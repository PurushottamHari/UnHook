  "content": "# Pakistan's State of War and Internal Crisis Explained\n\n## Introduction: A Nation at War with Itself\n\nPakistan is now officially in a \"state of war.\" This declaration comes not from a conflict with a traditional enemy state, but from a battle with an entity it helped create: the Taliban. Once considered a strategic asset, the Taliban's guns are now turned against Pakistan itself. The recent bombing in Islamabad's judicial complex—where lawyers, judges, and civilians were killed—raises a critical question: Is this a terrorist attack on Pakistani soil, or the beginning of a civil war that the state can no longer contain?\n\n## The Islamabad Bombing: A Declaration of War\n\nOn November 11, 2025, a suicide bomber detonated himself near the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad. The attack killed 12 people and injured dozens. In response, Pakistan's Foreign Minister declared that Pakistan is \"officially in a state of war.\" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif echoed this, stating, \"We are in a state of war,\" and directly blaming the Taliban for the suicide bombing.\n\nThis attack is not an isolated incident. Similar patterns have been observed in India, such as the Red Fort blast, which was linked to training camps in Pakistan. The message is clear: nations that support homegrown terrorism—whether in Afghanistan or India—eventually suffer the consequences. As the saying goes, \"If you try to light a fire, your own house will burn too.\"\n\n## The Historical Roots: Pakistan's Dance with Militancy\n\nTo understand how Pakistan reached this point, we must rewind 40 years. Pakistan's ideology and vision were flawed from the beginning, relying heavily on the military to govern every aspect of the state. This approach has now backfired, with the very fire they stoked turning against them.\n\n### The 1980s: The Launchpad for Mujahideen\nDuring the Soviet-Afghan War, Pakistan became the launchpad for the Mujahideen, with covert support from the USA and CIA. The ISI and CIA collaborated to train and fund these fighters, creating what amounted to \"fighters without uniforms.\" Pakistan believed it could act as a proxy for superpowers, using homegrown terrorism to influence neighboring countries.\n\n### The 1990s: The Rise of the Taliban\nThe same fighters evolved into the Taliban, nurtured by the Pakistani military for \"strategic depth.\" This concept allowed Pakistan to avoid direct military action while using radical groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Taliban to create instability in Afghanistan. This proxy warfare enabled Pakistan to deny responsibility on global platforms like the United Nations.\n\n## The Unraveling: From Ally to Adversary\n\nAfter 2001, Pakistan promised the USA it would fight terrorism while secretly sheltering the Taliban. Despite clear instructions to cease support for terrorist camps, Pakistan continued to grow homegrown terrorism. The discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad exposed this duplicity.\n\nIn 2021, the Taliban returned to power in Kabul. Pakistan's establishment quietly celebrated, believing it had gained influence in Afghanistan. However, this victory revived the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which now turns its guns inward, destabilizing Pakistan.\n\n### Timeline of Escalation\n- **2007:** Lal Masjid siege\n- **2014:** Peshawar Army Public School massacre\n- **2018-2023:** New wave of insurgency from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n- **2025:** Judicial complex bombing in Islamabad\n\n## Internal Fractures: The Four-Front War\n\nPakistan is already fighting a multi-front internal war:\n\n1. **Northern Border:** TTP insurgency in the northwest\n2. **Southern Province:** Balochistan liberation movement\n3. **Western Border:** Conflict with Afghanistan over the Durand Line\n4. **Eastern Border:** Regular skirmishes with India\n\n### The Economic War\nPakistan's economic situation is dire:\n- Foreign reserves below $9 billion\n- Inflation reaching 25-30%\n- Reliance on IMF bailouts and funding from USA and China\n- Terror financing through drug money\n\n### Ethnic and Cultural Wars\nIn Balochistan and Sindh provinces, local insurgencies accuse Islamabad of resource exploitation. The Baloch Liberation Army frequently targets Chinese engineers and military convoys, opposing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that seeks to extract minerals from the region.\n\n## The Kabul Connection: Regional Implications\n\nThe 2,640-kilometer Durand Line border with Afghanistan has never been recognized by Kabul. Recent tensions escalated when Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Afghanistan's Khost and Paktika provinces, targeting alleged TTP camps. The Taliban government called this \"an act of aggression,\" and the Islamabad bombing could be seen as retaliation.\n\n## Intelligence Failure or Political Crisis?\n\nThe Islamabad attack raises serious questions:\n- Was this an inside job?\n- Has Pakistan's intelligence apparatus (ISI) collapsed?\n- Is this a political case where the rule of law is disappearing?\n\nThe targeting of the judiciary—the institution that protects civil, political, and economic rights—was symbolic. An attack on the judiciary is an attack on the rule of law itself.\n\n## Global and Regional Stakes\n\n### India's Perspective\nIndia has maintained a clear stance: no support for terrorism, whether domestic or cross-border. However, instability in Pakistan creates cascading effects:\n- Increased proxy activity after the Taliban's rise\n- Higher security alerts and defense spending\n- Potential domino effect on regional stability\n\n### China's Concerns\nChina has invested $60 billion in CPEC but now faces threats to its investments. Beijing is privately pressuring Islamabad to establish peace and stability to ensure returns on investment.\n\n### United States' Disillusionment\nThe USA, which once treated Pakistan as a pawn in South Asia, recognizes the double standards exposed during the 9/11 attacks. While understanding Pakistan's nuclear power status, Washington cannot afford continued engagement with a state that supports terrorism.\n\n## Lessons and Warnings\n\nPakistan's downfall began when it allowed religion to overtake reason. Unlike India, where religion remains a private affair separate from state governance, Pakistan built state policy on ideology rather than evidence-based governance.\n\nThe clear message to Pakistan and other nations: \"When a nation breeds fire to fight its neighbor, it must remember—flames don't stop at borders.\"\n\n## Conclusion: A Ticking Time Bomb\n\nPakistan, as a state sitting on a ticking time bomb, is now witnessing the explosion. The internal civil war, political conflicts, and economic collapse suggest that the state of war is not external but internal. The machinery of state is collapsing, and the consequences will reverberate across South Asia and beyond.\n\nThe question remains: Can Pakistan contain the very forces it helped create, or is this the beginning of the end for a state built on flawed foundations?\n\n---\n\n*This analysis is based on recent developments and historical patterns. The situation remains fluid and subject to change.*",
