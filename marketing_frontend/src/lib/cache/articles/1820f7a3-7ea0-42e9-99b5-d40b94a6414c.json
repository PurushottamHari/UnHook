  "content": "# Devotion Matters More Than Perfect Posture in Meditation\n\n## The Myth of the Perfect Posture\n\nA common anxiety plagues many spiritual seekers: \"If I can't even sit up straight for five minutes due to my physical condition, how will I ever attain God?\" This question, born from a misunderstanding of spiritual practice, places undue importance on the external form.\n\nThe truth is, you will not find a single scripture where God declares, \"Attention! I will only appear to those who sit perfectly straight. If a person is sitting crookedly, I will never appear before them.\" Such a conditional God is a human invention, not the reality of the divine.\n\nIn fact, God's entire creation is \"crooked.\" The universe operates in curves and spirals. The Earth itself is round. Look at any mountain—nothing in nature is perfectly straight. The insistence on a rigid, straight-backed posture is a man-made constraint, not a divine mandate. The real requirement is not a straight spine, but a heart filled with *bhava*—sincere feeling and devotion.\n\n## Bhakti is Not a Cheap Hotel\n\nIt is crucial, however, to understand that this emphasis on internal feeling does not mean that the path of devotion (*bhakti*) is a lax or \"cheap\" path where anything goes. A powerful analogy illustrates this point.\n\nThere is a famous place in Delhi, the Kake-da-Hotel, which was originally a simple roadside eatery, a *dhaba*. A man went there to eat. After his meal, he went to wash his hands and began making the most terrible noises—coughing, sneezing, clearing his nose—performing his entire purification ritual with a complete lack of decorum. The people around him were disturbed and asked, \"Are you cleaning yourself with such rudeness here? Have you never eaten at a five-star hotel? Have you sat and dined at the Sheraton, the Hyatt, or the Marriott? Would they have allowed you to behave like that there?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"Whenever I *wanted* to do this there, everyone said, 'What is this, the Kake-da-Hotel?' That is precisely why I have come *here*.\"\n\nThe spiritual lesson is clear: **Bhakti is not the Kake-da-Hotel of spirituality.** You cannot just do anything you want. My point is not that yoga, meditation, mantra, and bhakti are like a fine five-star establishment where you must do nothing out of line. The point is that while the external form has flexibility, the internal state of *bhava* is non-negotiable.\n\n## The True Measure: The Experience of Bliss\n\nHow can you know if your practice is correct, if your *bhava* is sincere? The ancient texts provide a simple and profound measure.\n\nConsider the example of Yudhishthira from the Mahabharata. He would say, \"I experience bliss.\" Do you feel a sense of peace, happiness, or bliss when you pray? If you do, then somewhere, in some way, you are calling upon God correctly.\n\nWhen a person calls upon God without genuine feeling, their devotion becomes dry and joyless (*niras*). They do not experience the bliss of prayer; they are merely stuck in a mechanical count of repetitions. If you are experiencing bliss, if you have a sense of the divine presence (*sannidhya*), then you are on the right path. You *are* attaining God.\n\n## God-Realization is a Journey, Not a Destination\n\nA fundamental shift in perspective is needed. Do not make the mistake of thinking that God-realization is a single moment in time—a switch that flips from \"not attained\" to \"attained.\"\n\n**God-realization is the name of a journey.** It is a continuous, ongoing process. It is not a static state of being but a dynamic river of becoming.\n\nJust as Mother Ganga manifested at Gangotri and flows as an unbroken, continuous stream towards the ocean, so too is God-realization. It happens continuously. The day a person truly grasps, holds, and understands this—that God-realization is not an event that happens \"today\" after which one can levitate and fly away wherever one wishes—is the day they shed a great ignorance.\n\nThis is not a journey with a finite end. It brings to mind the story of Narada Muni and the mind-born sons of Brahma. They were sent to find the \"end\" of the divine before they could consider marriage. The search for an end to the infinite is itself the illusion. God-realization is a continuous, eternal process that happens to a human being because the moment that \"attainment\" stops, the next breath would not even emerge. The final, great dissolution (*mahanirvana*) is the ultimate realization, but until then, it is a constant, flowing engagement.\n\n## Practical Guidance for the Sincere Seeker\n\nWith this understanding, one should never be anxious about physical limitations.\n\nYou should never worry about how many hours you can sit, whether you can sit on the floor, or if you must use a chair. **As long as your mind is functioning and you have the capacity to chant, to pray to God, then He will continue to come to you.**\n\nConsider the example of Shabari. Do you think she sat in a perfect, firm *asana*? Absolutely not. Not even a little. But she possessed two things in abundance:\n1.  **Patience (*Dhairya*)**\n2.  **Feeling (*Bhava*)**\n\nShe waited with patience and she chanted with feeling. Through this persistent practice (*abhyas*), detachment (*vairagya*) also arises. Without both patience and feeling, realization is not possible.\n\nOne must persist with patience. There will be many days when the mind does not engage in devotion. On those days, I am not saying you should force it violently. Do a little less. But on the days when the mind *does* engage, do a little more. Because the taste (*swad*) will have started to come. Follow the rhythm of your own heart's sincerity, not the rigid tyranny of a perfect posture. Your devotion, not your posture, is the true vehicle to the divine.",
