  "content": "# How to Stop Being a Social 'Goober' and Gain Respect\n\nA few years ago, I was wrapping up treatment with a patient when I asked the standard closing question: “Is there anything else you want to work on?”\n\nTheir response stopped me cold: “Hey, Dr. K, can you help me stop being a goober?”\n\nI had to ask. “What does that mean? What do you mean by a goober?”\n\nThey explained a painfully common social dilemma. “Look, I have this problem where I struggle in social situations. I have friends, but I’m not super important to them. I’m the kind of person who gets invited to a party or a weekend trip, but if I don’t go, it’s not that big of a deal to them. I have friends, but they don’t seem to care about me very much. I don’t feel central to their lives. I think about them a lot. I initiate with them a lot, but they don’t think about me quite as much. And sometimes when I’m in a group, I sort of feel like a goober. I feel like I don’t really belong. I feel a little bit awkward, and I don’t know what to do about it.”\n\nWe dug deeper. When did this become a problem? The answer was a story of profound social rejection.\n\nAbout a month prior, they had thrown a birthday party for themselves. They told all their friends, “Hey, I’m going to put together this party. It’s going to be great. I’m going to cook.” And they meant it. They cooked for three days. They brined chicken 24 hours in advance. They made dessert. They crafted their own dips. It was an elaborate, heartfelt labor of love.\n\nTheir friends were enthusiastic. “Yeah, we’re absolutely coming, man. It’s going to be great. It’s going to be awesome.”\n\nThen, no one showed up.\n\nThis devastating moment crystallized their “goober” status. As we explored their behavior patterns, a clear theme emerged: **clinging**.\n\nAnytime they wanted to be included, they would try extra hard to be “worth” inviting. If a weekend trip was planned, they’d volunteer to handle logistics or bring supplies—subconsciously increasing their perceived value to the group. The driving force was a quiet, persistent paranoia about being ejected. They felt perpetually on the periphery, and so they engaged in a series of “bribing” behaviors to stay in the group’s good graces.\n\nThis realization was fascinating. My first instinct as a psychiatrist was to diagnose. *Do you have social anxiety? Are you on the spectrum?* But “being a goober” is not a pathology in the DSM. It doesn’t need medication. It is a part of oneself—a tangled knot of self-esteem, social connection, and social skills that can actually be improved. Working on issues like this is what ultimately led me into coaching. So many people struggle with real, life-hindering problems that exist just outside the realm of traditional pathology.\n\nTogether, we figured out how to solve it.\n\n## The Core Problem: Clinging vs. Climbing\n\nThe basic issue is that people on the edges of social groups engage in specific behaviors to avoid being ejected. I call these **clinging behaviors**.\n\n**What does clinging look like?**\n*   **Self-deprecating humor:** You make yourself the butt of the joke so others laugh *at* you, ensuring you appear non-threatening.\n*   **Downplaying expertise:** You hide your skills or knowledge so you don’t outshine the “central” people in the group.\n*   **Over-investing in transactions:** You try to “buy” your place through favors, elaborate gifts, or always being the planner.\n\nThe goal of clinging is simple: *Don’t kick me out.* The problem is, a strategy designed to keep you in one spot will also keep you stuck in that spot. Your respect in a group will never increase as long as your primary goal is to not get ejected. Clinging is the opposite of **climbing**.\n\nTo move from the periphery to a place of respect, you need to understand the social science of how groups actually work.\n\n## The Macro Strategy: The Science of Social Centrality\n\nThere’s compelling research on this—not from psychiatry, but from social network theory. A key concept is **eigenvector centrality** (yes, I love that word). In simple terms, it measures your influence in a network based on how well you’re connected to other well-connected people.\n\nIn any friend group, there are central nodes and peripheral nodes. The central person is the one where, if they don’t show up, the party feels like a dud. When they throw a party, everyone wants to be there.\n\nHow do you become more central? You must strategically build your network. Clinging to your existing spot won't work. Here are the three macro principles:\n\n### 1. Form Weak Connections (Lots of Them)\nOften, people who feel peripheral make the mistake of over-investing in getting a *specific* group to like them more. This is barking up the wrong tree. The first step is actually to go *outside* your core group and form many **weak connections**—friendly acquaintanceships with people in other circles.\n\nYou might think, “But weak connections are my problem! I already have peripheral friends who don’t respect me.” The purpose here isn’t immediate depth. It’s to build a broader social web, which boosts your own sense of self-esteem and creates future opportunities. It’s the foundation.\n\n### 2. Convert Weak Ties to Strong Ties Through Repeated Interaction\nWeak connections become strong through repetition. This is also powerful *within* your existing group. Instead of only interacting in the large group where hierarchies are rigid, seek out the other “peripheral” people one-on-one or in small groups of two or three. Strengthening these bonds creates a coalition and increases your overall social capital within the larger network.\n\n### 3. Master “Betweenness” – Become the Connector\nThis is the most powerful lever. Your social respect skyrockets when you become the **connection point between other people or groups**.\n\nThink about networking. Most people network selfishly: “How can this person help *me*?” The most effective networking is selfless: “How can I connect two people who would benefit from knowing each other?” Every time you make a meaningful introduction, you elevate your status. You’re not asking for anything; you’re providing value. You become the glue.\n\nThis explains the “cool new kid” phenomenon. Sometimes a new student is ostracized. Other times, they instantly become central. Why? Novelty is a factor, but a major reason is that they become a bridge between their old world and this new one. They sit between two networks, and that “betweenness” grants instant social capital.\n\n**Practical Macro Takeaway:** Don’t throw a desperate, over-the-top party for people who might not come. Instead, host a small event and invite one person from Group A and one person from Group B. You are now the node that connects two distinct parts of the social universe. This is the essence of building respect.\n\n## The Micro Strategy: Changing Your Behavior in the Moment\n\nMacro positioning is useless if your minute-to-minute behavior undermines it. This is where we return to **clinging vs. climbing**. Peripheral people often engage in “non-respect-gaining” behaviors rooted in fear.\n\n**Two critical micro-behaviors to change *today*:**\n\n### 1. Stop the Self-Deprecating Humor. Full Stop.\nMaking yourself small to make others feel safe is a clinging behavior. It signals, “I know my place is beneath you.” It might get a laugh, but it cements your peripheral status. Respect is not given to people who don’t respect themselves.\n\n### 2. If You’re Good at Something, Show It.\nDo you have expertise, a skill, or knowledge relevant to the group? Share it. Demonstrate it. The clinging fear is: “If I show I’m better, the central person will feel threatened and eject me.”\n\nHere’s the paradigm shift: **If people feel threatened by your competence, that is *their* problem.** More importantly, a 2024 study on self-efficacy confirms that the way you feel about yourself dictates how others respond to you. If you act small, people will treat you as small. As you demonstrate belief in your own abilities, the respect from those around you naturally increases.\n\nThis is why the sequence is crucial. When you start demonstrating expertise, your self-belief grows. As your self-belief grows, you carry yourself differently. And if you’ve also been building those external weak ties and acting as a connector (the macro work), you have a safety net. You’re not clinging to one group for survival. Your social worth is distributed, making you less afraid of ejection from any single circle.\n\n## The Path Out of Gooberhood\n\nThe journey from feeling like a social goober to being respected isn’t about becoming someone else. It’s about shifting your strategy from defensive clinging to strategic climbing.\n\n1.  **Look outward.** Build a wide net of weak connections.\n2.  **Look for bridges.** Become the person who connects others.\n3.  **Look inward.** Stop belittling yourself and start owning your strengths.\n\nThe central people in your group aren’t magical. They, often unconsciously, follow these rules. They have broad connections, they are hubs of information and introductions, and they don’t apologize for their competencies.\n\nYou don’t have to be the loudest or the most charismatic. You have to be strategic, brave, and willing to provide value without immediately demanding it in return. Stop trying so hard to be included, and start becoming someone who is hard to exclude.\n\nThat is how you optimize your eigenvector centrality. That is how you stop being a goober.",
