  "content": "**India's Taliban Engagement: Strategic Move or Compromise?**\n\n---\n\n### **A Weekend of Diplomatic Whiplash**\n\nOver the past few days, India’s evolving relationship with the Taliban has sparked intense debate across the political and media landscape. The sudden shift in posture—from long-standing condemnation to cautious engagement—has left many observers questioning the motives, morality, and strategic necessity behind the move.\n\nOn one hand, a pragmatic argument is gaining traction: *the enemy of my enemy is my friend*. If engaging the Taliban helps counter Pakistan’s influence, then perhaps it’s a price worth paying. On the other hand, critics argue that shaking hands with a regime known for fundamentalism, regression, and deep terror links tarnishes India’s image as a nation that has long positioned itself at the forefront of the “war on terror.”\n\nHow does a country that once thundered against terrorism now openly court a group it once labeled terrorists?\n\n---\n\n### **The Trigger: A Flurry of Developments**\n\nThe catalyst for this debate was the official visit of Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India on October 9. The visit itself was notable—Muttaqi remains under UN sanctions and a travel ban, which India helped temporarily lift to facilitate the dialogue.\n\nDuring the visit, Muttaqi met with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. India announced humanitarian aid for the Afghan people and discussed reopening its embassy in Kabul. While humanitarian measures are widely supported, the optics of openly engaging a sanctioned Taliban leader raised eyebrows.\n\nJust days later, tensions between the Taliban-led Afghanistan and Pakistan escalated dramatically. On October 12, heavy border clashes erupted, with Taliban forces launching retaliatory strikes on Pakistani border posts. Reports suggested over 50 Pakistani soldiers were killed, and several posts were captured. The Taliban claimed the action was in response to alleged Pakistani airstrikes on Afghan territory.\n\nPakistan has long accused the Taliban of providing safe haven to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)—a group seeking to impose Sharia law in Pakistan. The irony isn’t lost on observers: Pakistan, often accused by India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism, is now facing the same blowback.\n\n---\n\n### **The Moral Dilemma: From “Good Taliban, Bad Taliban” to Red-Carpet Treatment**\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi himself once famously stated:\n\n> *“Good Taliban, bad Taliban… Good terrorism, bad terrorism—this will not work anymore. You have to decide: are you with terrorism or with humanity?”*\n\nThat clear, principled stance now stands in stark contrast to the warm reception Muttaqi received. The same government that once warned against distinguishing between “good and bad terrorists” is now being accused of rolling out the red carpet for them.\n\nMuttaqi is no ordinary diplomat. He was the Taliban’s spokesperson in 1999, when Indian Airlines Flight IC814 was hijacked and taken to Kandahar. India was forced to release terrorists like Masood Azhar—who later wreaked havoc on Indian soil. It was a joint Taliban-Pakistan operation that left India humiliated. Muttaqi was later placed on the UN Security Council’s terror list.\n\nHis conduct during the India visit did little to suggest reform. First, female journalists were barred from his press conference. Then, the event was staged in front of a backdrop showing the destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas—the ancient statues dynamited by the Taliban in 2001, an act widely condemned as cultural genocide.\n\n> “It’s like Osama bin Laden saying he’s changed, while using 9/11 imagery as his backdrop.”\n\nThe move was widely seen as a political message: *We haven’t changed. We’re still the same Taliban.*\n\n---\n\n### **The Domestic Reaction: Outrage, Justification, and Hypocrisy**\n\nThe exclusion of women journalists sparked outrage. Many argued that male journalists should have walked out in solidarity. Instead, some government-aligned voices defended the Taliban’s actions, arguing that “Afghan rules apply on Afghan soil.”\n\nCritics called this logic flawed and hypocritical. If Afghan rules truly applied, then male journalists without beards should also have been barred—since the Taliban often punish men for not growing beards, deeming it un-Islamic.\n\nFemale journalists, however, refused to stay silent. In a second press conference, they took front-row seats and confronted Muttaqi with sharp questions:\n\n> *“Why have you banned education for women and girls? In Iran, Syria, even Saudi Arabia—women are not stopped from going to schools and colleges. Why are you doing this in Afghanistan? When will they be allowed to go back and claim their right to education?”*\n\nMuttaqi’s response was evasive: *“There is no ban… discussions are ongoing.”* But the reality is clear: Afghanistan under the Taliban is perhaps the only country where girls are systematically denied basic human rights—from schools and parks to mosques and markets.\n\n---\n\n### **The Strategic Rationale: Why Engage Now?**\n\nBehind the moral unease lies a hard-nosed geopolitical calculus.\n\n#### **1. Countering Pakistan**\nWith the U.S. pivoting away from South Asia and China firmly in Pakistan’s corner, India’s options to contain Islamabad’s influence are shrinking. The Taliban’s recognition of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India—and recent border clashes with Pakistan—have made the group an unexpected, if uncomfortable, ally.\n\nAs one supporter argued:  \n*“Pakistan’s enemy is India’s friend. We are supporting our national interest.”*\n\n#### **2. Protecting Investments & Tapping Resources**\nBetween 2001 and 2022, India invested over $3 billion in Afghan infrastructure—schools, hospitals, roads, dams, and even the parliament building. These projects stalled after the Taliban’s return. Normalizing ties could help safeguard those investments.\n\nAfghanistan also holds vast mineral reserves—copper, lithium, iron ore—that remain untapped. The Taliban wants Indian investment to avoid falling into China’s economic orbit.\n\n#### **3. Regional Power Balance**\nIndia seeks to maintain a visible economic and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan to prevent Pakistan and China from dominating the region. Through trade and soft power, India aims to position itself as a stabilizing force.\n\n---\n\n### **The Cost: Compromise on Terror & Global Standing**\n\nEngaging the Taliban comes at a price—especially to India’s credibility on terrorism.\n\nTo host Muttaqi, India had to seek a special sanctions waiver from the UN. Yet, throughout the visit, India did not publicly raise past atrocities—the IC814 hijacking, the 2008 embassy bombing, or the murder of journalist Danish Siddiqui.\n\n> “On one hand, when India faces a terror attack, we demand global support. On the other, we’re negotiating with UN-designated terrorists. Who will take our anti-terror narrative seriously now?”\n\nThe government describes this outreach as “pragmatic diplomacy.” But India is not just a transactional power—it has long claimed the moral high ground as a responsible global actor. Honoring the Taliban with state-level treatment undermines that identity.\n\nWorse still, the Taliban’s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada—based in Kandahar—is the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for crimes against humanity, particularly the persecution of women and girls. Will Modi shake his hand too?\n\n---\n\n### **The Political Fallout: Hypocrisy or Realpolitik?**\n\nThe engagement has not gone unnoticed domestically. Opposition leaders have seized on the contradiction.\n\nKarnataka Chief Minister’s son, Yathindra Siddaramaiah, compared the RSS to the Taliban, calling them “same mindset.” Mehbooba Mufti accused the BJP of hypocrisy:\n\n> *“The same government that talks of love jihad, land jihad, cow jihad… is now embracing the real jihadis of the Taliban.”*\n\nEven some Muslim leaders have questioned the red-carpet welcome for a group that embodies the very extremism the government claims to oppose.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: A Necessary Evil or a Strategic Blunder?**\n\nIn the end, India’s Taliban engagement reflects a painful reality: the country’s diplomatic isolation is growing. With traditional allies like the U.S. drifting and Pakistan strengthening its ties with Middle Eastern powers, India has been forced to turn to the Taliban to counter Islamabad.\n\nBut this is not a cost-free strategy. Every handshake with the Taliban dilutes India’s moral authority on terrorism. It signals to the world that when cornered, even principles can be negotiable.\n\nAs one critic put it:  \n*“If you befriend a fascist, you become a fascist. If you befriend the Taliban, you become a Taliban.”*\n\nIndia may have gained a tactical advantage, but it has lost something far more precious in the process: its standing as a nation that once drew a clear line between terrorism and humanity.\n\n---\n\n*This analysis is based on recent developments and public statements.
