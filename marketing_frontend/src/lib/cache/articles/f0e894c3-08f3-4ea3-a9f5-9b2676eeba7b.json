The answer lies in a core principle of CIA tradecraft: **human behavior is remarkably consistent and predictable.**\n\nThe guest, a former CIA operative, explains that whether someone is in India or the United States, highly educated or not, the biological and chemical workings of the human brain are almost identical globally. This consistency forms the basis of understanding and predicting behavior.\n\n> \"You only have to worry if you think about mathematics... all things land on a bell curve... the remaining 80% is inside that bell curve. That means 80% of the global population, their brain works almost the exact same way.\"\n\nThis \"80% rule\" is pivotal. While media, art, and culture often emphasize our differences to make us feel unique, intelligence agencies focus on the vast common ground. When you understand how this 80% thinks—how it processes threats, opportunities, negative thoughts, and future projections—you can \"predict, anticipate, manipulate, and direct human behavior.\"\n\nThe host illustrates this by pointing out the immediate, superficial differences between himself and his guest—clothing, studio setup, background—while highlighting the massive similarities they instinctively overlook: both are men with facial hair, both are or have been married, both have partners deeply involved in their personal environments.\n\n## The Research Pipeline: How Intelligence Agencies Access Human Science\n\nHow does an organization like the CIA conduct this research? Contrary to popular belief, they don't necessarily have vast, secret private labs. Instead, they leverage a strategic advantage within national funding structures.\n\nMajor research institutions like UCLA or the University of Mumbai are often federally funded. This funding creates a pipeline: breakthroughs in psychology, cognitive science, and brain research are seen first by the government agencies that helped pay for them. Intelligence organizations like the CIA, India's RAW, or Israel's Mossad get \"first dibs\" on new findings, sometimes even before they are published publicly.\n\n> \"What CIA and Mossad and RAW and the best agencies in the world... get a chance to do is have first dibs at new psychological results, new cognitive findings, new brain science, new medical research.\"\n\nThe extent of this research is dictated by perceived threat. The guest uses the example of remote viewing—a fringe, psychic espionage technique. The U.S. invested in it not because they believed in it, but because they knew the Soviet Union was experimenting with it. The threat of an enemy gaining any potential advantage justified bending ethical rules and even laws, as seen in operations like MK-ULTRA or Operation Midnight Climax, where citizens were tested on without consent.\n\n> \"We tested medical and narcotic drugs on American citizens without advising them that we were doing so... We broke our own laws because we had to keep up with the pace of development from our enemies.\"\n\nThe driving principle is simple: organizations will research something as far as they believe it threatens their existence. When the Soviet Union fell, the impetus for remote viewing research faded, but the knowledge remained in the arsenal.\n\n## The Malleability of Humans: Conformity, Authority, and Survival\n\nThe discussion turns to classic psychological experiments that reveal the depths of human malleability: Solomon Asch's conformity tests, Stanley Milgram's obedience studies, and Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment.\n\nThe guest reframes these not as simple stories of weakness, but as tests of different, powerful behavioral levers:\n\n1.  **Asch's Conformity (Social Pressure/Survival):** This isn't about peer pressure in the bullying sense. It's about a survival calculation. The subject hears several people give an obviously wrong answer. Their brain reasons: *If I contradict the group, I mark myself as different, a potential threat. I have infinite time to be right later, but right now, conforming guarantees my social survival.*\n2.  **Milgram's Obedience (Assigned Authority):** This leverages a specific type of authority. When a figure is *assigned* as the authority (the scientist in the lab coat), it creates a psychological transfer of responsibility. The subject shocks the \"victim\" because the authority figure says to, absolving themselves of moral burden in the moment. The guilt only crashes in afterward, when the authority figure leaves the room.\n3.  **Zimbardo's Prison Experiment (Environmental Roles):** This shows how quickly people adapt their behavior to fit a prescribed role within a constructed environment.\n\nThe operative's conclusion is stark: **\"If you can create the environment, you can get someone to do anything you want them to do.\"** For an intelligence officer, the question becomes: Which lever do I pull for this person? Do I create an authority figure, engineer social pressure, or manufacture a survival scenario?\n\n## The Playbook and the Algorithm: Influence at Scale\n\nThis manipulation isn't just for high-stakes espionage. It operates on a mass scale every day, especially in the digital age.\n\nThere is a universal \"playbook\" that works for the predictable 80%. Whether you're trying to get a 15-year-old to do homework or a 55-year-old to buy gold, the core principles of conformity, authority, and survival apply. The difference is in the tuning for efficiency—how quickly you want the action to happen.\n\nThis is where technology, specifically social media algorithms, becomes a force multiplier. Algorithms are mirrors that reflect our behavior back to us, creating a loop of familiarity and trust.\n\n> \"An algorithm is really a computer code that you can create that will work the same way for millions of people... The algorithm was created to follow their behaviors and then to modify the content in order to maximize the viewership and the retention.\"\n\nThe host shares a personal story: after a fight with his then-girlfriend, his Instagram feed filled with content about \"toxic women,\" while hers filled with content about \"wrong men.\" The algorithm, designed to maximize engagement, inadvertently poured fuel on their emotional fire. This is a benign example of a powerful system.\n\nThe guest uses a fishing analogy:\n*   **Past:** We could cast many hooks, but all with the same bait.\n*   **Present (with basic targeting):** We can customize the bait for different fish.\n*   **Future (with AI):** We will have 10,000 automated fishermen who can not only choose the perfect bait but also expertly \"play\" the fish—reeling it in, letting it run, tiring it out—before finally landing it. The goal is not to benefit the fish, but to \"fillet it, to eat it, to sell it.\"\n\n## Conditioning Society: The Long Game from Childhood\n\nIs there an active effort to keep populations sedated or manageable? The guest's answer is nuanced. The control isn't applied to adults in the moment; it's conditioned into them from childhood.\n\n> \"We were shaped when we were children so that by the time we're this age... we've been conditioned already for how to accept information we don't like.\"\n\nHe traces the lifelong cycle: school teaches you to follow rules for grades and approval. University continues the pattern for scholarships and status. Careers demand conformity for promotions and job security. This creates a \"predictable social base\" by the time people are old enough to demand change.\n\nProtest movements often fizzle out because participants have been conditioned their whole lives to believe that \"breaking the social norm for too long\" means forfeiting future rewards. Those who persist are labeled \"crazy,\" \"unrealistic,\" or \"irrational.\" The system is self-reinforcing and scalable, echoing through generations, which is how political leaders and corporations maintain lasting power and brand loyalty.\n\n## The Emotional Levers: Fear, Anger, and Sadness\n\nIf you want to program or influence someone, what is the most effective access point? The guest identifies three core emotions more powerful than love or happiness: **fear, anger, and sadness.**\n\nWhile everyone experiences all three, individuals tend to have a dominant channel. Effective influence tailors the message to that channel. He uses the example of advocating for maternity leave:\n\n*   **For the anger-prone woman:** \"Take action now! This injustice has gone on too long. Fight for our future daughters!\"\n*   **For the sadness-prone woman:** \"This burden was carried by your mother and her mother. Let's end the cycle of sadness for our daughters.\"\n*   **For the fear-prone woman:** \"If we don't act now, they will take more rights away. We must stand up for ourselves today!\"\n\nThe same desired action (voting for the policy) is achieved by pressing three different \"piano keys.\" On an individual level, an operative figures out which key—fear, anger, or sadness—produces the most reliable, reproducible behavior in their target.\n\n## What Drives Us? The Confusion of Needs and Wants\n\nThe conversation delves into human motivation, moving beyond Maslow's hierarchy of *needs*. The guest argues that what truly drives people is their hierarchy of *desires*, and we chronically confuse the two.\n\n> \"We as human beings, we use the word *need* when we're actually talking about the things that we *desire*. I need to get married. I need to have kids. I need to make money... No, you don't *need* any of those things. But you *want* those things.\"\n\nWe say \"I need a new car\" when we want luxury features. We say \"I want to relax\" when we actually *need* respite from stress. This internal confusion makes us ripe for manipulation. When an advertisement says, \"You *deserve* a new car,\" it echoes the story already in our head (\"I need a new car\"), creating instant, false familiarity and trust.\n\nThis self-deception is widespread. Ask someone what they want from life, and they'll offer buzzwords: \"travel, happiness, freedom.\" Push them to define those terms, and they falter, pulling definitions from movies, friends, or social media. They are often lying to themselves first.\n\n## The Roots of Dishonesty: Survival and the Scarcity Mindset\n\nWhy are people, by and large, dishonest? The guest roots it in a fundamental evolutionary mismatch: **Our biological evolution has not kept pace with our social and technological evolution.**\n\nBiologically, we are still cavemen with a scarcity mindset. In a world of limited fruit on trees, hoarding and deceit were survival strategies—you didn't want others knowing where your resources were. Today, in a world of relative abundance, we are still wired the same way.\n\n> \"Rich people aren't rich because they're greedy. They're rich because they want more and they know how to get more and they never know when it's going to run out... Almost like squirrels saving for the winter.\"\n\nLying is inherent to this survival instinct. We lie about small things to preserve status, ego, or a desired self-concept—all extensions of the survival drive in a social context. The \"more\" we chase—more status, more power, more freedom—is a psychological mirage, always receding into the distance. For public figures, this chase can morph into a perceived moral obligation, burdening them with the responsibility of being a \"symbol\" or \"voice for millions,\" divorcing them from their own humanity.\n\n## Influence vs. Persuasion: The Four C's of Building Trust\n\nA crucial distinction is made between **persuasion** (happening in real-time, face-to-face) and **influence** (happening when you are *not* present). Influence is more powerful and lasting. The key to influence is **trust**.\n\nThe guest outlines the CIA-taught framework for building influence, called **The Four C's**:\n\n1.  **Consideration:** View the world through the other person's eyes. Deduce their daily routines, pressures, desires, and fears.\n2.  **Collaboration:** Actively help them get more of what they want, based on your consideration. This turns you into a trusted collaborator.\n3.  **Consistency:** Be reliably collaborative. Inconsistent behavior destroys trust; predictable behavior builds it.\n4.  **Control:** This is the final, often missed step. Leverage the trust built from the first three C's to *ask for what you want*. Influence is useless if you never wield it.\n\nThe difference between a happy and unhappy influential person is often this last step. Many people do the work of consideration, collaboration, and consistency but then wait passively for a reward, never taking control.\n\n## Charm, Validation, and the Path of Least Resistance\n\nWhat is charm or charisma? The operative defines it simply as **validation**.\n\n> \"All charisma or charm really is is being able to validate the other person... People like you because of how you're similar to them.\"\n\nYou don't have to agree with someone to validate them. You just have to reflect their own feelings or experiences back to them, making them feel seen and understood. In the digital age, algorithms supercharge this. Validate a middle-aged man's feeling of being overlooked, and the algorithm will show your content to a million men who feel the same, building a perception of widespread charisma.\n\nThis leads to a key insight about persuasion: **Never try to persuade someone against a deeply held belief.** The risk of failure is too high. The professional method is to find people who already believe 90% of what you want and give them the final push. It's easier to push someone already at the cliff's edge than to drag someone across a field to it. Modern influence operations work this way—funding and inflaming both sides of an existing debate to create division and doubt, rather than trying to convert anyone.\n\n## Reading People: Assessment Over Assumption\n\nFinally, how do professionals \"read\" people? They use **assessment**, not assumption.\n\nAssessment is a continuous, temporary theory about a person based on observable data points: verbal cues (word choice, pace, complexity of language) and non-verbal cues (posture, gestures, eye movement). You build a \"baseline\" of their normal behavior and then look for deviations, which can indicate stress or deceit.\n\nThe host notes how he instinctively leaned back in his chair when a concept fully \"clicked,\" revealing a moment of cognitive processing. These subtle cues are gold to a trained observer.\n\nFiguring out deceit isn't about spotting a single \"tell\" like touching the nose. It's a slower process of baseline analysis, strategic questioning, and observing clusters of deviations from normal behavior. Micro-expressions have value in controlled settings but are less reliable in everyday, dynamic environments.\n\nThe conversation closes on a personal note, with an invitation extended and accepted, proving a final point about influence: sometimes, stating what you want to the universe is the first step to getting it.",
