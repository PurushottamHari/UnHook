  "content": "# Pakistan Outspent India on Trump Lobbying, Report Shows\n\nIn the landscape of Donald Trump’s presidency, many unusual events unfolded—from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to the Venezuela crisis—but one of the most striking was the dramatic strengthening of U.S.-Pakistan relations. A recent New York Times report has highlighted how Pakistan invested heavily in lobbying efforts to win over Trump, effectively flipping U.S. foreign policy in its favor.\n\n---\n\n## A Foreign Policy Flip\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, financial aid to Pakistan was significantly cut, dealing a major blow to the country. Under President Biden, the situation grew even more distant. Biden did not call the Pakistani Prime Minister for over two years, a point publicly noted by Pakistan’s National Security Advisor Moeed Yusuf. The lack of engagement drew considerable attention in Pakistan, fueling political debates about whether the U.S. had abandoned the relationship entirely.\n\nBut under Trump’s renewed influence, the dynamic has shifted completely. Now, U.S. presidents regularly speak with Pakistani leaders like Shehbaz Sharif and Asim Munir, who have been invited to the White House multiple times. Pakistani propaganda has also gained traction, with claims of downing fighter jets and public praise for Trump, who has referred to Asim Munir as his “favorite field marshal.”\n\nThis reversal—from isolation under Biden to influence under Trump—has been described as nothing short of a “foreign policy coup.”\n\n---\n\n## The Lobbying Game\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Pakistan signed a series of high-priced contracts with prominent Washington lobbying firms just weeks before the White House announced favorable new policies for the country. These policies included some of the world’s most lenient tariff rates.\n\nLobbying in the U.S. is legal and operates openly. Countries hire lobbying firms to advocate for their interests—whether it’s reducing tariffs or gaining political support. These firms then distribute funds to senators and members of Congress, who in turn influence policy decisions.\n\nIn just a few months, the Pakistani government spent **$5 million on lobbying**—three times more than India, which spent approximately $1.7 million during the same period.\n\n---\n\n## Desperation or Strategy?\n\nFor a country facing severe financial strain, this level of spending represents a major gamble. Pakistan’s leadership appears to have concluded that without Trump’s support, the country would face even greater challenges. As one analyst noted, “When a country is desperate, it takes big steps.”\n\nBut the strategy may also be more targeted. Reports indicate that Pakistan’s government has stakes in companies like World Liberty Financial (WLF), with which the Trump family recently amassed an additional $5 billion in wealth. Though Trump has denied direct involvement, the timing and nature of these financial arrangements raise questions.\n\nPakistan also engaged in a cryptocurrency deal—another area of interest for Trump—suggesting a carefully tailored approach to winning his favor.\n\n---\n\n## The Indian Response\n\nIndia, by contrast, faces a structural disadvantage. Lobbying is illegal in India, and any politician caught accepting foreign funds for advocacy would face immediate legal action. While India has recently hired its second lobbying firm in the U.S., it cannot match the direct financial incentives Pakistan is offering to the Trump family.\n\nAs one observer noted, “India won’t go down that road.” Instead, New Delhi may focus on reminding Trump of his significant business interests in India—such as the Trump Tower projects—which already generate substantial revenue for his family.\n\n---\n\n## The Big Question: Will It Pay Off?\n\nThe central uncertainty is whether Pakistan’s massive lobbying investment will yield tangible benefits. Will the country see a genuine increase in exports? Will it gain long-term strategic advantages? Or will Trump’s support prove short-lived, leaving Pakistan with little to show for its financial outlay?\n\nWith Trump potentially in office for only a few more years, the long-term impact of this lobbying push remains unclear. What is certain is that Pakistan has placed a high-stakes bet on one of the most unconventional presidencies in modern history.\n\n---\n\n*This article is based on a video analysis by Prashant Dhawan for Career 247.
