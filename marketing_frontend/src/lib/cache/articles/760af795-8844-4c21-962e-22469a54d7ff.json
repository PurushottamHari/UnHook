  "content": "# AirPods Pro 3 Review: Major Upgrades in Fit and ANC\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt’s September again—the busiest time of the year for tech reviewers. I wasn’t planning on reviewing the new AirPods Pro 3. But just like last time, Apple sent them over, and curiosity got the better of me. The first thing I did? I hopped on a plane.\n\nNow, after testing them in the air and on the ground, I’m convinced: these aren’t just another incremental update. The AirPods Pro 3 bring meaningful improvements that might just make them the best true wireless earbuds on the market—especially if you’re an iPhone user.\n\n---\n\n## Design & Fit: Subtle Changes, Major Impact\n\nAt first glance, the AirPods Pro 3 look nearly identical to their predecessor, the AirPods Pro 2. But look closer, and you’ll notice a host of small yet significant changes.\n\n### The New Angle & Ear Tips\n\nThe most immediately noticeable upgrade is the fit. The earbuds now sit at a slightly different angle in your ear, and the ear tips themselves have been redesigned. They still use silicone, but now include a small amount of foam inside the tip. This hybrid design gives you the best of both worlds:\n\n- The comfort and ease of silicone\n- The moldable, secure seal of foam tips\n\nYou gently compress them before inserting, and they expand to fit your ear canal perfectly. The result? A fit that’s both comfortable and incredibly stable.\n\nFor the first time ever, a pair of AirPods actually stays in my ears. Previous generations always wiggled loose over time—but not these. That alone is a game-changer.\n\n### More Sizes, Better Seal\n\nApple now includes five ear tip sizes, including a new double extra-small option. Whether you have unusually small or large ears, there’s likely a tip that will fit you perfectly.\n\n---\n\n## Sound Quality: Clear, Punchy, and Loud\n\nThe AirPods Pro already had a reputation for great sound, but the Pro 3 takes it up a notch.\n\n### Improved Bass and Clarity\n\nI did some back-to-back listening with the previous generation, and the difference is noticeable. There’s more punch in the low end, without sacrificing the full mid-range or crisp highs. They also get louder with less distortion at high volumes.\n\nTwo hardware changes help explain the improvement:\n\n- **Larger Vents**: Better airflow for richer bass response\n- **Redesigned Interior**: Optimized for acoustic performance\n\nWhether you’re listening to music, podcasts, or movies, these earbuds deliver a balanced, immersive experience.\n\n---\n\n## Active Noise Cancellation: “World’s Best”—Really?\n\nApple made a bold claim during their keynote: these have the “world’s best active noise cancellation” of any in-ear wireless headphones. No asterisks, no fine print.\n\nAnd you know what? They might be right.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe Pro 3 uses the same H2 chip as the previous model, so the improvement isn’t coming from raw processing power. Instead, it’s the combination of:\n\n- New ear tips with foam\n- Revised insertion angle\n- Larger vents\n- Software tuning\n\nApple says these cancel twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2—which were already excellent.\n\n### Real-World Testing\n\nIn a typical office environment, with background chatter, keyboard clacks, and the occasional dog bark, the ANC was impressive. But where it really shined was on a flight. The constant white noise of the airplane cabin was almost completely erased. Not totally silent—but close enough that I could fully immerse myself in whatever I was watching or listening to.\n\nI compared them side-by-side with other top-tier earbuds:\n\n- **Bose QC Ultra 2**: Less comfortable, weaker seal, inferior ANC\n- **Sony WF-1000XM5**: Great sound, but fit and noise cancellation aren’t as strong\n- **Galaxy Buds 3 Pro**: Very comfortable and stylish, but don’t sound as good or cancel as much noise\n\nThe AirPods Pro 3 came out on top in nearly every category.\n\n---\n\n## Battery Life & Durability\n\n### Longer Listening\n\nBattery life has been improved across the board:\n\n- **With ANC**: 8 hours (up from 6)\n- **Transparency Mode**: 10 hours (up from 6)\n\nThat means you can ignore your coworkers for an entire workday—or enjoy a long flight without needing to recharge.\n\n### IP57 Rating\n\nBoth the earbuds and the case are now IP57 rated, meaning they’re protected against dust and can be submerged in water. That’s a big step up from the previous IPX4 rating, which only handled splashes and light rain.\n\nThis makes the Pro 3 more suitable for:\n\n- Heavy rain\n- Spills\n- Intense workouts with lots of sweat\n\n---\n\n## The Case: Small Tweaks, Big Convenience\n\nThe charging case has also been updated. It’s slightly taller and thicker to accommodate the new earbuds, and it features a cleaner design:\n\n- No more cutout for the pairing light—it’s now behind the plastic and brighter than before\n- The physical pairing button is gone (to manually pair, open the case and double-tap the front)\n- New Ultra Wideband chip enables precision finding from 50% farther away\n\nNote: The old buds don’t fit in the new case, and the new buds don’t fit in the old case.\n\n---\n\n## New Features: Heart Rate Monitoring & Live Translation\n\n### Built-In Heart Rate Sensor\n\nA small window on the back of each earbud houses a heart rate monitor. It’s a nice addition, especially for workouts. The data integrates seamlessly with the Apple Fitness app, making it easy to track calories and close your rings.\n\nIf you also wear an Apple Watch, the system automatically chooses the best source for heart rate data—you don’t have to do a thing.\n\n### Live Translation\n\nApple also introduced live translation alongside the Pro 3, though it’s not exclusive to these earbuds. Powered by Apple Intelligence, it works offline once you’ve downloaded the language packs. It’s a promising feature—2025 seems to be the year live translation finally becomes practical and widespread.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Still Missing\n\n- **Lossless Audio**: Still only available on the Vision Pro—not here.\n- **Included Cable**: Like the AirPods 4, these don’t come with a USB-C cable. Apple assumes you already have one.\n\n---\n\n## Who Are These For?\n\nIf you’re an iPhone user looking for one pair of headphones that can do it all—commuting, working, working out, and relaxing—the AirPods Pro 3 are an easy recommendation.\n\nThey’re comfortable, sound great, have best-in-class noise cancellation, and now offer better battery life and durability. At the same price as the previous model, they’re a no-brainer upgrade.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI’ve never been an all-day earbud person. I usually prefer over-ear headphones for travel and dedicated workout earbuds for the gym. But the AirPods Pro 3 might just change that.\n\nThey don’t have any glaring weaknesses—especially if you’re already in the Apple ecosystem. Well played, Apple. Well played.\n\n---\n\n### Fun Fact:\nThe original AirPods were announced 3,295 days ago. They’ve come a long way since then—but they’re still recognizably AirPods. If you want to change up their look, consider a skin or case from our sponsor, **Dbrand**. Their Grip cases protect your gear and let you customize your style.\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading.
