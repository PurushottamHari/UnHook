  "content": "# India-ASEAN Trade Deficit and PM Modi’s Call for Review\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the global trade landscape has shifted dramatically. Trump has accused India of contributing to a significant trade deficit with the United States, prompting India to reassess its own trade relationships. Against this backdrop, the ASEAN-India Summit has become a focal point for recalibrating economic ties. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while not attending the summit in person, delivered a strong virtual message calling for an urgent review of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA). This article explores the roots of India’s trade imbalance with ASEAN nations and the implications of Modi’s call for reform.\n\n## The ASEAN-India Trade Relationship\n\nASEAN is India’s **fourth-largest trading partner**, while India ranks as ASEAN’s **seventh-largest partner**. Bilateral trade has surged from around **$45 billion in 2009**—when the AITIGA was signed—to approximately **$135–140 billion today**. However, this growth has come with a heavy cost: India’s trade deficit with ASEAN has ballooned from **$5 billion in 2009** to a staggering **$45 billion** in 2025.\n\n### Key Trade Dynamics\n\n- **India’s Exports to ASEAN**: Primarily consist of raw materials and semi-processed goods such as crude oil, petroleum products, minerals, agricultural products, gems, and jewelry.\n- **India’s Imports from ASEAN**: Dominated by high-value finished goods like electronics, palm oil, machinery, chemicals, and gold.\n\nThis trade structure reveals a fundamental imbalance: India exports low-value raw materials while importing high-value manufactured goods, putting it at a structural disadvantage.\n\n## Why Has the AITIGA Not Benefitted India?\n\nSeveral factors explain why the ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has failed to deliver balanced benefits:\n\n### 1. Persistent and Rising Trade Deficit\n\nASEAN nations possess highly competitive manufacturing sectors, deeply integrated into global value chains—especially with China, Japan, and South Korea. India’s imports of electronics, machinery, and chemicals surged after tariff reductions under AITIGA, but its exports to ASEAN failed to keep pace. Notably, **palm oil alone accounts for 40% of India’s imports from ASEAN**, primarily from Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n### 2. Weak Rules of Origin\n\nA major loophole in the agreement involves **transshipment** or **rerouting of Chinese goods** through ASEAN countries. Chinese products enter ASEAN nations, are repackaged as “Made in ASEAN,” and then exported to India at preferential tariff rates—violating the spirit of the FTA, which was designed to benefit goods originating within member countries.\n\n### 3. Non-Tariff Barriers\n\nEven as tariffs fell, ASEAN countries imposed **non-tariff barriers** such as stringent sanitary standards, product testing requirements, and regulatory hurdles. For instance, Indian pharmaceutical products, agro-exports, and IT services face restrictive regulations in Indonesia, the Philippines, and other ASEAN markets, limiting India’s export potential.\n\n### 4. India’s Domestic Weaknesses\n\nIndia’s manufacturing sector has historically struggled to compete globally. Key challenges include:\n- High logistics and power costs\n- Weak infrastructure and port connectivity\n- Labor market rigidities\n- Low productivity\n\nThese factors have prevented India from leveraging the FTA to boost exports meaningfully.\n\n### 5. Limited Gains in Services Trade\n\nThe ASEAN-India Services and Investment Agreement (signed in 2014) was expected to benefit India’s strong IT and services sector. However, visa restrictions, work permit issues, and regulatory barriers have limited market access, denying India another potential avenue for trade growth.\n\n## Comparative Perspective: Where India Lags\n\n- **Manufacturing Share of GDP**: India (~16%) vs. ASEAN nations (25–30%)\n- **Logistics Cost as % of GDP**: India (13%) vs. ASEAN (lower)\n\nThese figures underscore India’s need to enhance competitiveness. Additionally, tariff concessions have been asymmetrical: India reduced tariffs on **74.2% of Indonesian goods**, while Indonesia reciprocated for only **50% of Indian products**. Similar disparities exist with Vietnam, India’s top ASEAN trading partners.\n\n## PM Modi’s Strong Message at the ASEAN-India Summit\n\nIn his virtual address, PM Modi outlined clear demands for reforming the trade relationship:\n\n1. **Call for Early Review of AITIGA**: Modi emphasized that the current agreement is **not balanced, transparent, or mutually beneficial**. He called for an immediate review, with a target completion date of **2026**.\n2. **Fair Trade and Market Access**: The Prime Minister stressed that trade must be a **two-way street**. He highlighted the need to address non-tariff barriers and streamline customs procedures to ensure Indian exporters get fair access to ASEAN markets.\n3. **Broader Cooperation**: Modi also touched on digital inclusion, technology cooperation, maritime security, connectivity, and resilient supply chains. Significantly, **2026 has been declared the ASEAN-India Year of Maritime Cooperation**, with plans for increased naval exercises—particularly in the South China Sea, where ASEAN nations face Chinese pressure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for an AITIGA review marks a pivotal moment in India-ASEAN relations. The existing trade deficit—driven by structural imbalances, weak rules of origin, non-tariff barriers, and domestic manufacturing challenges—has made the current agreement unsustainable. As India seeks to renegotiate terms for a more equitable partnership, the world will be watching to see whether ASEAN nations respond with the flexibility and fairness that Modi has demanded.\n\n---\n*For further insights on international trade, foreign policy, and economic strategy, stay tuned to our analysis.
