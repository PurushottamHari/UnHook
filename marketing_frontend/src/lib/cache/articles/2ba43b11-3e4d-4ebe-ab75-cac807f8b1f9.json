  "content": "# Cardiologist on Visceral Fat, Fasting, and Heart Health\n\nIf you have a belly sticking out, you have a problem. That’s the stark warning from Dr. Praep Jam Nadas, a world-leading cardiologist who has treated more than a quarter of a million patients with chronic heart disease. The fat accumulating in your stomach isn’t just an aesthetic concern—it’s **visceral fat**, and according to Dr. Nadas, “This is very detrimental fat. And that's the epidemic that we have today.”\n\nBut there is hope. Dr. Nadas emphasizes that the most effective way to lose this dangerous fat quickly isn’t through calorie counting or endless cardio—it’s through **fasting**. “The only thing that will make you lose that fat very quickly,” he explains, “is to change your diet, of course, but you have to do fasting.”\n\n## The Hidden Danger: Visceral Fat and Insulin Resistance\n\nDr. Nadas, who has performed over 30,000 cardiac procedures in his 35-year career, has witnessed a dramatic shift in heart disease demographics. Where patients were once predominantly over 65, he now estimates that 50% of his cases are under 65—some as young as 28. The common thread? Visceral fat and the metabolic havoc it wreaks.\n\nThis type of fat is not the pinchable subcutaneous fat found on your thighs or arms. It’s deep within the abdominal cavity, surrounding your organs. “It's on the inside. You can't pinch it,” Dr. Nadas notes. More importantly, it’s metabolically active and highly inflammatory. A biopsy of visceral fat, compared to fat from elsewhere like the buttocks, reveals a stark difference: one is “full of inflammatory molecules” like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, while the other is not.\n\nThe root of the problem, he argues, is **hyperinsulinemia**—chronically high levels of insulin in the blood. This state is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes and is a direct result of modern eating patterns.\n\n### The Glucose-Insulin Roller Coaster\n\nTo understand the crisis, Dr. Nadas breaks down the fundamental relationship between glucose and insulin. When you consume sugar or carbohydrates, glucose enters your bloodstream. “Glucose actually is toxic inside the bloodstream,” he states. It glycates molecules—attaching itself to proteins and fats—rendering them dysfunctional and accelerating aging.\n\nTo clear this glucose, the pancreas releases insulin, which acts as a key to push glucose into cells for energy. The trouble begins with frequent consumption of carbs, sugar, and processed foods. “If I'm eating every 3 hours... I'm stimulating my insulin. My insulin goes up, it comes down. But before it even gets a chance to come down, it goes up again.”\n\nThis constant stimulation leads to **insulin resistance**. The body becomes desensitized to insulin, requiring ever-increasing amounts to manage blood sugar. While a standard test like hemoglobin A1c might still show “normal” glucose levels, the background insulin level can be “off the roof.” This high insulin is a silent destroyer: it promotes fat storage (especially visceral fat), causes inflammation, constricts blood vessels, and makes blood more prone to clotting.\n\n“By the time you are diagnosed as having diabetes,” Dr. Nadas warns, “you already have coronary artery disease.” The damage is done years before the official diagnosis.\n\n## Why Fasting—Not Just Calorie Restriction—Is Key\n\nMany people turn to simple calorie reduction to lose weight, but Dr. Nadas draws a critical distinction. Caloric deficit triggers one physiological response; fasting triggers another entirely.\n\nWhen you merely cut calories, “your metabolic rate changes, actually slows down, and the body will start breaking down everything—muscles included.” You lose fat, but you also lose precious muscle mass.\n\nFasting, however, taps into an ancient survival physiology. “Fasting is: I've put on fat. Now I'm going to take it out of the bank.” Here’s how it works:\n*   **First 12 hours:** The body depletes its stored glucose (glycogen) from the liver and muscles.\n*   **After 12 hours:** With insulin levels low, the body begins liberating stored fat for energy. “And the first place the fat comes out of is going to be visceral fat.”\n\nThis is why fasting is so powerful for improving heart health. It directly targets the most inflammatory fat depot in the body. “Fasting benefits you so much because it gets rid of that worst fat.”\n\n### A Fasting Protocol for Beginners\n\nDr. Nadas recommends a graduated approach for those new to fasting, always emphasizing the importance of medical supervision, especially for extended fasts.\n\n1.  **Start with 12:12:** Fast for 12 hours (consuming only water, black coffee, or tea) and have an eating window of 12 hours. Do this for 2-3 weeks.\n2.  **Progress to 18:6:** This involves an 18-hour fast and a 6-hour eating window.\n3.  **For Significant Weight Loss or Diabetes Reversal:** Under strict medical supervision, he may prescribe longer fasts, such as a 48-hour fast once a week or even a 72-hour fast. One of his patients fasted for 72 days under supervision, losing 60 pounds and reversing her diabetes and hypertension.\n\nDr. Nadas stresses that fasting is a natural human state that modern life has eliminated. “We've lost this physiology of fasting... We were supposed to use fasting and feasting as part of our normal program.” Reintroducing it isn't a radical hack; it's a return to our biological design.\n## The Cellular Spring Cleaning: Autophagy and Mitochondrial Renewal\n\nDr. Nadas explains that the benefits of fasting extend far beyond simply burning visceral fat. When you fast, you trigger a profound cellular cleansing process called **autophagy** (from the Greek for \"self-eating\").\n\n\"Your mitochondria are very important,\" he states. \"They are the power plants of your cells. If you have old mitochondria, you're going to have fatigue, tiredness. But when you get autophagy, one reason why you feel so good after a fast is because you have *new* mitochondria. They are much more efficient in producing ATP and less reactive oxygen species.\"\n\nThis isn't just about energy; it's about cellular rejuvenation. Autophagy is the body's innate recycling program, where old, damaged cellular components are broken down and used to create new, healthier ones. \"So you have autophagy, recycling of your parts, cellular function improves, toxins get out of your cells as well,\" Dr. Nadas adds. This process is a cornerstone of improving health span—the quality of your years—not just lifespan.\n\n## The Heart-Health Exercise Prescription: Less is More\n\nStephen, conscious of his family history of heart disease, asks a pivotal question: \"Is there a particular exercise that is best for the heart?\"\n\nDr. Nadas's answer challenges conventional wisdom. Based on his observations of a quarter-million patients, he reveals a surprising trend: excessive aerobic exercise can be counterproductive.\n\n\"I see that people who overly do aerobic activity—they cycle 100 miles a day or they're running on their treadmill for two hours at a time every day—they actually end up with more inflammation in their body and they end up with more coronary artery disease than patients who do short sprints and patients who do resistance exercises.\"\n\nHis prescription is precise and balanced:\n\n*   **Aerobic Activity (for endurance):** Only 15-20 minutes. \"You don't want to be running behind the bus and get short of breath just in a few hundred feet.\"\n*   **Resistance Training:** Use your own body weight. \"Simple things... planks and leg lifts.\"\n*   **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** The gold standard. \"Exercise really hard for about 30 seconds to 45 seconds and then you completely rest for another 30 to 45 seconds.\"\n\nThe critical insight is the \"rest\" phase. \"That's allowing your body to clean up the reactive oxygen species you just created,\" he explains. This \"metabolic mess\" is cleaned up by antioxidants like glutathione, whose production is a rate-limiting step. By exercising in short, intense bursts followed by complete rest, you achieve a \"cleaner physiology\" without the inflammatory burden of chronic, long-duration cardio.\n\n## The Unseen Driver of Heart Disease: The Gut-Heart Axis\n\nThe conversation takes a profound turn as Dr. Nadas shares a story that illustrates a hidden source of cardiovascular inflammation. He recalls a patient in his 60s—a non-smoking, non-drinking, regular gym-goer with no diabetes or high blood pressure—who had a terrifyingly high coronary calcium score (over 1,000), indicating significant plaque buildup.\n\n\"The question is, why do you have all this coronary calcium?\" Dr. Nadas asked him. The answer lay not in his heart, but in his gut. \"It turned out that ever since he was a kid, he had a bad microbiome.\" The patient thought being constipated and having a bowel movement only every three or four days was normal. \"He was totally shocked... I dug into it and found out that he's actually got a lot of GI problems and that's what probably caused him to have inflammation.\"\n\nThis introduces the critical concept of the **gut-heart axis**. Dr. Nadas explains, \"The biggest difference between you and your outer environment is actually your gut, not outside your skin.\" It's home to 100 trillion bacteria and 400 trillion viruses in a symbiotic relationship. When this ecosystem is disrupted, the consequences are direct:\n\n1.  **Nutrient Deprivation:** A healthy microbiome produces essential micronutrients like short-chain fatty acids.\n2.  **Leaky Gut:** A dysfunctional microbiome compromises the intestinal lining. \"Molecules that are supposed to stay in the gut, dead bacterial wall products called lipopolysaccharides... get into the bloodstream\" and travel directly to the liver.\n3.  **Fatty Liver & Systemic Inflammation:** This invasion causes fatty liver disease, which Dr. Nadas calls an \"epidemic\" affecting 25% of the population. \"A fatty liver causes a lot of inflammation,\" creating a cascade that leads directly to coronary artery disease.\n\nThe solution is to \"fix the fatty liver by changing your diet... increase the fiber intake so that the good bacteria start coming back... and when I give you certain supplements to restore all your nutrition in your body then all of a sudden the progression of coronary calcium flattens out.\"\n\n## The Calcium Conundrum: Supplements vs. Arterial Plaque\n\nStephen wisely seeks to clarify a potential confusion: the difference between harmful calcium in artery walls and calcium supplements often taken for bone health.\n\nDr. Nadas is unequivocal: \"Calcium supplements actually increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Calcium supplements should not be taken... I stop all calcium supplements on all my cardiac patients.\"\n\nThe problem is not calcium itself, but how it is managed in the body. \"The problem is lack of D3 and lack of K2.\" He explains the crucial synergy:\n*   **Vitamin D3** ensures calcium is absorbed from the gut.\n*   **Vitamin K2** acts as a traffic director, shuttling calcium into the bones (where it's needed) and away from the arteries (where it causes hardening).\n\nThis explains the paradox of young women in sunny Florida with osteopenia despite taking calcium supplements. \"The reason is D3. You need D3 and K2. It's a hormonal thing. It's not the elemental thing.\" He even notes that blood thinners like warfarin, which lower vitamin K levels, lead to increased coronary calcification.\n\n## Building a Healthy Gut: Fiber, Fermented Foods, and Lifestyle\n\nSo, what is the prescription for a \"perfect gut\"?\n\n1.  **Lots of Fiber:** \"Fiber is going to be eaten by your good bacteria.\" Given that modern diets are 40-50% deficient in fiber, Dr. Nadas advises a supplement like inulin with FOS (a soluble fiber powder) and, more importantly, eating \"real food.\" He emphasizes variety: \"You're supposed to eat 30 to 40 different types of vegetables a week... including spices. They all count as one vegetable.\"\n2.  **Fermented Foods:** These provide both probiotics (the good bacteria, like in kefir) and **postbiotics**—the beneficial compounds they produce, such as vitamin K2 and short-chain fatty acids.\n3.  **Sleep and Stress Management:** \"Lack of sleep causes a change in your gut microbiome... One night of bad sleep, you become insulin resistant the next day.\" Stress and frequent time-zone changes also disrupt the gut-liver axis.\n\n## The Toxin Invasion: Pesticides, Plastics, and Mold\n\nDr. Nadas defines a toxin simply as \"a molecule that should not be in your body.\" The list of common offenders is alarming:\n*   **Pesticides & Herbicides:** Estrogen receptor disruptors that cause inflammation.\n*   **Plastics:** \"Forever chemicals\" like PFAS and BPA that disrupt metabolism.\n*   **Mold:** A particularly insidious toxin.\n\n\"Mold is very interesting. I've only started researching it in the last one year,\" he admits, but his findings are stark. \"Almost 70% of homes these days have some form of mold toxicity.\" Stephen shares a personal story of discovering mold in his steam room, realizing he had been inhaling it daily. Dr. Nadas explains that mold causes a systemic inflammatory reaction, and if it colonizes the sinuses or gut, you can be \"re-inoculating yourself over and over again.\"\n\n\"When I get rid of the mold, all of a sudden I'm noticing that the patients are not only feeling better, but the rate of progression of coronary artery disease flattens off.\" He argues that for many \"healthy\" people who still develop clogged arteries, undiscovered sources of inflammation—like mold, leaky gut, or food sensitivities (e.g., undiagnosed celiac disease)—are often the culprits. \"It's all about inflammation. We need to get rid of the source.\"\n\n## Nutritional Pitfalls: The \"Healthy\" Foods That Harm Your Heart\n\nIn a striking reversal, Stephen asks what he should eat to *ensure* he ends up on the cardiologist's surgical table. Dr. Nadas's list is a sobering guide of what to avoid:\n\n*   **Processed Foods:** \"Pringles... biscuits, cookies, cakes, lots of bread. Fast foods, foods that come in a box.\" Anything with a long ingredient list.\n*   **\"Healthy\" Traps:**\n    *   **Bread:** \"Bread is a survival food. Just empty calories.\" The worst offender is pure white bread, which he equates to \"10 teaspoons of sugar.\"\n    *   **White Rice:** He advises a specific preparation to mitigate its effects: soak it overnight to remove arsenic, cook it with plenty of water, cool it in the refrigerator, and reheat it the next day. This process creates **resistant starch**, which feeds gut bacteria instead of spiking your blood sugar.\n    *   **Excessive Fruit:** \"Fruit should be eaten only in season because it has too much fructose in it... fructose causes fatty liver.\" He recounts a patient whose health transformed after stopping a fruit-only diet.\n    *   **Overcooked Foods:** Burning or blackening food creates **advanced glycation end products (AGEs)**, which cause significant inflammation.\n    *   **Vegetable Seed Oils:** \"Exceedingly high in omega-6,\" which disrupts the crucial omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. He recommends replacing them with olive oil, butter, ghee, or coconut oil.\n\n## Reading Your Body's Warning Signs\n\nFinally, Stephen asks how an individual can assess their own cardiovascular health at a glance. Dr. Nadas's indicators are holistic:\n\n*   **Weight and Belly Fat:** \"If you have a belly, you have a problem.\" Visceral fat is the primary red flag.\n*   **Joint Pains:** Often dismissed as arthritis, but \"it's all inflammation.\" Improving diet and gut health frequently resolves joint issues, even autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Bad Breath and Oral Health:** \"There's a microbiome that goes all the way from your nose, mouth, all the way down to the anus.\" Poor dental hygiene and chronic sinusitis are linked to valvular heart disease and coronary calcification because they represent constant, low-grade inflammation.\n\nDr. Nadas's conclusion is powerful: \"We are transforming the whole definition of the causes of coronary artery disease... everything—your entire lifestyle, mental, physical, eating—everything will affect your coronary arteries. Everything.\"\n\nThis holistic view sets the stage for the final part of the conversation, where we will delve into the critical roles of sleep, stress, and mental well-being in heart health, and explore the practical steps anyone can take to build a resilient cardiovascular system from the ground up.\n## The Final Pillars: Sleep, Stress, and the Mind-Heart Connection\n\nThe conversation takes a deeply personal turn, moving from the biochemical to the biographical. Dr. Jay reveals that the most difficult day of his life was the loss of his father. This wasn't just a moment of grief; it was a profound professional and personal reckoning. His father, a cardiac patient who had been given only a few years to live after bypass surgery, had his life extended by three decades through the very principles discussed in this article—weight loss, dietary changes, and eliminating alcohol. Yet, his final decline was triggered by a catastrophic gut infection. \"He got overwhelmed with a toxin from his gut,\" Dr. Jay explains, a stark, heartbreaking reminder that even with the best protocols, the gut remains a precarious frontier. This experience taught him a lesson that transcends medicine: the critical importance of living in the present moment.\n\n\"This being in the moment... Life is only expressed in this moment right now.\"\n\nThis philosophy is the ultimate pillar of heart health. Chronic stress, anxiety, and living in the past or future keep the body locked in a sympathetic (fight-or-flight) state, directly undermining the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) healing that the vagus nerve facilitates. Dr. Jay stresses that depression itself is not merely a psychological state but a symptom of inflammation in the brain. The same anti-inflammatory diet that clears coronary arteries can lift the fog of depression, linking mental and cardiovascular wellness inextricably.\n\n### Your Action Plan: From Screening to Presence\n\nDr. Jay concludes with a clear, two-step prescription for anyone concerned about their heart health, moving from clinical assessment to daily practice.\n\n**1. Get the Right Tests:**\n*   **Coronary Calcium Score:** For adults over 30, this is the non-invasive gold standard. A score of zero means you have no detectable calcified plaque—an excellent place to be. Any score above zero indicates existing atherosclerosis and is a clear signal to engage in a serious prevention program with a knowledgeable cardiologist.\n*   **Advanced Inflammatory Panel:** Standard cholesterol tests are not enough. Seek out a comprehensive panel like Cleveland Heart Lab, which measures:\n    *   LDL particle size and density (small, dense LDL)\n    *   Oxidized LDL\n    *   CRP (C-Reactive Protein)\n    *   Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor\n    *   Hemoglobin A1C\n\nThese markers tell the real story of inflammation happening beneath the surface, often before symptoms appear.\n\n**2. Cultivate Present-Moment Awareness:**\nThe goal is to balance the nervous system. This isn't just about adding years to your life, but life to your years. The techniques to stimulate the vagus nerve—the 4-7-8 breathing, humming, cold exposure, and laughter—are all tools to anchor you in the present. By consciously practicing these, you shift your body from a state of constant threat to a state of repair and resilience.\n\n### The Heart of the Matter\n\nThe journey through heart health, as Dr. Jay frames it, is a move away from simplistic, fear-based metrics like total cholesterol and toward a profound understanding of the body as an interconnected system. The heart is not an isolated pump; it is a mirror reflecting the health of your gut, the balance of your nervous system, the quality of your sleep, and the peace of your mind.\n\nThe ultimate takeaway is one of empowerment. Heart disease is not an inevitable fate. It is, in large part, a lifestyle disease rooted in inflammation. By addressing the root causes—through mindful nutrition, targeted fasting, toxin avoidance, gut healing, and nervous system regulation—you can directly influence your cardiovascular destiny. It requires a shift from being a passive patient to an active participant in your own well-being.\n\nDr. Jay’s final wisdom, born from both professional expertise and personal loss, is that true health is found not just in the numbers on a blood test, but in the quality of your presence. A healthy heart is one that beats in a body that is well-nourished, well-rested, and fully engaged in the current moment. It is the culmination of treating yourself not as a collection of symptoms, but as a whole, interconnected human being.",
