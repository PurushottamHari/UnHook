  "content": "# China's Auto Export Strategy: EVs at Home, ICE Cars Abroad\n\nThe global automobile industry is now sharply divided into two major segments. On one side are Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, powered by oil, petrol, and diesel—fuels increasingly seen as environmentally detrimental. On the other side are Electric Vehicles (EVs), hailed as the future for being climate-friendly and sustainable. Into this landscape has emerged a powerful new player: China. Its rise has been so dominant, particularly through emerging brands like BYD, that projections suggest 60-70% of the cars we see on roads globally in the near future could be Chinese EVs.\n\nChina's dominance isn't just about manufacturing scale; it's also about rapid innovation across the entire industry. This influence was on full display at events like COP 30, where BYD was an official sponsor. Notably, even the President of Brazil arrived at the summit in a BYD car. China used the platform to showcase its deep concern for the global climate and its major contribution to climate initiatives. With the US absent from such forums, the conversation was dominated by \"China, China, China.\"\n\nHowever, there is another, less publicized picture behind China's automobile industry. While aggressively growing its domestic EV segment, China is simultaneously **dumping its petrol and diesel cars onto markets worldwide**. This practice is the real reason China has earned the tag of the **world's largest automobile exporter**, not its EV exports.\n\nThis session delves into the mechanics of this dual strategy: how China achieved this export potential, the reasons behind it, the specific regions and countries targeted for this ICE vehicle dumping, and what the future may hold.\n\n## The Domestic Pivot: From ICE Peak to EV Ambition\n\nChina's journey began with a strong, state-backed push for EVs. It was the first nation to sell 1 million EVs in a single month. The government's major focus on this industry dates back to 2010-2012, with numerous players emerging and receiving comprehensive state backing.\n\nThe growth was so rapid that after China's ICE vehicle sales peaked in 2017, electric car sales began to surge. This created a significant problem: the inventory of unsold ICE vehicles from companies still manufacturing them began to pile up, reaching millions of units. Letting this industry collapse was not an option.\n\nThe solution was not to push these ICE vehicles domestically—China itself wants to replace ICE with EVs, a shift clear in the sales numbers—but to **start exporting this unsold inventory**. For state-owned companies facing major losses, exporting became the escape valve.\n\n## The Export Surge: Subsidies and State Backing\n\nChina's automobile exports were not always significant. In 2020, exports were hardly 1 million units. That number grew rapidly, reaching approximately 6 million by 2024, with estimates suggesting 6.5 to 6.75 million for 2025.\n\nThe critical detail? **The major growth in exports is not from EVs.** It is from ICE vehicles. So, on one hand, China talks about global climate sustainability and promotes its EV industry (making BYD a sponsor at COP 30). On the other, it is exporting massive numbers of ICE vehicles to many countries.\n\nEconomists, ecologists, and activists have coined a term for this: **\"Carbon Dumping.\"** This is not normal trade dumping (selling excess goods cheaply abroad). It is a specific kind of environmental offloading: **China reduces its domestic emissions by pushing EVs, while increasing the emissions of other countries by flooding them with ICE vehicles.**\n\n## The Key Players: State-Owned Champions of ICE Exports\n\nA look at the numbers reveals which companies generated major export figures: **Chery and SAIC**. Both are state-owned enterprises. These two companies provided the major push, with their ICE vehicle exports seeing dramatic increases. Other companies like Geely and BYD are definitely known for electric vehicles, but the export boom has been fueled by ICE models.\n\nThis doesn't mean Chinese EVs haven't created market dominance. China has been building its EV industry for four to five years, with BYD emerging as a silent giant. Even in India, BYD vehicles are becoming increasingly common in regions like Delhi NCR and parts of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHowever, the major increase in automobile exports that earned China the title of **\"World's Largest Automobile Exporter by Volume\"**—a tag long enjoyed by Japan—is **because of ICE vehicles**. This title wasn't necessarily China's initial, intentional goal. Given its significant domestic consumption, it might have taken longer. But the policy shift to promote EVs led to the export of ICE vehicles, inadvertently creating one of the world's largest exporters and snatching the title from automotive giants like Japan and Germany.\n\n## Target Regions: Where is China Dumping Its ICE Vehicles?\n\nAnalyzing data from January 2021 to April 2025 shows a major increase in exports, with a clear geographical pattern:\n\n*   **Asia & Southeast Asia:** Exports continue to these regions, including poorer economies.\n*   **Latin America & The Caribbean:** This region represents a **major portion of the increase**. Countries like Mexico have seen a significant surge.\n*   **Russia:** China has sold a substantial number of vehicles here. Remarkably, about **half of Russia's passenger vehicle fleet** is now estimated to be Chinese. This influx has caused concern in Russia itself, leading to policy responses.\n*   **Africa:** Nations like South Africa have seen Chinese brands capture up to 16% market share.\n\n**Notably, China has not been able to sell these vehicles in advanced economies like the rest of Europe and North America.** These countries have already imposed restrictions, declaring that this kind of \"carbon dumping\" will not be tolerated.\n\nSo, where does the carbon dumping go? **To developing or poorer nations**, where EV penetration is low due to infrastructure and affordability challenges. China capitalized on this opportunity to boost its ICE vehicle export numbers.\n\n### Case Studies of Market Capture:\n\n*   **Mexico:** Became China's largest export market in 2024, with 200,000 units sold. 14% of all cars sold in Mexico were Chinese.\n*   **South Africa:** Chinese brands reached a 16% market share, up from 10%.\n*   **Chile:** Approximately one-third of cars sold are now Chinese, snatching market share from previously prominent brands like Nissan and Volkswagen.\n\nThis strategy mirrors what China did earlier in the electronics industry: state backing, cheap goods, and capturing foreign markets. It is now being replicated in the automobile sector. Even in Western Europe, rapid expansion has occurred in countries like Poland, which saw 33 new Chinese models, mostly fossil-fuel powered.\n\n## The Core Driver: Affordability vs. Sustainability\n\nThe biggest point emerging from this is **profitability**. Articles have begun appearing highlighting how easily one can buy cheap Chinese cars in South Africa. The message is simple: if affordability is a major concern and cheap options are available from abroad, people will buy them.\n\nWhen discussing climate adaptability or sustainability, people globally would prefer to preserve the environment. But for many developing nations, **affordability is the primary pinch point**. EV technology is still growing and remains expensive. While China has identified a sweet spot for affordable EVs, it also possesses massive unsold ICE vehicle stocks. Selling these stocks in such countries allows it to make a major profit—a practice termed \"dumping.\"\n\nThis creates a stark division. While global initiatives like COP 30 strive for environmental sustainability and controlling emissions from ICE vehicles, a form of **carbon dumping** is visibly happening. Some regions adopting EVs are dumping their older, polluting technology (or its new equivalent) into regions without the infrastructure to support cleaner alternatives. The desire of people in these nations to own a car—any car—is being fulfilled, and China is capitalizing on it.\n\n## Pushback and the Road Ahead\n\nNations are becoming cautious. **Mexico** has started raising import tariffs on Chinese cars, potentially up to 50%. **Russia** has also stated it will increase import tariffs, as Chinese vehicles now contribute to over 50% of its fleet size.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean China's market will vanish. The availability of markets remains, particularly in the **African continent**, where many countries still lack alternatives. China already has trade relations there, often extracting minerals. It could easily start selling ICE vehicles in these markets tomorrow.\n\nThere must be a certain point where a collective global voice says such practices must be curbed. The core argument is: **You can revolutionize the world with new EV technology, but you cannot simultaneously dump your excess stock and over-produced ICE vehicles onto lower-income nations.**\n\nA collective global responsibility is essential. While some nations have taken steps, others, like **Pakistan** (which has strong economic ties with China), may continue to import due to pure affordability.\n\n### China's Long-Term Model and Global Scenarios\n\nObserving China's model on a core conceptual basis reveals it is already creating affordability in EVs. It's likely that China will gradually decline its ICE vehicle production capacity. Simultaneously, it could make EVs so affordable that it **retains the \"world's largest automobile exporter\" tag in the automotive sector** through electric vehicles. This affordability-focused dominance, already seen across various sectors, could be replicated in EVs.\n\nFor advanced nations (US, Europe), many restrictions are already in place. But for developing nations, environmental sustainability often comes second. Fulfilling their own requirements and demand comes first.\n\nThis leads to three possible future scenarios:\n\n1.  **A Two-Speed World:** A permanent division where EVs dominate in some regions, and ICE vehicles continue to run in others. Modernization may never fully reach some countries, and dependency on fossil fuels may never end.\n2.  **A Hybrid Catch-Up Approach:** EV development continues globally, with slow, gradual adoption in developing countries. This is perhaps the most viable and acceptable solution.\n3.  **A Forced Transition:** A mandate to completely phase out petrol vehicles. This would likely cause significant political backlash, especially in poorer countries where a petrol car with a 10-year lifespan might be driven for 15-20 years, with little regard for emissions.\n\nThe second scenario seems most plausible. However, it would require **advanced nations to assist developing nations** with technology transfer and infrastructure development. Global institutions like the World Bank and IMF would also need to step in to provide funding for infrastructure setup in the least developed economies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChina's automobile industry strategy presents a paradox of progress and concern. It is simultaneously leading a green transportation revolution at home while exporting the very technology that revolution seeks to replace. This \"carbon dumping\" highlights the complex tensions between global climate goals, economic strategy, and the stark realities of affordability and infrastructure in the developing world.\n\nThe coming years will reveal how this strategy evolves and whether the global community can forge a more collective and equitable path toward sustainable transportation for all.",
