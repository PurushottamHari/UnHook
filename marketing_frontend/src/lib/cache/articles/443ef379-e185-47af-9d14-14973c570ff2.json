  "content": "# Six Degrees of Separation: The Science of Networks\n\nIn 1999, the German newspaper *Die Zeit* ran a social experiment. They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director, Salah ben Ghaly, who in the world he would most like to be connected to. He chose his favorite actor: Marlon Brando.\n\nReporters then searched for a chain of friends, family, or acquaintances—people who knew each other on a first-name basis—that could connect ben Ghaly to Brando. As it turned out, ben Ghaly had a friend in California. That friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer of the film *Don Juan DeMarco*, which starred Marlon Brando.\n\nIn total, it took just **six steps**—six degrees of separation.\n\nThis idea—that any two people on the planet can be connected in six steps or fewer—has fascinated scientists, storytellers, and social observers for decades. But is it really true? And if so, what does it mean for how diseases spread, how information travels, and how we relate to one another in an increasingly interconnected world?\n\n---\n\n## The Mathematics of a Small World\n\nAt first glance, the idea seems improbable. In a world of **eight billion people**, how could we all be just a few handshakes apart?\n\nMathematician Steven Strogatz offers an intuitive explanation:\n\n> “Let’s suppose I have my 100 friends out of eight billion people. Each of them knows 100 people. So two steps away from me is going to encompass 100 times 100 people—that’s already 10,000 people. If you do 100 to the fifth power, that’s 10 billion, more people than there are on Earth. So notice that number is five—I said, ‘to the fifth power.’ That’s the ballpark reason why six degrees of separation is true.”\n\nBut there’s a catch: this calculation assumes our friendships are **randomly distributed** across the globe. In reality, they’re not. We naturally cluster—geographically, socially, professionally. Most people you know live near you, and they also know each other. This clustering should, in theory, make the world much larger.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine all eight billion people arranged in a circle, each connected only to their 100 nearest neighbors. In that scenario, connecting to someone on the opposite side of the planet could take **40 million steps**.\n\nYet, in practice, we consistently find that real-world networks are small. This is the **paradox of six degrees of separation**: we live in local clusters, but we’re still closely linked to almost anyone, anywhere.\n\n---\n\n## The Small-World Model: Watts and Strogatz\n\nIn the mid-1990s, mathematicians **Duncan Watts** and **Steven Strogatz** set out to solve this puzzle. They modeled social networks on a spectrum between two extremes:\n\n- **Ordered networks** (like a circle where everyone knows their nearest neighbors)\n- **Random networks** (where connections are made arbitrarily)\n\nThey began with an ordered network—nodes arranged in a circle, each connected to a few neighbors—and then “rewired” a small fraction of the links to random nodes elsewhere in the network. These random reconnections were called **shortcuts**.\n\nWhat they discovered was striking:\n\n> “As soon as he introduced a few shortcuts, the world immediately gets as small as a random graph,” Strogatz recalls. “But it stays as clustered as if it were still regular. So you could simultaneously have the clustering that we know is real and the small world that we know is real.”\n\nWith just **1% of links** rewired into shortcuts, the average degree of separation dropped dramatically. Applied to the global population, you’d need only **three out of every 10,000 friendships** to be shortcuts for the average degrees of separation to fall to six.\n\nWatts reflected:  \n> “Our math showed, the question is not why is the world small, it’s really how could it be otherwise?”\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Validation: From Worms to Hollywood\n\nTo test their model, Watts and Strogatz turned to an unusual source: the nervous system of the tiny worm *C. elegans*. Neurobiologists had mapped every one of its 282 neurons and their connections.\n\nIn a fully ordered model, the average degree of separation between neurons would be around 14. But in the actual worm, it was just **2.65**—very close to what a random network would predict.\n\n> “Then we were popping the champagne,” Strogatz says. “That was really exciting—that nature had done that.”\n\nThey went on to study other networks:\n\n- **Hollywood actors**: In a database of 200,000 actors, the average degree of separation was less than four.\n- **Power grids**: Also exhibited small-world properties.\n\nThe model held up. But the real question remained: **So what?**  \nDoes a small world affect how diseases spread? How information travels? How cooperation emerges—or collapses?\n\n---\n\n## The Dark Side of Connectivity: Speed of Spread\n\nTo understand how network structure influences disease spread, Derek Muller of Veritasium collaborated with animator Casper to run a simulation.\n\n- In a **fully clustered world**, an infection took **73 days** to spread globally.\n- With just **10% of links** rewired as shortcuts, the same infection took only **26 days**.\n- In a **fully random network**, it took **25 days**.\n\nThe difference between a fully clustered and a slightly “small-world” network was staggering. As Casper noted:\n\n> “It’s crazy because in the random case, all your links are random. In the small-world case, it’s just 10%. It’s like if one out of your 10 friends is a shortcut.”\n\nThis helps explain why pandemics can explode so quickly in the modern world—and why a handful of long-range connections can have outsize effects.\n\n---\n\n## Hubs: The Super-Connectors\n\nNot all networks are shaped primarily by shortcuts. In the late 1990s, physicist **Albert-László Barabási** studied the structure of the World Wide Web. He expected the distribution of links to follow a bell curve, but what he found was entirely different: a **long-tailed distribution** where a few sites—like Yahoo—had thousands of links, while most had very few.\n\nHe called these highly connected nodes **hubs**.\n\nBarabási and his colleague Réka Albert proposed that two principles explain the emergence of hubs:\n\n1. **Growth**: Networks form over time, with new nodes continually added.\n2. **Preferential attachment**: New nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many links.\n\n> “Once hubs are there,” Barabási explains, “they fundamentally change the way the system behaves and the way we understand that system.”\n\nHubs aren’t just a feature of the web. They appear in:\n\n- **Airports**: Chicago O’Hare serves as a hub connecting hundreds of destinations.\n- **Ecosystems**: Keystone species like Atlantic cod support entire food webs.\n- **Metabolism**: Molecules like ATP participate in hundreds of reactions.\n- **Neural networks**: Brain regions like the prefrontal cortex integrate countless functions.\n\nBut hubs also create vulnerability. A delay at O’Hare can ripple across the globe. The loss of a keystone species can collapse an ecosystem. This is what Barabási calls the **Achilles’ heel of networks**.\n\n---\n\n## Network Structure and Human Behavior\n\nPerhaps the most profound implication of network science is how structure shapes **human behavior and beliefs**.\n\nWatts and Strogatz explored this using the **prisoner’s dilemma**, a classic game theory scenario where players choose to cooperate or defect. In a clustered network, cooperation thrived. But when they introduced shortcuts—mimicking the openness of the internet—cooperation collapsed.\n\nStrogatz explains:\n\n> “Cooperation is fostered by having little clumps. If I have a little clump of people that are kind of my buds, we get to have a lot of encounters, and cooperation tends to emerge from familiarity… Whereas in the world of the internet, where anyone can get on Twitter and badmouth anyone else, that tends to discourage cooperation. We don’t have pockets; you don’t have communities.”\n\nThis helps explain the “keyboard warrior” phenomenon—why people say things online they would never say in person.\n\nLater, Watts ran experiments with real people playing similar games. He found that when players could **choose their connections**, cooperation was much more likely to emerge.\n\n> “You can make this a lot better for yourself by just acting and being decisive and being proactive about things,” says Casper. “Making a choice can be powerful in more than one way.”\n\n---\n\n## The Power of the Individual\n\nOne of the most hopeful insights from network science is that **individuals can shape networks**—and through them, society.\n\nStrogatz reflects:\n\n> “There’s something about the world that makes it prone to those upheavals. Meaning it’s always kind of poised on an edge of instability. And that gives each of us more power than you’d think we would have. It is actually possible for individual people to start movements that grow and take off.”\n\nThis idea echoes the famous Steve Jobs quote:  \n*“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”*\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: We Shape Our Networks, and They Shape Us\n\nThe science of networks reveals a profound duality:  \nOur connections shape how diseases spread, how information travels, and even how we behave. But we are not passive nodes. We can choose whom we connect to, which hubs we support, and what kind of network we want to be part of.\n\nAs Derek Muller concludes:\n\n> “Learning all about network science has taught me many things, but perhaps the most important is that our networks shape us, but our actions shape the networks. So choose both wisely.”\n\nIn a small world, every link matters. And every one of us has the power to be a shortcut—or a hub—for something better.\n\n---\n\n*Interested in experimenting with network simulations yourself?
