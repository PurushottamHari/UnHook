  "content": "# Apple's AI Crisis: Dependence and Cost Challenges\n\n## The Dream vs. The Reality\n\n> \"My hope is that towards the next 50 to 100 years, we can make a tool, if we really can come up with these machines of a new kind, of an interactive kind.\"\n\nThis visionary statement captures the technological ambition that once defined Apple under Steve Jobs. Today, however, a very different narrative is unfolding. **\"Ladies and gentlemen, Apple has an AI problem,\"** declares one analyst, summarizing what many in the tech industry are thinking.\n\n**\"Apple is lagging right now. Apple's AI is floundering. They're struggling in AI,\"** critics say, with some going so far as to suggest **\"Tim Cook should be fired as CEO.\"** The fundamental shift in Apple's identity is stark: **\"Under Steve Jobs, it was very much a concept-oriented company. Under Tim Cook, however, it's become a very product oriented company or what I call a mechanic.\"**\n\nThis transformation comes at a dangerous time. History shows that **\"Giant company is late to massive technological shift, falls behind and never recovers, dies. That is a tale as old as time and it does repeat itself.\"** And now, this pattern **\"is shaking Apple's trillion dollar empire.\"**\n\n## From Revolution to Stagnation\n\nThere was a time when Apple invented the future. When Steve Jobs was leading Apple, every keynote felt like a revolution waiting to happen. The launch of Siri was particularly emblematic of this era - it was **4 years ahead of everyone else.** As one observer notes, **\"Because for decades, technologists have teased us with this dream that you're going to be able to talk to technology and it'll do things for us.\"**\n\nSiri was initially hailed as revolutionary as the first computer mouse. But the landscape has dramatically shifted. **\"Fast forward to today, while Alexa can run your home, Google can actually predict what you need even before you do. But Siri, Siri feels like a dumb assistant in the age of AI.\"** The criticism has become so severe that some joke: **\"Everyone's worried about losing their jobs to AI, but the only person that should really lose their job is Siri.\"**\n\nThe recent iPhone 16 announcement highlighted this growing gap. **\"They announced the iPhone 16, but the biggest drawback were the AI Siri features. As you know, Siri hasn't really worked well for years.\"** While competitors are pushing boundaries - **\"Today, in a world where OpenAI is dropping GPD5 and agentic features, while Google is flexing with V3\"** - Apple's biggest updates remain **\"camera improvements and better battery life.\"** To make matters worse, **\"Apple Intelligence is in beta even after one full year.\"**\n\n## The BlackBerry Parallel: A Cautionary Tale\n\nThe current situation bears eerie resemblance to one of tech's most famous failures. **\"If you remember back in 2007 when touchscreens took over, BlackBerry doubled down on what it felt safe, which was privacy, security, and tradition.\"** The result was catastrophic: **\"6 years later, the company that once owned half the smartphone market was reduced to a business school case study in failure.\"**\n\nToday, while the AI revolution is rewriting every single industry, **\"Apple is clinging to what it knows best, which is privacy, polish, and perfection.\"** The parallels are striking: **\"Something that BlackBerry is known for is not getting hacked and having security and privacy... But somewhere along the line, they stopped innovating. When the iPhone came out, they were complacent and didn't realize the future.\"** By 2016, BlackBerry had stopped manufacturing its own phones.\n\n**\"While the world was racing ahead with touch and apps, you know what BlackBerry said? That's okay, but we still build the most secure phone in the world. So Blackberry was based on trust and security just like Apple today is based on trust and security.\"**\n\n## The API Dependency Problem\n\nTo understand Apple's fundamental challenge, you need to grasp the concept of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). An API acts as a digital bridge between two systems, allowing one app like Siri to send a request to another system like OpenAI's GPT servers and get back an answer.\n\nHere's how it works in practice: If you ask Siri, \"tell me the history of Paris and why Eiffel Tower was built,\" behind the scenes:\n- Siri converts your voice into text\n- That text is packaged as an API request\n- The request is sent to OpenAI's cloud service\n- GPT-4 processes the query, burning compute power\n- A response is generated and sent back to Siri through the same API\n- Siri speaks back to you\n\nEvery time this interaction happens, there's a currency exchange happening with something called **tokens**. Tokens are the digital currency in the world of API. Each interaction costs input tokens (your question) and output tokens (the response). Currently, 1 million input tokens cost $2.5 and 1 million output tokens cost $10.\n\n**The fun fact is that right now Apple pays OpenAI $0.** Why? Because Apple wants intelligence that it doesn't have and OpenAI needs more users. But this arrangement is temporary. **\"OpenAI is also losing $5 billion a year. So, OpenAI at some point or the other has to start charging Apple.\"**\n\n## The Scale Problem: Why AI Economics Break at Apple's Size\n\nMost people assume Apple can easily absorb these costs. After all, Apple sells iPhones for $800 - what's the big deal in paying $20 to OpenAI? This is where the fundamental economics of AI become problematic.\n\nAs explained in a newsletter by Mikt Jaffer, **\"while in traditional SAS your profit margin increases with users, in AI SAS, the profit margin actually starts to go down.\"** This insight comes from the product head of OpenAI himself.\n\n**Traditional SaaS vs. AI SaaS Economics:**\n\nIn traditional SaaS (like Canva):\n- Companies have large fixed costs (engineers, office, computers)\n- Variable costs (storage, servers) don't change much and actually decrease with scale\n- Cloud vendors offer discounted rates as usage increases (0.023 per GB → 0.022 per GB → 0.021 per GB)\n- **Profit margins compound with scale**\n\nIn AI SaaS:\n- **Scale becomes a disaster**\n\nLet's examine the numbers:\n- Apple has **2.36 billion active devices**\n- If just **1 billion devices make 12 requests per device per day** = **12 billion requests per day**\n- Assuming each request costs **1,500 tokens**, the daily cost = **$180 million per day**\n- Annual cost = **$65 billion per year**\n\n**Context: Apple's net profits as of 2024 was $93 billion.**\n\nIf query count increases to 24 requests per day, OpenAI's bill alone would be **$130 billion**. Even with a 50% discount, Apple would still lose **50% of its profits** only to OpenAI.\n\n**\"So the moral of the story is that in traditional SAS you have a compounding margin but in AI SAS you have compounding cost and diminishing margins and this is a big big problem.\"**\n\n## Why Apple's Position is Worse Than Google and Microsoft\n\nYou might wonder: Won't Google and Microsoft face the same problem? The answer lies in their different positions in the AI stack.\n\n**Microsoft's Advantage:**\n- Has significant stake in OpenAI\n- Hosts OpenAI on Azure\n- When OpenAI's valuation increases, Microsoft's investment value increases\n- If OpenAI pays bills to Azure, Microsoft profits (though the exact agreement isn't public)\n\n**Google's Dominance:**\nGoogle doesn't just use AI - **it literally owns every layer of the AI stack:**\n\n**AI Stack Components:**\n- **Model**: Gemini, Gamma, Palm\n- **Compute**: Own data centers and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n- **Data**: Ocean of knowledge from Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps\n- **Platform**: Distribution through Android, Chrome, Search\n\n**Google's TPU Advantage:**\n- While OpenAI depends on Nvidia GPUs (with 80% gross margins)\n- Google's TPUs operate at **20% less cost** than Nvidia GPUs\n- TPU processing speeds are **15 to 30 times faster** than GPUs\n- Offer **30 to 80 times more performance per watt**\n- Result: **Lower cost per token, faster inference, less hardware dependency**\n\n**\"Basically, while OpenAI and Anthropic pay rent for computers, while Apple might have to pay OpenAI, Google owns the entire factory.\"** Once the model is trained, Google has direct distribution to billions of users instantly. No other company comes close to this scale.\n\nThis makes Apple **\"the dumb glass that displays AI built by others.\"** While Microsoft and Google can scale AI applications across billions of users, **Apple would bleed cash doing the exact same thing.**\n\n## Apple's Defense Strategy\n\nWhen looking deeper, Apple does have a two-layer defense protection against this dependency:\n\n**1. On-Device Layer** (runs on iPhone, iPad, Mac)\n- Handles simple private tasks\n- Summarizing audio, rewriting text, prioritizing notifications\n- **\"Apple intelligence delivers personal intelligence without collecting personal data\"**\n\n**2. Private Cloud Computer**\n- Apple's own servers handle heavier generative tasks\n- Image generation, advanced writing tools, long-form reasoning\n- Only very complex queries or explicit ChatGPT requests go to external AI\n\n**\"So instead of paying for every Siri request, Apple may end up paying for one in 20 requests.\"**\n\n## The Subscription Fallacy\n\nAnother argument suggests that Apple could follow the Google search model, where Google pays Apple **$18-20 billion per year** to be the default search engine on Safari. Why can't OpenAI do the same?\n\nThe fundamental difference: **Google makes money every time an iPhone user searches because it monetizes clicks and ads. But OpenAI loses money every time an iPhone user chats because every chat burns compute and tokens.**\n\n**\"Google's deal was profitable at scale, but OpenAI's deal is loss-making that too at scale. So free is impossible forever unless OpenAI raises another trillion dollars.\"**\n\n## The Strategic Threat: Becoming a Gateway, Not a Platform\n\nThe second challenge is more profound. **\"In the old internet era, Apple owned the hardware, Google monetized user intent and everyone made money. But in the AI era, OpenAI owns the cognition and Apple just hosts the interface.\"**\n\n**If value migrates away from Apple's glass toward whoever owns the thinking layer, that means every time a user says, \"Hey Siri, ask ChatGPT,\" Apple becomes one step closer to being a gateway and not a platform.**\n\nConsider Apple's current value proposition: iPhones are premium because of their seamless experience of privacy, camera, smoothness, and ecosystem. But **\"when AI agents start living above the OS layer, they'll be accessible through voice chat or even AR.\"**\n\n**\"When users start valuing intelligence over interface, what will happen to this brand loyalty that Apple has? Because if your AI knows you better than your iPhone does when your AI can do the exact same thing in your Pixel phone as your iPhone, people might actually stop caring about which phone they hold.\"**\n\n## The Future: Comfort vs. Revolution\n\nToday, Apple may need OpenAI for one in 20 queries. But **\"when agentic tasks become more and more common as the number of API calls keep increasing, that's when the true dependence will start and Apple's mode will start to disappear.\"**\n\nApple could enjoy OpenAI's free access or charge a subscription with commission and survive the next fiscal year. But **\"the real question isn't whether Apple can offer AI. It's about whether Apple can offer to stay comfortable while everyone else redefines the future.\"**\n\nAs one Apple fan expresses: **\"I hope they have a trick under their sleeve. I hope Apple will make a grand announcement and I hope they announce Apple Glass next year and announce a version of Apple Intelligence that will blow everybody's mind and I just hope that Apple has another moment to tell the world that it is still the greatest company on earth.\"**\n\n**\"So dear Apple, we are waiting. I hope you have something very special in 2026.\"**\n\nThe clock is ticking for Apple to prove it can still lead technological revolutions rather than becoming another case study in how giants fall when they stop inventing the future.",
