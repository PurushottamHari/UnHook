US Media Analysis and India's Role**\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nRecent headlines in American media have sparked intense debate among geopolitical analysts, with many echoing a provocative claim: **\"The Quad is dead.\"** Publications like *Foreign Policy Magazine* have gone so far as to declare, **\"The Quad is dead. Long live the Quad,\"** borrowing a phrase traditionally used in British royalty to signify the end of one reign and the hopeful beginning of another.\n\nBut what does this mean for the strategic alliance between India, Australia, Japan, and the United States? And where does India stand in this shifting geopolitical landscape?\n\n---\n\n## The \"Old Quad\" in Question\n\nThe Quad—comprising India, Australia, Japan, and the U.S.—has long been viewed as a cornerstone of Indo-Pacific security architecture, designed to counterbalance China’s growing influence. However, recent signals from Washington suggest a dramatic shift in American foreign policy priorities.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Quad appears to have been deprioritized. As one analyst noted, the group is not dead, but **\"it has entered a coma.\"** Key indicators include:\n\n- No standalone Quad summit in 2024\n- Only two foreign minister-level meetings, both held on the sidelines of other events\n- No meeting of defense ministers since the Quad’s inception—a telling gap that has frustrated U.S. strategists\n\n---\n\n## The Rise of a \"New Quad\"\n\nWhile the original Quad languishes, a new configuration is emerging. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth recently met with his counterparts from **Australia, Japan, and the Philippines**—pointedly noting it was the **second such meeting this year.**\n\nThis new grouping excludes India, and its members are more closely aligned with U.S. policy. As one observer noted:\n\n> \"These three countries—Australia, Japan, and the Philippines—depend heavily on the U.S. for security, and all face a real, immediate threat from China.\"\n\n---\n\n## Why India Doesn’t Fit the New U.S. Strategy\n\nThe Trump administration’s foreign policy has increasingly emphasized a **G2 framework**—a proposed U.S.-China condominium to manage global affairs. In this vision, there is little room for a powerful, independent player like India.\n\nAs one analyst explained:\n\n> \"If the U.S. and China are going to govern together through G2, where does India fit? You don’t need a powerful country like India if you’re settling things between two superpowers.\"\n\nIndia’ strategic autonomy, military strength, and Himalayan border disputes with China make it less pliable than other U.S. allies. Meanwhile, Japan, Australia, and the Philippines rely directly on American security guarantees—making them more amenable to Washington’s direction.\n\n---\n\n## China’s Expanding Ambitions\n\nA viral social media map from China—highlighted by an Australian news analyst—reveals the stark reality facing U.S. allies in the region. The map depicts:\n\n- The entire Korean Peninsula under Chinese control\n- Japan absorbed\n- Philippines and ASEAN nations annexed\n- Australia and New Zealand claimed as \"stolen land\"\n\nAccompanying text argues that for \"complete peace in the Asia Pacific,\" this map must be implemented. While not official policy, the sentiment reflects a growing nationalist narrative within China—one that directly threatens U.S. allies.\n\n---\n\n## The G2 Fantasy vs. Reality\n\nDespite Trump and his officials repeatedly referencing \"historic G2 meetings,\" Chinese officials and state media remain conspicuously silent on the concept. This asymmetry suggests Washington may be overestimating Beijing’s willingness to partner on American terms.\n\nThe U.S. appears to be operating under the assumption that friendly U.S.-China relations will deter Chinese aggression—particularly regarding Taiwan. As one analyst noted:\n\n> \"Trump recently claimed he received assurances from Xi Jinping that China won’t invade Taiwan. For now, the U.S. seems satisfied with that.\"\n\n---\n\n## India’s Position and Future Prospects\n\nDespite the current downturn, some analysts believe the Quad will revive. The prediction:\n\n> \"China will eventually backstab the U.S., particularly on Taiwan. When that shock comes, the U.S. will rediscover India’s importance.\"\n\nUntil then, India continues to strengthen bilateral ties—as seen with Canada’s new prime minister emphasizing improved relations with New Delhi, potentially restarting free trade agreement talks.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Is the Quad Really Dead?\n\nWhile American media declares the Quad deceased, the reality may be more nuanced. The original Quad is in hibernation, but its strategic logic remains sound. As China’s ambitions grow and U.S.-China tensions inevitably resurface, the Quad’s revival seems likely—if not inevitable.\n\nFor now, India watches and waits, building its own partnerships while the U.S. experiments with new configurations. But in the long game of Indo-Pacific strategy, the Quad’s obituary may be premature.\n\n---\n\n**Question for Readers:**  \nWhich country recently made history by implementing a complete generational smoking ban—prohibiting anyone born after 2007 from ever smoking, regardless of age?\n\n- India  \n- Maldives  \n- United States  \n- China  \n\n*Answer in the comments!*",
