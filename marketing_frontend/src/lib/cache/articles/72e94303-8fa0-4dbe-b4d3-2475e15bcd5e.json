  "content": "## Guru as a Guide, Not the Goal\n\nIn a world where spiritual guidance is often sought, a profound question arises: **What is the true role of a guru?** Is the guru the destination—or the signpost along the way?\n\nThis question lies at the heart of a thoughtful reflection shared recently, one that challenges the way many seekers approach their spiritual journey. The speaker begins with a simple premise: **“I would hate for a disciple to be left behind because they start idolizing their guru and lose sight of the goal—that’s their real goal.”**\n\nIt’s a sentiment that cuts to the core of a common spiritual pitfall. Many seekers begin their journey with a clear intention—a longing for enlightenment, awakening, emancipation, or some form of divine connection. Then, they meet a teacher, a guide, a guru—and something shifts. The search stops. The chapter closes.\n\nBut if meeting the guru is the end of the journey, then what was the point of the journey in the first place?\n\nAs the speaker wryly notes, if that’s the case, it might be better to simply say, “Nice meeting you,” and move on.\n\n### The Danger of Making the Guru the Goal\n\nWhen we elevate a human form to the status of guru—which is common in many traditions—we must be careful not to confuse the guide with the goal. The speaker illustrates this with a series of probing questions:\n\n- What does it mean to say, “You are my end goal”?\n- Does it mean merging with the guru? (“That’s not possible—I like to remain fit,” the speaker jokes.)\n- Does it mean becoming like the guru? Then you’d have to do everything they did.\n- Does it mean hoping to be in the guru’s thoughts in your final moments? That’s a possibility.\n- Or does it mean merging with the guru after death? If you’re truly on the path, that may happen naturally.\n\nThese questions reveal how abstract and often unexamined our spiritual aspirations can be. When we fixate on the person of the guru, we risk losing sight of the inner transformation we originally sought.\n\n### The Guru as a Constant Guide, Not a Constant Presence\n\nOne of the most clarifying insights offered is the distinction between the guru as a **constant principle** and the guru as a **physical presence**.\n\nThe speaker gives a personal example: “If you come here any time of the year, Shrihari is here—constant. If you come here on days when there’s no event, I am not here—not a constant.” Even more pointedly: “If you think you can get a physical answer from me, 99% of the time it’s just not humanly possible for me to respond.”\n\nThis reality can lead to disappointment, a feeling of being let down, of oscillation and emotional tossing. But rather than riding that wave of expectation and letdown, the speaker suggests a more stable approach: **“It’s much better to say, look, we go with the constant.”**\n\n### The True Role of the Guru\n\nSo what is that constant? It is the role of the guru as a guide:\n\n- **To show you the path**\n- **To help you walk the path**\n- **Not to become the path**\n\n“In which case,” the speaker adds with characteristic humor, “you will walk all over me.”\n\nThis distinction is crucial. The guru points toward something beyond themselves—toward the divine, toward enlightenment, toward your own highest potential. They are not the destination, but the one who helps you find your way.\n\n### An Individual Choice\n\nThe reflection closes with a gentle acknowledgment that how one relates to their guru is ultimately “an individual choice.” There is no single right way—but there may be more or less helpful approaches.\n\nWhen we make the guru the object of our devotion rather than the representative of the path, we risk getting stuck. When we see the guru as a temporary guide in a much longer journey, we keep moving forward.\n\n“Such is the way of life,” the speaker concludes—a simple, profound truth that reminds us that spiritual seeking, like life itself, is a process, not a possession.\n\nThe guru is not the treasure—the guru is the map. And no matter how beautiful or detailed the map may be, its true value lies in where it leads you.",
