  "content": "# The Neo Humanoid Robot: A $20,000 Promise, or a Beta Test in Disguise?\n\nWe have to talk about this. It feels like it’s been a while since I’ve done an old-school, straight-to-camera rant video, but this has been all over my timeline lately—so I feel like I have to.\n\nMeet **Neo**. Potentially the most futuristic product we’ve ever seen: a full-fledged humanoid robot. Standing 5’6”, weighing 66 lbs, with a 4-hour battery life, self-charging capabilities, and designed to live in your house. No, get your mind out of the gutter—it’s not *that* kind of robot. It’s a housekeeper.\n\nBecause it’s shaped like a human—walks on two legs, has ten fingers—it boasts human-like dexterity. It can fold laundry and put it away. It can load the dishwasher from start to finish, then put everything back in the cabinets. It can water your plants on a perfect schedule and never forget a single one. It’ll vacuum, tidy up, and always know where everything is—even the TV remote. It actively does all the chores you know you *should* do, but don’t *want* to do. And when it’s done? It docks itself and recharges.\n\nImagine leaving for work and coming home hours later to a spotless house. All chores finished. Every day. You’d never have to do chores again. For people with mobility issues, it could act as a personal assistant. The value here is massive for a lot of people.\n\nAnd it’s available to order *now*.\n\nThis feels like it could be the best tech announcement of 2025.\n\nExcept… it isn’t real.\n\nAnd I mean that in the most literal way possible.\n\n---\n\n## The Fine Print: Pre-Orders, Promises, and a $20,000 Leap of Faith\n\nFirst, it’s a pre-order. You can go to the website right now, pick between three colors, and either pay **$500 per month** on a subscription (standard delivery) or a flat **$20,000** to own it outright with priority delivery. Just drop a $200 fully refundable deposit to get in line. Deliveries in the U.S. are slated to start sometime next year—allegedly.\n\nNow, the price isn’t even my main issue. On paper, those numbers are eye-popping, but this is a first-generation, bleeding-edge humanoid robot assistant. I never expected it to be cheap. With no real competition yet, the target audience is clearly people whose time is worth more than the money they’d spend—early adopters who see value in reclaiming hours each week. That’s fine.\n\nMy problem is the **gaping chasm** between what Neo can actually do *today* and what the company is promising as they take your money.\n\nWhen you watch the promotional video, you’d naturally assume this robot has built-in artificial intelligence that lets it recognize objects, navigate autonomously, learn your home, and be productive while you’re gone. That’s the dream they’re selling.\n\nBut that’s not what’s happening.\n\n---\n\n## The Reality Check: 100% Teleoperated\n\nJoanna Stern—absolute legend—did a video this week where the company, 1X, showed her everything Neo could do. Turns out, **100% of the tasks demonstrated were remotely controlled by a human in another room wearing a VR headset and controllers**. Carrying things, loading the dishwasher—all of it. Teleoperated.\n\nThis was a *company demo*—their best-case scenario. And I’ve seen people online defending it: “Oh, there are probably other things it can do autonomously that they didn’t show her.”\n\nReally? You don’t think they’d lead with their best autonomous features to keep selling the dream?\n\nIf you rewatch their keynote video, they’re actually careful to label when the robot is acting autonomously versus being teleoperated. In the entire nearly 10-minute presentation, there are **exactly two scenes** with the “autonomous” label:\n\n1. **“Get the door, please.”** The robot walks to the door, grabs the handle, waits for the guest, and pulls it open (though it fumbles back a bit, like a toddler).\n2. **“Put away the dishes.”** The robot toddles over, recognizes an empty cup, grabs it, and walks off.\n\nCool. Seriously, that *is* impressive. Even though I can already unlock my door with a smart lock and my voice, there’s something undeniably futuristic about a humanoid robot doing it autonomously. That’s part of the dream.\n\nBut it also means everything *else* in that video—and everything else we’ve seen Neo do—was remote-controlled.\n\nThe gap between today’s reality and the ideal future is **massive**.\n\n---\n\n## The Lost Art of the Finished Product\n\nThere seems to be a lost art in waiting for a tech product to be *finished* before announcing it. Remember when companies would unveil something new, do a live demo, and then say, “It’s on sale tomorrow”? The hype carried right into the buying cycle. That was awesome.\n\nNow, in the age of AI, we’re stuck selling the *dream* before the product. The promise of AI is huge, magnificent, and clearly not done yet—which leads to products like the Humane AI Pin, the Rabbit R1, or even Apple Intelligence. Big promises, underwhelming capabilities.\n\nWhy do companies do this? I think there are two main reasons.\n\n---\n\n## The Training Data Problem: Your Home as a Beta Lab\n\nFor Neo to become the robot we dream of, it needs a super-smart AI system that can:\n\n- Learn its environment\n- Recognize every object it sees\n- Navigate autonomously\n- Perform complex tasks like folding laundry (which requires understanding different clothing types, folds, and storage methods)\n- Load a dishwasher (knowing what’s fragile, what goes where)\n- Even handle sensitive tasks like fetching the right medication for an elderly person\n\nThe list is endless. And it needs to adapt to millions of variables—every home is laid out differently, filled with unique objects.\n\nThis is a **robotics challenge** and an **AI challenge** rolled into one.\n\n**Tesla’s self-driving** is a perfect parallel. Tesla slowly rolled out beta features to millions of cars, gathering data from early adopters to teach its AI how to handle countless road scenarios. Their primary advantage now is the millions of miles of training data.\n\nThe home AI robot challenge is similar—but arguably harder. Roads are mostly 2D and follow rules. Homes are 3D, chaotic, and filled with infinite variables. Stakes are high, too: if a self-driving car fails, someone could die. If a home robot messes up medication, the consequences are also serious.\n\nSo, to build the perfect home robot, you need training data. And that means you need early adopters.\n\n---\n\n## The Early Adopter’s Role: Beta Tester & Privacy Trade-Off\n\nIf you order a Neo robot today, you’ll get a machine that can do a few simple autonomous tasks (like opening doors). But for everything else, there’s **“Expert Mode”**—where you schedule a teleoperator to remotely control the robot through its sensors so it can *learn* from the experience.\n\nScroll down on their website, and you’ll see it. Watch Joanna Stern’s interview with the CEO—he’s upfront about it. Early adopters will need to be okay with employees potentially viewing their homes (with blurred faces and geo-fencing, sure, but still).\n\nThis isn’t unique to Neo. Pre-ordering unfinished products is normal in smartphones, video games, even cars. But with AI, the gap between promise and delivery feels wider—and riskier.\n\nAre there really enough people willing to spend **$20,000** on a 5’6” humanoid that:\n\n- Is too small and weak to carry heavy items?\n- Moves slowly and clumsily?\n- Requires inviting remote-viewable cameras and mics into their home?\n- Could fall over and struggle to get up?\n- Might make dangerous mistakes (e.g., with medication or fragile objects)?\n\nSome will. But is it enough?\n\n---\n\n## The Upside: The Dream Is Real\n\nLet’s be clear: the *dream* is incredible. A **Rosie the Robot** from The Jetsons, seamlessly handling chores, freeing up your time, assisting those who need it most. That’s what we want AI to do—not just generate slop or infringe on copyrights, but be genuinely useful.\n\nThe problem isn’t the vision. It’s the **gap**.\n\nAnd closing that gap is incredibly hard. The people who would benefit most from the ideal version—the elderly, people with disabilities—are the least likely to become early adopters. That’s a tough pill to swallow.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts: The AI Promise Problem\n\nNeo is just the most visible example of a broader trend: **AI products promising the world long before they’re ready to deliver**. We’re stuck in this cycle of hype, disappointment, and slow iteration.\n\nI give 1X credit for being transparent in Joanna’s video. Fun fact: they reached out to me 10 months ago from a random Gmail address offering a sponsored video. I didn’t respond—it didn’t feel real.\n\nWe might look back in a year and see humanoid robots everywhere, living up to the hype. If so, great—we made it through the gap.\n\nBut history suggests I’ll probably be right about this one, at least for now.\n\nSubscribe to see me eat my words if I’m wrong.\n\nThanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\n\n---\n\n*This article is based on a critical video analysis of the Neo humanoid robot and the current state of AI product launches.*",
