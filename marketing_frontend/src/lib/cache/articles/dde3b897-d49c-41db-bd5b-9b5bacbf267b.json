  "content": "# Advice for Teenagers on Self-Belief and Avoiding Toxic Relationships\n\n## The Challenge of Growing Up in a Changing World\n\nJasmine’s question touches on a deeply relevant and tender subject: what message can we offer teenage girls—and all young people—as they step out into the world and begin to see it in a new light? Until now, I hadn’t formulated a specific message, but the question itself invites reflection. It’s fascinating, really—how the world works, and how young people navigate it.\n\nIn earlier times, many grew up in joint families, surrounded by a variety of personalities and behaviors. That exposure offered an early education in human nature. You learned the “tricks of the trade” almost by osmosis—understanding subtle cues, recognizing insincerity, and building a natural comprehension of what others might truly mean beneath their words.\n\nBut as families have become more nuclear, that early social training has diminished. Many young people today grow up trusting almost everyone—and to be clear, most people are not cunning. Most carry no malice in their hearts. Yet, this very innocence can become a vulnerability, especially for girls, who often display remarkable sincerity, loyalty, and intelligence.\n\n> “It's like you tell them something once—if they get it, they will just follow.”\n\nBut what happens when that trust is misplaced?\n\n---\n\n## The Turning Point: When Promises Derail Potential\n\nAll too often, a boy or a man comes into a girl’s life, makes promises he never intended to keep, and completely derails her sense of self. She loses sight of her career, her strengths, her innate capabilities. The quest for that person’s approval or love becomes her central focus—a sad and pivotal turning point in her life.\n\nThis isn’t limited to young women. It can happen to women of any age. The pattern is hauntingly similar: a person becomes emotionally dependent on someone else, trapped in a cycle of seeking validation, even when they don’t want to be.\n\n> “I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to be dependent on this man. I don’t want to look up to this other person—but somehow I can’t get him out of my head.”\n\nWhat do you do then?\n\n---\n\n## The Anchor: Self-Belief and How You Were Raised\n\nWhat saves you in those moments is your *samskara*—the imprint of your upbringing. If you were raised in an environment where you were taught to believe in yourself, with ample love and care, you have an inner foundation to fall back on.\n\nThe feminine spirit, in particular, thrives on love. There’s a beautiful story about a disciple who once asked his guru:\n\n> “Master, you have said that love is the way to transform a person. In fact, you’ve said love is the *only* way. But what do you do if love does not transform the other person?”\n\nThe master replied simply:  \n> “Give them even more love.”\n\nWe often think we’re giving enough, but each person’s need for love is different. Some need only a little—like a light snack. Others need love repeatedly, throughout the day. We can’t compare or judge. That’s just how they are.\n\n---\n\n## Taking Control: You Are the Dictator of Your Own Life\n\nIf a young woman can internalize one truth during these vulnerable moments, it’s this:  \n**You can be the controller and dictator of your own life.**\n\nYou don’t need to constantly seek external love or approval to feel whole. When you go out “begging for love”—a tragically common scenario—you do a great injustice to your own existence. You’re essentially saying, *“I am incomplete on my own.”*\n\nThis isn’t just a female experience. Many brilliant teenagers—boys and girls alike—abandon their talents and passions during their teen years. They might have been world-class athletes, artists, writers, or scientists, but as they explore their sexuality and new emotions, they lose focus. Those who keep their “house in order,” who maintain self-belief and purpose, often become independent thinkers who transform the world.\n\n---\n\n## The Path of Self-Love vs. The Quest for Love\n\nThe one who goes in search of love is walking a lost path.  \nJust like happiness, **love is something you attract—not something you chase.**\n\nWhen people tell me, “Swami G, we love you,” I often reply:  \n> “That’s because I’m very nice to you.”\n\nIt’s a simple truth: we struggle to love people we don’t like. A person must be *likable* before they can be *lovable*.  \nReflect on that—you’ll find it’s true in most circumstances.\n\nSo, how do you avoid the trap of seeking validation from others?\n\n---\n\n## The Power of Purpose and the Courage to Walk Away\n\nWhen you have a sense of purpose—a meaning to your existence—you stop seeking love from outside. You’re no longer chasing person after person, setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nAll relationships are a gamble. There are no guarantees—much like building a startup. You can have the best idea, team, funding, and timing, and still end up with nothing.  \nExpecting someone to live exactly as you want, for your happiness, is a recipe for frustration.\n\n> “Good luck. Even ‘happy holy’ won’t cut it.”\n\nInstead, take responsibility for your own feelings. Enter relationships knowing your needs may not be met—and have the courage to walk away if they’re not.\n\n> **Believe me, you don’t want to be in an abusive relationship.**\n\nNever subject yourself to someone who demeans, degrades, or abuses you. No one deserves that. Nature has a million other ways to bring good things into your life—but you must first refuse to tolerate mistreatment.\n\n---\n\n## You Are the Master of Infinite Possibilities\n\nAs a teenager—or at any stage—remember: you always have choices. You can change the course of your life at any point. That’s why we educate our children—to give them the strength, wisdom, and skills to make their own decisions and earn their own bread.\n\nThe teen years are formative. The scars and struggles of that time can take decades to heal. How you spend those years can shape your entire professional and emotional future.\n\nSo, my message to all young people is this:\n\n> **You are a master of infinite possibilities. Pick one and run with it.**\n\nWhen you live with purpose and self-belief, you’ll naturally attract the right people—if that’s important to you.\n\n---\n\n### A Final Note\n\nI know—teenagers often hate being lectured. I could have just said, “Believe in yourself,” and left it at that. But I’m 40-plus, and it’s that time in life when you know a few things, even if nobody wants to hear them.\n\nSo, here’s the long version. Take what resonates. Leave the rest. But never forget: your life is yours to design. Don’t give that power away to anyone.",
