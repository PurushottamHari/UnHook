  "content": "**Asan Siddhi: Achieving Inner Stillness Through Meditation**\n\n---\n\n### **The Vision of the Buddha and the Stillness That Followed**\n\nIn the 16th chapter of the book *13 Months in the Himalayas*, there is a brief but profound description of an experience that forever altered the author’s spiritual practice: a vision of the Buddha. The author recounts:\n\n> “I had the vision of Lord Buddha, and with His arrival, my posture—my *asan*—became still. If seen from a certain perspective, it was perfected. I was able to sit in one posture, without moving, for a very long time.”\n\nThis was not a dramatic, theatrical event. It was quiet, immediate, and transformative. The author emphasizes that what was written was exactly what was experienced—no more, no less. There was no desire to convince society or elaborate for the sake of validation. The experience was recorded with the simplicity and honesty with which it occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **The Struggle for Asan Siddhi**\n\nBefore this experience, the journey toward *asan siddhi*—the mastery of posture—was marked by years of struggle. The author explains:\n\n> “It took me many years to perfect that posture, so that I could sit in one asan for as long as I wished.”\n\nWhy is this mastery so essential? Because without it, the body repeatedly intrudes upon the mind during meditation. The moment you try to focus, the body sends signals—discomfort, pain, restlessness. As soon as bodily awareness arises, the mind wavers. And when the mind wavers, thoughts begin to flow. Once thoughts arise, meditation breaks.\n\nThe author offers a powerful analogy:\n\n> “Just as the sun rises even before it is fully visible—when dawn breaks and light appears—so too does meditation break even before thoughts fully manifest.”\n\nEven the slightest flicker of the eyes, the tiniest shift in the body, can disturb the mind. And once the mind is disturbed, thoughts “rise from their chairs and begin to walk.” If meditation breaks, you cannot stabilize your chosen deity or object of focus on the screen of your memory. And without that stability, true spiritual vision becomes nearly impossible.\n\n---\n\n### **The Arrival of the Buddha: A Moment of Perfect Stillness**\n\nThe author describes the vision with vivid humility:\n\n> “When Lord Buddha appeared—this happened around 14 years ago, in 2011—He simply arrived. I said, ‘Oh, You have come.’ He was seated about six inches above the ground, His robe hanging lightly. His form was utterly unique. The moment you saw Him, your mind would grow still. You would feel as though you had effortlessly slipped into meditation. You would feel that nothing else was needed.”\n\nHe compares the experience to the moon on a full-moon night, descending into a dark room:\n\n> “Sometimes you see the full moon appear closer than usual, and it brings such joy. ‘The moon looks so large today, so radiant.’ That is how He appeared.”\n\nBefore the author could even speak, he asked inwardly, “How can I perfect my posture?” The Buddha’s response was not verbal—it was a subtle gesture, a presence. And after that, *asan siddhi* was effortlessly attained.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Asan Siddhi?**\n\nThe author is cautious with the word *siddhi*—perfection or accomplishment. He says:\n\n> “I use the word ‘siddhi’ only after much thought. Did I truly attain asan siddhi? Perhaps I do not know. But I do know that after that, I could sit in one posture for as long as I wished. My body did not trouble me.”\n\nHe tested this ability and found he could sit without moving for up to 72 hours—three days and three nights. Whether he can still do so today, he does not claim. But the experience revealed a profound truth:\n\n> “If the mind is not still, the posture cannot be still. And if the posture is not still, the mind cannot be still.”\n\n---\n\n### **The Mind-Body Dialogue: Who Is Speaking?**\n\nThe author delves into the relationship between mind and body with striking clarity. Suppose you are sitting in meditation, and a thought arises: “My knees are in pain.” Where did that thought come from?\n\n> “Did the body send a signal to the mind? Or did the mind send a thought to the body, which then echoed back to the brain?”\n\nWhat if the mind simply did not listen? What if, like under anesthesia, the body’s signals were not registered by the mind? Would you still feel the pain?\n\nThis is the heart of *asan siddhi*: achieving, in a state of full awareness, what happens under anesthesia—the severing of the feedback loop between body and mind.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Still the Mind**\n\nThe mind’s natural tendency is to move. Stillness is not its default state—it must be cultivated. The author identifies two primary sources of mental disturbance:\n\n1. **The inherent restlessness of the mind**\n2. **The constant generation of thoughts**\n\nHe offers a beautiful metaphor:\n\n> “A pond never experiences tides. Its water is calm. A lake does not flood—its water remains still. But the ocean is salty, restless, always in motion. The more impurities on the surface—the more emotional clutter—the more thoughts will disturb you.”\n\n#### **The Story of the Two Bulls**\n\nThe author shares a teaching story:\n\nA disciple asks his guru, “How can I stabilize my mind? When negative emotions arise, they destroy me. How can I rise above them?”\n\nThe guru replies with a question: “Suppose you have two bulls—one with red horns, one with black. They begin to fight. Which one will win?”\n\nSome disciples say the red-horned bull will win; others say color doesn’t matter. The guru says:\n\n> “The one you feed more will win.”\n\nIf you feed negative emotions, they will grow stronger. If you feed purity, clarity will prevail.\n\n---\n\n### **Pratyahara: The Art of Withdrawal**\n\nIn the Yoga Sutras, *pratyahara*—withdrawal of the senses—is given great importance. The author explains:\n\n> “Before concentration (*dharana*), you must learn pratyahara. Give less food to the senses. When they are weakened, the mind grows calm.”\n\nHe quotes the sutra:\n\n> “When the senses are withdrawn, like a tortoise drawing its limbs inward, the wisdom of the yogi becomes steady.”\n\n---\n\n### **The Role of Practice and Detachment**\n\nThe author turns to the Bhagavad Gita, where Arjuna laments:\n\n> “The mind is restless, turbulent, strong, and stubborn. To control it is as difficult as controlling the wind.”\n\nBut Krishna replies:\n\n> “Through practice (*abhyasa*) and detachment (*vairagya*), it can be done.”\n\nWithout detachment, every emotion feels urgent, every thought seems true. The greatest skill, says the author, is learning to ignore the mind.\n\n---\n\n### **The CEO of the Mind**\n\nThe author concludes with a modern analogy:\n\n> “A good CEO listens to multiple executives giving presentations. They speak for hours, but the CEO knows how to pick out the one relevant point—the essence—and act on it.”\n\nSimilarly, in meditation, you don’t have to listen to every thought. With alertness, mindfulness, and a sharp memory, you learn to discern what deserves your attention.\n\n> “You don’t have to listen to everything. Just like that… it happens.”\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n*Asan siddhi* is not merely a physical accomplishment. It is the fruit of a still mind, a purified heart, and a spirit anchored in awareness. It is the quiet victory that comes not from force, but from letting go—the moment when the body ceases to speak, because the mind has finally learned not to listen.\n\n---\n*Tags: meditation, mindfulness, spiritual growth, Buddhism, well-being*  \n*Category: SPIRITUALITY*",
