  "content": "# Israel Plans Major Defense Manufacturing Shift to India: A Geopolitical and Strategic Realignment\n\nIn a significant development with far-reaching geopolitical implications, Israel is reportedly preparing for a large-scale shift of its defense manufacturing base to India. This strategic move comes against a backdrop of declining Israeli arms exports to India and a concerted effort by New Delhi to enforce \"Make in India\" components in all major defense purchases.\n\n## The Context: A Declining Market Share and a Strategic Imperative\n\nThe relationship between India and Israel in the defense sector has seen a notable shift. From a peak where Israel accounted for a staggering **34% of India's defense import market between 2015-2019**, its share has plummeted to an estimated **5-6% in recent years**. This dramatic decline is not due to a deterioration in ties, but rather a change in India's procurement philosophy.\n\nIndia now insists on a significant \"Make in India\" component in every major defense purchase. As one analyst put it, \"We want that in every defense purchase, there should be a 'Make in India' component. A certain percentage of the defense items should be manufactured in India.\" This policy left Israel with a critical question: how to reclaim its position in one of the world's largest arms import markets?\n\nThe answer, it appears, lies not in selling finished products, but in moving the factory floor itself.\n\n## The \"BrahMos Model\": A Blueprint for Collaboration\n\nIsrael's proposed solution mirrors the highly successful **BrahMos missile program**—a joint venture between India and Russia. While inspired by an existing Russian missile, the BrahMos is co-developed and co-produced, with profits shared and exports marketed under the \"Made in India\" banner. It has become a major export success, with sales to the Philippines and ongoing talks with Indonesia.\n\nIsrael is now looking to adopt this model. The plan involves Israeli defense firms, including small and medium enterprises that supply specialized components, forming **joint ventures with Indian companies**. The goal is to manufacture large-scale weapon systems—from missiles and drones to advanced air defense components—within India.\n\nThe benefits for Israel are multifold:\n*   **Regaining Market Access:** Products manufactured in India would naturally comply with New Delhi's \"Make in India\" mandates.\n*   **Geopolitical Insulation:** Finished systems would be technically exported from India, potentially bypassing the growing international boycott against Israel due to the Gaza conflict. As noted, several nations, including South Africa, Ireland, and Spain, have expressed deep anger and are reluctant to purchase Israeli hardware.\n*   **Profitability:** While profits would be shared with Indian partners, it represents a far better outcome than the \"0% profit\" scenario of being locked out of the market entirely.\n\n## A Geopolitical Checkmate: Countering Turkey and Pakistan\n\nThis strategic pivot is also viewed as a direct geopolitical counter to recent moves by Turkey and Pakistan. Reports emerged recently that Turkey plans to establish combat drone manufacturing facilities in Pakistan as part of a global defense push.\n\nIsrael's response, however, aims to be exponentially more comprehensive. While Turkey may focus on manufacturing drones in Pakistan, Israel intends to integrate its **entire defense industrial complex** with India. This collaboration is expected to span \"missiles, drones, hi-tech advanced weapons—everything in the field of defense.\" This move is seen as a \"complete checkmate to Pakistan and Turkey,\" significantly elevating the strategic depth of the India-Israel partnership beyond the scope of the Turkey-Pakistan axis.\n\n## Solid Foundations: Relations That \"Stand on Their Own\"\n\nA critical test for the India-Israel relationship emerged recently with the potential for friction between India and the United States under a possible future Trump administration. Given Israel's profound dependence on the U.S., analysts questioned whether a \"Washington-Delhi quarrel\" would negatively impact Israel's ties with India.\n\nThe consensus, however, is that it will not. This has become an \"accepted geopolitical fact.\" The shared interests are too compelling: Israel provides cutting-edge technology, India provides massive manufacturing scale and manpower, the Indian military becomes the primary user, and both nations benefit from joint exports. This common interest creates a standalone pillar for the relationship. As stated, \"India-Israel relations stand on their own,\" independent of the fluctuations in India-U.S. ties.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nThis is not merely about a few arms deals. Officials describe it as a defense collaboration \"perhaps of a level India has not done with any country in its history.\" The groundwork is already being laid; Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements have been signed. Israeli media extensively reports that \"the future of Israeli defense lies in India.\"\n\nPractical steps are already visible. Reports suggest that by 2026, thousands of Israeli-designed light machine guns manufactured in India could be inducted into the Indian Army. In the coming 6-8 years, observers predict that India and Israel will become deeply integrated in defense matters. The anticipated visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to India is expected to announce a proper roadmap for this ambitious partnership.\n\nThis shift represents a fundamental realignment—a fusion of Israeli technological innovation with Indian industrial capacity, driven by mutual strategic necessity and a shared vision to dominate the future defense landscape.",
