As Anupam Mittal puts it, **“The question of whether you should raise capital or not is a question of what do you want out of life.”**\n\nHe draws a powerful analogy:  \n> “Unless you fall in love and a chemical reaction happens and you marry somebody, if you plan to get married, it becomes a life question. What do you want out of life? Without answering that question, you cannot decide to get married. Correct. So in the same way, when you decide to raise capital, it is that level of seriousness.”\n\n### The Real Cost of Equity Capital\n\nWhen you raise equity capital, you’re signing up for more than just money. You’re taking on an obligation to deliver returns—often as high as **30–50% IRR** (Internal Rate of Return). In simple terms, a 30% IRR means an investor expects to roughly **2.5x their investment in 5 years**. For a 50% return, you’d likely need to grow **100% year-on-year for the next 5 years**, followed by another 5 years of 50% growth.\n\nThis kind of growth requires:\n- Hiring exceptional teams\n- Aggressive go-to-market strategies\n- Subsequent rounds of funding\n- A life dominated by your startup for the next decade\n\nAs Mittal warns, **“As soon as you raise capital from somebody from an organized VC or an angel investor, you take on the obligation for the next 10 years.”**\n\n### Alternatives to Equity Funding\n\nEquity isn’t the only option. In fact, it’s the **most expensive form of capital**. Consider these alternatives:\n\n1. **Customer Capital**:  \n   Mittal’s own venture, Shaadi.com, was initially built using capital from customers.  \n   > “It came from my customers. It's the cheapest form of capital because you give away no interest. You give away no equity... and you get validation. That means somebody's voting with their wallet.”\n\n2. **Friends, Family, and “Fools”**:  \n   These investors typically have different expectations—they want to see you succeed rather than demanding high returns.\n\n3. **Debt and Government Schemes**:  \n   Many government grants and low-interest loans are available, especially for women entrepreneurs and small businesses. Yoga Bar and several others were built this way.\n\n4. **Revenue-Based Financing**:  \n   NBFCs and other institutions offer working capital loans once you have revenue.\n\n## The Simplest Way to Validate an Idea\n\nIdea validation doesn’t have to be expensive or complex. Mittal suggests two highly effective, low-cost methods:\n\n### 1. The WhatsApp Group Hack\n- Create a WhatsApp group with a few hundred people (friends, family, acquaintances, or even strangers from relevant online communities).\n- Use AI tools to generate images of your product (e.g., a bottle design for a sauce).\n- Share these and ask for honest feedback.\n- This approach works because these groups often lack “sympathy”—they’ll tell you the truth.\n\n### 2. The “Vaporware” Website\n- Build a realistic-looking website for your product—even if it doesn’t exist yet.\n- Allow people to “order” the product.\n- When payments come in, refund them and explain the product is in development.\n- This tests not just interest, but **willingness to pay** and acceptable price points.\n\nFor service-based businesses, the approach is similar:  \n> “Fake it till you make it. Create the site, create the deck, create the vaporware, and go sell.”\n\n## What Do Investors Look For in Founders?\n\nWhen evaluating founders, Mittal focuses on three key traits:\n\n### 1. Exceptionalism\nFounders must be **exceptional at something**—whether it’s product vision, execution, sales, or marketing. This is why investors often back IIT/IIM graduates—not for the brand, but as a **proxy for exceptionalism**.\n\n### 2. Business Acumen\nThis means understanding:\n- Profit pools, not just market size\n- Why saying *“This is a $10 billion market—even if I get 1%, I’ll make $100 million”* is flawed logic:  \n  > “What you have said… is the guys who built this $10 billion industry are so stupid that they've left $100 million for you. In other words, you have to extract it out of them painfully.”\n\n### 3. Non-Obvious Insights\nFounders must know something about their space that others don’t—a “truth that others are blinded to.” This is their “right to play.”\n\n## Cultivating Business Acumen: Start Early\n\nMittal emphasizes that business acumen isn’t taught—it’s built through **doing**. He started his first business at 13, renting out books. He tried and failed multiple times before finding success.\n\nHis advice:  \n> “Start selling early on in life… Selling doesn't mean just selling the product. It could mean selling yourself for employment, asking some factory owner to take up your production. That is also a type of sales.”\n\nFor a macro perspective, working in finance or investment banking can help—it teaches you to think about industries structurally, beyond just execution.\n\n## What Will Grow in India in the Next 10 Years?\n\nWhile predicting the future is tough, Mittal identifies several powerful tailwinds:\n\n### 1. The Experience Economy\nThe more time people spend digitally, the more they crave real-world experiences—new cuisines, travel, events, and unique products.\n\n### 2. The Branding Gap\n> “India is highly unbranded in every category.”  \nFrom chairs and clothing to personal care, thousands of brands will be created in the next decade.\n\n### 3. Social Media-Driven Disruption\nSocial media is reshaping consumption—creating opportunities for brands that understand new aspirations and behaviors.\n\n### 4. AI and Tech Transformation\nAI is disrupting every software-driven business. Companies that adapt will thrive; those that don’t may struggle.\n\n### 5. Geopolitical Shifts\nWe’re moving toward a **multi-polar world**, with soft power from South Korea, China, and others creating new global trends. This also increases focus on **defense and self-reliance**.\n\n## Can India Compete with China’s Dominance?\n\nChina’s control over resources (like cobalt and lithium) and manufacturing is undeniable. However, history shows that dominance shifts.  \n> “Taiwan was very dominant for electronics at one point. Then Japanese products were all the rage… We've always seen these things change.”\n\nThe real question isn’t whether China will always lead—it’s whether **India is investing enough today** to secure its future needs.\n\n## Building for India 2 and India 3\n\nThe key isn’t whether you *can* build brands for tier 2 and tier 3 cities—it’s **what kind of brands** they need. While the top of the pyramid seeks experiences, the bottom focuses on necessities—affordable, high-quality staples.\n\nHowever, some categories cut across segments—like education and healthcare. With tech and AI, it’s possible to deliver high-quality education even at very low price points.\n\n## Valuation: Art, Science, and Supply-Demand\n\nValuing a startup isn’t just about financial models—it’s also about **market dynamics**.  \n> “Valuation becomes a game of supply and demand.”\n\nDuring hype cycles, valuations soar; during downturns, they crash. Founders should be cautious about raising at high valuations—if they need to raise again at a lower valuation, **anti-dilution clauses** can severely dilute their ownership.\n\n## Hiring the Right People\n\nFor senior hires, Mittal recommends:\n- **Multiple meetings**: One in the office, two outside (e.g., breakfast and dinner)\n- **Unnamed reference checks**: Reach out to people not listed by the candidate\n- **Ask specific, disarming questions**: Instead of “Is this person ethical?”, try “How can I help this person grow emotionally?”\n\n## Final Word: Missionaries Over Mercenaries\n\nThe best founders are **missionaries**—driven by a passion for their mission—not **mercenaries** looking for a quick flip.  \n> “Mercenaries are guys who are looking to flip… Unless you have mastery over a certain discipline and it's a very liquid discipline… it's a hope in hell.”\n\nIn India’s evolving startup ecosystem, building for the long term—with patience, resilience, and a clear sense of purpose—is what truly creates lasting value.\n\n---\n*This article is based on a conversation with Anupam Mittal, founder of Shaadi.com and judge on Shark Tank India.
