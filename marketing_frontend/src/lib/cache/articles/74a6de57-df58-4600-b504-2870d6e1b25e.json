  "content": "## God as the Only Constant in Life\n\nIn the quiet solitude between dreams and waking life, there lies a desolate space—a place where the warmth of sleep gives way to the stark reality of consciousness. One Urdu verse captures this beautifully:\n\n> ख्वाब तो मुझको मेले तक ले आए थे।  \n> नींद के बाहर तो वही वीराना था।  \n> चादर के बाहर बेदारी बैठी थी।  \n> ऐसे में क्या पाऊं मुझे फैलाना था।  \n> एक अकेली नज्म थी पूरे सफे पर।\n\n(“Dreams brought me all the way to the fair, but outside of sleep, it was the same wilderness. Beyond the blanket, wakefulness sat waiting. In such a state, what could I grasp? A lone poem lay across the entire page.”)\n\nThis imagery—of a single poem written across a vast, empty margin—serves as a poignant metaphor for human existence. We search for meaning, for something to hold onto, only to find that everything we cherish is fleeting.\n\n### The Fire That Must Fade\n\nThe verse continues:\n\n> आतिश तुझको नाज बहुत था सूरज पर  \n> शाम के ढलते ही जिसको बुझ जाना था\n\n(“O fire, you took such pride in the sun—yet by evening’s fall, you were destined to be extinguished.”)\n\nHere lies a profound truth: no matter how brilliant the flame, how radiant the sun, dusk inevitably arrives. Everything that rises must set. Everything that burns must one day go out.\n\nThis is the essence of human life. Nothing in this world is permanent. Nothing can be held onto forever. Every joy, every relationship, every achievement—no matter how fiercely we cling—eventually slips through our fingers.\n\n### The Eternal Teaching of the Gita\n\nThis timeless wisdom finds its deepest expression in the Bhagavad Gita, where Lord Krishna imparts this very realization to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He explains that just as the brightest sun must eventually set, so too must all worldly attachments fade. We cannot truly “hold” anything in this life—it all escapes our grasp in time.\n\nAnd this message was not for Arjuna alone. Krishna presented the same truth to Duryodhana, and to all who seek understanding: **No matter how brilliant the sun, when evening comes, it disappears below the horizon.**\n\n### The Still Center in a Turning World\n\nSo what remains? If everything changes, what can we rely on?\n\nKrishna offers a powerful analogy:\n\n> “Consider a chariot with its two wheels spinning rapidly. Between them lies an axle that does not turn. In modern terms, even in rear-wheel drive vehicles, the principle remains—the stability of the motion depends entirely on the stable foundation. How still something remains determines how fast and how far it can move.”\n\nThe faster the wheels of life spin—the more change we experience—the more essential it becomes to have a still, unmoving center.\n\n### Making God Your Axis\n\nKrishna’s instruction is clear:\n\n> “Make Me that stable center in your life. Fix your consciousness upon Me. Then, move as swiftly as you need to. I will ensure both your progress (yog) and your well-being (kshem). I will never allow my devotee to be destroyed.”\n\nWhen God becomes the axis of your existence—the one constant in a world of variables—you gain the freedom to engage fully with life without fear of loss. You can love, strive, create, and live passionately, because your foundation is not in the transient, but in the Eternal.\n\n### The Invitation\n\nThe empty page with its single poem is not a symbol of lack, but of focus. When everything else is stripped away, what remains is the essential—the one thing that cannot be taken from you.\n\nYour dreams may bring you to the fair, but when you wake, only one truth remains written across the margins of your life. Make that truth God. Make that truth the still point in your turning world. Then, you will not only endure—you will move with grace, purpose, and an unshakable peace.",
