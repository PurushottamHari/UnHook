The partnership comes against the backdrop of a U.S. boycott of the summit, raising questions about America’s influence in global forums and the future of multilateral diplomacy.\n\n---\n\n## A Surprising Alliance: India, Canada, and Australia\n\nJust a year ago, few would have predicted that India and Canada—whose relations had grown deeply strained under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau—would enter into a new strategic partnership. Yet, at this year’s G20, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the formation of a trilateral framework focused on technology, innovation, and critical minerals.\n\nThe partnership has been extensively covered in Canadian media, where the tone has shifted from confrontation to collaboration. As one analyst noted, “Canadian media is no longer asking why their government isn’t taking action against India—they’re celebrating a partnership that promises jobs, research, and shared prosperity.”\n\nThe initiative, promoted by Canadian Finance Minister Mark Carney in a widely circulated tweet, emphasizes cooperation in AI, clean energy, and critical minerals. Carney wrote that the three nations would “unlock new research, more opportunities, and greater prosperity” through the alliance.\n\nThe collaboration has even sparked lighthearted suggestions from Canadian social media users to nickname the group “CIA”—not for the intelligence agency, but as an acronym for **C**anada, **I**ndia, **A**ustralia.\n\n---\n\n## The U.S. Boycott and a Declaration Without Washington\n\nThis year’s G20 summit will be remembered not only for new partnerships but for what—and who—was missing. The United States, under President Donald Trump, boycotted the event following tensions with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nTraditionally, G20 summits conclude with a joint declaration—a consensus document addressing global challenges such as poverty and climate change. This year, however, the U.S. absence threatened to derail that process. Yet, in a historic move, the remaining G20 nations adopted a landmark climate declaration unanimously, despite American opposition.\n\nThis marks the first time a major global declaration has been adopted without U.S. involvement—a moment that analysts are calling “defining” for the future of international cooperation.\n\n---\n\n## Why Did the U.S. Skip the Summit?\n\nThe roots of the U.S. boycott trace back to escalating tensions between the Trump administration and South Africa. Trump has repeatedly accused the South African government of permitting violence against white farmers—a claim that resonates with part of his domestic voter base.\n\nEarlier this year, when President Ramaphosa visited the White House, Trump reportedly played videos purporting to show attacks on white South Africans, further straining relations. The issue has become a flashpoint in U.S.-South Africa diplomacy, exacerbated by South Africa’s membership in the BRICS bloc—a grouping Trump views with suspicion.\n\nWith the U.S. set to host the G20 summit in 2026, the symbolic handover of hosting rights from South Africa has not yet taken place. Ramaphosa stated that the U.S. chair would remain empty at this year’s event unless Trump or a representative came to receive it in person—a gesture that now seems unlikely.\n\n---\n\n## A New World Order?\n\nThe 2025 G20 Summit may signal a broader shift in global influence. For decades, U.S. participation was seen as essential to the success of such gatherings. This year, however, the world moved forward without it.\n\nInternational media outlets have described Trump as “isolated” at the G20, with headlines noting that world leaders “united behind a joint declaration” despite U.S. opposition. European, Australian, and Canadian media have expressed frustration with Trump’s foreign policy and tariff measures, suggesting that American influence may be waning.\n\nAs one commentator observed, “It feels like the U.S.’s stature in the international community has fallen. A few years ago, if the U.S. wasn’t present, the summit would have failed. No country would have signed the declaration.”\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nThe new India-Canada-Australia partnership is expected to focus on attracting talent, advancing AI research, and securing supply chains for critical minerals. Canada has already launched a $1.6 billion program to fast-track H-1B visa holders, signaling its intent to attract skilled Indian workers—especially as the U.S. considers restrictions on such visas.\n\nLooking ahead, the 2026 G20 Summit in the United States will be closely watched. Will South African leaders attend? Will India and the U.S. finalize a trade deal? How will Russia be represented? The dynamics of global diplomacy are clearly in flux.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: A Mixed Legacy\n\nWhile the new trilateral partnership and climate declaration represent diplomatic successes, the absence of the U.S. casts a shadow over the summit. As one analyst concluded:\n\n> “From a humanity perspective, this development is not good. The G20 is a forum where countries should come together to solve global problems. Unfortunately, the dispute between South Africa and the U.S. has made this summit less impactful.”\n\nStill, the 2025 G20 will be remembered as the moment the world proved it could unite—even without its traditional leader.",
