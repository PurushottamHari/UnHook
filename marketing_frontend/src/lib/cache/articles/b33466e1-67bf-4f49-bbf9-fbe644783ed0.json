Galaxies will dissolve like dandelions in the wind, and black holes will evaporate in bursts of light like sad fireworks. The cosmos will become a forever-expanding, empty void where nothing happens. Forever. A place without life, purpose, or meaning. Lame and depressing.\n\nBut what if there’s a loophole in the laws of physics—a way for a future civilization to survive the death of everything? A way to go on having fun and internet arguments for googols of years, maybe even forever?\n\nTo understand how this might work, we need to travel far into the future and explore a radical idea: **Dyson’s Cold Thoughts**.\n\n---\n\n## How to Outlast the Stars\n\nLet’s travel **100 trillion years** into the future, when the last stars are about to die and the cosmos begins to turn dark forever. Here, in this dying universe, we find the **Noxans**—the last civilization still alive.\n\nCompared to them, we are cave dwellers. They have solved physics. They can do things we can only dream of. And yet, the same rules of reality apply to them as to us.\n\nThe Noxans like being alive. They don’t want to vanish with the last stars. So they enact a plan to keep consciousness around forever.\n\nThe first issue is **energy**.\n\nIf you want to keep a civilization running, you need a lot of it—but actually, not that much in cosmic terms. With just **five hours of the full energy emitted by the Sun**, we could power present-day humanity for about **10 billion years**.\n\nSo the Noxans harvest the last stars and build a gigantic complex of batteries around their home star. In principle, this energy could keep them alive for a few hundred trillion years—a long time, but not even close to forever.\n\nNow the hard part begins:  \nThe Noxans need to change the nature of life itself.\n\n---\n\n## Thoughts Cold as Ice\n\nBeing alive means doing things—eating, playing video games, and very importantly: **thinking**. And each of those things costs energy.\n\nBut how much energy?\n\nEnter **Dyson’s Cold Thoughts**—an idea from a famous paper, here mercilessly simplified. In a nutshell:\n\n> The lower your temperature, the less energy it takes to do something.\n\nYour brain runs at about **310 degrees above absolute zero**—the temperature where nothing can happen anymore. At this temperature, your brain needs about **20 joules of energy** to think a simple thought that takes one second, like *“I should wear a funny hat.”*\n\nBut if your brain worked at colder temperatures—say, **155 kelvin** instead of 310—a few things would change:\n\n- You’d think at half the speed. The same thought would now take **two seconds**.\n- But the energy needed would **halve**, from 20 joules to only 10.\n\nIf Dyson’s Cold Thoughts are correct, then the colder you go, the less energy you need to think. At **one-tenth** your current temperature, the same thought would take **10 seconds** but require only **2 joules**.\n\nThis has wild implications.  \nIt means we might be able to play this game **forever**.\n\n---\n\n## Becoming Cold Minds\n\nCooling down a living organism isn’t easy. If we put you in a fridge, you’ll die from hypothermia. So the Noxans have to take a huge step: they must leave biology behind.\n\nThey transfer their minds into artificial brains—or better yet, become **completely virtual minds**, building a digital world as good or better than the real one.\n\nThis is getting pretty sci-fi, and to be fair, we don’t know how to build such brains or computers today. But remember: we’re **100 trillion years in the future**. The Noxans are desperate, and the laws of physics should allow this.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n- A massive battery with a huge but finite amount of energy.\n- A civilization of minds that can be cooled down.\n\nBut how do you stay around with limited energy… forever?\n\n---\n\n## The Eternal Cycle\n\nHere’s the core of the plan:\n\nEach time the Noxans get colder, they need **less energy to stay alive**. Sure, they’ll be slower—but that isn’t relevant to them. From their perspective, as long as they can keep cooling down fast enough, their battery’s energy is growing proportionally and could keep them alive forever.\n\nLet’s see how their plan unfolds.\n\n### Cooling Down\n\nAs the last star in the universe goes out and darkness falls forever, the Noxans activate their batteries and begin cooling their brains.\n\nHow do you cool down a light bulb?  \nYou unplug it so it can radiate away its heat.\n\nSo the Noxans **switch off their brains** and begin to hibernate. They enter a state with no activity, thoughts, or dreams—letting their “bodies” radiate heat away. When they activate again, they are colder than before. They think slower, and each thought uses less energy.\n\nThey enter a cycle of **cosmic days and cosmic nights**:\n\n- During the **days**, they are awake—doing all the things they enjoy: hanging out with friends, thinking, eating virtual cheeseburgers, simulating universes—whatever a Type 3 civilization finds fun.\n- During the **nights**, they are switched off, lost in dreamless non-existence, cooling down even more.\n\nAt first, the nights are short—only a few hours—and the days last millions of years. But warm things shed heat much faster than cold ones. Cooling from 300 to 299 degrees takes far less time than going from 100 to 99.\n\nSo as the Noxans get colder, the nights grow longer.\n\n---\n\n## How Long Could They Last?\n\nThe power of Dyson’s Cold Thoughts lies in how incredibly they **scale**.\n\nAfter **100 trillion years** of this cycle, the Noxans’ temperature has dropped to only **230 degrees above absolute zero**. A simple thought now takes **1.3 seconds** instead of 1. Each cosmic night is **400,000 years long**.\n\nBut even with slower speeds and long hibernations, the Noxans have experienced the equivalent of **76 trillion years of life**—over **5,000 times the age of the current universe**.\n\nThis is frankly unsettling.  \nWhat’s way scarier than being dead?  \nBeing alive forever.\n\nWe simply have no concept of how conscious beings would deal with the opportunity to live that long. Maybe the Noxans:\n\n- Delete their memories regularly\n- Create new worlds and new life\n- Decide at some point to sleep forever\n- Or just activate their pleasure centers and experience perfect bliss forever\n\n---\n\n## The Long, Long Future\n\nAs time passes, the universe keeps dying:\n\n- After **quadrillions of years**, the corpses of former stars—white dwarfs—turn yellow, then orange, then red, then black.\n- **Trillions of trillions of years later**, all galaxies have dissolved.\n- **Decillions of decillions of years later**, the first black holes evaporate.\n\nAnd the Noxans?  \nThey are still around.\n\nAt a chilling **10 quintillionths of a degree above zero**, they’ve become so slow that a simple thought takes **a trillion years**. They spend **99.999999999999999997% of the time hibernating**.\n\nBut for them, **nothing has changed**.\n\nIf you and the world around you slow down at the same pace, you don’t notice anything. Your conversations, thoughts, adventures, and experiences feel exactly the same as before. And while the cosmic nights are now a **quattuordecillion years long**, it doesn’t matter—because during the nights, the Noxans don’t experience anything. No matter how long the nights are, they pass in an instant.\n\nThe Noxans experience a perfectly fluid existence, using less and less energy with each cycle.\n\nAt this point, they have lived the equivalent of **4,000 trillion trillion years**. Their battery has only a tiny fraction of its original charge, but the Noxans now need so little energy that it seems larger than ever before.\n\nTrue eternity has just begun.\n\nOr has it?\n\n---\n\n## Can They Actually Live Forever?\n\nWhether Dyson’s Cold Thoughts can make you live forever depends on one thing:\n\n> Can you keep cooling forever, or does the universe force you to hit a true limit?\n\nThere are a few problems:\n\n- **Dark energy** might eventually set a temperature limit of one nonillionth of a degree above absolute zero. The Noxans will cool to that level after a **googol years**, but then they can’t cool further—and their battery will begin to run out.\n- **Quantum noise** might destroy their brains.\n- All matter may decay into iron, or **proton decay** may destroy all atoms.\n\nWe don’t know. Forever is a long time.\n\nBut even if the Noxans don’t get a true forever, if Dyson’s Cold Thoughts work, then within these googol years, their consciousness would experience the equivalent of **two trillion trillion trillion years**.\n\n---\n\n## A Final Thought\n\nThis may all seem far-fetched and hard to imagine. But the amazing thing is that, for all we know, the laws of physics don’t forbid life to adapt—even to a completely dead universe.\n\nAnd if that’s true, then life and consciousness aren’t just a brief accident in cosmic history. They could be the **final chapter of existence itself**—giving the universe meaning, purpose, and hope.\n\nMaybe forever.\n\n---\n\n*Want to explore more mind-bending ideas?
