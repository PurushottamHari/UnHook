  "content": "# Robert Greene on the Sublime, Near-Death, and the Mind\n\n## What Is the Sublime?\n\nThe sublime is a philosophical concept with deep historical roots, originating from the ancient Roman writer of Greek origin, Longinus, who authored the first tract on the subject, *Peri Hypsos* (“On the Sublime”). The term signifies something elevated, transcendent—an experience that lifts you beyond the ordinary limits of human life.\n\nRobert Greene reinterprets the sublime through a personal lens: **“Human experience always involves a limit.”** He envisions this limit as a circle—a boundary defined by cultural codes, conventions, and habits that govern how we think and behave. This circle can shrink under the influence of technology, social media, or personal rigidity. The sublime, then, is **an experience that transports you outside that circle**—not just in behavior, but in thought.\n\n> “People don’t realize that your thinking patterns are conditioned by your culture. We live within a culture just like a fish lives in the ocean. We don’t see it; we can’t see it from a distance, but it tells us how we think, how we look at the world.”\n\nGreene’s upcoming book, *The Laws of the Sublime*, is structured like a clock with 12 chapters, each exploring a different facet of transcendent experience—culminating in a final chapter on death.\n\n## A Brush with Death: When the Abstract Becomes Real\n\nTwo months after finishing his previous book, *The Laws of Human Nature*—which included a chapter on death—Greene suffered a severe stroke. He came terrifyingly close to dying. “If my wife hadn’t saved me,” he reflects, “I wouldn’t be here talking to you right now.”\n\nHis near-death experience was not the classic “light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel” narrative, but it was visceral and transformative. While in a coma, he felt his bones dissolving, as if returning to the earth. He recalls a strange taste, indescribable sensations—a rawness that intellectual understanding could never capture.\n\n> “When I wrote about death in *Human Nature*, it was still abstract to me. Now it is not a concept. It’s a very physical feeling. When I look out the window, I know how close I came... I would be underground. The worms would be eating me. It’s a whole different relationship.”\n\nThis confrontation with mortality altered him profoundly. Where he once saw people walking dogs or jogging as ordinary, he now sees them as “free animals”—while he, physically limited, observes from a “cage.” Yet, he believes **they are more imprisoned than he is**, because they take their freedom for granted.\n\n## The Sublime: A Mix of Pleasure and Pain\n\nThe sublime is not merely “awesome” or “beautiful” in the colloquial sense. Its Latin root—*sublimis*—means “up to the threshold.” You stand at the door of death and peer through.\n\nIn the tradition of Kant and Edmund Burke, the sublime is a **peculiar mix of pain and pleasure**. Two contrary emotions experienced simultaneously create a “vibratory effect” in the brain, moving between awe and terror.\n\n> “A common experience of the sublime is a sense of the cosmos—how vast things are, how endless time is. But at the same time, it’s kind of painful. Like my life is so short... I’m essentially meaningless. Your brain is vibrating between pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain.”\n\nBurke, for instance, saw horror as sublime: Gothic novels terrify, but you remain safe. Romantic poets felt it atop mountains—awed by nature’s grandeur, humbled by their own insignificance.\n\nEven ecstatic religious experiences—like those of St. Teresa of Ávila—are not purely blissful. They are tinged with the pain of returning to the mundane. **There is no unadulterated sublime.**\n\n## Psychedelics, Near-Death, and the Filtering Brain\n\nGreene draws parallels between near-death experiences and psychedelic journeys—both of which dissolve the brain’s “filtering mechanism.”\n\n> “The brain is a filtering mechanism that narrows down what we experience. If we were open to everything going on around us, we’d be overwhelmed.”\n\nUnder psychedelics or in near-death states, these filters drop. Colors intensify, senses merge, and the mind opens to realities normally hidden. Aldous Huxley described this as accessing the “Mind at Large”—a consciousness greater than our own.\n\nRemarkably, brain scans of people on psychedelics show *decreased* neural activity—suggesting the brain normally *restricts* experience rather than producing it.\n\nNear-death experiences take this further. People declared clinically dead—heart stopped, brain inactive—report vivid, coherent experiences. Greene cites the work of researchers like Dr. Bruce Greyson (author of *After*), who documents cases where individuals accurately describe events they couldn’t possibly have witnessed—a phenomenon known as **veridical near-death experiences**.\n\n> “If your brain is dead, not operating, but your mind is operating, that clearly indicates that the mind is not the brain. But what is it? I don’t know.”\n\n## Ancient Wisdom and the Hunger for the Sublime\n\nThroughout history, humans have sought the sublime through ritual, drugs, and extreme practices. Ancient initiation rites involved torture, sensory deprivation, or psychoactive substances to induce rebirth. The Aztecs venerated decay and waste as sacred. Pagans saw gods as energies, not personalities.\n\n> “We are hungry for that experience. We can’t get it from science, we can’t get it from our crap culture... That’s why people are turning to drugs, to psychedelics. There’s a deep hunger for it because it’s embedded in human nature.”\n\nGreene believes this longing is innate. Cave paintings from 30,000 years ago were not just art—they were multisensory rituals designed to evoke the sublime.\n\n## False Sublime vs. True Sublime\n\nModern culture offers **false sublime** experiences: alcohol, pornography, shopping, Marvel movies. These provide jolts of transcendence but are passive, addictive, and controlled by external forces.\n\n> “The sublime is an act of will. It’s not like somebody giving it to you... It’s something that comes from deep within. You’re generating it. You’re cultivating this emotion.”\n\nTrue sublime experiences—whether through meditation, nature, art, or confronting mortality—are active, intentional, and inwardly generated.\n\n## How to Cultivate the Sublime\n\nGreene’s book includes practical exercises to help readers access the sublime in daily life. For example:\n\n- **Think like the Aztecs**: See waste and decay as sacred. Reverse your perspective—the low is high.\n- **Contemplate the cosmos**: Look at the sun or moon and grasp that you’re standing on a rock orbiting a star. Feel the strangeness.\n- **Study history**: See the familiar and the alien in past cultures. Feel the dreamlike quality of time.\n- **Meditate**: Zen practice, which Greene does daily, can quiet the mind and open the doors of perception.\n\n## The Mind Beyond the Brain\n\nGreene remains agnostic but open-minded about the nature of consciousness. He rejects rigid materialism:\n\n> “We’re so caught up in what we can see... But the human experience involves a lot of what is completely invisible. Ideas, symbols, communication—none of that is material.”\n\nHe urges intellectual humility: “Physicists, the smartest people on the planet, have come to the conclusion of how much they don’t know... Why should we be reducing everything to a cliché?”\n\n## Conclusion: The Sublime as a Way of Life\n\nThe sublime is not a rare, mystical event—it’s a potentiality embedded in human consciousness. It is the antidote to a culture that reduces life to algorithms, clicks, and consumption.\n\n> “I want to blast your brains open... I want to give you a firehose hitting your brain. You can’t possibly think you know what’s actually going on. It’s a mystery.”\n\nThrough his book and his own journey—from stroke survivor to seeker—Robert Greene invites us to step outside the circle, peer through the door of death, and reclaim the awe that makes us human.\n\n---\n\n*This article is based on a conversation between Robert Greene and Alex O’Connor.
