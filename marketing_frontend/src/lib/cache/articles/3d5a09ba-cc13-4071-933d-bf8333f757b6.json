It’s a question that strikes at the very geometry of our solar system. As astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains on Star Talk, the reason boils down to a simple but profound cosmic misalignment.\n\n“The moon orbits in a plane that is tilted to the ecliptic,” Tyson clarifies. The ecliptic is the apparent path the Sun takes across the sky throughout the year. “You can only get an eclipse if both the Sun and the Moon are in the same place, in their tilted orbits.”\n\nIn other words, for a lunar eclipse to occur, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must line up perfectly. During a full moon, the Moon is opposite the Sun. If it passes directly through Earth’s shadow, we get a lunar eclipse. But most of the time, the Moon’s orbit carries it either above or below that shadow.\n\n“You can have a full moon,” says Tyson, “but it's not crossing the ecliptic. So it's not going to enter our shadow.” The same principle applies to solar eclipses, which require a new moon that also crosses the ecliptic to pass in front of the Sun.\n\n“You need a new moon or a full moon coinciding with when they cross the ecliptic,” Tyson summarizes. “And so that doesn't happen every month.”\n\n## A Universe of Constant, But Not Daily, Drama\n\nIf the Moon’s orbit were perfectly aligned with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, we would indeed have a lunar eclipse every full moon and a solar eclipse every new moon. But our cosmic neighborhood is more dynamic.\n\n“If they were always in the same plane,” Tyson muses, “then it would happen that way. Every month we'd have a total solar eclipse.” He even references the sci-fi epic *Dune*, where eclipses are so common they become mundane. “It was not even interesting anymore because it was a kind of a daily phenomena. It's like a sunrise at that point.”\n\nWhile this might sound like a celestial disappointment, it’s what makes eclipses special. They are events to be anticipated and planned for, not taken for granted.\n\n## Lunar vs. Solar: An Eclipse for Everyone\n\nTyson also highlights a key difference between the two types of eclipses that makes lunar events particularly democratic.\n\n“In a solar eclipse, you have to be on the spot on Earth where [the] moon shadow drags across Earth's surface,” he explains. “If you're not in that spot, you're not going to see the eclipse.” This creates narrow paths of totality that eclipse chasers travel the world to experience.\n\nA lunar eclipse, however, is a show for half the planet. “Whereas in a lunar eclipse, the moon is entering Earth's shadow in space. Anybody who can see the full moon will watch it enter Earth's shadow. The entire half of the Earth that faces the moon will see a lunar eclipse.”\n\nHe adds a fascinating statistical tidbit: “Lunar eclipses are slightly, last I remembered, slightly less common than solar eclipses, but everybody gets to see it. You don't have to travel.” It’s a small kindness from the cosmos—a spectacular event shared by billions simultaneously.\n\nSo, the next time you mark your calendar for a lunar eclipse, remember you’re witnessing a precise celestial alignment, a beautiful exception to the monthly rule, made possible by the elegant, tilted dance of the Moon around our world.",
