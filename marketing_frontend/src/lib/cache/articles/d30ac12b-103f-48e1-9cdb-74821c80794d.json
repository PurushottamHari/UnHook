  "content": "**Understanding Toxic Parenting and Its Effects on Children**\n\n---\n\n### The Two Kinds of Relationships in Life\n\nEvery person forms two kinds of relationships in their life. One is by choice—like friendship. Who will be their friend? Who won’t? That depends entirely on the individual’s will. But at the same time, who will be their parents? Who will be their siblings or relatives? That doesn’t depend on their choice. They are born into a family and automatically receive parents, siblings, and relatives. In that space, their will doesn’t apply.\n\nFrom a child’s perspective, parents are no less than gods. That’s why it’s often said: there’s no need to go to a temple or a mosque. If a child serves their parents with complete devotion until the end, that child will attain salvation.\n\nFrom the parents’ perspective, there’s no greater joy than their child. That’s why it’s said: parents can fight and win against anything in the world, but they lose to their own child. For parents, raising a child is the most rewarding experience—but at the same time, it’s also very challenging.\n\nWhy? Because parents want to give their child every comfort, ensure they face no hardship, but they also have to maintain a balance so the child doesn’t spoil, develop bad habits, and grows up to be a responsible and independent individual.\n\n---\n\n### When Good Parenting Turns Toxic\n\nWhen we talk about parenting, parents are often extremely sensitive toward their children. Just to protect them, they sometimes become **overprotective** or **oversensitive**. During parenting, when they become too controlling, constantly criticize, fight with each other, or when such behavior is part of their nature or personality—what happens? Good parenting gets converted into **toxic parenting**.\n\nToday, we’ll explore:\n- What is toxic parenting?\n- What effects does it have on children?\n- How to deal with the issue of toxic parenting.\n\n---\n\n### Types of Toxic Parenting\n\nToxic parenting comes in many forms. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n#### 1. Controlling and Authoritarian Parenting\nThese parents enforce rigid rules. The word *authoritarian* itself suggests they want to control their children in every sense—giving no independence. What clothes they wear, how they talk, behave, where they go, whom they talk to, what they eat—everything is controlled. No autonomy, no independence.\n\n#### 2. Manipulative Parenting\nIn many families, parents emotionally manipulate their children. They might say, *“We’ve done so much for you—can’t you do this for us?”* They distort reality—a form of **gaslighting**. The child starts believing their parents have sacrificed immensely, and they begin sacrificing their own needs in return.\n\n#### 3. Physically Abusive Parenting\nHere, parents frequently resort to hitting the child. Research shows this is especially common in metropolitan nuclear families, where kinship systems break down. Spouses become overly dependent on each other, expectations aren’t met, and frustration leads them to vent their anger on the child.\n\n#### 4. Verbally Abusive Parenting\nConstant criticism, naming, shaming, pinpointing every small mistake. The child isn’t allowed to enjoy their childhood. They’re always under scrutiny.\n\n#### 5. Overprotective and Helicopter Parenting\nThis is a widely used term: **helicopter parenting**. It means you’re micro-managing your child’s life—hovering over them everywhere. Whether they’re playing, studying, or with friends—you’re there. You don’t let them become independent. If you always practice helicopter parenting, the child never develops coping skills.\n\n#### 6. Narcissistic Parenting\nHere, parents see the child as an extension of themselves—but in a negative sense. They offer **conditional love**: *“I’ll love you only if you fulfill my expectations or satisfy my ego.”* They fully control the child and often put all blame on them when things go wrong.\n\n#### 7. Parentification (Role-Reversal Parenting)\nThis is also called **role-reversal parenting**. Here, parents expect the child to take care of everything—as if the child should become the parent. The child takes on all responsibilities early and loses their childhood entirely. This is commonly seen in children forced into labor.\n\n#### 8. Neglect and Emotionally Unavailable Parenting\nA child needs a lot of affection, attention, and love. Research shows that if a child doesn’t receive love during the initial stages of life, they won’t grow into a trusting individual. Parents who don’t give this emotional support engage in a form of toxic parenting.\n\n#### 9. Competitive and Comparison-Based Parenting\nThese parents constantly nag and compare their child with others. They make the child’s life miserable. Even if the child achieves something, they don’t celebrate it—instead, they find flaws: *“Why didn’t you come first?”* This breeds perfectionist tendencies in the child.\n\n#### 10. Inconsistent and Unpredictable Parenting\nThese parents keep changing rules unpredictably. One day, TV is allowed until 9 PM; the next, it’s banned after 6 PM. Their behavior is erratic—sometimes calm, sometimes suddenly angry. This creates emotional and psychological distress. The child never experiences stability and struggles to become a reliable person.\n\n---\n\n### Traits of Toxic Parents\n\n- **Overreacting to small issues** – spilling water, not doing homework, not wearing certain clothes.\n- **Constant comparison** with others.\n- **Dismissing the child’s emotions** – saying, *“Don’t cry, it’s not a big deal.”* Children seek emotional validation—if they don’t get it, they feel their emotions have no value.\n- **Expecting instant obedience without explanation** – e.g., *“Lower the TV volume,”* without saying why.\n- **Using guilt to control behavior** – *“We’ve done so much for you, can’t you do this?”*\n- **Not apologizing when wrong** – parents often feel saying sorry shows weakness, but it actually strengthens the relationship.\n- **Trying to control every aspect of life** – not allowing the child to make decisions, learn from failures, or become independent.\n\n---\n\n### Effects of Toxic Parenting on Children\n\nThe impact is often disastrous—psychologically, physically, and emotionally.\n\n- **Low self-esteem** – constant criticism makes the child start self-criticizing.\n- **Negative self-talk** – the child speaks poorly about themselves. As Bruce Lee said: *“Never speak bad words about yourself—words have energy.”*\n- **Anxiety and depression** – due to constant vigilance and pressure.\n- **Relationship problems** – if the child doesn’t experience emotional stability at home, how can they build stable relationships later with a spouse, siblings, or friends?\n- **Emotional dysregulation** – if parents can’t control their anger, the child learns the same.\n- **Perfectionism and procrastination** – constant comparison leads to perfectionist tendencies, and perfectionists often procrastinate because they won’t start unless they can do something perfectly.\n- **Inability to apologize** – the child develops an egotistic attitude.\n- **Boundary issues** – if parents don’t respect the child’s privacy, the child never learns to set boundaries, even in professional life.\n- **Substance abuse** – to cope with a toxic environment.\n- **Career issues** – the child’s personality doesn’t develop fully; they face anxiety and low confidence.\n- **People-pleasing attitude** – always trying to make others happy at the cost of their own well-being.\n- **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex PTSD** – from long-term exposure to stress, abuse, and anxiety.\n- **Anger issues** – inability to manage anger properly.\n\n---\n\n### How to Deal with Toxic Parenting\n\nIf you’re facing toxic parenting, here’s what you can do:\n\n1. **Acknowledge** that your parents’ behavior is toxic.\n2. **Set clear emotional boundaries** – decide which topics you won’t discuss.\n3. **Avoid trying to fix or change them** – you can’t change their behavior.\n4. **Create mental distance** – don’t engage in unnecessary arguments.\n5. **Build an alternative support system** – friends, kinship groups, mentors, teachers, therapists.\n6. **Don’t share everything with them** – toxic parents may misuse your vulnerability.\n7. **Recognize and break guilt cycles** – don’t fall into the *“I’ve done so much for you”* trap.\n8. **Plan for financial and physical independence** – take steps to become self-reliant.\n9. **Seek emotional support and therapy** – there’s no harm in seeking therapy.\n10. **Accept that minimum or low contact is sometimes necessary** – it’s for your protection, not disrespect.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nParenting is one of life’s most profound relationships—but when it turns toxic, the effects can last a lifetime. Recognizing toxic patterns, setting boundaries, seeking support, and striving for independence are essential steps toward healing.\n\nRemember: saying sorry isn’t weakness—it’s about strengthening your bond. Let children take decisions, let them fall—they will rise again. You can’t control every aspect of their life. Don’t indulge in helicopter parenting.\n\nLet’s strive for a parenting style that nurtures independence, emotional stability, and respect—so every child can grow into a confident, well-rounded individual.\n\n---\n*Study IQ: Your selection, our mission.*",
