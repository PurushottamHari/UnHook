  "content": "### When a Guru Becomes Imperfect: Spiritual Warning Signs\n\nIn the journey of spiritual seeking, the relationship between a disciple and their guru is often considered sacred—a bond built on trust, guidance, and the shared aspiration for enlightenment. But what happens when that bond begins to fray? When the guru, once a beacon of light, starts showing signs of imperfection or even exploitation?\n\nA poignant question was recently raised: “My guru has grown old, and he calls me to his ashram, but I am unable to go. What should I do?”\n\nThe response offered was both direct and deeply insightful—a set of spiritual warning signs that every sincere seeker should recognize.\n\n---\n\n#### 🚩 The Guru Starts “Calling Out” to You\n\nWhen a guru begins to *insist* that you come—summoning you repeatedly, almost demanding your presence—it may be time to pause and reflect. As the speaker noted:\n\n> “When the guru starts calling out to you insistently, that is the time to walk away.”\n\nA true guide leads through silence, wisdom, and presence—not through pressure or emotional appeals. If you feel you are being “called” in a way that feels more like a summons than an invitation, the guru may no longer be acting as a spiritual guide, but as a figure seeking validation or control.\n\n---\n\n#### 🚩 When the Guru Uses You for Personal Tasks\n\nAnother clear red flag emerges when the guru begins to use disciples to fulfill personal or organizational agendas:\n\n> “When the guru starts getting their personal work done through you, or makes you feel that you *must* attend their satsang, be in their company, or visit the ashram—that guru is no longer a guru.”\n\nAt that point, the speaker warns, the guru is no longer leading you from darkness to light. Instead, they have themselves “drowned in darkness.” The relationship shifts from one of liberation to one of transaction—or worse, dependency.\n\n---\n\n#### 🚩 When the Guru Asks You to “Bring a Crowd”\n\nPerhaps one of the most telling signs of a guru’s fall from grace is when they begin to focus on numbers—on crowds, influence, and visibility:\n\n> “If a guru says, ‘I am arriving at such-and-such place—bring 50–100 people, bring your friends, bring that person…’ When the guru’s intention becomes like a political rally, then that guru and that institution have nothing left to do with spirituality.”\n\nThe shift from inner transformation to outer spectacle is a profound departure from the essence of spiritual teaching. A true guru does not need an audience—they serve those who are ready, whether they are one or one thousand.\n\n---\n\n#### 🧘 A Story of Seeking an Elderly Guru\n\nThe speaker shared a revealing anecdote:\n\n> “I knew someone who said, ‘Swamiji, I was always in search of an elderly guru.’ Why? Because his logic was: ‘I will take initiation from him, and then he will leave his body. I won’t have to see him, I won’t have to meet him, no negative feelings will arise in my mind. I will always hold the highest regard for him.’”\n\nThere is a certain brutal clarity in this approach. If the guru is no longer physically present, there is no one to correct you, no one to disappoint you, no one to trigger doubt or disillusion. You are left with only the pure teaching—and your own practice.\n\nWhile this may sound cynical, it highlights a painful truth: the human tendency to pedestalize spiritual teachers—and the inevitable fall when they reveal their humanity.\n\n---\n\n#### ✋ When to Stop—Even Midway\n\nOne of the most compassionate insights offered was this:\n\n> “When your heart does not bear witness, you should stop right there. It is not necessary that you alone should burn in the fire of regret—thinking, ‘The fault is in me, the fault is in me.’ Stop. It’s okay. No big deal.”\n\nSo often, disciples blame themselves when the relationship with a guru sours. They introspect, repent, and agonize—convinced that their own inadequacy is the cause. But the truth is, sometimes the path itself has shifted. Sometimes the guide has lost the way. And it is not only permitted but necessary to pause, step back, and reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary: Trust Your Inner Witness\n\nThe relationship with a guru is meant to be one of the most profound and freeing connections in a seeker’s life. But it must be rooted in authenticity, humility, and truth—on both sides.\n\nWhen the call feels more like a demand,  \nWhen service turns into servitude,  \nWhen silence is replaced by crowd-building,  \nWhen your own heart hesitates—\n\n**Listen.**\n\nYour inner witness—the quiet voice of your own conscience—is your first and final guru. If it does not affirm the path you are on, do not force yourself forward out of obligation or fear.\n\nAs the speaker gently concluded:  \n> “Stop. It’s okay. No big deal.”\n\nThe spiritual journey is long, and there are many guides. But the true guru—the one who leads you toward light—will never ask you to betray your own soul.",
