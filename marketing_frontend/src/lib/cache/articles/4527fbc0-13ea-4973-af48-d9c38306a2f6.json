  "content": "# Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review: A Niche Contradiction\n\n**(upbeat music)**\n\nSo, I’ve been thinking about this concept a lot lately.  \nThere are tons of folding phones out now—it’s been a category for a little while—and we’re expecting a folding iPhone soon, which will probably reinvigorate the whole space. But here’s the thing: I actually don’t think the concept of a Pixel and the concept of a folding phone are really all that compatible. And you know what? That’s okay.\n\n---\n\n## The Pixel Identity vs. The Foldable Ethos\n\nLet’s break this down.  \nThe idea of a Pixel has become very specific over the past couple of years. It’s a **super smart phone**—not necessarily a super high-end piece of hardware. It’s never had the best screen, the best chip, the best battery, or the best cameras. Instead, it’s packed with clever software that the everyday person can appreciate. And more often than not lately, it’s also a pretty good deal.\n\nThen there’s the folding phone.  \nThis is inherently **niche**. It’s a premium-priced, premium-built piece of bleeding-edge hardware for people who want the absolute most from their phone. These are users who rely on their device so much that they want two different styles of phone in one—even if it costs $2,000.\n\nSo, Pixel and folding phone are like opposites. They’re at odds with each other.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Google from making another nearly $2,000 folding phone.\n\n---\n\n## First Impressions: A Contradiction I Like\n\nI’ve been using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and as someone who really likes Pixels *and* folding phones… I like it.  \nBut I also understand that there are very few people I can genuinely recommend this to.\n\n---\n\n## What’s New? The Hinge & The Screens\n\nThe biggest change versus last year’s Pixel Fold—no joke—is the **new hinge**.  \nIt’s been re-engineered to be gearless and much smaller. That means:\n\n- The bezel to the left of the cover screen is now much thinner.\n- The frame looks more balanced, with bezels closer to even all the way around.\n- The motion is smooth, with a satisfying, heavy resistance.\n\nIt’s a nice hinge. Shout out to the hinge engineers—the *hingeneers*, I guess.\n\nThis redesign makes room for the next best thing: **the displays**.\n\nThe outside cover display is now **6.4 inches** (a bit bigger than before) and noticeably brighter. One of my favorite trends in phones this year is the push toward 3000 nits max brightness—and this screen looks really good in basically any condition.\n\nOpen it up, and the inside 8-inch screen is brighter too.  \nNot much else has changed, though:\n\n- There’s still a selfie camera cutout in the corner.\n- The bezels are still… *aggressively medium*.\n- The crease is still very visible, and you can easily feel it with your finger—though you kind of learn to live with it over time.\n\n---\n\n## Pixelsnap: A Game-Changer\n\nThe next best thing? **Pixelsnap**.  \nGoogle added magnets to the back of every Pixel 10 model, enabling Qi2 wireless charging and compatibility with literally any MagSafe accessory.  \nThat’s **elite**. It’s awesome.\n\nThey’ve made some of their own Pixelsnap accessories, of course, but the fact that every Pixel 10—including this foldable—can snap to a MagSafe charger, a dock, or anything else you might already own is so dope.\n\nEven though the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is heavier than the average phone, it stays put on a car dash mount with no problem. (That was one of my concerns coming in.)\n\n---\n\n## Performance & Battery: A Surprising Strength\n\nWe already knew the new **Tensor G5 chip** was kind of a letdown power-wise. It’s nowhere near the most powerful chips in phones right now. But Google paired it with **16GB of RAM**—which makes sense for a multitasking foldable.\n\nI was let down by the raw power, but I was **pleasantly surprised by the battery life and efficiency**.\n\nThe battery life on this phone is actually really solid.  \nWhen you use it closed a lot, it’s like a slightly thicker phone with a relatively small 6.4-inch display and a **5,015 mAh battery**. In that mode, I was getting around **six hours of screen-on time** every single day, no problem.\n\nOf course, your mileage will vary depending on how much time you spend unfolded—that chews through battery faster. But there’s no question: the extra room inside, thanks to the thinner hinge, went directly toward the battery. And it turns out to be a surprising strength of this phone.\n\nWorth it.  \nShout out again to the hingeneers.\n\nOh, and did I mention? This is the **first foldable ever to be fully IP68 water and dust resistant**. You better believe that’s also because of that hinge.\n\n---\n\n## The Pixel Experience: Closed vs. Open\n\nUsing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold **closed**, it’s pretty good.  \nEverything I liked about the Pixel 10 is still here:\n\n- All the Android 16 features\n- Material 3 Expressive aesthetics and animations\n- All the AI features: Call Screening, Now Playing, etc.\n\nIt’s a super smart smartphone, plus the new longer battery life.\n\nThen, **opening it up**—just like every other foldable—I get inspired to be way more productive. I start doing things I’d never do on a normal phone:\n\n- Organizing travel\n- Buying plane tickets\n- Side-by-side email triage with schedule building\n\nI get this itch to crush my to-do list because I have all this real estate.\n\nThat said, there isn’t anything particularly new or special about Android on this folding screen. You still get side-by-side apps, the taskbar, and the dock at the bottom. After that, it’s really just what you make of it.\n\n---\n\n## Where It Falls Short: The Hardware Trade-Offs\n\nHere’s the thing:  \nThis Pixel is clearly **still not a hardware leader**.  \nIt’s still kind of a **chunky foldable phone**—very noticeable when compared to newer ultra-thin folding models. It’s also noticeably heavier.\n\nThat slightly uncomfortable feeling you get while using the phone closed (which, let’s be real, is how you’ll use it a lot) is important. You could argue that’s a necessary sacrifice for such good battery life, but I think ergonomics are right up there on the list of most important things about a foldable.\n\nAlso, this isn’t some silicon-carbon battery that charges particularly fast.\n\nNewer foldables just **feel more pleasant to use**, even when open:\n\n- Lighter weight makes a difference\n- Thinner bezels make a difference\n- Lesser creases on other foldables make a difference\n\nThe cameras are essentially the same as last year—almost flagship quality, but a half-step down from the Pixel flagships. You get a little less detail, a little more noise, and a little less ability in low-light scenarios. The 10MP selfie cameras on the cover and inside screens? Not great at all, unfortunately.\n\nAnd while the Tensor G5 is decently efficient and everyday use is smooth, it doesn’t hold a candle to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for the most powerful tasks. (And that chip is about to be replaced by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5—I don’t know why it’s called that, but still.)\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts: A Good Phone, But Not in a Vacuum\n\nIn the competitive **$2,000 smartphone segment**, people rightfully start shopping around and expecting the absolute max from their phone—especially when it comes to hardware.\n\nThis phone, while really nice to use and enjoyable, and while it gets a lot of things right… is pretty clearly **not giving you the absolute max**, especially in hardware.\n\nHere’s another way of looking at it:  \nThis is a really good phone in a vacuum.  \nBut we’re not in a vacuum.  \nYou have to consider the other options—the ones that are really exciting and really pushing the limits. When you start comparing, you notice all the things that are great about those other phones.\n\nI’ll keep using this one, though.\n\nThanks for watching.  \nCatch you guys on the next one.  \nPeace.\n\n**(calm music)**",
