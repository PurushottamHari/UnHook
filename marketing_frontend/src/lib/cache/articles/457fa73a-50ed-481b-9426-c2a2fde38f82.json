  "content": "# India's Useless Jobs Crisis and the Path Forward\n\nIn today’s India, thousands of jobs are created every year—but many of them are fundamentally hollow. They offer neither productivity nor purpose. Welcome to what can be called **The World of Useless Jobs**.\n\nPeople are working. They are employed. But when you look deeper, you realize: the system has tasks, but not value.\n\nBritish anthropologist **David Graeber**, in his controversial book *Bullshit Jobs*, coined a term for roles that provide neither internal satisfaction to employees nor serve any real purpose for society. India, too, is now witnessing the rise of such roles—jobs that exist just for the sake of employment data, not meaningful contribution.\n\n---\n\n## The Blinkit Layoffs: A Case Study in Modern Job Instability\n\nIn early 2024, Blinkit—Zomato’s quick-commerce arm—laid off around 1,500 to 1,600 employees, roughly 5% of its workforce. Most of those let go were ground-level workers: delivery riders, warehouse pickers, and dark store managers, especially in cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.\n\nThe company’s official reasoning? Aggressive expansion. Over recent months, Blinkit spent over ₹600 crores opening new stores and offering discounts. When this model proved financially unsustainable, roles were declared redundant. Just like that—people were out.\n\nThis raises a basic but vital question:  \n**Are the jobs around you truly meaningful? Do they add real value? Or are people just running in circles inside a system that doesn’t care?**\n\n---\n\n## Where Are These “Useless Jobs” Coming From?\n\n### 🧑‍🌾 Agriculture: Disguised Unemployment\n\n- Nearly **45–50%** of India’s workforce is still employed in agriculture.\n- Yet, agriculture contributes only **15–17%** to India’s GDP.\n- Economists call this **disguised unemployment**—people are working hard, but if they stopped, productivity wouldn’t fall much.\n- Most farmers own small landholdings of 1–2 acres, making technology adoption and efficient farming nearly impossible.\n- Government schemes like irrigation projects, subsidies, and MSP continue, but on-ground productivity remains stagnant.\n\n### 🧵 Textiles: Low-Skill, High-Risk Roles\n\n- The textile sector employs around **4.5 crore** people directly or indirectly.\n- But productivity is far lower than in countries like China.\n- Most roles—stitching, cutting, packaging—are low-skill, repetitive, and easily replaceable by automation or cheaper labor.\n- A World Bank report warns that automation could wipe out **25–30%** of textile jobs in India.\n- Yet, automation is being delayed—just to keep employment numbers inflated.\n\n### 🛵 Gig & Delivery Work: The Illusion of Convenience\n\n- Platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, and Blinkit employ millions of gig workers—riders, packers, warehouse staff.\n- But these jobs come with **high pressure, tight deadlines, low pay, no health benefits, zero job security, and no career growth**.\n- They are temporary by design: hire when demand is high, fire when it falls.\n- This is the modern job system in a nutshell: **use and discard**.\n\n---\n\n## How Other Countries Are Doing It Right\n\n### 🇨🇳 China\n- Since the 1980s, China focused on **export-oriented manufacturing**.\n- It built special economic zones, invested in infrastructure, and attracted global brands like Foxconn and BYD.\n- Result: millions of high-skill jobs in electronics, semiconductors, and electric vehicles.\n\n### 🇻🇳 Vietnam\n- Invited foreign companies and focused on **skill development**.\n- Samsung and Intel set up factories—making Vietnam the **second-largest smartphone exporter**.\n- The government prioritized vocational training and English education.\n\n### 🇹🇭 Thailand\n- Shifted farmers from raw agriculture to **agro-processing and value-added products**.\n- Developed a strong automotive industry with brands like Honda and Toyota.\n- Now moving toward smart manufacturing under the **Thailand 4.0** policy.\n\nWhat’s common?  \n**Skill development, value creation, and a clear vision.**\n\n---\n\n## What India Can Do: A Three-Step Shift\n\n### 1. Upskill the Existing Workforce\n- Teach current employees new tools, techniques, or software.\n- Example: A textile worker learning CAD can move from stitching to design and prototyping.\n\n### 2. Reskill for New Domains\n- Prepare workers for entirely new fields.\n- Example: A delivery rider learning data entry or finance tools can transition into the BFSI sector as a junior analyst or support executive.\n\n### 3. Strengthen Emerging Sectors like BFSI\n- Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance are creating **structured, long-term roles**.\n- Roles like business correspondents, digital banking agents, and rural insurance advisors are growing—especially for women.\n- According to NSDC, the BFSI sector will demand **1.6 crore jobs by 2025**.\n\n---\n\n## The Roadmap for Job Seekers\n\nIf you’re looking to build a career in a growing field like finance or economics:\n\n- Start with a **strong academic foundation**—B.Com, BBA, or BA in Economics.\n- Join **internships or training programs**.\n- Prepare thoroughly for interviews—polish your résumé, practice mock interviews, and clarify concepts.\n- Aim for roles in **BFSI, upskilling, or reskilling sectors**—where jobs are not just numbers, but pathways.\n\n---\n\n## Changing the National Narrative\n\nWe must shift from **“jobs for the sake of jobs”** to **“meaningful work for meaningful lives.”**\n\nThe next time you ask someone what they do, don’t just note their designation. Ask yourself:  \n**Is their work actually improving someone’s life? Or is it just another useless job, keeping the illusion of the system alive?**\n\n---\n\n### Your Turn\n\n- Are you a job seeker?\n- Stuck in a role with no growth?\n- Looking to upskill or reskill?\n\nShare your perspective in the comments.
