  "content": "# How IPOs Are Harming India's Economy\n\n## The IPO Frenzy of 2025\n\nIn 2025, the term \"IPO\" has become a constant fixture in financial news. Headlines celebrate company after company launching their Initial Public Offerings, while others report on stocks plummeting post-listing. By October 2025, an astonishing **111 companies** have raised **₹2.2 lakh crore** through IPOs.\n\nAt first glance, these numbers appear positive—companies raising significant capital seems like a sign of a healthy economy. But beneath the surface lies a troubling reality that threatens to undermine India's economic foundation.\n\n## The Fundamental Flaw: Exit Strategy Over Growth\n\nThe core purpose of an IPO should be capital raising for future growth, development, and expansion. However, India's current IPO landscape has transformed this tool into primarily an **exit strategy** for existing investors, promoters, and founders.\n\nThrough Offer for Sale (OFS) mechanisms, these stakeholders are selling their shares to exit the market with substantial profits, boosting their bank balances rather than fueling company growth. This shift in motivation creates a dangerous precedent where the startup lifecycle becomes limited to moving from \"proof of concept\" to IPO, with little consideration for what comes afterward.\n\n## The Performance Reality: Most IPOs Underdeliver\n\nThe data reveals a stark contrast between hype and performance:\n\n- Among 25 tech startups that launched IPOs in recent years, **only four** have become multibaggers\n- **Eight** have become complete losers, trading below their IPO prices\n- The remaining companies have failed to generate average returns compared to other market opportunities\n\nThis performance gap directly results from weak fundamentals becoming apparent post-listing, or the IPO being primarily motivated by OFS objectives rather than genuine growth capital needs.\n\n## The Origins: Retail Investor Boom and Speculative Culture\n\nThe current IPO wave began in 2021, fueled by several converging factors:\n\n**1. COVID-Era Financial Influencing**\nDuring the pandemic, financial content creators encouraged moving money from banks to mutual funds and stock markets, creating a perception of wealth generation opportunities.\n\n**2. Lottery Mentality**\nIPO applications became akin to lottery tickets—investors applying with the hope of quick listing gains rather than long-term investment.\n\n**3. Company Opportunism**\nCompanies recognized the retail participation surge as the \"right moment\" to raise money or cash out existing investors.\n\n## The Valuation Crisis: Indian vs Global Realities\n\nThe most concerning aspect has been aggressive, unrealistic pricing:\n\n- **Global IPOs** typically maintain valuations at 6-7 times sales\n- **Indian IPOs** have reached 21-27 times sales multiples\n\nThis valuation gap reflects speculative hype rather than intrinsic value, creating inevitable post-listing declines.\n\n**Paytm: The Cautionary Tale**\nPaytm serves as the prime example, experiencing major declines post-IPO, exacerbated by RBI's actions against its payment bank and subsequent consumer base erosion.\n\n## Structural Incentives Driving Overvaluation\n\nThe system itself encourages inflated valuations:\n\n**Merchant Banker Commission Structure**\n- Fees are percentage-based\n- Higher IPO prices mean higher commissions\n- This creates direct incentive for unrealistic assumptions and aggressive pricing\n\n**Regulatory Gaps**\nSEBI maintains a hands-off approach to valuation control, believing \"the market will adjust itself.\" However, this laissez-faire attitude has allowed the problem to escalate.\n\n## The Tax Arbitrage Angle\n\nNitin Kamath of Zerodha highlighted a crucial structural issue: **India's tax system fuels the IPO rush**.\n\n**The Math:**\n- Profitable companies pay corporate tax (approximately 25-30%)\n- Dividend distributions attract additional taxation (approximately 30%)\n- Total tax burden can reach **50% or more**\n\n**Versus:**\n- Capital gains from share sales in loss-making companies: **15%** (long-term capital gains previously at 12.5%)\n\nThis creates significant tax arbitrage, encouraging even loss-making companies to launch IPOs as a tax-efficient wealth extraction method.\n\n## Artificial Profitability and Sustainability Concerns\n\nMany companies engage in last-minute cost-cutting before IPOs to artificially demonstrate profitability. The question remains: Can these companies sustain such performance long-term, or are they merely dressing up for their public debut?\n\n## The Consequences: Declining Investor Confidence\n\nThe fallout from overvalued IPOs is already visible:\n\n**Listing Gains Erosion**\n- 2023: Average listing gains of **27%**\n- 2025: Dropped to just **8.41%**\n\n**Reduced Retail Participation**\n- Subscription rates have declined from **33.71 times** to **27 times**\n- Retail investors are becoming increasingly wary of IPO investments\n\n## The Ripple Effect on Genuine Companies\n\nThe most significant long-term damage may be to fundamentally strong companies that actually need capital for growth. As investor appetite diminishes due to bad experiences with overhyped IPOs, even deserving companies may struggle to raise capital for:\n\n- Manufacturing expansion\n- Infrastructure development\n- Research and innovation\n\n## The Broader Economic Impact\n\nIf unchecked, this trend could lead to:\n\n**1. Capital Misallocation**\nExcess funds chasing overhyped IPOs while productive sectors remain underfunded.\n\n**2. Eroded Trust**\nRetail investor losses could destroy market confidence and participation.\n\n**3. Reduced Liquidity**\nLower retail participation means reduced market liquidity.\n\n**4. Reputation Damage**\nThe perception of insider enrichment over fairness could damage India's IPO market reputation globally.\n\n## The Regulatory Imperative\n\nWhile SEBI has advised merchant bankers to be more realistic with valuations, many argue the regulator needs to establish:\n\n- Basic valuation frameworks\n- Guiding principles for IPO pricing\n- Stronger oversight mechanisms\n\nWithout regulatory intervention, the concern will only escalate, with more companies bringing overvalued offerings to market next year.\n\n## The Path Forward: Returning to Fundamentals\n\nThe IPO process should remain a sacred milestone that companies aspire to after years of building strong fundamentals and sustainable profitability. Companies should launch IPOs when:\n\n- Fundamentals genuinely support valuations\n- The primary objective is growth capital, not exit strategy\n- Long-term sustainability is demonstrated, not artificially created\n\n## Conclusion: An Internal Bleeding\n\nIf this trend continues, Indian startups—which should be sources of employment, innovation, and wealth creation—could instead internally bleed the Indian economy. The capital that should flow to worthy companies through a healthy IPO market may be misallocated to overhyped ventures, ultimately damaging the ecosystem that genuine entrepreneurs and investors depend on for growth.\n\nThe solution requires collective responsibility: companies must prioritize long-term value over short-term gains, regulators must provide appropriate guardrails, and investors must focus on fundamentals over hype. Only then can India's IPO market fulfill its true potential as an engine of economic growth rather than a vehicle for wealth extraction.\n\n---\n\n*This analysis is based on current market trends and aims to educate investors about the importance of fundamental analysis in IPO investments.
