  "content": "## Gurus Give Life Recipes, Not Philosophy\n\nYou can’t understand a guru’s teachings intellectually. What I thought I heard Osho say, what I believed he meant then, is completely different from what I understand today. Why? Because if I tell you about the taste of \"sweet,\" but you’ve never actually tasted sweetness, you’ll only have concepts and philosophies about it. The moment you truly taste it, all those philosophies vanish. Then, and only then, do you realize which description came closest to the real experience.\n\nA spiritual teacher or guru isn’t discussing philosophy—they’re pointing toward something experiential. The mistake we make is treating sacred texts like the Gita, or any scripture, as philosophies. They aren’t. **They are recipes to be cooked, not talked about.**\n\n### You Don’t Debate Recipes When You’re Hungry\n\nWhen you’re holding a recipe, you don’t sit around arguing which one is right. You start cooking, because your body needs food—it doesn’t need a recipe. We treat scriptures the same way: we collect hundreds of \"recipes,\" then wonder why we’re still hungry, why we aren’t feeling what we hoped to feel. It’s because you haven’t eaten anything yet.\n\nThe need of your being is to **eat a truth**.\n\n> Jesus says, “Take, eat; this is my body… Drink from it, for this is my blood.”\n\nA real disciple doesn’t just understand the guru—they **eat the guru**. They consume that vibration, make it a part of themselves. That’s what transformation is. That’s the transmission that happens in *satsang*—true spiritual fellowship. You’re not there to listen to philosophy and then complain. You just **be** with the guru. They are vibrating at a certain frequency, and you tune yourself to it. Then you say, “Aha.”\n\n### The Guru Brings You into the Present\n\nFundamentally, the guru is trying to bring you into the present moment. For most of us, “the present” is just a concept. It’s difficult to arrive here because everyone around us is pulling us into stories of the future or the past. But when you’re near someone who is already fully present, it’s easier to get there yourself. The guru acts as a convergence point, pulling you back—back to here, back to now.\n\nAnd in that true “here and now,” there is no guru and no disciple. There is just presence.\n\n> Is that why we feel such a profound sense of peace and ease in the presence of a guru?\n\nYes. Because in that space, **you are with life, only**. You *are* life, but you’re not *with* yourself. Through the guru, you learn how to be with life. Then you realize: there is no “guru” out there. You are simply being with your own life. The guru was just the medium.\n\n### Enlightenment Isn’t a Job Title\n\nPeople have this idea: “Now you’re enlightened, you should open an ashram.” But no true guru ever *tries* to open an ashram. If it happens, it happens. If there’s a need. But the truth is, if you know how to look, **this—all of this—is already a huge ashram**. The whole world is the temple. We don’t need separate, smaller ashrams.\n\n### The Illusion of the Separate Soul\n\nIf the soul truly knew it came from the Creator itself, what would be the purpose of the entire *maya*—the illusion—of birth and death?\n\n> There is no soul.\n\nAt least, not a separate one.\n\nThink of it like this: You see a wave arise and think it contains a separate soul, a separate portion of water. But it *is* the whole ocean itself. This belief in a separate, individual soul is one of the basic dualities that misguides people. You think you have a separate soul, and I have a separate soul.\n\nIt’s just electricity. The same *Shakti*—the same divine energy—flows through you and through me. Do you think there are two separate electricities? No.\n\nThe sun shines, and its reflection appears in a pond with many waves. You see hundreds of little suns. Are there hundreds of suns? No. Similarly, what you call your “soul” is just the reflected light of the Divine in you. Calling it a “separate soul” is a misinterpretation.\n\n### What Creates the Illusion of Separation?\n\n> Words.\n\nWhen you say “soul” and “body,” you create an illusion. There is no soul *and* body. There is just **one presence**, which appears as the body, as the cosmos, as matter, as a stone, as a bird, as you, as a thought, as movement.\n\nSo, in the end, that one presence is playing all the parts. It is playing the part of the guru and the disciple, talking about itself.\n\n> It’s very narcissistic.\n\nThe ocean is telling the waves, “Please, talk about me.”\n\n[Laughter]\n\n[Music]",
