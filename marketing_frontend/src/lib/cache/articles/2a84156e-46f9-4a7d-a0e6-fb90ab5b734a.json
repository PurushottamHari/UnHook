  "content": "## India, Pakistan, and China Unite in Opposition to US Return to Bagram Airbase\n\nIn a rare geopolitical alignment, India, Pakistan, and China have come together to oppose the potential return of the United States to Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan. This unusual coalition emerged during the recent **Seventh Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan**, held in Moscow, where these three major Asian powers joined Iran and Russia in expressing strong resistance to any U.S. military re-establishment in the region.\n\n### A Historic Alignment\n\nWhat makes this development particularly striking is the joint stance taken by India, Pakistan, and China—nations often at odds with one another. As the host noted, “This is the first time that India, Pakistan, and China have stood together in opposition.” This unified front underscores the seriousness with which regional powers view the prospect of a renewed U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan.\n\n### The Moscow Format Meeting\n\nThe Moscow Format, established in 2017, serves as a crucial platform for regional dialogue on Afghanistan. The latest meeting, held on a Tuesday, saw participation from senior officials and special representatives from:\n\n- India\n- Iran\n- Kazakhstan\n- China\n- Kyrgyzstan\n- Pakistan\n- Russia\n- Tajikistan\n- Uzbekistan\n\nAlso present was **Amir Khan Muttaqi**, the Foreign Minister of the Taliban-led administration in Afghanistan. Muttaqi is scheduled to visit India until October 16, a trip that has already sparked domestic controversy due to the Taliban’s record on human rights and the notable absence of women in his press conferences.\n\n### Why Bagram Airbase Matters\n\n**Bagram Airbase** is not just any military installation—it holds immense strategic importance:\n\n- **Location:** Situated just 60 km north of Kabul, it lies in a highly centralized position.\n- **History:** Originally a Soviet airbase built in the 1950s, it later became the **largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan**, functioning as a de facto headquarters during the American presence.\n- **Withdrawal:** When NATO forces withdrew in 2021, the base was left abandoned, with significant military equipment left behind.\n\n### Regional Concerns: Stability and Sovereignty\n\nThe joint statement issued on **October 7** emphasized that any attempt to re-establish foreign military infrastructure in Afghanistan is “unacceptable” and does not serve the interests of **regional peace and stability**. Participants argued that while the U.S. presence from 2001 to 2021 occurred under different circumstances, a return today would drastically alter the regional dynamic—and not for the better.\n\nKey concerns include:\n\n- **Pakistan’s Dual Role:** Despite its participation in the joint statement, Pakistan remains a wild card. The country has previously engaged in “dirty work” for the U.S., including strikes in Kabul, and was implicated in harboring Osama bin Laden.\n- **China’s Proximity:** Bagram’s location places it uncomfortably close to China’s Xinjiang province. A U.S. presence there would enable direct surveillance of Chinese nuclear assets—a red line for Beijing, especially amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and the looming threat of conflict over Taiwan.\n- **India’s Strategic Calculus:** For India, a U.S. return could destabilize an already volatile region. While India participated in the Moscow meeting and supports the statement, it remains wary of Pakistan’s unpredictable behavior.\n\n### The U.S. Position and Broader Implications\n\nFormer U.S. President **Donald Trump** has expressed interest in retaking Bagram, citing its strategic value in countering Chinese influence. U.K. Prime Minister **Keir Starmer** has also voiced support for regaining the base, warning that “bad things will happen” if the Taliban continues to defy international expectations.\n\nHowever, analysts question the feasibility of such a move. Sending U.S. troops back to Afghanistan is politically fraught, and the U.S. may instead opt to use Pakistan as a proxy—a scenario that further complicates regional trust.\n\n### The Taliban’s Stance and International Recognition\n\nThe Taliban, represented by Muttaqi, used the Moscow Format to appeal for international recognition. While Russia has already recognized the Taliban government, other nations—including India—remain hesitant. The Taliban’s desire for legitimacy clashes with its domestic policies, particularly concerning women’s rights, which remain a major sticking point for the international community.\n\n### Conclusion: A Fragile Consensus\n\nThe joint opposition to a U.S. return to Bagram represents a fragile consensus among traditionally rival nations. While they agree on this issue, underlying tensions—especially between India and Pakistan—remain unresolved. As one observer noted, “The situation will become very dangerous if America returns,” highlighting the high stakes for all involved.\n\nThe outcome of these consultations, especially following Muttaqi’s visit to India, will be closely watched. For now, the message from Moscow is clear: regional powers are determined to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a theater for great power competition.\n\n---\n*What are your thoughts on this unprecedented alignment?
