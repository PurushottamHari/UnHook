As astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson observes on Star Talk, \"We have no idea what happens after death. So nothing can be spookier.\" This fundamental uncertainty about life's boundaries forms the bedrock of our fascination with monsters.\n\n\"The one moment they're talking, they're breathing, they're whatever, they're holding your hand,\" Tyson continues. \"Next moment they're not.\" This abrupt transition from living to non-living represents one of humanity's greatest mysteries—and our monsters emerge from this very uncertainty.\n\n## The Historical Roots of Monster-Making\n\n### From Unknown Animals to Legendary Beasts\n\nProfessor Charles Liu, joining Tyson and comedian Matt Kersian on Star Talk, explains how monsters often begin as misunderstood natural phenomena. \"Monsters to maybe actual animals in our environment that we didn't know much about and only showed up at night, maybe had beady eyes and people they maybe they worked their way into legends as monsters.\"\n\nLiu points to historical examples like dinosaur skeletons emerging from eroded cliff faces that ancient people might have interpreted as dragon remains. \"Human nature makes us think about monsters because when we have something that's unknown and we fear it, we want to explain it. We want to put it in a context.\"\n\n### Cultural Variations in Monster Perception\n\nThe conversation reveals fascinating cultural differences in how monsters are perceived. While European dragons are typically menacing creatures, Asian dragons often represent nobility and helpfulness. Liu shares a Chinese zodiac story where the dragon, despite being powerful enough to win a race, helps a rabbit cross a river first—demonstrating kindness over competition.\n\nThis cultural distinction extends to modern interpretations. As Tyson notes, \"On Sesame Street, the puppets, muppets were all called monsters.\" These \"lovable monsters\" teach children letters and numbers, completely redefining what monstrosity means.\n\n## Godzilla: The Atomic Age Monster\n\n### More Than Just a City-Destroyer\n\nGodzilla, the longest-running movie franchise spanning 70 years, represents perhaps the most culturally significant monster of the modern era. But as Liu explains, Godzilla's meaning transcends simple destruction.\n\n\"In Japan, within 10 years of the dropping of the atomic bombs, Godzilla shows up as a radioactively influenced created—the radioactivity created him.\" This timing is no coincidence. Japan, the only country to experience atomic weapons used against its population, processed this trauma through storytelling.\n\n\"Again, it's a way of sort of embodying your fears and the worst things that have happened to you,\" Liu observes. \"And personifying them.\" Godzilla became a manifestation of nuclear anxiety, environmental degradation, and the unintended consequences of human technological advancement.\n\n### The Evolving Role of Godzilla\n\nInterestingly, Godzilla's role evolved over time. Initially a destructive force representing nature's retaliation against human hubris, Godzilla eventually became a protector against greater threats. \"Monsters like Godzilla, which wiped out cities in early episodes or early movies, wound up saving humanity more than once,\" Liu notes, including against humans creating new monsters through pollution.\n\n## The Physics of Impossible Creatures\n\n### Why Godzilla Couldn't Actually Exist\n\nTyson raises a crucial scientific point about giant monsters: \"To be that large, yet that nimble—you can't do that. No, it's physically impossible.\"\n\nLiu explains the scaling problem: \"If I double in height, I will actually increase by a factor of eight in volume. So I would be eight times heavier. That means my legs have to support eight times the weight.\" For a creature like Godzilla, estimated at 400 feet tall, \"all known bone would shatter, all known muscles would tear. He would just be a blob of protoplasmic stuff because he couldn't support himself.\"\n\nThis physical limitation doesn't diminish these monsters' cultural power but highlights how they represent fantasies of overcoming natural limits.\n\n## Sympathetic Monsters and Human Hubris\n\n### King Kong: The Tragedy of Nature Exploited\n\nLong before Godzilla, King Kong presented a different kind of monster—one more sympathetic than terrifying. As Liu describes, \"A giant monkey ape chimp type creature who was benign and perfectly friendly and was living on a skull island and doing great until humans decided to take him to New York and show him off as the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\nKong's story becomes a tragedy about nature corrupted by human greed and spectacle. The famous final line—\"beauty killed the beast\"—masks the deeper truth that human exploitation destroyed a magnificent natural creature.\n\n### Frankenstein's Monster: Science Unbound\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein represents another sympathetic monster born from human ambition. \"Considered by many to be the first true science fiction novel in the European tradition,\" Liu notes, Frankenstein explores what happens \"when you try to violate nature because here was a man trying to reproduce, trying to create life, trying to be God.\"\n\nThe novel's scientific context matters—written when electricity was newly understood and experiments with galvanism showed connections between electricity and muscle movement, Frankenstein's creation method seemed plausible to contemporary readers. Today, with defibrillators using electricity to restart hearts, the concept feels even more relevant.\n\n## The Modern Monster: Zombies and Biological Fears\n\n### Why Zombies Dominate Contemporary Horror\n\nZombies have become the \"monster du jour\" in recent decades, from The Walking Dead to The Last of Us. Liu suggests their appeal lies in addressing our fundamental uncertainty about life and death: \"Things that are not alive fascinate us simply because we're not dead.\"\n\nThe zombie genre particularly excels at holding up a mirror to human behavior under stress. As Liu observes about The Walking Dead, \"What's the point of even trying to stay alive when you know you're going to become a zombie anyway? But that's sort of the existential question of what makes a monster and what makes a human.\"\n\n### The Last of Us: Environmental Monsters\n\nThe Last of Us represents a sophisticated evolution of zombie mythology, replacing supernatural causes with ecological ones. Liu explains the science behind it: \"Fungi can't survive parasitically in humans because we are warm-blooded. We have a higher body temperature than most fungi can tolerate.\"\n\nThe series posits that global warming enables fungi to evolve tolerance for human body temperatures, allowing parasitic species to jump to humans. \"The fungus is not evil,\" Liu emphasizes. \"The fungus is just a fungus. It's trying to make more fungi.\" The real monstrosity emerges from human reactions to this threat—\"kill and oppress and push away and isolate\"—revealing how fear brings out our worst instincts.\n\n## The Ultimate Monster: Ourselves\n\n### The Twilight Zone's Chilling Insight\n\nPerhaps the most profound monster story comes from The Twilight Zone episode \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" where aliens manipulate neighborhood technology to make residents suspect each other of being monsters. The episode concludes with the aliens observing, \"The humans will turn on themselves just by [creating fear]. So they will be easy to conquer.\"\n\nLiu summarizes the lesson: \"We are the monsters. The monsters in space in Monsters by Godzilla. The monsters that infect us with their fungal mycelium spores and stuff—they're just forces of nature. The thing that makes them bad is we is us.\"\n\n### From Fear to Familiarity\n\nAn interesting pattern emerges across monster genres: familiarity diminishes fear. Liu notes how vampires evolved from terrifying figures in Bram Stoker's Dracula to \"love struck teenagers\" in Twilight who \"glisten a little bit.\" Similarly, black holes transitioned from terrifying cosmic monsters to understood natural phenomena.\n\n\"This is the commentary about monsters,\" Liu observes. \"Once we become familiar with monsters, they're not so evil anymore.\"\n\n## The Scientific Approach to Monsters\n\n### Testing the Supernatural\n\nHumanity hasn't just feared monsters—we've tried to study them scientifically. Tyson recounts historical attempts to detect the soul: \"Everyone thinks you have a soul and there's science that can test those. Why not test your soul? X-rays can see through your body. No one else ever saw through your body. Now X-rays. So they get somebody dying on the bench and they waited for him to die to see if they saw something leaving his body with the X-rays. And they didn't.\"\n\nThis empirical approach represents humanity's attempt to understand the boundaries between life and death, natural and supernatural.\n\n### Carl Sagan's Dragon\n\nLiu references Carl Sagan's \"dragon in the garage\" thought experiment from The Demon-Haunted World, where an invisible, undetectable dragon becomes scientifically indistinguishable from no dragon at all. This parable illustrates the difference between scientific and unscientific monsters—the latter defined by their resistance to evidence.\n\n## Conclusion: Monsters as Mirrors\n\nReflecting on the conversation, Tyson offers a concluding perspective: \"I value anything that can bring insights to ourselves brought to you by others, brought to you by your own introspection. And it's pretty clear that all if all you do is tell stories about humans interacting with humans, it's going to miss an important dimension of how we might behave on the edges of our cell—and a monster will take you there.\"\n\nThe most valuable monsters, Tyson suggests, are those that \"earn the sci-fi label\" by incorporating real science before stretching beyond it. \"In the end, the monster will teach us about ourselves. And that is a cosmic perspective.\"\n\nFrom Godzilla processing nuclear trauma to zombies reflecting pandemic anxieties, our monsters consistently reveal more about humanity than about the creatures themselves. They represent our evolving fears, our cultural values, and ultimately, our ongoing attempt to understand our place in a universe full of unknowns.",
