2. The Problem With Feeds → Illusion vs Reality
Subtext: “Social, video, and news feeds — endless streams designed to grab your attention.”
   •	Visual: Dual-sided cards (front = felt benefit, back = hidden cost).
   •	Examples:
	1.	Front: 🧠 “I’m always learning something new.”
Back: “But how much of this sticks? Am I truly reflecting — or just skimming, collecting fleeting knowledge?”
	2.	Front: 🔄 “Endless scroll gives me choice.”
Back: “It sparks craving and leaves me empty. The more I scroll, the less satisfied I feel.”
	3.	Front: 🌿 “I feel happy and relaxed while scrolling.”
Back: “But am I running from my real emotions — numbing what needs attention? Who’s quietly keeping me hooked to this fleeting relief?”
	4.  Front: 🎭 “Feeds surprise me with exciting, edgy content.”
Back: “But much of it is engineered provocation — sexual, shocking, or agitating — designed to hijack emotion, not nurture focus or clarity.”
	5.	Front: 📰 “It helps me stay informed.”
Back: “But is it neutral facts, or am I being provoked constantly to react?”
	6.	Front: 🤝 “Feeds keep me connected.”
Back: “Yet in real life, I feel lonelier, more divided, subtly provoked — connection feels shallow.”
   •	Closing tagline: "Feeds feel like they serve us — but on retrospection, they quietly shape habits we didn't choose."
   •	Tone: Empathic mirror, not blamey.

4. The Transformation → Motivation
    •	Visual: Toggle component ("Before vs After").
   	•	Before: Feeds weren’t made for you — they were made to capture attention and turn it into a product. The result: overstimulation, scattered focus, and feeling pulled away from yourself.
