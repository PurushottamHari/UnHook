1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,240
As you keep aging, time keeps becoming

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,240
shorter. The western philosophy is very

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,599
simple. Time is linear. But when we talk

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,200
about time in sanata, time is

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,679
multi-dimensional. It keeps on changing.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,560
And a very practical example of time is

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,560
the three states of

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,840
consciousness. There is an understanding

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
in the Gita known as prasad buddhi.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,720
Buddhi means intellect. Prasad is

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
something that we go to the temple and

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,560
take. So whatever is happening in your

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,039
life, take it as a prasad from the

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,039
divine.

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Wow. How you understand maya is where

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,640
you'll go beyond time. Now suppose if I

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,120
tell that this is my glass. I have

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,840
associated with certain identity that I

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,559
am myself. This glass is mine. But the

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,039
problem is I don't realize in ignorance

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
that this is temporary.

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
Is behav and shiva one and the same? In

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
higher states they all are one. You know

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
when you start worshiping ship he's

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,680
bolat he's just when you chant and you

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
just surrender he will look after you.

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
He's one of those gods that you call out

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,519
he'll come first. When does he get

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,360
annoyed? I got an experience of his when

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
I was not doing a sad and then I

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
realized

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,479
that an enlightened being goes beyond

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,400
the gonas. He becomes a witness that is

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,840
called the turya. You are in a state

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,479
where you have no anxiety, no fear, no

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,159
mental issues. You are a perfect

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,600
instrument and you're experiencing

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,400
unconditional love. That is the reason

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,560
you do sad. Ma kali stands for past,

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,960
present and future. Maesneshwari stands

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,119
for space, the carnal points. So when

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,040
you do sadna, you realize that they're

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,510
taking you beyond space, time and

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:53,100
causation.

45
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:53,100
[Music]

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,280
The purpose of my career is to sit with

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,160
you Bhavesh by and talk about what the

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
world needs to listen to. Thank you

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,760
Arbay. I'm good. Thank you. I think that

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,720
um childhood is where a human mind first

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,959
understands the concept of

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,239
time. True. Would you like to talk about

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,680
childhood? Would you like to talk about

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
aging? Or would you like to begin with a

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
mantra? I'm I'm just throwing the ball

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
to you. Whatever you want to do. We will

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
begin with a mantra and of course we are

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,360
talking about Mahal. So we will pray to

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,160
him. Uh we will chant the verses of Rdri

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,440
and um of course we offer it everything

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,440
to him because he is Makal.

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,440
So, om.

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Sasha

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,680
Maha you bow on to him who's beyond

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,959
spaceime and causation.

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,200
J Mahal

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,360
Jakal. Yeah by coming back to time and

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,280
childhood. Uh how do we start?

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,760
Um I will start from the basics so that

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,159
we can go. It's totally in your quote.

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,159
Whenever we talk about time or whenever

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,760
the time topic comes up, first thing

73
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,560
that occurs to our mind is the fear of

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,519
death because with time there is an

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,080
expiry date and we are conditioned by

76
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
the society. So whenever a baby is born

77
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,879
or whenever someone comes into birth we

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
celebrate we are happy but at the same

79
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,760
time when that person or baby grows

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,560
older the time of death has also come

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,680
and the beauty is or maybe call it the

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,720
drawback that we are conditioned that

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,120
anything that we hold very close to us

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,360
with time that also has an expiry date.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,599
The beauty is that we cherish it but

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,720
with time we realize that has an expiry

87
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
date. But if you ask me what time is

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,959
from a spiritual point of view, again

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm juggling between practical and

90
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,680
spiritual, there is no time. Time is

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,760
just a concept that a mind has created.

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,920
Again coming back to this reality. Now

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,959
if you realize uh in our childhood time

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
was going very fast, very very fast. If

95
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
I tell I think I mentioned this last

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
time, if I tell a small boy or my cousin

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
or someone nephew that tomorrow we'll go

98
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,000
for a movie for him tomorrow is like oh

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,600
no tomorrow.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
But if the child likes eating a

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,040
lollipop, kadam time is just half an

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,440
hour becomes 2 minutes. Even for us, if

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
you like something, time runs. If you

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
don't like something, that same time is

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
like, oh

106
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,240
no. So the concept of time changes

107
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,800
accordingly. And as we grow older and we

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,280
look back, we realize life is just snap

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
and life is over. Yeah, I'd seen this

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,240
one graphic some time ago. Some time

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
ago.

112
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,639
uh it it showed the perception of time

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,880
for a child versus the perception of

114
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
time for an adult. So an easy way of

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,479
understanding that is I would ask the

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,440
viewers to go back to their second

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,520
standard second grade and that distance

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
of second to third grade or to fourth

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
grade felt like a lot like in your

120
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,919
fourth standard in your fourth grade you

121
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,000
look back at second grade as being ages

122
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,479
ago. True. Now switch to being 24.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,720
Age 24 is not too distant from age 22

124
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,960
even mentally speaking. True. But

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,039
actually if you quantify both it's the

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
same amount of time. True. The graphic

127
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,320
basically showcas time as being much

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,560
more stretched out in childhood. And as

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,639
you keep aging, time keeps becoming

130
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,639
shorter. True. I will throw more light

131
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,199
on it. The western philosophy is very

132
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
simple. Time is linear. Time is

133
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,720
straight. According to western

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
philosophy, we are born at A and we die

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,120
at B. For example, I take birth, I go to

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
school, I get married, eventually I'll

137
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
die. But in sanatan, the concept of time

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,800
is very different. We time according to

139
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,840
us is circular. That means in a year we

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,639
have 12 months. 1 minute has 60 seconds.

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,400
Everything goes on circular. And again

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
in that circle, you don't know where the

143
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,800
time starts and when the time ends.

144
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
However, in riguid beautifully time is

145
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,039
given a beautiful concept. uh it is not

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
a concept it is the understanding of the

147
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,000
rishies and they got it to us in a very

148
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,840
simple manner they have given axes

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,600
x-axis yaxis and z-axis and there is a

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,240
horse ashwa actually ashwa means a horse

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
but when you break down a means no and

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,120
swah means tomorrow that means there is

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,120
no tomorrow and there are horses running

154
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,600
spirally multiple directions going to

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,440
multiple locas so what we understand

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,039
from A to B is nothing. Time is

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,520
multi-dimensional. It keeps on changing.

158
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,600
And a very practical example of time is

159
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,080
the three states of consciousness which

160
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,680
is very very um we all go through it

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
though we are aware but we experience it

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,319
every day. For example, I'm in the awake

163
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,960
state. I'm enjoying this conversation.

164
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
Time is going very fast. If in this

165
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
conversation I am not connecting, time

166
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,800
will go very slow. I want to leave the

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
room. Then comes the dream state. Dream

168
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,599
state is very interesting because at the

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,280
moment suppose Arab I'm talking to you

170
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,400
and while talking you go to sleep now in

171
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,160
your sleep you are dreaming that you are

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,599
in Paris it's your world again there is

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,840
that space and time again you snap out

174
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,560
again you go to another dream where you

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,240
might be at Cargill saving someone but

176
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,759
when you wake up again you come in this

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,440
so the concept of time has changed

178
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,400
completely completely and in deep sleep

179
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,880
when we go you don't know where time is.

180
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,560
So the concept of time is so detailed

181
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,440
and it is so much to learn and

182
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,319
understand but our problem is we always

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,039
live in our past or 90% in the future.

184
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,199
So the concept of time is u very strange

185
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,080
because we are conditioned. Suppose if

186
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,479
someone is taking birth the time we are

187
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
born the concept of time comes into play

188
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,120
because everything works according to

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,599
space time and causation that is des

190
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,840
kalan nita we'll get there and now when

191
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,360
suppose I'm born I will go to school I

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
will get married I will learn eventually

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,080
I'll die. So the western concept of time

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,919
is that time is in one line it's linear

195
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
and once we are born everything will go

196
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
in straight line and it will come to an

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,440
end. However, when we talk about sanatan

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,640
time is very different. Everything is

199
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,479
circular. It goes round. For example, if

200
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,919
you talk about a year, it has 12 months.

201
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
If you talk about 1 minute has 60

202
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,560
seconds. So everything is round round.

203
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
Even everything even the weather is

204
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,760
going round. So the time is circular

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,440
where there is no beginning and no end.

206
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,440
But in higher states of consciousness,

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,000
as I mentioned, time is a mental

208
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,399
concept. We create our own time. We

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
create our own space but that doesn't

210
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
mean that we're not affected. Of course

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,000
in sad if you're high you can go beyond.

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,560
For example um if I've cut my hand I

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,399
will feel that pain and that burning in

214
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,360
that space and time or if emotionally

215
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm not I'll feel it. But how aware I am

216
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,120
and how I understand maya is where you

217
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,160
will go beyond time. How you understand

218
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
maya is where you'll go beyond time.

219
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,839
Yes. But I'm assuming this understanding

220
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,240
of maya takes very long.

221
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
Very very true. Because you know when we

222
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,120
are born the first thing that we are

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,440
conditioned is to give n and root to

224
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,600
everything. That is name and form.

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
Everything has name and form. One

226
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,800
second. Let's just sit with that

227
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,800
thought. You said something very heavy.

228
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,279
Everything has name and form especially

229
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,399
in your childhood. And whenever there is

230
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,600
name and form, it has an

231
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,880
expiry. I'll ask you something. Anything

232
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,880
from the childhood that has been

233
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,040
constant

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,000
materially. Do you remember anything

235
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,560
from a car to a cell phone to a watch

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
everything has an expiry date and we are

237
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,480
conditioned to give name and form and

238
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,680
that name and form is also the source of

239
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,160
identity and that is a problem because

240
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
we get so happy in that name and form we

241
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,720
don't realize that it is temporary.

242
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,079
Identity for what? Now suppose if I tell

243
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,440
that this is my glass I have associated

244
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,800
with certain identity this I am myself

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,040
this glass is mine but the problem is I

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
don't realize in ignorance that this is

247
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,600
temporary because one day the glass is

248
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,040
going to break one day I'm going to die

249
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
one day everything is going to come to

250
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
an end would you say that all these

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,320
identifications of your own reality lead

252
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,680
to ego growing in a human definitely

253
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,360
definitely you have said something very

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,600
beautiful called reality. Now

255
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,640
um I will throw some light on reality

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,399
and I think if you understand this you

257
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,120
have understood the crux of the rishies

258
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,440
and the teachings. What our rishies are

259
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,000
saying that reality is something which

260
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
never

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,240
changes and whatever in your life is

262
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,959
never changing that is the only truth

263
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,120
that is the only s for example let me

264
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,040
break it down in very simple language

265
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,399
um we'll take it in stages in different

266
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
states so that we understand what

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
reality is now if I ask you what is

268
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,040
reality for you

269
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,240
uh you will say that reality is being

270
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,480
here or reality is going back home or

271
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
reality is material, emotional,

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,240
whatever. What the rishies are saying

273
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,680
again, reality is that which never

274
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,800
changes. For example, simplifying

275
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,800
vanta, I am

276
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,920
hungry, I am

277
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,480
fat or I will go to Pune. This is what

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,680
we use in our language daytoday. Now

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,800
what rishies are saying, I am fat,

280
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,880
tomorrow I'll become thin.

281
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,160
I am going to Pune from Pune. I'll go

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,959
come back to Mumbai again. I like this.

283
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,200
Tomorrow I will not like it. So whenever

284
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,279
we say that I am my body, I am my mind.

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
I am my intellect. The rishies are

286
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,320
asking us is your body constant? No, it

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
is constantly changing. Is your mind

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,000
constant? It is running around in

289
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
multiple levels. Is your intellect

290
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,079
constant? No, you're evolving with time.

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
What is constant? The question comes.

292
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
That is the reason the concept of time

293
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,000
changes because the rishies are saying

294
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,920
and of course you will apply in sad also

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,560
there's only one thing constant in your

296
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,320
life that is the I

297
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,200
because whenever you are talking you

298
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,000
also say that I was hungry hunger has

299
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,519
gone I was feeling fat again the body

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,160
has changed that I is the only constant

301
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
if you start dwelling and start

302
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,839
practicing you will experience that time

303
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,839
is a mental

304
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,920
concept okay I'm just going to break

305
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
down what you said a little bit so that

306
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,120
I have clarity in exactly what you said

307
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,720
and then you correct me or agree with me

308
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,480
based on what I say um so when I look at

309
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
my hands and I'd recommend the viewers

310
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,519
do this as well these are the

311
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,320
limitations of your physical body this

312
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,839
is where your biology stretches to okay

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
if you go back into the memories of your

314
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,079
childhood it's that same brain and it's

315
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
those same eyes and the same retina

316
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,720
inside your eyes and that same

317
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
consciousness which was at work

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,000
absorbing and learning about life but

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
also you had a few good moments. You did

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
well in a football game. You did well in

321
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
your exams. You won a competition. It

322
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,079
made you feel great but somewhere you

323
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
identified more with yourself. You said

324
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
that hey I was able to do my hard work

325
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
got me here which it did definitely

326
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
there's an element of free will. So

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,399
you're saying that sanat and dharma

328
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
especially the rishies say that nothing

329
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,760
is constant. The suffering is not

330
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,440
constant. The good stuff is not

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,000
constant. Say that there's only one

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
thing constant. Whatever is changing is

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,519
Maya.

334
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,959
So eyes are changing, retina is

335
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,440
changing, hand is changing, the dose of

336
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,440
drug is changing, sexuality is changing,

337
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,000
emotions are changing. Whatever is

338
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,320
changing is Maya. Whatever is not

339
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
changing, that is the only reality.

340
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
There's a very beautiful phrase that all

341
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,920
of these are passing clouds. I am the

342
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,079
sky.

343
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,880
Wow. Okay. All of these are passing

344
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,600
clouds. I am the sky. That means my

345
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,839
emotions, my past, my present, my body

346
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,399
constantly is passing. I am that sky

347
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,560
which is infinite. And that eye is the

348
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,360
core of existence. It is a core of

349
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,240
sadna. It is a core of being. It is a

350
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,600
core and the birthright of humans. All

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,680
these conversations we've had over the

352
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
years on the show with everyone who

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,920
knows tantra, who's been on the show,

354
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
they talk about the fact that the only

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,800
thing you carry into the next birth is

356
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,760
your spiritual advancement. So you go

357
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,160
about your sadha. Yeah. Everything else

358
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,240
sheds off. Your health sheds off. Money

359
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,839
sheds off. Fame sheds off. But when

360
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,920
you're born again, you'll be blessed

361
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
with that positive baggage from your

362
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
previous book. Yeah. You know, very

363
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,240
interesting. Now when you're talking

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,839
about tantra, when we talk about maali

365
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
and

366
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,000
maeshwari, maali stands for past,

367
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
present and future. Maali stands for

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,440
past, present. Maeshwari stands for

369
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,040
space. The cardinal points. The what?

370
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,839
Cardinal points. Space. all the

371
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,560
directions. So when you do sadna, you

372
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
realize that they're taking you beyond

373
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
space. Time and causation. Why did you

374
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
name these two? Because of time and

375
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
space. Because of time and space. And

376
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,920
when we talk about time, of course there

377
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,760
is space. Of course there is. Wherever

378
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,000
there is time there is space. Because I

379
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,760
require certain time and space to reach

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
somewhere. So if I'm coming from here

381
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,160
till here, time is required and certain

382
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,360
space is captured. But even that is

383
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,519
changing. So with that knowledge if you

384
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,760
understand daties and do your sadna you

385
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,839
will realize that you're just evolving

386
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,000
on the

387
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,759
path okay wow a college kid that's

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
listening to this or a very young person

389
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,519
who's listening to this so someone who

390
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,399
actually does not have much spiritual

391
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,920
understanding yet what value are they

392
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,279
supposed to get from these concepts so

393
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
for them we will break down the

394
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,000
conversation as you mentioned if you are

395
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,160
someone new or a collegegoing remember

396
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,279
that there's only One duty that we have

397
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
that are the teachings on the Bhagat

398
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,720
Gita we have to give the best all the

399
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,639
time never forget that teaching rest all

400
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,360
will be taken care of secondly was

401
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,880
completely new into it there is an

402
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,720
understanding in the Gita known as

403
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,120
prasad buddhi prasad buddhi that means

404
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,399
buddhi means intellect prasad is

405
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
something that we go to the temple and

406
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,279
take so whatever is happening in your

407
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,480
life take it as a prasad from the divine

408
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,560
wow if you stick to these two principles

409
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
that I will give my best wherever I show

410
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,000
up and I take everything good, bad,

411
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,279
neutral as a prasad buddhi automatically

412
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
you will start moving ahead on your

413
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,519
journey. Because the concept of space,

414
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,360
time and causation is for high saddaks.

415
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,399
Vedanta is for high saddak but that

416
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,399
little knowledge should be there.

417
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,319
I have these two friends. Okay. Uh I'm

418
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,600
not going to name them but I feel they

419
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,880
are suffering a lot in their reality. Uh

420
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,079
and they're both good friends. uh they

421
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,120
both

422
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,120
deny any conversation related to any

423
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,400
aspect of God. They're open to spiritual

424
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,919
conversation. They would like to discuss

425
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,959
the concept of time, the concept of

426
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
psychology and they're both very

427
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
intelligent people but they deny God.

428
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
It's their conditioning from their

429
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,760
childhood where I don't know either one

430
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
parent was probably trying to force

431
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,120
religion on them or maybe the parents

432
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,039
were also cut from the same cloth. True.

433
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,640
And I want to introduce them to the

434
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,720
books of Om Swami. I want to introduce

435
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,480
them to your Instagram page. But the

436
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,880
moment they hear the word Kali,

437
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Shiva, the word Hindu. Yeah. And I'm not

438
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,520
this is not I'm not making this a Hindu

439
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,919
thing. Even if they hear the word

440
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,440
Christian, Muslim, whatever, anything

441
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,960
related to God, God. Yeah. Um there's a

442
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,039
part of them that immediately switches

443
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
off. They're like, "Oh god, this is a

444
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,960
religious conversation. I don't want

445
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,480
to." M you know so that is the beauty of

446
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,039
sanatan. Uh have you heard about

447
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,200
Maharishi Patanjali? Yes he is the

448
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,760
greatest psychologist and you know he is

449
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
the one who dissected the mind. So for

450
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,919
people who don't understand gods or

451
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,080
scared or don't have knowledge he said

452
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,720
something very very clear and he spoke

453
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,559
about human behavior. He said in order

454
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,320
to evolve you have to understand your

455
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,919
behavior. M and he said u so-called

456
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,039
behavior is dominated by the threeas

457
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,799
satwara you know about it now there are

458
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,919
different states that you go through

459
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,160
okay shipa vishupta muda ikagra and noda

460
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,200
okay shipa is when you are

461
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,760
hyperactive you're hyperactive and

462
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,080
you're running around rajas is at peak

463
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,919
that means you can't even sit at one

464
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
place and you know these people even

465
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,679
they don't believe this they're going

466
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,640
through it everyone is going through it.

467
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,360
Then he's saying there's another

468
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,400
category where at times you are

469
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,960
concentrated but again the mind runs. It

470
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,799
goes for example for one nancond I'm

471
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
aware about something again my mind is

472
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
completely gone. For example I'm craving

473
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,799
for a coffee I have a sip of coffee and

474
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
that moment again I'm going in my past

475
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,520
or future. Then there's a state of mind

476
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,039
where he says you're completely

477
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,440
lethargic. You're not interested in

478
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,600
anything. You're just lazy lazy lazy.

479
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,960
However, he's saying that these three

480
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,559
states are constantly messing with you.

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,039
I'm putting my words constantly

482
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,919
degrading you, making you lethargic. But

483
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,400
when you do simple practices like yam

484
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,559
and nam, simple things like discipline,

485
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
you will become one-pointed. So he's not

486
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,559
talking about God. He's saying that your

487
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
state of mind, you have to change it.

488
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,720
And these five states these four three

489
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,280
states we constantly go through when you

490
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,080
do sadena or by simple yam being

491
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,120
disciplined doing some exercise doing uh

492
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,160
asan pranayam you will become focused.

493
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,840
So he's explaining the same things but

494
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,760
those who don't understand they should

495
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,679
follow patanjali. One only understands

496
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,280
the power of yoga when one experiences

497
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,960
yoga. Definitely definitely and that is

498
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,280
the reason I recommend everyone if you

499
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,160
don't believe in God don't just follow

500
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,240
the yamas and nyamas yam nyam and

501
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,400
basically just do sura namaskar and

502
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,080
pranay yeah you know we live in a hyper

503
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
practical world nowadays especially

504
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
people who listen to podcasts hyper

505
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,600
practical reality in their own heads the

506
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,760
simple angle here and I'll talk about

507
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,400
this as an anecdote from my own life I

508
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,679
started actual stretching and you know

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,120
asas when I was 26 27 uh because I was

510
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,799
getting very injured during football and

511
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,440
I realized it was a lack of flexibility.

512
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,600
So I started for flexibility. But every

513
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,000
time my yoga session would get over with

514
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
my instructor, I would feel very very

515
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,679
calm. I almost felt like I am lifting my

516
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,600
consciousness beyond my own mind. Maybe

517
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
for that one two hours post the yoga

518
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
session. That's how you experience yoga.

519
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah. And you know we contemplate so

520
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,159
much now. You have done it, you enjoy

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
it, you realize that gym is different

522
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,120
and yoga is different, breathing is

523
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,200
different and that experience is

524
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
talking. Our problem is we just want to

525
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,600
pinpoint things and don't want to

526
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,600
practice. Yeah. I think this

527
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,840
experiencing things is the greatest gift

528
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,559
you can give to yourself in your 20s.

529
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,559
That is the greatest thing. Being aware

530
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,559
and experiencing your own self. Yeah. I

531
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,520
also feel your 30s there will be a

532
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,520
slightly heavier burden of

533
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,320
responsibilities. Your 20s are supposed

534
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,000
to be experimental according to me a

535
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,280
little bit. That is the reason again I'm

536
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,559
coming to Padanjali because he said

537
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,159
something very interesting. Satsang and

538
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,320
suadhaya satsang is having like-minded

539
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,799
conversations with people and suadha is

540
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,760
self-study that is very important to be

541
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,640
on track otherwise the mind again

542
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,559
creates a lot of drama yeah you spoke

543
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,480
about the three modalities of the human

544
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,520
mind rajas satwa tamas tamas yes in

545
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,760
balance they are all important right

546
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,600
they can never be in balance it'll

547
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,600
always be sliding always be and that is

548
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,280
your sabha your behavior that is how the

549
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
human mind is created That is created.

550
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,640
Three konas are always operating and all

551
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,120
your bad mental health, all your

552
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,520
negative thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety,

553
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,960
all these concepts which we have given

554
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,559
names to happen as an outcome of having

555
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,960
a lack of balance of these three. Yeah,

556
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,360
let me put it technically. Satwa is a

557
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,480
space where you are one-pointedness you

558
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,120
are aware. Rajas is giving you activity

559
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,120
constant movement and tamas is a space

560
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,440
where you go into darkness. Even in that

561
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,039
there are many combinations permutations

562
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,360
but going into anxiety is where rajas

563
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,000
and tamas are working together.

564
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,200
Our goal is to be in satwa. That is the

565
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,919
reason you do sadna. But what if your

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,360
satwa is very excessive?

567
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
Then you will move into higher states.

568
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,320
Okay. So you go beyond satwa also. Wow.

569
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,400
So the goal is to actually increase your

570
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,159
satwa. The goal is to actually

571
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,760
experience satwa. But I'll give you a

572
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,120
very simple example. When we talk about

573
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,039
the three gonas um satwa is like a

574
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,039
silver

575
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,280
chain. Uh rajas is like a gold chain and

576
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,400
tamas is like an iron chain. At the end

577
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,799
of the day all three are

578
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,720
binding. Even satwa is binding. A satic

579
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,200
person wants to make other happy, wants

580
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,600
to feel happy, be happy. An enlightened

581
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,520
being goes beyond the guas. He becomes a

582
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,320
witness.

583
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,720
Wow. That is what Bhagat Gita also

584
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,200
preaches. There's a fourth state of a

585
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,760
higher state that is called the Turya.

586
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
An enlightened being is in that he goes

587
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,440
beyond awake, dream, deep sleep. He's

588
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,080
operating in the Turya where he becomes

589
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,080
a witness of everything. Participates in

590
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,280
everything. Complete participation,

591
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
complete enjoyment but no expectation in

592
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,280
the game of life. But his or her

593
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,520
consciousness is extremely different

594
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,159
than what we experience in extremely

595
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,520
they become masters of acting and they

596
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,039
established in higher states of

597
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,120
consciousness where they have

598
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
experienced

599
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,640
subtle beyond subtle it's a state of

600
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,559
being. I'm often asked about my own goal

601
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,799
in life and nowadays I've started giving

602
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,799
a very quick answer that hey everything

603
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,279
that I'm doing in my material reality is

604
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,159
to

605
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,120
enable free time in order to go deeper

606
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,960
into my spiritual

607
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,240
practices which will hopefully take me

608
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,240
to that point of what human society

609
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,000
calls enlightenment in order to go

610
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,320
towards that fourth state that you're

611
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,480
just talking about. The only way one can

612
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,799
actually go there practically speaking

613
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,159
is if you give time and discipline to

614
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:44,320
those practices. Yeah, true. Any other

615
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:47,360
way? There are many other ways. Go on.

616
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,840
First way is being aware of a karma

617
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,679
because everything is binding as karma.

618
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,960
Secondly, which is the first is very

619
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,440
important is the knowledge of who am I?

620
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,679
I'm not this body, not this mind, not

621
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,080
this intellect. There was a great uh

622
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,240
saint here called Nisaratam Maharaj. He

623
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,080
used to live in chapati chopati. He met

624
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,080
his guru and his guru just taught him

625
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,640
one teaching. Keep on asking yourself

626
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,480
who are you? Like Ramanarishi the great

627
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,320
whenever we go to his ashram or feel his

628
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,400
presence. Beautiful eyes staring and

629
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,039
making us realize that nothing is

630
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,640
constant. You are that bliss. Now when

631
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,919
I'm talking about bliss is a state where

632
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,120
all these great enlightened beings

633
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,200
experience. It's called

634
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,039
satan. It's a state where you are in

635
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,200
ecstasy. There is no duality. There is

636
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,200
nothing. Is it the same fourth state? It

637
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,880
is the state of Tura. Turya is the

638
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,880
highest. Below that there are many

639
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,799
states, God consciousness, animal

640
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,000
consciousness, earth consciousness. But

641
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,000
the highest is imagine Arabai. You are

642
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,600
in a state where you have no anxiety, no

643
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,360
fear, no mental issues. You are a

644
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,039
perfect instrument and you're

645
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,279
experiencing unconditional love. It's

646
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,640
very rare we talk about it but I'm sure

647
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,960
these great enlightened beings have

648
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,960
experienced it.

649
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,200
That is the goal of human life. That is

650
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,600
the birthright. We already that. The

651
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,279
problem is we are covered with Maya. We

652
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,559
have conditioned ourselves to the space

653
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,760
time and causation to names and forms. M

654
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,960
and if you realize that um we are so

655
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,480
greedy we want to associate with

656
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,720
something and when our desire satisfied

657
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,919
we want something new again we are

658
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,000
building up concepts of causal relation

659
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
a highly evolved being is just being

660
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,200
aware and just participating but

661
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,400
internally completely free what can a

662
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,640
22year-old do right now to at least move

663
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,360
towards this reality as I mentioned give

664
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,679
their best secondly I think at that age

665
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,559
the mind is so hyperactive you need

666
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,080
tools to calm it down and thirdly

667
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,600
reading basic reading of

668
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,200
about

669
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,760
existence and you know the problem is

670
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,360
what I'm realizing now we are so high

671
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,400
with our own uh goals and intentions we

672
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,640
bind oursel don't bind yourself to any

673
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,360
anything so that means if a thought is

674
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,520
coming to you be okay that if this

675
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,120
happens I'm okay if it doesn't I'm I'm

676
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,960
okay

677
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,400
keep That attitude, build that attitude.

678
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,120
It will take time. Slightly

679
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,360
anti-manifestation. Yeah. Kishta and

680
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Patanjali says kish is binding you and

681
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,039
is liberating you. Now if you are

682
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,919
telling me that bhavish take this gold

683
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,720
okay in my mind okay if I get it I'm

684
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,559
okay. If I don't get I'm free. I'm free.

685
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm free of that scenario that space

686
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,400
time and causation. Just simple teaching

687
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,400
to start applying. It is difficult. Well

688
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm aiming for to becoming an IPS

689
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,840
officer. You're working, working,

690
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,000
working. Keep that awareness. If it

691
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
happens, I'm okay. If it doesn't happen,

692
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,400
something else will open up

693
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,320
automatically. You will mature. But we

694
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,799
can't. You know, I see a lot of people

695
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,799
taking this exact golden advice, and it

696
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,480
is golden advice. But I see a lot of

697
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,480
people picking up this golden advice and

698
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
using it as escapism. And in the world

699
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,679
of spirituality, it's called spiritual

700
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,120
bypassing. Yes. They they go past a goal

701
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,399
oriented mindset life. They're like, "N,

702
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
I don't want to achieve my goals. I'll

703
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,240
actually just go live in the Himalayas.

704
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,919
Yeah, we call it the vdantic shuffle.

705
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,080
It's called running away from everything

706
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,360
and taking away so that you satisfy your

707
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,520
own ego. But no, a yogi is a person

708
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,799
who's participating in everything, not

709
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,880
running away in any scenario. So until

710
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,520
you in the body, nature will not let you

711
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,799
rest. Okay. Can I just draw out a tiny

712
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,720
instruction manual for a 22 year old

713
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,399
beginning life? Yeah. Okay. And of

714
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,799
course, this applies to 25, 30 year olds

715
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,720
as well. Yeah.

716
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,480
You mentioned some guidelines. Yeah. So

717
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,120
you said your first job is to uh you you

718
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,320
said something that kind of in my eyes I

719
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,679
read as being kind. Yeah. Like you have

720
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,679
to be a good human being. Karma. You

721
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,360
said be conscious of your karma. The

722
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,480
greatest sign of a noble being is

723
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,880
humbleness. Be humbleness and uh never

724
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
think that you are the doer. There's a

725
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,399
greater force that is operating. And if

726
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,399
you think that you are too smart, just

727
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,480
hold your nose and you'll come to know

728
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,399
that you can't survive. The sun is

729
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,480
shining equally for everyone. That

730
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,880
humbleness is very important. So for a

731
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,799
22-year-old, the basis of all forms of

732
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
growth is humbleness. I also put

733
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,120
kindness in the same bracket. Yes.

734
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,640
Perfect. The second is to do your best

735
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,720
in the world, which at 22 often means

736
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,240
career and family life. Do your best for

737
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,640
your parents, do your best at your job.

738
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,520
And one more advice practically if you

739
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,480
don't like something don't do it as in

740
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,240
don't be forced by parents or don't be

741
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,960
in any situation that you're because you

742
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,480
won't last your shava will decide what

743
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
you want to do but also don't use this

744
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,720
as an excuse to not work hard. Perfect.

745
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,559
Perfect. And you know it's yeah very

746
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,159
it's a very fine line. It's a very fine

747
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,520
line where we forget. Yeah. This is

748
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,279
actually where most people slip off.

749
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah. That's what where spiritual

750
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,000
bypassing begins. Yes. Uh the third

751
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,520
thing you said is study. read. You know

752
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
how I look at spiritual podcasts? They

753
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
point you towards spiritual books and

754
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,399
spiritual books point your journey

755
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,000
towards where it's supposed to go. True.

756
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,760
Like there is something you'll gain from

757
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,440
podcast. Definitely. But it actually

758
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,240
should point you towards the books. And

759
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,559
you know it is very strange. Um we

760
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,159
forget things very easily. We forget

761
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,559
things very easily because we are now

762
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
selective surrender. If things are going

763
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,159
my way, oh God is so nice. I always tell

764
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,320
this because we go through the process.

765
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,880
So that constant reading and constant

766
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,520
being aware is very important. Right.

767
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
The final two steps in my eyes, these

768
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,559
are kind of optional. It depends on your

769
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,720
own personal journey. Uh get into the

770
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,000
process of yoga and by that I don't mean

771
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,240
just as yum prana and meditation is very

772
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,520
important. And finally I would say that

773
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,679
really take up a sadna if you can. For

774
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,520
me at 22 I used to just sit for 20

775
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,279
minutes keep my back straight. I

776
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,679
couldn't even sit cross-legged well that

777
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,440
time you know I would just do chanting

778
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,440
for 20 minutes. It started off

779
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,200
something. Yeah, it's the most powerful

780
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,679
sadha. Even the entire text opes says

781
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,520
that home is everything. In fact, if you

782
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,240
think this is too much heavy for you and

783
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,120
this is too spiritual, a very basic

784
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,919
simple solution is being nonviolent in

785
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,600
your

786
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,520
thoughts. When I say non very very

787
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
difficult oh I should not be jealous of

788
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,159
our oh my brother is getting more money

789
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,159
from me. Oh you know what tomorrow I'm

790
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,880
not gaining popular. This is the biggest

791
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
battle. If you try understanding, you

792
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
will evolve and it is very very

793
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,000
difficult. So if you think that oh

794
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,840
praying to Kali is difficult or home

795
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,840
chanting, be non- minded your thoughts.

796
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,720
It will drain you out because you're

797
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,640
conditioned again. I ask the person in

798
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,039
front of me often.

799
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Are you a good person trying to be bad

800
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,159
or are you a bad person trying to be

801
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
good?

802
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,320
And it's actually a question that you

803
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,799
need to sit and really think about

804
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,559
because it's a very nuanced answer. And

805
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,320
very often I think society conditions us

806
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,399
into wanting to say no. I'm a good

807
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,760
person trying to be bad. No way. I don't

808
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,440
I want to have a bad person trying to be

809
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,720
good. No, no, no. I'm a good person

810
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,679
trying to be bad. And they settle at

811
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,320
that because that's societal

812
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,480
conditioning.

813
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,880
But Shikhar Davan when I asked him this,

814
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,240
he did this. Okay. He went ooh. He did

815
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
something like that cuz he understood

816
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
the depth of the question. Yeah. A

817
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,880
reality of growing up in urban centers

818
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,200
anywhere in the world. You are taught to

819
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,039
be mentally very tough, very street

820
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,120
smart to survive in the city and to

821
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
grow. And then you're also given a moral

822
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,880
compass and you're told don't do the

823
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,279
wrong things in life. Uh there's a

824
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,799
dialogue from Batman Begins where they

825
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,399
say that it's not who you are on the

826
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,880
inside but it's your actions that define

827
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,640
you. True. It's the same thought. You

828
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
may be bad on the inside. you know the

829
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,120
vicious way of going about the world but

830
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
you're trying to do the right thing. I

831
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,240
think it's kind of similar to what

832
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,399
you're trying to say about being

833
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,760
nonviolent in your thoughts. Yes, there

834
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,880
is violence in your thoughts.

835
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,360
Acknowledge it. Don't ever act upon it

836
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,279
and eventually transform that inside as

837
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,880
well. Beautiful. Because um uh when you

838
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,679
read Patanjali, this is stuck to my

839
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,640
heart because it is so practical. He's

840
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,640
saying that being nonviolent is

841
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,240
impossible. M impossible accept it.

842
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,760
There is viciousness in human nature. It

843
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,640
is but try not to.

844
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,799
Secondly, what I believe is also the

845
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,960
intention. If I am shouting at you, but

846
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,960
my intention is that you evolve, I'm

847
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
free. The intention matters. Intention

848
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,120
matters and the wish to transform. Yeah.

849
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,320
And the intention if it is for

850
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,960
upliftment of others, you will blossom.

851
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,440
Yeah. And but I'm fabulous. My intention

852
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,600
is very very um toxic. I'm using such

853
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
words. I'm sorry. That's fine. Then no

854
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,159
matter what I am binded because nature

855
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,880
knows everything. Nature will not leave

856
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,200
you. You know people who have negative

857
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,120
or I would even say neutral intention in

858
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,320
their heart. It often shows up on the

859
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,080
face. Definitely. You can't hide. I can

860
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,840
hide from you for three times, four

861
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,320
times. It will come up. Yeah, it will

862
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,600
come up. a a good practice for end users

863
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,480
and they can do this in their own social

864
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,639
circles. Yeah. If you are doubtful about

865
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,200
a certain person's intention, see a

866
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,599
photo of them smiling. Yeah. You will

867
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,679
come to know. Just just keep looking at

868
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,200
it. Keep looking at it and and ask

869
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,639
yourself what lies beyond the smile. And

870
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,320
the way to polish this skill, it's also

871
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,879
a podcasting skill honestly where you

872
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,839
observe humans very deeply. The way to

873
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,919
polish this skill is that you have

874
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,359
certain people in your life who you know

875
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,599
very deeply. You know their characters

876
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,679
inside out. Maybe a relative, maybe a

877
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,879
friend. See a photo of them smiling.

878
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,240
Especially the ones where you know that

879
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,320
this person is a good human being and

880
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,200
the intentions are clean. And see a

881
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,639
bunch of good human beings in your own

882
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,760
circle. Their smiles are often

883
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,280
representations of good intention. And

884
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
do this obviously with the people who

885
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,400
you know have been slightly twisted in

886
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,160
their life. True. you'll be able to

887
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,839
develop some kind of pattern recognition

888
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,200
in your head which will protect you

889
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,000
throughout your 20ies. True. True. And I

890
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,800
also believe that

891
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,599
um at times when you are around people

892
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,280
you just come to know with time they

893
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,119
will hide it for three times, four times

894
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,200
but fifth time it will just come to you.

895
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,160
Yeah. I think one of those experiences

896
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,119
one has again in their 20s is uh

897
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,400
understanding which people give you

898
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,200
energy and which people take energy

899
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,240
from. True. And the goal of life is to

900
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
hang out with people who give you

901
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,119
energy. You know, um there's a very

902
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,000
beautiful state that we go in 20. And

903
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,079
personally, I believe don't get attached

904
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,680
to the

905
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,200
experiences. It is a learning process.

906
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,440
I've seen many people whatever has

907
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,160
happened in 20 till 20 and also they are

908
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,280
stuck in the 24 23. They don't let go of

909
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,000
that and that's a major problem

910
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,200
and it is not the end of

911
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,839
life. But you have planned your life in

912
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,160
such a way in your head. Again, you're

913
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,760
binded to situation.

914
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,520
Are you are you okay if I ask you your

915
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,119
age? I am 36. 36. So 6 years in your

916
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,560
30s. Yep. Um I'm sure you have friends

917
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,160
whom you know from childhood. I have um

918
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,079
childhood friends, they have changed,

919
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,560
but now I have some very good saddaks

920
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,160
around who

921
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,720
what do you observe about people in

922
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,119
their 30s,

923
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,440
you know?

924
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,880
um if you're talking from a normal point

925
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,040
of view or from a sadic point of view

926
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
from a normal point of view uh I think

927
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,200
during 30s there's too much of stress

928
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,880
with

929
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,880
their savings with their money with

930
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,119
their lifestyle with their future

931
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,359
they're completely entangled and they

932
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,119
think that they have to rush into

933
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:47,359
something settle down settle down settle

934
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,480
down I've seen with many people that I

935
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,040
know you know we spent two hours talking

936
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,079
before I was trying to iron out my own

937
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,560
challenges of being in my 30s with you

938
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,079
to bring up this chapter on our episode

939
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,320
today. Yeah. So that I don't have to

940
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,400
trauma dump in front of the world can do

941
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,359
it outside. Yeah. Uh I want to talk

942
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,720
about 30s a little bit because um I'm

943
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,800
thinking one positive thing which is

944
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,400
that almost everyone I know is having

945
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,320
more conversations about health and

946
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,160
evolution. Yeah. See internal battles

947
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,000
are different, professional battles are

948
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,160
different and worldly battles are

949
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,119
different completely. But that is the

950
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,079
reason you know in 30s also people

951
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,839
change and you are

952
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,680
changing and also the experiences that

953
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,760
you're going through is either taking

954
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,760
you to other levels or also putting you

955
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,599
back in your past.

956
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,720
It's a very crucial time that is the

957
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,720
reason a good friend circle sadena and I

958
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,960
think common sense is required at times.

959
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,560
Yeah. You know I speak for my own friend

960
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
circle here but I think I speak for a

961
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,240
lot of friend circles of people in their

962
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,359
30s because I view this a lot. the core

963
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,280
friend groups uh get even closer in

964
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,280
their 30s because you've really seen

965
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,200
human beings by this point. Uh and you

966
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,000
almost come together from a sense of

967
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,920
fear and and a sense of damn bro the

968
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,480
world is like a dirty place. I want to

969
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,960
hang out with you guys. Yeah. Like it's

970
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,359
it's a sad reality of human life. For a

971
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
survival of any relationship, there's

972
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,720
only one ingredient that is

973
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,920
communication. at a very practical

974
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,440
level, you need to communicate, you

975
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,040
know, and this the same emotion that

976
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,200
we're talking about right now, this

977
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,280
trials and tribulations of your 20s and

978
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,520
challenges of your 30s. This is what

979
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,200
made me want to talk about time to you

980
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,040
today because I'm getting more and more

981
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,160
aware of aging through little things

982
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,000
like I've started getting more gray

983
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,800
hairs and I'm like, "Oh, okay. This is

984
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,640
what it feels like." Like because in my

985
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,520
head I'm still in first standard. Yeah.

986
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,599
I'm still 6 years old. Yeah. That I'm

987
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,400
still 18 as well. I'm still in fifth

988
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,520
grade as well, but my hair is graying.

989
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,240
My knees are unhealthy. There's stuff

990
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,079
happening. So, I'm

991
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,440
like, it feels like when you know

992
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,040
t-shirt starts becoming old and you see

993
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,720
that hole in the t-shirt for the first

994
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,240
time. Yep. But this is the body version

995
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,839
of it. Your soul's like ah can't wait

996
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
for that next life where I'm given a new

997
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,160
young body and it's more flexible again.

998
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,720
See, you know the thing is um once the

999
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,640
mind starts thinking no, it just creates

1000
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,440
threads.

1001
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,280
numerous threads. That is the reason

1002
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,599
that understanding that nothing is

1003
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,200
permanent should always be there. Yeah.

1004
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,960
That underlining knowledge should always

1005
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,079
be there. That will save you save you

1006
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
from my own miseries that you're

1007
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,160
creating.

1008
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,000
And with time when you measure you

1009
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,920
realize nothing is in your hands.

1010
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
Nothing. You plan out so many things.

1011
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
But what is in your hand? The

1012
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,960
satisfaction that no one can take away

1013
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,760
that is in your hand and that you'll get

1014
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
when you do things with complete

1015
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,079
awareness. What was that thing you

1016
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
mentioned about the Bhagat Gita? The

1017
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,599
prasad prasad buddhi prasad buddhi that

1018
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,680
is very very important. Bhagat Gita is

1019
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,760
so practical teachings you don't need to

1020
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,760
you just have to apply it that whatever

1021
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,040
I'm getting I will take it as a prasad

1022
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,640
but I will play my role

1023
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,119
100%. Otherwise you're coming into again

1024
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,240
the shuffle. What is the playing my role

1025
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,880
100% aspect of things. playing my role

1026
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,160
100% aspect is that and whatever

1027
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,599
condition I am placed I'm placer because

1028
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,000
of my own karma secondly whatever I am

1029
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,560
placed in any situation the reaction

1030
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,160
depends in my hands if I respond I'm

1031
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,320
free and third deep inside you know

1032
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,320
you're doing justice or not if you have

1033
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,839
these three things in your head you are

1034
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
clear you can handle any situation in

1035
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,839
the world

1036
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:38,160
practically one of The ways I connected

1037
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,000
with Shiva Mo especially in my mid to

1038
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,560
late 20s was

1039
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,640
uh filling the gap that I felt through

1040
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,480
Shiva's presence.

1041
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,680
You know when you start worshiping Shiv

1042
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,280
in my personal experience he's Bolinat

1043
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,000
he's just when you chant and you just

1044
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,480
surrender he will look after you. Not

1045
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,520
like ferocious daties. He's very very

1046
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,119
shant very very caring and he's one of

1047
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,920
those gods that you call out he'll come

1048
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
first. Yeah.

1049
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,560
Yeah. Uh I had an experience when I was

1050
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,680
not doing a sadna. I got an experience

1051
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,280
of his rodu and then I realized that yes

1052
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,680
he has many forms and uh one more time

1053
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,280
when anytime when I think I'm very hoy

1054
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,520
to have some ego he will crush me down

1055
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,359
always in a good way. But uh he has

1056
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,079
different different forms. Is is behav

1057
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,800
and shiva one and the same?

1058
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,000
In higher states they all are one. All

1059
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,839
are one. All are one. She was the same

1060
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,720
as Krishna. All are one. The ways um has

1061
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,920
Takuri said jotto different different

1062
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,839
beings different different ways to

1063
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,920
worship but we all come from the same

1064
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,800
source. That is the reason that I is

1065
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,960
always

1066
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,280
constant and um I have realized I have

1067
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,280
done Krishna sadha for a very long time

1068
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,079
then I have done shiv sadna all bhagan's

1069
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,480
race they all are one but sabhava is

1070
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,920
different of different deities. And you

1071
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,319
attune to that sabha.

1072
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,520
You attune to that sa. That means the

1073
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,839
more you practice you will realize that

1074
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,040
deities have their own sabhawa. No, if

1075
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,040
if I had to ask you the traits of beer's

1076
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
presence

1077
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,040
um when uh I started doing bat sad now I

1078
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,000
realized it's very protecting. Okay.

1079
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,079
Very protecting. Very

1080
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,359
nurturing. Very nurturing.

1081
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,880
But this is how I project

1082
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:39,839
him. But when I do Kali sad, it is

1083
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,640
different. She's ferocious. She'll make

1084
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,240
me dance to her tunes. Make me realize

1085
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,079
that she is in charge of things and I'm

1086
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,240
just an instrument. Which is very good

1087
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,000
because the ego rises anytime. You think

1088
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,920
you're very special anytime. How does

1089
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,319
she get annoyed?

1090
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,640
If I lack my sadha and again if there is

1091
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,800
any pride, no, these dities will push

1092
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,359
you down. That is the reason holding on

1093
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,680
to vdanta is very different. And we slip

1094
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,920
into it that I am Brahman, I am

1095
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,599
Brahasmi, I will not do anything. No,

1096
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,000
you have to participate. The role has to

1097
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,480
be played.

1098
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
And association is with the dity is

1099
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,560
giving that comfort that there is

1100
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,280
someone looking after you always.

1101
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,119
Sometimes will the

1102
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,079
dity force you to reduce the sadha

1103
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,160
because of whatever? Um depending upon

1104
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,839
the sanscaras depending upon see once

1105
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,599
you completely surrender the dity will

1106
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,720
do everything.

1107
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,040
If you have that kind of bacti then even

1108
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,880
talking becomes a

1109
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,359
sadna. Imagine that ara you in a state

1110
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,079
that completely I' left it to be. So the

1111
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,680
mic is better. You are beof. The

1112
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,440
questions are better. Your life has

1113
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,359
become a sadna. So the mantra coming

1114
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,359
also be and going is also you don't have

1115
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,359
to worry about it because you become an

1116
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,280
instrument. When you start thinking

1117
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,079
space and time comes then we lose

1118
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,800
connect.

1119
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,200
Time

1120
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,960
time time is

1121
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,280
um it's very difficult to understand. We

1122
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,000
just get very deluded all the time. We

1123
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,359
forget

1124
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,319
that we are not this time.

1125
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,000
Let's speak about Mahakal a

1126
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,560
little. Let's let's begin by speaking

1127
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,480
about the Ujen temple. Y okay that's

1128
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,560
honestly my introduction to Maka. Why?

1129
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,720
Because my idol went there and said J

1130
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,960
Mahal and I saw a change in his fortunes

1131
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,200
also. fortune's already crazy but went

1132
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,880
to another level for Virat Kohli. So

1133
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,400
let's let's begin with the temple and

1134
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,079
then expand Mahakal from there. Mahakal

1135
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,440
um I will we'll talk about our

1136
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,319
experience. We were in Mahakal

1137
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:46,400
and it is a space which will take you

1138
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:48,800
beyond time. It is shift personified as

1139
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,720
the essence beyond time that when I talk

1140
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,400
about Maral we realize in we were just

1141
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,040
running and we realize that we are just

1142
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,880
dancing to his tunes. So the concept of

1143
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,960
time just dissolves that completely and

1144
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,200
that is the only only jotling in the

1145
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,760
world where you do

1146
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,800
basma. It's a constant reminder that

1147
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,480
nothing is in your hands. What is that

1148
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,480
basma? Originally in earlier times they

1149
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,240
used to do from the smashant they used

1150
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,040
to get basma and used to do basarti in

1151
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,839
the nightsh ashes here human cremated

1152
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,560
ashes but now they do it with sandalwood

1153
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,680
and cowang and everything so that arty

1154
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,839
and even um that temple is so powerful

1155
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,960
it's an experience I would personally

1156
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,400
recommend that um whenever you go to

1157
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,359
just sit cross-legg and just be do your

1158
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,480
j and just be get that essence pull that

1159
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,040
energy and of uh sh in that form. Is

1160
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,720
there some truth in the fact that you're

1161
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,280
not supposed to sleep when you go to a

1162
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,079
jin?

1163
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,079
I think uh if you're very highly

1164
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,079
sensitive saddak you will realize a lot

1165
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,280
of

1166
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:59,280
things we can't generalize it because

1167
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,119
uh and I believe that any spiritual

1168
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,760
place I tell this and I have experienced

1169
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,760
only when the dati calls you you can go

1170
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,920
otherwise your cal will not change. So

1171
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,640
if Mahal has called you that means your

1172
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,839
call is about to change spiritually and

1173
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,359
when spiritually things change

1174
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,640
everything will change materially also

1175
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,800
emotionally also I think hard work needs

1176
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,599
to be a very core part of one's

1177
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,319
existence otherwise life is going to

1178
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,920
punish you going forward karma yoga is

1179
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,920
very important

1180
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,319
if the human body is given action is

1181
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,280
very very important for people living in

1182
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,640
this space with the base of what I just

1183
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,440
said that hard work should be like

1184
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,920
breathing that shouldn't be a question

1185
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,800
you know

1186
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:47,200
uh beyond that I feel that uh the

1187
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,720
success that you gain through hard work

1188
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,240
is not just because of the hard work

1189
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,079
it's actually because of your spiritual

1190
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,839
growth definitely how kind you are

1191
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:00,480
how nuanced your decision- making is um

1192
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,880
your success or anything depends upon

1193
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,160
the hard work it will turn out to be

1194
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,280
fruitful if you're doing it as an

1195
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,079
offering

1196
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,119
Yeah. To that divine. Yeah. So I'm doing

1197
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,800
this podcast for the divine. I'm doing

1198
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,599
every it's a very high state to be in

1199
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,920
because uh if for a nancond things don't

1200
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,160
go your way and you forget everything

1201
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,800
again you're binded to karma. Clished

1202
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,040
again cliched again binding. So attitude

1203
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,079
your intention and I think in higher

1204
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,000
states you just do it with love. That is

1205
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,040
a solution for everything. Unconditioned

1206
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,280
love. You're talking about attaching

1207
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,440
love to your professional work right?

1208
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,599
doing it as an offering for the divine

1209
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,400
and enjoying the process. Yeah, it's

1210
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,880
such a it's such a challenging thing for

1211
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,160
a person in their early 20s to actually

1212
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,680
wrap their head around, you know,

1213
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,520
because like go on. Yeah. Early 20s, a

1214
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,359
simple solution is first see what you

1215
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,280
want to do in your life. Yeah.

1216
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,720
Understand your sava. Yeah. You're

1217
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,280
saying a very practical thing, right?

1218
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,319
Very practical. You know I remember so

1219
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,160
my first uh internship in college was in

1220
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,839
mergers and acquisitions in Ernston

1221
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,520
Young. Okay. I worked as a financial

1222
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:10,560
analyst and I was very grateful to be in

1223
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,319
that EI office. It was a swanky office

1224
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,839
and I was like this is a big blessing

1225
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,680
that I'm here. I first said thank you to

1226
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,640
God on my first day and I stayed there

1227
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,400
learned a lot saw the corporate world uh

1228
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,480
had a lot of respect for it. It was that

1229
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,160
whole energy of the office is actually a

1230
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,680
guru for me even today like I bow my

1231
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,319
head down to that phase of my life. This

1232
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,880
was when I was 20 or 21. But I do

1233
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,640
remember this one feeling I used to have

1234
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,839
which is that about a month or two into

1235
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,520
that internship um I had a friend called

1236
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,920
Dendra. He was a family friend who also

1237
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,920
happened to be interning at that and the

1238
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,160
only reason I wanted to go to office was

1239
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,559
to spend time with Dendra and then learn

1240
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,760
alongside him. But the feeling I used to

1241
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,520
have while entering that office was wow

1242
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,400
can't wait for 5:00 p.m. when I get to

1243
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,400
exit. Yeah. That's the universe's way of

1244
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,640
saying that this is an experience. This

1245
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,800
is not where you belong.

1246
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,240
See, you have taken this maturely. Now

1247
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,599
with time you have realized this has

1248
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,280
happened. Your subhava is doing this.

1249
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
And the more you do it with your subh

1250
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,160
and enjoy it, automatically nature will

1251
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,200
push you ahead. Yeah. Apparently when I

1252
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,079
started training people for money, okay,

1253
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,200
uh before YouTube began,

1254
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,280
I would approach training with a very uh

1255
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,800
I love that job. I was I was making good

1256
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,000
money also as a 22-y old because of

1257
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,760
that. I was making more money than I

1258
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,319
would have made in any of my engineering

1259
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,319
college placements. Uh people were

1260
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,000
laughing at me like that. Oh, you did

1261
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,680
engineering and you know there was a lot

1262
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,839
of psychological trauma I had to face in

1263
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,200
that phase but I enjoyed training. I

1264
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,040
could I could do it for the rest of my

1265
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,440
life. I really like helping a younger

1266
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,599
person. Uh and I had some teenage

1267
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,440
clients and all that just I looked at it

1268
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,920
as a younger sibling that I want to help

1269
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,440
your body. Uh and that then that

1270
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,480
extended into beer biceps being a

1271
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,880
fitness channel. It was effectively that

1272
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,880
the feeling I had with that professional

1273
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,839
aspect was

1274
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,079
um it felt like a plant. It didn't feel

1275
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,440
like a task. Felt like I just want to

1276
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,240
keep giving this nurturing it. Yeah. I

1277
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,440
want to nurture this. Uh and long hours

1278
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,280
of work didn't feel like that. Yeah.

1279
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
Yeah. Because you're enjoying it. No.

1280
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah. That's what people need to look

1281
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,040
for on a professional level in their

1282
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,720
early 20s. And I think these 20 or 25

1283
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,119
are so pressurized in society and having

1284
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,119
a status or having this later they

1285
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,200
regret. Yeah. So contemplate what you

1286
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,839
enjoy the most. Yeah. You know and the

1287
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,240
truth is that there are certain fields

1288
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,480
that are perceived to be glamorous. This

1289
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,200
field included content creation uh

1290
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:41,359
sports uh films all the people who

1291
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,079
matter in these fields.

1292
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,280
are all young people and they're not

1293
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,599
being able to find them

1294
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,680
entering these fields out of a place of

1295
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,400
self-doubt but it's about extending

1296
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,920
yourself send emails out try getting in

1297
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,280
touch with people there's a lot of fear

1298
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,480
there's a lot of uh unknown territory

1299
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,559
the reason I'm saying this is this

1300
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,800
nurturing aspect of watering the plant

1301
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,400
when it comes to career uh people don't

1302
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,839
experience that reality cuz

1303
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,359
um they just think that hey I don't get

1304
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:15,760
paid in those kind of jobs. That's not

1305
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,119
true. There is money to be made. Uh and

1306
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,640
I think money is a good thing to chase

1307
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,559
when you're in your early 20s. Yeah. The

1308
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,160
thing is no, the fear is to jump in.

1309
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,920
Once you jump in only then you'll know

1310
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,480
how to swim. We don't want to jump in.

1311
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
We contemplate. We just create a lot of

1312
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,079
things. The reason you and me are

1313
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,079
talking about this very hyper practical

1314
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,559
career angle in a tantra based podcast

1315
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,000
is because this is actually a box one

1316
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,880
needs to tick to enable all the

1317
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,599
spiritual stuff. True. like first settle

1318
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,839
your own capitalistic mind and more than

1319
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,520
that no you have to go through the grind

1320
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,400
you can't experience things when you

1321
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,880
can't go through it so unless I have

1322
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,640
burnt my hand I'll realize the sensation

1323
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,079
of what it is so it's a process you go

1324
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,280
through it there's a reason that even

1325
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,359
this topic is choosing

1326
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,359
to split this fabric of reality around

1327
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,880
us and enter this conversation cuz

1328
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,359
there's a lot of young people listening

1329
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,280
to this conversation uh who probably

1330
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,359
understand a gore only from the

1331
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,599
perspective of media and that's fine at

1332
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,960
least that knowledge has reached them. I

1333
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,800
would point them towards an author

1334
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,640
called Roberts Voboda who we have hosted

1335
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,000
on the show. He's written a trilogy uh

1336
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,359
Agora 123 very detailed difficult to

1337
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,640
read book try reading it. Um we've also

1338
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,000
recorded podcasts with him. So if you're

1339
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,319
not a reader go listen to those

1340
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,920
podcasts. But my question to you is why

1341
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,240
has this entered this Jenzi

1342
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,559
spirituality?

1343
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,200
Because you know um people are attracted

1344
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,440
to things that gives them kicks. They

1345
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,079
don't want the long step-by-step method

1346
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,240
of going to yam nyam then doing mantra

1347
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,400
chanting then getting a guru then no

1348
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,800
they want shortcut but they don't this

1349
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,599
shortcut is

1350
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:55,920
hell if you just read or just you know

1351
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,839
get and an actual auror will you know

1352
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,760
there are many aurors that I've met who

1353
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,240
dress normally we don't even come to

1354
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,480
know the auror I had an interaction in

1355
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,640
kashi later I got to know when I saw him

1356
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,640
and I'm like okay then I realized that

1357
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,559
we know nothing about them Because what

1358
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,079
is project on TV is holding a kapal

1359
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,319
running like this. They are not they are

1360
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,839
very well educated and that man was so

1361
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,599
well spoken traveled the world taken the

1362
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:21,200
part and come into this because they are

1363
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,440
karma their situation have dragged them

1364
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,359
into this if I tell you just leave

1365
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,119
tomorrow if I tell a so-called jenzi

1366
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,440
okay pack everything leave step out in

1367
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,520
the mountain start walking they won't

1368
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,119
you need to jump into it to realize it

1369
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,520
where do you live the majority of your

1370
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,280
life

1371
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,680
um uh it has been distributed in many

1372
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,839
many parts but I would say in the

1373
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,280
mountains yes mountains Yes. I think

1374
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,880
it's very important for Indians. Every

1375
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,520
Indian should visit the mountains.

1376
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,720
Everyone should definitely at least once

1377
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,359
at least once you realize how life is

1378
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,880
say say more because you know especially

1379
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:59,680
for people living in metro cities we are

1380
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,520
very comforted in our own space given

1381
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,640
you step in the mountains you'll realize

1382
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,640
how life is how nature is harsh how you

1383
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,240
realize that you have to survive not

1384
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,559
proper mountains not even rishiesh

1385
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,400
rishikesh is luxury and you will step

1386
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,400
out ahead you'll come to know that and

1387
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,400
you'll you'll also um realize One

1388
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
important thing that we are very blessed

1389
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,440
we are humans. We can act, we can

1390
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,040
perform, we can think and we can evolve

1391
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,880
because of the mountains. You realize

1392
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,880
that the nature will teach you. Yeah.

1393
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,599
Because here everything is McDonald's

1394
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,119
this that you have to do your own thing.

1395
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,200
I remember my first trip to the

1396
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,200
mountains was with a very close friend

1397
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,040
group from school and my best friend

1398
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,280
Nandini. We were just sitting and

1399
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,359
looking at the mountains. Okay. This was

1400
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,920
a kasal to trip. This is at age 23.

1401
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,160
uh we saw these massive mountains in

1402
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,920
front of us, okay? And there was a

1403
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,680
moment at night where the moonlight was

1404
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,319
falling on them and you could see like

1405
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,359
the you know the cracks in the mountains

1406
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:59,200
and possible caves and we all just

1407
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,839
paused collectively as a friend group

1408
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,559
and she said that just look at how many

1409
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,040
secrets are present right in front of us

1410
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,559
and that's such an important sentence

1411
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,280
because as you travel through the

1412
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,319
mountains you realize that mountains are

1413
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,440
not the places where you choose to just

1414
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:19,520
be in one location. You have to sit in

1415
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,680
your car and go around and discover the

1416
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,079
secrets. True.

1417
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,520
How many secrets are there in India

1418
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:29,000
according to you? I think you're the

1419
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:35,440
right person to be asked this question.

1420
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:37,440
I personal experiences uh many a uh

1421
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,000
every time when we experience we think

1422
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,839
we know nothing. We know nothing. Um

1423
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,880
just sharing not a personal experience.

1424
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:48,480
Va and Gmuk and uh in the night

1425
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,240
u it was one of the best nights not

1426
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,040
spiritually but talking with with our

1427
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,359
all um Adi members and we looked up and

1428
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,400
we saw shooting stars we saw the

1429
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,920
Saparishi mandala and we were

1430
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:03,240
like what is this? This is another

1431
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,359
world. What is mandala? Um you know the

1432
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,000
saparishis we say they have come from

1433
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,240
the stars. So they form a specific uh

1434
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,400
rectangular mandala which you can see it

1435
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,680
and it's very very visible and you and

1436
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,280
you know every mountain is different.

1437
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,040
The mountains in Nepal are different.

1438
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,640
Kalash is different. Rishies is

1439
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,799
different. Himachel is different and you

1440
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,760
feel the energy is different. You feel

1441
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,200
it like those who know know it.

1442
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,640
Different gifts as well. Different gifts

1443
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,480
as well. Yes. And they are scary also.

1444
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,480
They make you realize how small you are

1445
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,160
and insignificant. I would recommend

1446
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,440
that um you know we are very secure with

1447
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,240
money with security with cell phones go

1448
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,000
for a trip don't if you're not don't

1449
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,559
know what a yatra is just pack your bags

1450
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,400
go go to go explore you will realize

1451
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,480
that you are so gifted you have so many

1452
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,480
things you'll also realize that nature's

1453
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,359
constantly supporting you if you just

1454
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,760
flow

1455
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:59,280
yeah a CA had once asked me why do

1456
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,400
people even go to the mountains he was

1457
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,359
fairly older than I am Yeah. And my

1458
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,240
answer at that point was because it's

1459
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,440
the best form of nature. And then he's

1460
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,079
like, "No, but I've never done a

1461
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,079
vacation where I've really see out

1462
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,040
nature. I always like pref I go to

1463
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,200
cities." I I didn't know what to say

1464
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,680
because how do you explain the joy of

1465
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,040
being out in nature?

1466
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:29,520
It's you know you can't explain it's you

1467
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,760
know we were in um Kedar and u there was

1468
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,359
one point

1469
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,400
where we could see Keddar we could see

1470
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:40,000
the ice peak mountain we could see the

1471
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,440
multiple stars and we were like we have

1472
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,599
wasted so many years we are not

1473
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,440
experiencing

1474
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:48,319
this practically speaking away from the

1475
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,760
depth it's very affordable as a trip

1476
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,960
yeah it is like you'll be able to

1477
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,520
explore the mountains with very less

1478
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,000
less money. Yeah. And I would say that

1479
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,480
uh don't use those fancy choppers and

1480
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,119
all. Go travel local. You will realize

1481
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,880
how local people are humble. You'll

1482
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,480
realize everything. And I think such

1483
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,000
experience is more important than

1484
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,000
studying books or running

1485
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,240
beholution as well.

1486
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,480
I'm going to ask you a very peculiar

1487
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,559
travel oriented question which is useful

1488
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,680
for young people. If I give you a

1489
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,760
timeline of four years where they can do

1490
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,720
a trip to the Himalayas every single

1491
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:35,040
year, can you draw out a road map that

1492
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,599
will help them evolve as human beings?

1493
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,520
See um honestly speaking every mountain

1494
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,079
has good side and bad side. Yeah.

1495
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,680
Because humans are everywhere. Every

1496
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,760
mountain where you go has a spiritually

1497
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,799
uplifting side. At the same time it has

1498
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,559
everything which you don't want to get

1499
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,200
involved with. If you're starting your

1500
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,280
trip I would say start with rishies.

1501
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,760
It's a good space to be in. Don't go to

1502
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,119
casoli. Don't go to dharam shala. You

1503
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,319
will land up doing other things and the

1504
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,799
mind will get diverted easily. Go to

1505
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,359
rishiesh. If you actually want if see

1506
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,720
depends um now if you are inclined

1507
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:09,359
towards shiv I would definitely say do

1508
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,200
kedat do adi kalash. If you want to do

1509
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,440
something which is challenging go to

1510
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,200
him.

1511
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,799
Just go outside your comfort zone. If

1512
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,880
you want to do something very very

1513
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,160
challenging, go to rdanat. But take the

1514
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,920
journey. Start with something very

1515
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,359
small. And I think kanat is good to

1516
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,680
start with. What is challenging about

1517
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,760
those yatras? Oh, you have to do it in a

1518
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,119
day. We were in Himkunai. One of the

1519
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,920
most beautiful experiences because

1520
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,559
oxygen goes less. And you have to go in

1521
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,880
the morning and by 3:00 they will push

1522
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,599
you down because you can't stay there.

1523
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,760
Okay. It gets very difficult.

1524
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:45,520
Bitter weather. Bitter weather. Oxygen

1525
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,880
problem. No other issues. So you go take

1526
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,240
dasha and come back and that is

1527
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,400
something which is mentally difficult

1528
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,960
also and of course only when the dati

1529
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,760
calls you can go. That is the sad. That

1530
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,640
is the sadna definitely. I always say

1531
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,720
that any atra that we did kana recently

1532
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,240
I was planning for a year it was not

1533
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,000
possible in 10 days we planned

1534
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,520
everything and we realized that all the

1535
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,640
doors opening because dati was calling

1536
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,799
us and it is a mental test because at

1537
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,880
any point of time you will be stuck

1538
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,440
there'll be a problem. Uh-huh. There

1539
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,200
you'll have no water and it is a

1540
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,760
beautiful journey. But when you go to

1541
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,400
the shetra and you be there, you will be

1542
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,559
charged like a battery again. O you'll

1543
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,160
be charged again. That is the reason all

1544
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,400
these jot lings and everything are so

1545
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,000
powerful. The statement you said that

1546
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,359
you'll be charged like a battery. It's

1547
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,799
something one only understands when one

1548
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,559
experiences. Yeah. Like when we go to

1549
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:39,359
Kashi, we visit Baraba, we go to uh Jot

1550
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,079
Ling, Kashi Vishna, we are charged. We

1551
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:44,160
are charged and you know it. You know it

1552
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,040
and that energy comes back again

1553
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,480
sustains again again you go but in

1554
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,000
higher states if you're talking from a

1555
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,359
Vatic point of view you don't need to go

1556
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,680
anywhere because everything is within

1557
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,440
you but we are not there those who are

1558
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,119
there they don't travel but you will

1559
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,200
realize how the battery charges

1560
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,400
and there are very strange stories I've

1561
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,160
seen people living in rishies they have

1562
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,240
not been to Har they have not been to

1563
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,960
not harad not been to Kdana yet because

1564
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,839
there's no calling and I've seen People

1565
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,040
coming from Bangalore, from

1566
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:17,280
Hyderabad, four five days. Amazing of

1567
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,640
the DT calls. Can I take you back to

1568
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,280
that four year timeline? Yep. Uh

1569
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:26,000
Rishies, you have to do uh see depending

1570
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,960
upon the spiritual calling especially

1571
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,400
talking about mountains. I would say do

1572
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:34,480
Rishies, do uh Badrinat, do the punched

1573
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,160
also. Very interesting. This is where

1574
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,400
Shiv had taken the form of a buffalo and

1575
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,079
there are five punched. I would say do

1576
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,559
Adi Kalash. And if you actually into it,

1577
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,920
Kalash is the highest.

1578
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:49,839
Okay. I'm I'm also going to have a go at

1579
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,280
it. Yeah. Okay. And I'll I'll explain

1580
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,640
why. Yeah. For each because I want to

1581
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,760
know your point of view. Yeah. I think

1582
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,280
that if you wish for your own personal

1583
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,520
spiritual evolution as well as life

1584
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,720
evolution, the mountains are a must in

1585
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,240
your 20s, especially if you're Indian.

1586
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,480
Uh first and foremost, Rishies is my

1587
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,960
pick as well because it's got the right

1588
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,200
kind of amenities to make the mountain

1589
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,640
seem friendly. Point and it's a base for

1590
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:20,000
you to experience the blue Ganga. Yeah.

1591
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:24,559
You know, uh Kunjapuri, Mata, Mandr etc.

1592
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,240
Perfect. Uh the the goua uh Basha Basha.

1593
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,680
Yes. Uh very nice first mountain trip.

1594
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,760
Uh so this is the second one that to

1595
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,839
Kiranga Kasal region go see nature go

1596
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,799
see the beauty that god has created

1597
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:41,359
because the landscapes and the flora

1598
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,640
there uh it's like nowhere else in India

1599
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,640
and I've traveled through Kashmir as

1600
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,240
well the third one I would point people

1601
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:50,319
towards is the general Kangada area

1602
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,839
uh because of all the there's too many

1603
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,680
secrets there's too many things to do

1604
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:55,440
you know I was blessed to have some

1605
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:58,000
great encounters with great saints in

1606
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,559
Kanga so it is another territory

1607
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,040
And the mountains are huge and there's

1608
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,680
such energetic differences in different

1609
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:08,480
parts of Kangra. Dhamala is accessible.

1610
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,280
If you want the party cafe vibe, go up

1611
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,760
to Dharmot. Uh but for me, one of the

1612
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,079
benefits of being in Kangra is closely

1613
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,599
observing Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah. Like

1614
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,039
we're blessed in India to have that

1615
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,559
presence of Tibetan Buddhism. Very

1616
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,400
strong that it should be there. Yeah.

1617
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,400
And the fourth place I'd point people

1618
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:31,119
towards I want to say Kdarat but we saw

1619
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:34,720
all the videos of it being overcrowded.

1620
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:37,920
Which is why perhaps I would point them

1621
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:40,079
uh towards Nepal.

1622
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,359
Nepal is something you know it's like if

1623
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,440
you go to Nepal go there for a

1624
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:47,520
month because because you do sadna there

1625
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,079
you absorb the place you understand it

1626
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,760
has everything. It has shaky beats, it

1627
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:56,160
has beav, it has just being there. So

1628
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,400
it's another see Kashmir, Nepal, the

1629
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,240
other dimensions if you touch into and

1630
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,799
start living it. Yeah. And if for

1631
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,079
whatever reason you are not inclined to

1632
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,520
visiting the mountains but you still

1633
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,359
want spiritual evolution just go to

1634
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,280
Banaras. Yeah. Banaras is like home. You

1635
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,960
know many people don't like Banaras

1636
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,960
because it's too much for them. Oh it's

1637
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,280
dirty. It is like this. It is overly

1638
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,640
crowded. But I think uh if you start

1639
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,039
walking on the path you will be dragged

1640
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,079
to Banaras at one point of time in your

1641
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:27,440
life. Yeah. Yes. Definitely.

1642
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,960
You know I adored my trip to Vindavan as

1643
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,720
well. Yeah. Uh but I faced the

1644
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,880
psychological challenge in Vindavan that

1645
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,160
because of the layers of humanization.

1646
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,760
Yes. Uh I was not able to exactly absorb

1647
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,599
the nucleus of it but it it was

1648
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,000
important. I went to the Radhar Raman

1649
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:49,520
temple. Beautiful. My first um encounter

1650
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,839
of renavan was with my guru and um I

1651
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,680
can't remember it's taty tatya guru tata

1652
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,160
swami there was a guru who lived there

1653
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,319
never left that space and he has taken

1654
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,359
samadi there are no lights in the ashram

1655
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:06,319
they're only diyas and I was like

1656
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:07,599
everything is same like wow yeah um

1657
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,599
again I don't know why this happened to

1658
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,720
me in vindawan on my first day I went to

1659
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,680
a riverside arti

1660
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,319
and This was the one week in the year

1661
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,559
where a lot of bugs are going through

1662
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:22,799
breeding season. Yeah, there were so

1663
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,720
many bugs like at the art they were

1664
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,640
doing the art there was like this blue

1665
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,760
neon light because we were already very

1666
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,680
ethereal but there were so many bugs

1667
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,039
that they were entering our ears, our

1668
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,640
nose, our mouth. Uh the people who lived

1669
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,480
in Vindavan, they were still okay with

1670
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,280
being there. It was almost like that

1671
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,200
arti pushed us out of itself comfort

1672
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,599
zone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And yet

1673
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,799
people do it there. There are these this

1674
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,480
is what people need to understand about

1675
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,400
India travel. You know even with

1676
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,559
foreigners I tell them to visit India

1677
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,559
but when they ask me where first I do a

1678
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,960
personality test on them.

1679
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,720
You have to otherwise uh but one

1680
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,720
shouldn't just seek out fivestar hotels

1681
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,960
and you should not Instagram friendly

1682
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,119
locations and more than that to

1683
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,319
experience a place what we do is we live

1684
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:10,799
locally we be local and if you're doing

1685
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,160
a yatra specifically don't just go to

1686
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,000
the temple and come stay there for

1687
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,079
minimum 3 to 4 days to understand the

1688
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,240
place and ask the dity for experiences

1689
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,000
yes yes yes and always have that

1690
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,359
surrender that the dity will take care

1691
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
that underlining knowledge should be

1692
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,640
there otherwise you won't

1693
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,520
you want in fact very strange that we

1694
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,240
were in one night dragged to Tarapit

1695
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,440
first experience in Kolkata yeah very

1696
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:37,520
strange so you'll realize in sad the

1697
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,280
dity will also drag you and get it done

1698
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,960
if that understanding is there then it

1699
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,640
will become a successful because you are

1700
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,440
in surrender and things will open up

1701
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,000
hell will come in one night we one day

1702
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,280
morning 6:00 you went to Darab did sad

1703
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,760
and came back again the same night and

1704
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,640
the road was horrible but we knew that

1705
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:57,520
it has been done that attitude should be

1706
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,359
there for such places.

1707
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,880
This is such a potent piece of

1708
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,880
information that we have dispelled in

1709
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,480
this podcast. Yeah. And uh more than

1710
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,720
that you know it's good we are opening

1711
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,240
up for people especially for generation

1712
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,799
who is new and they want to jump into it

1713
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,240
and one should not act cool go into

1714
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:17,440
smasha and do agori and all. No you

1715
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:20,799
start surrendering it will come actually

1716
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,960
the journey will take. Yeah,

1717
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:25,359
let's close this travel chapter. This is

1718
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,480
enough. Y because if if we we can keep

1719
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:30,400
going on. Yeah, true. But uh it's a very

1720
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,640
good call to action. You know, we've

1721
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,319
given good options here and it whoever

1722
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,480
wants to now benefit from this will take

1723
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:38,720
this information and move forward which

1724
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,359
is why we come back to the base topic of

1725
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,359
time. Yep.

1726
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:45,039
How is one supposed to view aging?

1727
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,359
Because honestly, even at my age, I miss

1728
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,920
my childhood.

1729
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,599
you know uh two things I'm understanding

1730
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,559
first we have to come into acceptance

1731
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,200
that we are going to die you're not a

1732
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:00,960
chiranji I'm not a chiranji we are going

1733
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,359
to die secondly u you will accept aging

1734
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,640
and childhood when you're living that

1735
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:09,440
thing 100% and that happens with time

1736
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,079
you mature with time and third is if you

1737
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,480
let go of your

1738
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:16,319
past three things if that commumulates

1739
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,000
together then you will realize realize

1740
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,960
you're at peace otherwise you'll never

1741
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,759
be in peace. What is letting go of one's

1742
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,000
past? Accepting everything that has

1743
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,239
happened and taking responsibility that

1744
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,839
it is not God's doing or others doing.

1745
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:33,120
You are responsible because you have not

1746
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,759
taken the right decision

1747
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:38,719
and you're suffering because uh you know

1748
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,279
um at one point of time uh you are

1749
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,359
placed in situations where you know it

1750
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,679
is wrong yet you do it and later you

1751
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:49,040
regret. So that awareness I do want to

1752
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,319
do let it go should come.

1753
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,560
You know what you're saying is very

1754
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,480
important life advice in terms of taking

1755
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,600
responsibility for the own for the

1756
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,520
outcomes that your life has given you.

1757
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,759
There is a counter question here asked

1758
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,679
by people when because I've spoken about

1759
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,920
this concept publicly. The counter

1760
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:09,040
question is uh what about the external

1761
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,719
negative stimuli that happened in

1762
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,199
childhood which you were not in control

1763
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,640
of. See this question comes to us also a

1764
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:18,000
lot that you know why this has happened

1765
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,560
to me I have gone through so much but in

1766
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,880
this aspect when I talk about karma or

1767
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,080
kum then it will be justice or because

1768
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,799
they won't register that has happened to

1769
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,880
me but if you have taken a human body

1770
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,120
and you're going through something you

1771
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,120
have to go through the process the

1772
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,679
mental conditioning that has happened

1773
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,120
has to be changed so if you have gone

1774
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,799
through a process of something which is

1775
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,679
not in the normals norms of the soc

1776
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:46,400
society come into acceptance. Yeah. And

1777
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,319
this is not us removing empathy from

1778
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,960
this conversation at all. Yeah. There is

1779
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,480
nothing. And life is going to drag you.

1780
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,080
You're not the only person that is going

1781
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,920
through it. People are going to other

1782
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,600
the things. So don't become a victim

1783
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,360
because the victim attitude is the

1784
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,719
biggest downfall even in a normal

1785
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,280
journey of life. Can we talk about this

1786
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:06,000
victim attitude from a sanatan dharma

1787
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,760
perspective? I hear that a lot that I've

1788
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,520
been praying to shift for so many years

1789
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,520
but I'm not getting a job. I've been

1790
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,719
doing this sa I'm not getting this.

1791
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,480
You're not doing it because your

1792
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,719
intention is not there. And you know it

1793
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,080
is very easy to become a victim. Very

1794
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:23,040
easy. That is the easiest way to cover a

1795
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,640
ego. And uh it is sounds it may sound

1796
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,560
very very this that how is it possible?

1797
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,560
But the high ego you're tested with your

1798
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:32,159
ego a lot.

1799
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:35,040
Um what did you say the intention is not

1800
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,800
there. Uh so um the victim attitude is

1801
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,480
that I hear so many people messaging us

1802
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,760
saying that I've done so much but Shiva

1803
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,000
is not listening to me, Kali is not

1804
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,600
listening to me, Shiva is angry with me.

1805
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,679
No he's not angry. You are not

1806
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,360
satisfied. You're expecting a lot.

1807
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,960
You're coming into victim. You just do

1808
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,040
your best of fruits. That is the main

1809
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,040
teaching of Bhagat Gita. Prasad buddhi

1810
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,040
again.

1811
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,640
One more thing is very clear. If I have

1812
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,040
done my best at one point of time, what

1813
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,280
more can I do? Leave it.

1814
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,280
that satisfaction no one can take it and

1815
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:10,000
I know I've done this the result will be

1816
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,159
given to you what you deserve. Yeah, I

1817
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,040
keep repeating this on so many episodes,

1818
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:16,960
but the divine registers hard work.

1819
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,000
Definitely. If if you feel in your heart

1820
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,480
that you're working hard, it's

1821
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,440
registered up there. Definitely your

1822
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,120
intention, your action is of course and

1823
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,120
the present action that you're doing

1824
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,239
also is giving you certain results good

1825
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,920
or bad depending upon your actions. Now

1826
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,800
you can't run away from the law. No

1827
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,880
matter who you are, human body laws are

1828
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,800
there. Which Bhagat Gita would you point

1829
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,000
the users to?

1830
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I would point uh whatever I have learned

1831
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,960
is from my guru's Bhagat Gita Vanala.

1832
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,040
Vanwala. Yeah, she writes beautifully

1833
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,880
and she has written Nitya Yog. Simple

1834
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,360
language, easy to understand. But the

1835
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,760
problem is we forget what is nity? Nity

1836
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,239
yog is a constant union. Nitya means

1837
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,679
union of the individual self with the

1838
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,320
supreme self. So she has written

1839
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,960
commentaries on that. And whenever I

1840
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,520
read it, I'm again charged. But again,

1841
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,679
we forget with time. So the habit of

1842
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,520
reading it should be there. Yeah. You

1843
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,760
know, I'm wearing a whoop which like

1844
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,440
monitors my heart rate and it's like a

1845
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,600
fitness band for lack of better words.

1846
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:26,080
Um whenever I'm podcasting, it could be

1847
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,679
a bad guest also. Okay. Uh but obviously

1848
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,840
that happens rarely. Mostly it's great

1849
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:34,640
guests. Uh my stress levels fall heavily

1850
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,360
on on my app. My heart rate actually

1851
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,120
drops a lot. I'm a I'm in a very relaxed

1852
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,440
state of being. It's a good state of

1853
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,840
being. Yeah. I feel very stressed out

1854
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,480
outside of the podcast room as you've

1855
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,719
seen today and since you've known me as

1856
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,840
well. My challenge at this point is how

1857
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:54,000
do I bring that nity to that part of

1858
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,480
life which is outside flow state. It

1859
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,760
will come. It is coming. But the problem

1860
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:02,000
is you know

1861
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:04,960
what just in this scenario the higher

1862
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,000
you are going the higher the challenges

1863
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,800
are being placed in that is the struggle

1864
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,400
and that will also come it will become

1865
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,120
okay you will realize how to handle it

1866
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,199
you realize how to tackle it and you're

1867
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,800
much much better I say this all the time

1868
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,480
because now I'm closely associated

1869
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,880
watching you throughout the day and in

1870
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,320
fact you spent an entire day together so

1871
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,640
I'm realizing you're enjoying the

1872
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,800
process yet and uh whatever I've seen

1873
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,199
you closely and understood you are

1874
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,920
you're operating a big massive team so

1875
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:35,679
you're sad and you know I've realized a

1876
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,920
change in your language oh will take

1877
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,520
care I'm doing my best so it is

1878
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,400
happening it happened because of meeting

1879
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,600
people like yourself no it is all his

1880
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:48,320
leela we are just instrument you forget

1881
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,320
that you are not the doer I'm not the

1882
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,880
doer

1883
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:55,040
let it flow you may seem or you may

1884
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,400
think that it is going wrong but That

1885
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:01,159
great cosmic intellect knows everything.

1886
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,480
I wonder what the

1887
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:07,280
divine's relationship with human

1888
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,440
difficulty is. What is God's

1889
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,679
relationship with the difficulty he

1890
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:15,080
throws towards us? You know, uh from a

1891
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,600
very high point of view, there is no

1892
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:19,400
difficulty. Our mind creates difficulty

1893
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,719
because things are not going our

1894
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:25,600
way. In divinity, everything is a whole

1895
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:27,280
picture. So when you let go there is

1896
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,040
nothing to be worried about because

1897
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:33,600
Gangama is always flowing. It merges in

1898
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,280
the end. So even if there's a block, if

1899
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,840
there's a rock, there's a body, she will

1900
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,360
just go through it. But if we think that

1901
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,199
we are the body blocking it, if we think

1902
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:45,199
we are the rock, there's a difference.

1903
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:47,840
And you know something very important

1904
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:51,600
that you also mentioned at the age of

1905
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:54,400
22, be good humans. That is the crux. M

1906
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,960
be good humans first then run to aguris

1907
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,960
or this or be good humans understand

1908
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,679
that the problem is within you your

1909
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,840
jealousy your anger stop blaming pushing

1910
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,920
others be good humans out of all the

1911
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,960
episodes we've done this is the one

1912
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:12,080
where we've mentioned tantra the least

1913
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:14,719
yes and we have there is so much to talk

1914
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:17,400
about always I say that there are so

1915
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:20,320
many things and I'm liking that we are

1916
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,480
addressing young people and tantra is a

1917
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,080
small aspect There is vdanta, there is

1918
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,480
bacti, there is koshas, there is

1919
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,560
upanisha, there is so much. Why people

1920
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,159
are tantra is good only if you have a

1921
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,719
guru. Again I come to that or you have

1922
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:36,320
right knowledge because the higher you

1923
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,159
rise the harder you fall in tantra.

1924
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,120
Why is this knowledge coming through

1925
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:42,880
this episode? The world needs this. I

1926
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,199
think the world needs and I think the

1927
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,239
way we are interacting a lot of young

1928
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:51,360
people are inclined and uh they need

1929
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:53,600
some no one is talking about foundation

1930
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,199
foundation foundation how to start my

1931
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,760
journey with no one's talking about that

1932
01:15:55,199 --> 01:16:00,320
everyone's talking about mantra job yes

1933
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,840
and yes so even before mantra there are

1934
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,480
phases that a person has to go through

1935
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,120
reach mantra now I think that is the

1936
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:11,600
reason now we are flowing

1937
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,760
yeah so even if I chant namish or

1938
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:17,040
I need to know few things. I need to

1939
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,520
be satic. I need to have some

1940
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,199
discipline. I need to wake up on time.

1941
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,080
Yeah. I think the foundation is

1942
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:26,239
required. Yeah. Very foundationoriented

1943
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,920
conversation. Yeah. It's so weird how

1944
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,199
cyclic content is. This was the kind of

1945
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,239
conversations I used to have in year

1946
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:34,080
one. Yeah. And I almost felt like damn

1947
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:35,760
there's no market for this anymore. And

1948
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,320
this is such an enriching conversation.

1949
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,760
There is. there is because u we have

1950
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,679
been talking so much about detail

1951
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,440
aspects people are still craving for

1952
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,520
basic things that you know how can I

1953
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,199
work on my jealousy how can I let my job

1954
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,960
go how if someone cheated on me I should

1955
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:51,280
be okay I we get such questions even now

1956
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,199
yeah let's open up one of these this is

1957
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,480
what I have been told is a very jenzy

1958
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:58,719
thing u see I I actually have I work

1959
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,960
with only jenz's primarily

1960
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,640
and there's a vibe in that as well

1961
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,440
because it's a lot of young energy and a

1962
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:08,239
lot of intelligence I am told by a lot

1963
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,239
of them that a lot of people in their

1964
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:12,239
generation are run by for more driven

1965
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,840
culture. Fear of missing out. Yeah. And

1966
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,360
that's very obvious because social media

1967
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,719
is showcasing the highlight reels of

1968
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,199
other people. You think that that's a

1969
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:22,480
reality. Those people also suffering.

1970
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:23,840
Everyone is suffering. For context, you

1971
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,880
know, people again people think my life

1972
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,679
is stunning. You you're my bro beyond

1973
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,239
this. Like you've you've seen what we go

1974
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,159
through. I have spent an entire day with

1975
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,440
him

1976
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:37,880
bonding. He is struggling. We all are

1977
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:41,040
struggling. His struggles other levels.

1978
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,600
So life is different.

1979
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,600
Now that we've said that context, yeah,

1980
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,440
I really want to talk about this FOMO

1981
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,679
angle. You know, there's apps that have

1982
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:54,960
come out where you can

1983
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:57,120
rent video footage from happening

1984
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,679
concerts and happening clubs in your

1985
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,360
city. Yeah. upload it onto your story so

1986
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,760
it looks like you were present at those

1987
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:08,640
concerts and those clubs.

1988
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:10,080
Like I have so much to say here but I

1989
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,600
actually want to approach this very

1990
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,360
empathetically.

1991
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:18,080
Over to you. You know uh what I believe

1992
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:21,040
it is two important things. It is that

1993
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:24,080
you want to show people that you exist

1994
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:27,040
and you want some kind of uh recognition

1995
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,719
that I am there. Secondly, loneliness. I

1996
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,239
think loneliness is a layer beneath

1997
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:35,600
these two. Yes. So we want to be there

1998
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:37,280
to and it's a very dark phase because uh

1999
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,360
that is the reason no love is also

2000
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,679
conditioned very very conditioned and we

2001
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,360
try to seek attention. So these are way

2002
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,600
of seeking attention but beneath that is

2003
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,560
loneliness and acknowledgement that I

2004
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,920
exist. So is loneliness the root cause

2005
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:54,800
of this? I think it is a package of

2006
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,040
fear, loneliness, rejection and people

2007
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,719
are scared of being lonely. If I tell

2008
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,840
someone to just be in a room, they can't

2009
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,600
even stay there for half an hour. Do you

2010
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,960
think one layer deeper, do you think

2011
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,120
that this is because people run away

2012
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,840
from what's actually gone on in their

2013
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,840
life? Definitely. And I have realized

2014
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,840
that people have a fear to confront

2015
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,239
nowadays.

2016
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,480
Sure. They don't want to confront. Sure.

2017
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:20,640
Themselves. Yeah. two things I believe

2018
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,560
very stupid it is but it is true what

2019
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,840
the other person is going to think and

2020
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,080
what is their status and what the

2021
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,840
society will think and that has ruined

2022
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,080
the very practically I'm talking about

2023
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,320
what is happening confrontation and that

2024
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,000
is the reason again communication is

2025
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:37,480
very important for any

2026
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,760
relationship how do we solve for

2027
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:43,440
loneliness on a personal level like if I

2028
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,600
am a lonely 22 year old who is feeling

2029
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,440
for wants those expensive sneakers can't

2030
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,880
afford it wants that expensive car,

2031
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,760
can't afford it. Wants to be at the

2032
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,440
expensive concert, can't afford it. My

2033
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,480
actual problem is loneliness. Right.

2034
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:58,159
Yeah. This is a major problem. I think

2035
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,520
at that age, the parents play an

2036
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:03,400
important role. Secondly, at that age,

2037
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,760
we need someone to communicate

2038
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,640
with. And thirdly, spiritual knowledge

2039
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,960
is important. Without that, forget young

2040
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,640
people at 50 60 are feeling only having

2041
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,880
so many experiences. Oh, that's a whole

2042
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,800
other gamut. That's another they they

2043
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,840
have experienced life and when the

2044
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,960
children tell them that you're feeling

2045
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,360
they're not in acceptance because they

2046
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,800
think that they have seen more life.

2047
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,640
Yeah. It's a vicious cycle you know

2048
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,400
so that right knowledge of is very

2049
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:33,760
important you know I don't like saying

2050
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:36,960
this but it's a sad decade right now

2051
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,719
it is but time will change at one point

2052
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,159
of time it is people are like this at

2053
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,560
the other time there is a rise in

2054
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,880
awareness rise in spirituality rise of

2055
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,080
people want to do things and at the same

2056
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,600
time there's another there's too much of

2057
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,080
information

2058
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,560
too much of information you know the

2059
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,520
only solution in All this is to go back

2060
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:59,280
to the foundational blocks that is be

2061
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:02,159
kind, do your best, read spiritual

2062
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:05,920
thought. Yeah. Can I write can I add in

2063
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:07,760
a little negative like input here? Yeah.

2064
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,600
Uh cut off the wrong people from your

2065
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,480
life. Yeah.

2066
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,880
So important man. You know I've realized

2067
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:16,320
uh you know that the person is bad but

2068
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,239
you can't let go because you are

2069
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,520
attached to that person. There's no

2070
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:24,080
acceptance. But uh I think one kick and

2071
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,679
one nudge on the head at that point is

2072
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,960
very important. That cut off. If you

2073
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,840
can't cut off someone, at least distance

2074
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,719
yourself. Yeah. Like if someone's uh

2075
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,159
causing you jealousy. Yeah. If someone's

2076
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,320
causing jealousy in you because of their

2077
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,600
own jealousy, someone's projecting their

2078
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,840
own insecurities. People do that. People

2079
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:43,199
do that. People push it and make you

2080
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,880
come in guilt and come in very

2081
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,880
emotional stages. Yeah. Your own

2082
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,640
loneliness is a swamp that you've been

2083
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,080
pushed into because you've chosen the

2084
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,960
wrong people before the loneliness

2085
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:55,440
began. That is the reason I tell

2086
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,920
everyone one arm distance with everyone.

2087
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:01,360
Yeah. Because there's a very fine line

2088
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:03,280
of entering your space and just knowing

2089
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,760
you. What do you do to solve your

2090
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,920
loneliness when you can't expand your

2091
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,679
social circle? That is the thing. No,

2092
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,760
whoever you're close to, just talk it

2093
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,920
out. That is the first way to let it

2094
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,080
out. The problem is we are even scared

2095
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,080
to come out and talk about it. This is

2096
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,239
what I

2097
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:22,560
believe. So talk talk just let it out.

2098
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:25,760
But again you know if I am sharing then

2099
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:29,120
oh what will they think? Oh I become

2100
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:31,360
weak. Just talk it out. Let it out. And

2101
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,280
uh you know at that age the mind is

2102
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:36,960
influenced so easily so

2103
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:39,840
easily. That is the reason go step out

2104
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,920
do run jog. Let that energy come out.

2105
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,920
Talk it out. And I'm sure right people

2106
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:48,000
come if just hold on like religion is

2107
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,920
effectively psychology for many many

2108
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,480
generations of human beings. True. This

2109
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,199
is a generation that's forgotten the

2110
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,800
roots. Yeah. And I think that's why

2111
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:59,199
you've also grown the way you've grown

2112
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:02,159
on social media because you answer

2113
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:04,560
exactly this question that I'm sure you

2114
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:06,960
have lots of people on your page who at

2115
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,960
one point fought for carnivore diet,

2116
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,719
fought for veganism, fought for

2117
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,560
feminism, fought for men's rights and

2118
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,960
they're like no no I don't know why but

2119
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,080
bah's content is like settling down my

2120
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:20,239
head and heart. You know what we have

2121
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,480
realized on our journey is that you

2122
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:25,120
explain with logic you give them an

2123
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,040
understanding and don't fake up things

2124
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,760
just be the way you are people will

2125
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,840
understand but it is a run mechanism no

2126
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,960
that people go through like if I am

2127
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,000
projecting something because I'm

2128
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,159
insecure about it and then we want

2129
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,080
groups we want people but the fact is

2130
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:42,639
when you're being honest and you share

2131
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:47,280
what is written the text I think that is

2132
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:50,880
experiential no two things is There a

2133
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:56,080
book or a shastra from Sanadan that

2134
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:58,560
solves for loneliness. Bhagat Gita.

2135
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,639
Bhagat Gita is the book because it the

2136
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,280
first chapter it says starts with

2137
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:06,639
sorrow. Can you condense down the

2138
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:10,000
learnings of the first chapter? Um in

2139
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:13,040
very simple simple language. It is said

2140
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:16,560
that you if you channelize your sorrow

2141
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,880
or your pain in the right direction you

2142
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,199
will be experiencing the highest. Sorrow

2143
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,920
is sorrow is also energy. Yes.

2144
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:25,840
Everything is a yog in Bhagwat Gita 18

2145
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,239
chapters they are talking to unite. So

2146
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,639
if I take this petty victim attitude

2147
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:32,239
that why god is like this why why and

2148
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,679
channel it to a divinity that okay you

2149
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,960
know what there's a greater energy in

2150
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:37,440
simple language that I'll leave it to

2151
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,159
bhagan I will and you know it is very

2152
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,360
amazing personally as you mentioned and

2153
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:43,120
I've realized throughout the day that

2154
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,679
you said oh it is better it is better it

2155
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,360
is better though it may be words for me

2156
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,800
but you have experienced it you won't

2157
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,480
repeat it all the time or though maybe

2158
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,520
it is worse for you somewhere that

2159
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:56,000
experience is coming so that change and

2160
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,280
channelizing is again evolution

2161
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,239
Yep. Uh I think people loosely know that

2162
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:06,040
the Bhagavat Gita was recited by Shri

2163
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:09,440
Krishna to the warrior Arjun. Yes.

2164
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:12,239
On the day the Mahabharat was beginning.

2165
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,520
Yes. To understand it further. Shri

2166
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:17,679
Krishna loosely froze time, paused time

2167
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,679
and explained it to Arjun. Because Arjun

2168
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,760
had too many questions in his head

2169
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:24,880
because during the war he was supposed

2170
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,800
to face his own cousins, his guru. Yes.

2171
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,280
his grandfather

2172
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,280
he was confused he was tired didn't want

2173
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,960
to go to war yeah and then over the

2174
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,679
course of the Bhagat Gita Shri Krishna

2175
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:39,040
explains why he must do his duty go to

2176
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:41,840
war and also then went on to explain how

2177
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:45,199
to navigate through life Shri Krishna

2178
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:47,360
was his sari his charioteer yes and he

2179
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:50,480
was literally his charity but he was

2180
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:52,320
also the charity of his mind yes so I've

2181
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,800
not read the entire Bhagat Gita yet I'm

2182
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,400
in the process but what I sense Hence is

2183
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,560
that when you begin reading the Bhagat

2184
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,719
Gita, you will notice that Sri Krishna

2185
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,320
becomes your charity as well. Definitely

2186
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,560
out of that pool of sorrow and

2187
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:07,600
confusion. We all come from the same

2188
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,400
source. Again and again the knowledge is

2189
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,400
always there. For you that divinity has

2190
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,679
taken a form of a beer. For me she has

2191
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,360
taken a form of a Kali. Wow. And uh for

2192
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,440
Arjun she has he has taken a form of

2193
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,199
Bhagwan. Yeah. And you know it is very

2194
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:24,719
strange when you read uh and understand

2195
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:26,719
the Gita in detail. He purposely got the

2196
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,960
chariot in front of his guru and his

2197
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,520
cousins. And it is a battlefield of life

2198
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,000
that we are going through all the time

2199
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,639
where we'll be placed not and it is to

2200
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,239
make us realize you will not be placed

2201
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,560
in such situation that you have to kill

2202
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:42,320
your own guru and your own cousins. So

2203
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,960
your problem is not higher than Ajun's

2204
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:47,199
problem. Yet Bhagwan has solved it. Your

2205
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,639
instigment problems will be solved when

2206
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:52,760
you surrender. You know when a baby is

2207
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:56,719
born it's a soul that's entered

2208
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:59,120
bulok. H sure right like yeah before

2209
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,360
when it comes out or the process yes

2210
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,520
it's re-entered bull at least it's open

2211
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,199
to material reality again it's outside

2212
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:08,840
the uterus

2213
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:12,480
um that child that

2214
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:15,440
baby is obviously not aware of the

2215
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,159
battlefield that awaits it in the form

2216
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:21,679
of human life. No, there are two

2217
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:25,040
possibilities. Um, if the baby has done

2218
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:27,679
some past sadnas, that awareness may

2219
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,080
come in this birth also from the

2220
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,159
beginning. from the beginning. Secondly

2221
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:34,400
also there might be a possibility that

2222
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:37,040
uh who knows it might be the baby's love

2223
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,480
journey like great Ramana Maharishi or

2224
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:44,080
so they might be in that state or the

2225
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:47,000
baby might be a completely

2226
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,440
u baby who born

2227
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,280
to solve all the problems. So they may

2228
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,000
go through a very difficult life. Many

2229
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,600
many possibilities.

2230
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,360
You know people don't get this. I've

2231
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,440
actually had some billionaires ask me

2232
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,880
what my goal is in life. And I say that

2233
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,040
I want to spiritually evolve and

2234
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,880
everything else is catered towards that.

2235
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:08,000
Another story associated with Arjun is

2236
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,800
how in his childhood he was called up by

2237
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,639
his guru in front of all his cousins and

2238
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,880
he was asked to shoot the eye of a

2239
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,320
wooden bird on a tree. But before he was

2240
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,120
called up the other cousins were called.

2241
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,880
His brothers were also called. And

2242
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,719
before any of the brothers or the

2243
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,239
cousins were allowed to take the shot,

2244
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,560
the guru would asked them, "What do you

2245
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:28,560
see?" Someone said, "I see the sky, the

2246
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,159
tree, the bird." Someone said, "I see

2247
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,440
the bird in the branch." Someone said,

2248
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:35,840
"I see you, Guru." Someone said, "I see

2249
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,920
everything around me." Arjun was the

2250
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,560
only prince who came up and said, "I

2251
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,080
only see the eye of the bird." So the

2252
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,760
guru says, "Do you see anything else at

2253
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,520
all?" He's like, "No, I only see the eye

2254
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,080
of the bird." And then the guru says,

2255
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,280
"So take your shot." And the bird's eye

2256
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:52,800
explodes because of his arrow. Yes.

2257
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,000
This has been such a character building

2258
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,040
story for me because I've learned focus

2259
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,600
through this. But from a very practical

2260
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,840
human life

2261
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:06,199
perspective, what is my eye of the bird

2262
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:08,920
right now in life? It is one of two

2263
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:11,440
things. One, it's my

2264
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:14,679
present catered to my final goal of

2265
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:18,560
spiritual evolution. But if I don't end

2266
01:29:14,679 --> 01:29:21,520
up reaching a great point of spiritual

2267
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:24,960
evolution in this life, I want to ensure

2268
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:27,600
that my next birth when I take the form

2269
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,400
of a little baby again,

2270
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,880
that next birth should be very catered

2271
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:35,600
to spiritual evolution.

2272
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,440
Like I need to position my soul in the

2273
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,840
best possible place to be ready for the

2274
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:43,040
next birth or escape the cycle of birth

2275
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,679
and death in this birth itself.

2276
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,040
I think that this mentality is helping

2277
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,199
me right now. It's helping me keep that

2278
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,120
arrow locked in. So, one of these two

2279
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:53,520
things. But effectively, it's just

2280
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:56,159
spiritual evolution, which for me means

2281
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,679
everyday praying, meditating, doing my

2282
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,360
sad, being a kind person, trying to

2283
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,679
improve my body, doing the right thing

2284
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,639
in the

2285
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:05,280
world. Would you like to coach me

2286
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,199
further in this? See, this is a very

2287
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:10,400
similar question that Arjun had asked

2288
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:12,120
Bhagwan. What if I die and have not

2289
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,719
reached a pinnacle of human

2290
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:19,040
consciousness? What if in between I

2291
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,880
die? We call the yoke brushed. That

2292
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,199
means those evolved beings who have not

2293
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,440
reached the pakin, they come back again

2294
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:27,760
to continue their journey. So Bhagan

2295
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,840
said very nicely, don't worry. Whatever

2296
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,600
sanscar, whatever sadhas you have done

2297
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,280
will be taken to your next birth and

2298
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,960
your journey will start from there.

2299
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,120
You'll also be born in a family of

2300
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,679
yogis. The entire environment will be

2301
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:42,800
conducive and you will evolve. But again

2302
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:45,679
at that point of time if you waver and

2303
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,840
you go down the cycle will go again. So

2304
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:49,560
conditions will be provided but the

2305
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,800
human ego again is

2306
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:56,000
what problem. Do you consciously think

2307
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,400
of your next birth?

2308
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,880
Honest answer. How can an instrument

2309
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,360
think?

2310
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,920
It is the way it is. If he wants it is

2311
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,679
okay. If he doesn't want it is okay.

2312
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,239
Kali will decide everything what is

2313
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,600
there.

2314
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:13,520
This question is coming to me so I'm

2315
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,159
asking you. Okay. As you kept reading

2316
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,800
the Bhagat Gita in your process of

2317
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:20,159
reading it, I feel somewhere in the

2318
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,880
middle of the Gita was a very important

2319
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:25,000
lesson for you. Can you just repeat that

2320
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:29,360
lesson?

2321
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,760
Um for me very I think uh some of my

2322
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,679
past sanscaras and blessings of my guru.

2323
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:37,120
I used to question my guru the Gita all

2324
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:39,120
the time. What? Question her the Gita

2325
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,719
like ask questions from the Gita and she

2326
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,960
used to answer. What do you mean ask

2327
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:45,120
questions from the Gita? So when I used

2328
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,840
to read the Gita whatever doubts I had I

2329
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:49,600
used to go run to her and ask questions.

2330
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,239
So that was my learning and teaching of

2331
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:55,520
Gita phase and what I understood from

2332
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:58,639
Gita and what my takeaway is that in

2333
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:02,000
today's world you are not meant to leave

2334
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:04,400
everything and go in today's world

2335
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,800
participate in everything act everything

2336
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:09,760
go through everything but internally be

2337
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:12,000
established in Bhagan wow if you take

2338
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,480
this and you understand you have learned

2339
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,520
the Gita can I ask you a practical

2340
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,920
tangential question y how should one

2341
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,480
divide their time

2342
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,400
when it comes to balancing spiritual

2343
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,800
growth as well as professional life as

2344
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,239
well as family life and all that. Very

2345
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,000
important. This is what many people

2346
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:33,840
struggle with. You can't take a holiday.

2347
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,760
You have to get it in your system like

2348
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,440
drinking water. What do you mean? That

2349
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,760
means when you wake up in the morning,

2350
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,280
you have your time and do your sad. You

2351
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,679
have to do it that time. You can't do

2352
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,520
hanky panky that time. That means it

2353
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,320
should become a way of your life. That

2354
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,840
is the teachings of Gita. That means you

2355
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:54,800
divide everything equally. You um it

2356
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,520
takes time but it is possible. It is

2357
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:00,800
possible. That means sadha first, work

2358
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:04,159
time first, relax, sleeping time. You

2359
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:06,400
have to get it and that will change and

2360
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:08,719
move around according to your system.

2361
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:11,840
But that is the teaching that divide

2362
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:12,960
time equally

2363
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,520
effectively. You're saying it has to

2364
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,440
become a routine. routine and it is very

2365
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,120
difficult but if you hang on to your

2366
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:22,719
routine for six to eight months you will

2367
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:25,440
get it. Let's make it easy. Y

2368
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,760
I am of the belief that initially even a

2369
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,840
10-minute routine can at least begin

2370
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,880
your journey. Yeah. But it has to be a

2371
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,639
routine. Then you don't miss those 10

2372
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,199
minutes. But that's it. I'm not saying

2373
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,800
do sa for 1 hour 45 minutes. No. But 15

2374
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:39,440
minutes if I'm doing something stick to

2375
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,960
it for 6 months. Yeah. Every day. Every

2376
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,960
day. No matter what. If you're sleeping

2377
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,159
at 10:00, sleep at 10:00 no matter what.

2378
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,600
If people are going clubbing, people are

2379
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:47,600
going for a movie. No, I will sleep. In

2380
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,239
the beginning, you have to be harsh.

2381
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,320
That is what t is all about in modern

2382
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:54,560
world. Not going to the mountains and

2383
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:56,239
leaving family. But having this, okay, I

2384
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,480
will not eat after 7:00. I'll not eat.

2385
01:33:56,239 --> 01:34:02,239
That is my t. Once it becomes a cycle,

2386
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:03,920
you will realize that divinity is just

2387
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:06,400
you will have your own experiences.

2388
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:08,400
Yeah. Yeah. And honestly, I think people

2389
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,360
who get scared of this process of

2390
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,280
spiritual exercise. I don't want to

2391
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:16,000
meditate. I don't want to pray. I don't

2392
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:19,520
believe in it. What will this give me?

2393
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,080
My input is two things. One, let your

2394
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,600
experience lead your opinions. And

2395
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:28,320
two, eventually just know you're going

2396
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,440
to enjoy it. But take your body and your

2397
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:33,199
existence to that point. You know, the

2398
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,560
three important things that are binding

2399
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:38,159
us is sex, food, and sleep. When you get

2400
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,480
into routine and you get into higher

2401
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:42,880
sadness, you realize that the taste of

2402
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:46,320
the nectar is more beyond than anything,

2403
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:48,480
any relationship, any friend, any food.

2404
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,239
You are in a different state altogether.

2405
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:52,920
And later you realize that you don't

2406
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:55,520
need anyone. Everything is there within

2407
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,280
you and everything will all the

2408
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,360
experiences will be given according to

2409
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,920
your karma and whatever is required in

2410
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,880
your

2411
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,560
life. You're talking about spiritual

2412
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,679
experiences. every even material

2413
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,320
experiences if you're aiming for a big

2414
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:12,400
fancy car and if you don't deserve it

2415
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,760
it's not there do not come to you but

2416
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,199
that realization that okay I'll give my

2417
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,840
best leave but again simple things

2418
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:22,400
foundation today yes very important what

2419
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,080
an important conversation yeah what an

2420
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,760
important conversation this has been

2421
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,679
very I'm very happy that we are not

2422
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,880
justing touching tantra tantra all the

2423
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:33,120
time it is very rooted foundation

2424
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,880
conversation right I mean your practice

2425
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:39,360
is of another level. I've just begun my

2426
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:41,440
practices. But it it we qualified for

2427
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,360
these things because we worked on the

2428
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,719
foundations. Not saying from a place of

2429
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:49,840
ego, just seeing this from a place of

2430
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:49,840
perspective. Yeah. That yam nam basic

2431
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:56,080
basic Santo to be contented in any

2432
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,520
situation you don't need to chant or you

2433
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:00,600
just have to be aware. I have to be

2434
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:04,239
satisfied where I am but give my

2435
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:08,560
best. important.

2436
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:11,040
I have one last uh section I want to

2437
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,280
open up with you in this episode. Okay.

2438
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,199
Uh again because my mind is going to

2439
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,639
practicality throughout this

2440
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:21,120
conversation.

2441
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:22,480
Um the first time I experienced pranayam

2442
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:24,400
in my life and I think we've spoken

2443
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:27,760
pranayam in one of our episodes. The

2444
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:30,320
first time I experienced pranayam um it

2445
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,840
was almost like dizzying for my own

2446
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,320
head. I was like, "Wow, I didn't know

2447
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,239
that the simple practice of breathing

2448
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,400
through one nostril, breathing out

2449
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:43,120
through the other will create this shock

2450
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:43,120
wave in my head in a good way."

2451
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,960
Um, I'm not going to ask you to showcase

2452
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,480
a pranayam because you've done it

2453
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,719
throughout your content. We've done it

2454
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,880
on the show as well,

2455
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:56,080
but I would nudge the audiences to begin

2456
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,560
pranayam. Yeah. Uh, throughout. So, you

2457
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:00,080
know what? Can we demonstrate one if

2458
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:02,639
you're comfortable? Are you comfortable?

2459
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,920
I'm very comfortable. Could you can I

2460
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,440
tell you which one? Because this is the

2461
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,920
one coming through in my head. Okay.

2462
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:11,199
It's anulom. Anulom. Okay. There's a

2463
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,719
version of anom that my friend Sukritia

2464
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:16,960
spoke about on the show. It was a Shiva

2465
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:20,159
oriented episode. It's called Gayatri.

2466
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:23,040
Okay. I will show you basic anom that

2467
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:24,320
everyone can do. Sure. Okay. Um and let

2468
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,960
let's take the audience through it in

2469
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,920
this episode. Okay. So um I'm going to

2470
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,280
do a proper anomal with you with you. So

2471
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,040
of course you said cross leg. I can't

2472
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,800
fet your cross leg. Your spine should be

2473
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,440
straight. Now this is known as the

2474
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,960
pranam mudra. Your thumb out. Yeah.

2475
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,480
Thumb out. Last two fingers is not

2476
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,480
mentioned in any text. We call it the

2477
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,159
pranam mudra. Okay. Your your index

2478
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,679
finger your middle finger bent. Your

2479
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:47,840
ring finger and little finger straight.

2480
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,520
Yeah. If you can't do this you can do

2481
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,280
this. It is okay. Just keep your little

2482
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,199
finger. Yeah. But this is the mudra that

2483
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,679
we take because every mudra is also an

2484
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:57,360
important role. Okay. I'm telling you

2485
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,840
the traditional ankom villum if you do

2486
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,360
it for six months genuinely it will

2487
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,280
change your life I take my right hand

2488
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,040
I'm a righty secondly what people do to

2489
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,639
pranam is something for beginners that

2490
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,199
you should know never keep your elbow on

2491
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:11,040
your chest you're blocking your own

2492
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:14,560
breathing system so the elbow should be

2493
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:16,239
out yeah basic so that uh there are many

2494
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,320
breaths also but I'll just explain I

2495
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:20,400
don't know below we always start with

2496
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,560
the left nostril

2497
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,719
you keep the left nostril open no we

2498
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,119
always cover the right we start from the

2499
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:29,600
left you cover the right anulom means

2500
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:31,679
alternate nostril breathing so I'll

2501
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,760
inhale from the left left what about the

2502
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:36,480
other hand yeah you keep it gadra okay

2503
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:38,320
yeah now always start with a count of

2504
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:40,480
six so I'm just going to count it so

2505
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:42,159
because we are doing it together cover

2506
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,600
also one more thing I've seen many

2507
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:45,760
people complaining that the nose is

2508
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,840
bleeding this is light feather touch

2509
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:55,360
don't push it just feather touch you

2510
01:38:47,840 --> 01:39:01,920
inhale to the left inhale 6 5 4 3 2 1

2511
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:09,520
cover the nostril. Exhale right. 6 5 4 3

2512
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:16,880
2 1. Inhale right. 6 5 4 3 2 1. Cover

2513
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:20,560
the nostril. Exhale. 6 5 4 3 2 1. This

2514
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:23,440
is just one round of anomal. You inhale

2515
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:26,000
left nostril. You exhale right nostril.

2516
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,920
You inhale right nostril, you exhale

2517
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,239
left nostril.

2518
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,560
If you want some results in anomal 15

2519
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:34,960
minutes it should be done non-stop

2520
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:37,600
without any break. If you leave you

2521
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,520
start again 15 minutes. Okay. I want to

2522
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,080
add one anecdote. Yeah. Anecdotally

2523
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,639
please correct me if I'm wrong. I think

2524
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,480
this is an age where many humans are

2525
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,400
dealing with anxiety overthinking. This

2526
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,880
is one of the quickest hacks to reduce

2527
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:53,199
it and it will give you benefits

2528
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,520
immediately. Immediately. It's a fact.

2529
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:57,520
We have worked on it in a 10 to 15

2530
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,360
minute session of anomol vom. Do it for

2531
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,400
good 3 months without any break. Start

2532
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,880
with six always. Now we go to advance

2533
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:07,199
but that is

2534
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,520
that's got it. Yeah that is not for

2535
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:11,360
today. Not for today and uh you need a

2536
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,000
lot of lung capacity. You need bandas

2537
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,159
you need mudras you need you need bhija

2538
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
mantras. No again if you're going to ba

2539
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:21,040
there's another dimension but for

2540
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,360
beginner sit straight empty stomach wake

2541
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,840
up in the morning do analom and then

2542
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:27,760
close your eyes and

2543
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,199
meditate tell us after 6 months you will

2544
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,760
not ask questions you will increase your

2545
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:34,000
sadna because after balancing the ida

2546
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,480
and pna you can meditate easily can you

2547
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,679
break down the word pranayam

2548
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,080
pranayam uh pranayam comes from the root

2549
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:45,119
word pran and ayam pran is a vital

2550
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:47,199
energy without nothing is into existence

2551
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,440
without that prank chi life force but

2552
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:52,000
that's it and I am is you put it away to

2553
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:55,360
do it what to do it what but without

2554
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,600
this breath there is nothing and uh even

2555
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,320
in every haty yogic text we take gan

2556
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,880
samita takeaipika pranam is given

2557
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:05,920
emphasis even in tantra we do pranayam

2558
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:08,800
before we do mantra jab wow even when we

2559
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:11,440
do meditation we do anolom in fact the

2560
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,760
next step of anulom is nadishodan where

2561
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:17,600
we doing the same process we're inhaling

2562
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:20,320
But holding a breath. So kumbak is where

2563
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,239
pranam begins. What is kumbuk? Kumbukak

2564
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,239
is holding of the breath. So when I talk

2565
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:27,040
from a very experiential point of view,

2566
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:28,960
pranam is not breath. The holding of the

2567
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:31,040
breath in a certain manner is pranam.

2568
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,960
Because there's an oxygen exchange also.

2569
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:35,679
Kumbak is the key. The highest ratio

2570
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,719
that we take is 1 is to 4 is to2 1 is to

2571
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:42,320
4 is to 6. I've taken seen great people

2572
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:45,520
taking inhaling 10 holding 80 exhaling

2573
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:48,000
40. It is crazy. Yeah.

2574
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,679
Practical superficial angle on pranayam.

2575
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,880
Okay. Yes. Uh it changes the way you

2576
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:55,600
look. Yeah. And we're such a cosmetics

2577
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,760
oriented society nowadays. This is the

2578
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,280
greatest makeup you will ever use. Your

2579
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,080
skin will start shining. Not even

2580
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,600
exaggerating it. But you need practice.

2581
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,440
You need practice. And of course your

2582
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,600
meditations are deeper and all that. Um

2583
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:10,480
you know there is no way to

2584
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:12,000
scientifically explain pan yet. Yes. I

2585
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:14,480
think it'll be worked on by scientific

2586
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,159
research and then they'll figure um and

2587
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,600
you'll often see the people who deny

2588
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,960
pranayam completely are the ones who've

2589
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,400
not experienced it themselves. You can

2590
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,679
invite all of them to experience it with

2591
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,960
you. I've actually made a lot of

2592
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,480
skeptics sit with me and experience it.

2593
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,440
They're like okay I don't believe in God

2594
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:30,239
and yoga but I believe in this breath

2595
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:32,639
without breath you're nothing. No as you

2596
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:35,040
mentioned today we were talking is

2597
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:37,760
fabulous. If you think this is too much

2598
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:41,520
easier so

2599
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:44,400
just deep brea inhale. So exhale H with

2600
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,480
awareness slowly slowly these are all

2601
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,320
preparatory to get to pranam then

2602
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:52,000
there's level one level two level three

2603
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:54,000
that is another dimension that's why

2604
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,440
yoga I say

2605
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,040
you know all I'll say is this this is

2606
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:59,760
something Raji Nandi mentioned on the

2607
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:03,000
show so he said that the law of the

2608
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:07,719
material world is that

2609
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:10,960
um people or things that

2610
01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:13,040
contain slightly ly lower shy will be

2611
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,199
attracted to people or things that

2612
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:17,600
contain slightly higher shi. It's how

2613
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:20,320
the universe works.

2614
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,760
Now one other angle on this is if

2615
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,719
someone is famous and they're out in

2616
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,239
public, they will be a magnet for other

2617
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,239
people to come up. It's a very small

2618
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,760
way. If someone is rich, you will

2619
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,840
attract people who either want to work

2620
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,080
with you or want to benefit from your

2621
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,080
money etc.

2622
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,679
And I think that one of the material

2623
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:42,800
goals of human life should be to

2624
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,239
accumulate more shy.

2625
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,960
One can understand whatever they want

2626
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:49,280
through what I just said. But a very

2627
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:52,560
practical way of accumulating more shaky

2628
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:55,600
in your head, heart and soul is to

2629
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,840
regularly practice pranayam because pran

2630
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:01,440
is life force. True. It's almost like

2631
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:03,920
the petrol that fuels every other action

2632
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,080
in your body. Definitely. And it's not

2633
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,239
as simple as just being oxygen. It's the

2634
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,320
subtle layer beyond oxygen. It is the

2635
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:12,560
cleansing of the nadis, the flow of

2636
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:14,239
prana, the awakening of again we're

2637
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,239
coming to tantra but yes awakening of

2638
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:18,800
kini

2639
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:20,639
and it's so doable so easy. So it is a

2640
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,639
game changer. It's not even a

2641
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,800
meditation. It's it's something to do

2642
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:25,639
with your hands and your nostrils and it

2643
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,159
can

2644
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:29,600
begin unveiling the real version of

2645
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:33,840
reality to you. There is something

2646
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:36,560
called kapalati. uh kapal is this and

2647
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,119
shining skull. Yeah. And bati means to

2648
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,560
shine. So kapalbati there are seven to

2649
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,880
eight kinds of kapalati. Four are very

2650
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,199
famous. Basic kapalbati if you do with

2651
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:46,480
awareness 3 months you will have a

2652
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:49,840
drastic change in your concentration

2653
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:51,480
awareness. Drastic drastic means drastic

2654
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,679
and we have done it. So talking through

2655
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:56,880
experience but people don't want to do

2656
01:44:53,679 --> 01:45:00,719
this. People don't want people I don't

2657
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:02,320
know what you know I I realized

2658
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,639
somewhere when we started as of course

2659
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,520
we are still beginners no matter what

2660
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:10,239
even if you are tired raining headache

2661
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,600
what we roll the mat and we do once you

2662
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:13,679
touch the mat automatically you start

2663
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,920
doing it but rolling the mat and sitting

2664
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:18,080
and that is the effort and you do it for

2665
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,400
6 months automatically it's like going

2666
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,840
to the gym if you have not uh done your

2667
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,920
biceps for a long time the muscle will

2668
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:28,320
crave similarly the body will crave for

2669
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:30,400
M just begin. Yeah. Stay at it. Stay at

2670
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,080
it. Tiny easy goals which are doable.

2671
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,440
Yeah. Small small. Yeah. Things add up

2672
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,199
in the long term and there will be

2673
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,800
material benefits also. But that

2674
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,719
material benefit is an outcome of all

2675
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,239
the spiritual benefits. Foundation

2676
