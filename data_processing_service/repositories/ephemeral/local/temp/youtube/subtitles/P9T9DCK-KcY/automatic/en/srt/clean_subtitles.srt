As you keep aging, time keeps becoming shorter. The western philosophy is very simple. Time is linear. But when we talk about time in sanata, time is multi-dimensional. It keeps on changing. And a very practical example of time is the three states of consciousness. There is an understanding in the Gita known as prasad buddhi. Buddhi means intellect. Prasad is something that we go to the temple and take. So whatever is happening in your life, take it as a prasad from the divine. Wow. How you understand maya is where you'll go beyond time. Now suppose if I tell that this is my glass. I have associated with certain identity that I am myself. This glass is mine. But the problem is I don't realize in ignorance that this is temporary. Is behav and shiva one and the same? In higher states they all are one. You know when you start worshiping ship he's bolat he's just when you chant and you just surrender he will look after you. He's one of those gods that you call out he'll come first. When does he get annoyed? I got an experience of his when I was not doing a sad and then I realized that an enlightened being goes beyond the gonas. He becomes a witness that is called the turya. You are in a state where you have no anxiety, no fear, no mental issues. You are a perfect instrument and you're experiencing unconditional love. That is the reason you do sad. Ma kali stands for past, present and future. Maesneshwari stands for space, the carnal points. So when you do sadna, you realize that they're taking you beyond space, time and causation. [Music] The purpose of my career is to sit with you Bhavesh by and talk about what the world needs to listen to. Thank you Arbay. I'm good. Thank you. I think that um childhood is where a human mind first understands the concept of time. True. Would you like to talk about childhood? Would you like to talk about aging? Or would you like to begin with a mantra? I'm I'm just throwing the ball to you. Whatever you want to do. We will begin with a mantra and of course we are talking about Mahal. So we will pray to him. Uh we will chant the verses of Rdri and um of course we offer it everything to him because he is Makal. So, om. Sasha Maha you bow on to him who's beyond spaceime and causation. J Mahal Jakal. Yeah by coming back to time and childhood. Uh how do we start? Um I will start from the basics so that we can go. It's totally in your quote. Whenever we talk about time or whenever the time topic comes up, first thing that occurs to our mind is the fear of death because with time there is an expiry date and we are conditioned by the society. So whenever a baby is born or whenever someone comes into birth we celebrate we are happy but at the same time when that person or baby grows older the time of death has also come and the beauty is or maybe call it the drawback that we are conditioned that anything that we hold very close to us with time that also has an expiry date. The beauty is that we cherish it but with time we realize that has an expiry date. But if you ask me what time is from a spiritual point of view, again I'm juggling between practical and spiritual, there is no time. Time is just a concept that a mind has created. Again coming back to this reality. Now if you realize uh in our childhood time was going very fast, very very fast. If I tell I think I mentioned this last time, if I tell a small boy or my cousin or someone nephew that tomorrow we'll go for a movie for him tomorrow is like oh no tomorrow. But if the child likes eating a lollipop, kadam time is just half an hour becomes 2 minutes. Even for us, if you like something, time runs. If you don't like something, that same time is like, oh no. So the concept of time changes accordingly. And as we grow older and we look back, we realize life is just snap and life is over. Yeah, I'd seen this one graphic some time ago. Some time ago. uh it it showed the perception of time for a child versus the perception of time for an adult. So an easy way of understanding that is I would ask the viewers to go back to their second standard second grade and that distance of second to third grade or to fourth grade felt like a lot like in your fourth standard in your fourth grade you look back at second grade as being ages ago. True. Now switch to being 24. Age 24 is not too distant from age 22 even mentally speaking. True. But actually if you quantify both it's the same amount of time. True. The graphic basically showcas time as being much more stretched out in childhood. And as you keep aging, time keeps becoming shorter. True. I will throw more light on it. The western philosophy is very simple. Time is linear. Time is straight. According to western philosophy, we are born at A and we die at B. For example, I take birth, I go to school, I get married, eventually I'll die. But in sanatan, the concept of time is very different. We time according to us is circular. That means in a year we have 12 months. 1 minute has 60 seconds. Everything goes on circular. And again in that circle, you don't know where the time starts and when the time ends. However, in riguid beautifully time is given a beautiful concept. uh it is not a concept it is the understanding of the rishies and they got it to us in a very simple manner they have given axes x-axis yaxis and z-axis and there is a horse ashwa actually ashwa means a horse but when you break down a means no and swah means tomorrow that means there is no tomorrow and there are horses running spirally multiple directions going to multiple locas so what we understand from A to B is nothing. Time is multi-dimensional. It keeps on changing. And a very practical example of time is the three states of consciousness which is very very um we all go through it though we are aware but we experience it every day. For example, I'm in the awake state. I'm enjoying this conversation. Time is going very fast. If in this conversation I am not connecting, time will go very slow. I want to leave the room. Then comes the dream state. Dream state is very interesting because at the moment suppose Arab I'm talking to you and while talking you go to sleep now in your sleep you are dreaming that you are in Paris it's your world again there is that space and time again you snap out again you go to another dream where you might be at Cargill saving someone but when you wake up again you come in this so the concept of time has changed completely completely and in deep sleep when we go you don't know where time is. So the concept of time is so detailed and it is so much to learn and understand but our problem is we always live in our past or 90% in the future. So the concept of time is u very strange because we are conditioned. Suppose if someone is taking birth the time we are born the concept of time comes into play because everything works according to space time and causation that is des kalan nita we'll get there and now when suppose I'm born I will go to school I will get married I will learn eventually I'll die. So the western concept of time is that time is in one line it's linear and once we are born everything will go in straight line and it will come to an end. However, when we talk about sanatan time is very different. Everything is circular. It goes round. For example, if you talk about a year, it has 12 months. If you talk about 1 minute has 60 seconds. So everything is round round. Even everything even the weather is going round. So the time is circular where there is no beginning and no end. But in higher states of consciousness, as I mentioned, time is a mental concept. We create our own time. We create our own space but that doesn't mean that we're not affected. Of course in sad if you're high you can go beyond. For example um if I've cut my hand I will feel that pain and that burning in that space and time or if emotionally I'm not I'll feel it. But how aware I am and how I understand maya is where you will go beyond time. How you understand maya is where you'll go beyond time. Yes. But I'm assuming this understanding of maya takes very long. Very very true. Because you know when we are born the first thing that we are conditioned is to give n and root to everything. That is name and form. Everything has name and form. One second. Let's just sit with that thought. You said something very heavy. Everything has name and form especially in your childhood. And whenever there is name and form, it has an expiry. I'll ask you something. Anything from the childhood that has been constant materially. Do you remember anything from a car to a cell phone to a watch everything has an expiry date and we are conditioned to give name and form and that name and form is also the source of identity and that is a problem because we get so happy in that name and form we don't realize that it is temporary. Identity for what? Now suppose if I tell that this is my glass I have associated with certain identity this I am myself this glass is mine but the problem is I don't realize in ignorance that this is temporary because one day the glass is going to break one day I'm going to die one day everything is going to come to an end would you say that all these identifications of your own reality lead to ego growing in a human definitely definitely you have said something very beautiful called reality. Now um I will throw some light on reality and I think if you understand this you have understood the crux of the rishies and the teachings. What our rishies are saying that reality is something which never changes and whatever in your life is never changing that is the only truth that is the only s for example let me break it down in very simple language um we'll take it in stages in different states so that we understand what reality is now if I ask you what is reality for you uh you will say that reality is being here or reality is going back home or reality is material, emotional, whatever. What the rishies are saying again, reality is that which never changes. For example, simplifying vanta, I am hungry, I am fat or I will go to Pune. This is what we use in our language daytoday. Now what rishies are saying, I am fat, tomorrow I'll become thin. I am going to Pune from Pune. I'll go come back to Mumbai again. I like this. Tomorrow I will not like it. So whenever we say that I am my body, I am my mind. I am my intellect. The rishies are asking us is your body constant? No, it is constantly changing. Is your mind constant? It is running around in multiple levels. Is your intellect constant? No, you're evolving with time. What is constant? The question comes. That is the reason the concept of time changes because the rishies are saying and of course you will apply in sad also there's only one thing constant in your life that is the I because whenever you are talking you also say that I was hungry hunger has gone I was feeling fat again the body has changed that I is the only constant if you start dwelling and start practicing you will experience that time is a mental concept okay I'm just going to break down what you said a little bit so that I have clarity in exactly what you said and then you correct me or agree with me based on what I say um so when I look at my hands and I'd recommend the viewers do this as well these are the limitations of your physical body this is where your biology stretches to okay if you go back into the memories of your childhood it's that same brain and it's those same eyes and the same retina inside your eyes and that same consciousness which was at work absorbing and learning about life but also you had a few good moments. You did well in a football game. You did well in your exams. You won a competition. It made you feel great but somewhere you identified more with yourself. You said that hey I was able to do my hard work got me here which it did definitely there's an element of free will. So you're saying that sanat and dharma especially the rishies say that nothing is constant. The suffering is not constant. The good stuff is not constant. Say that there's only one thing constant. Whatever is changing is Maya. So eyes are changing, retina is changing, hand is changing, the dose of drug is changing, sexuality is changing, emotions are changing. Whatever is changing is Maya. Whatever is not changing, that is the only reality. There's a very beautiful phrase that all of these are passing clouds. I am the sky. Wow. Okay. All of these are passing clouds. I am the sky. That means my emotions, my past, my present, my body constantly is passing. I am that sky which is infinite. And that eye is the core of existence. It is a core of sadna. It is a core of being. It is a core and the birthright of humans. All these conversations we've had over the years on the show with everyone who knows tantra, who's been on the show, they talk about the fact that the only thing you carry into the next birth is your spiritual advancement. So you go about your sadha. Yeah. Everything else sheds off. Your health sheds off. Money sheds off. Fame sheds off. But when you're born again, you'll be blessed with that positive baggage from your previous book. Yeah. You know, very interesting. Now when you're talking about tantra, when we talk about maali and maeshwari, maali stands for past, present and future. Maali stands for past, present. Maeshwari stands for space. The cardinal points. The what? Cardinal points. Space. all the directions. So when you do sadna, you realize that they're taking you beyond space. Time and causation. Why did you name these two? Because of time and space. Because of time and space. And when we talk about time, of course there is space. Of course there is. Wherever there is time there is space. Because I require certain time and space to reach somewhere. So if I'm coming from here till here, time is required and certain space is captured. But even that is changing. So with that knowledge if you understand daties and do your sadna you will realize that you're just evolving on the path okay wow a college kid that's listening to this or a very young person who's listening to this so someone who actually does not have much spiritual understanding yet what value are they supposed to get from these concepts so for them we will break down the conversation as you mentioned if you are someone new or a collegegoing remember that there's only One duty that we have that are the teachings on the Bhagat Gita we have to give the best all the time never forget that teaching rest all will be taken care of secondly was completely new into it there is an understanding in the Gita known as prasad buddhi prasad buddhi that means buddhi means intellect prasad is something that we go to the temple and take so whatever is happening in your life take it as a prasad from the divine wow if you stick to these two principles that I will give my best wherever I show up and I take everything good, bad, neutral as a prasad buddhi automatically you will start moving ahead on your journey. Because the concept of space, time and causation is for high saddaks. Vedanta is for high saddak but that little knowledge should be there. I have these two friends. Okay. Uh I'm not going to name them but I feel they are suffering a lot in their reality. Uh and they're both good friends. uh they both deny any conversation related to any aspect of God. They're open to spiritual conversation. They would like to discuss the concept of time, the concept of psychology and they're both very intelligent people but they deny God. It's their conditioning from their childhood where I don't know either one parent was probably trying to force religion on them or maybe the parents were also cut from the same cloth. True. And I want to introduce them to the books of Om Swami. I want to introduce them to your Instagram page. But the moment they hear the word Kali, Shiva, the word Hindu. Yeah. And I'm not this is not I'm not making this a Hindu thing. Even if they hear the word Christian, Muslim, whatever, anything related to God, God. Yeah. Um there's a part of them that immediately switches off. They're like, "Oh god, this is a religious conversation. I don't want to." M you know so that is the beauty of sanatan. Uh have you heard about Maharishi Patanjali? Yes he is the greatest psychologist and you know he is the one who dissected the mind. So for people who don't understand gods or scared or don't have knowledge he said something very very clear and he spoke about human behavior. He said in order to evolve you have to understand your behavior. M and he said u so-called behavior is dominated by the threeas satwara you know about it now there are different states that you go through okay shipa vishupta muda ikagra and noda okay shipa is when you are hyperactive you're hyperactive and you're running around rajas is at peak that means you can't even sit at one place and you know these people even they don't believe this they're going through it everyone is going through it. Then he's saying there's another category where at times you are concentrated but again the mind runs. It goes for example for one nancond I'm aware about something again my mind is completely gone. For example I'm craving for a coffee I have a sip of coffee and that moment again I'm going in my past or future. Then there's a state of mind where he says you're completely lethargic. You're not interested in anything. You're just lazy lazy lazy. However, he's saying that these three states are constantly messing with you. I'm putting my words constantly degrading you, making you lethargic. But when you do simple practices like yam and nam, simple things like discipline, you will become one-pointed. So he's not talking about God. He's saying that your state of mind, you have to change it. And these five states these four three states we constantly go through when you do sadena or by simple yam being disciplined doing some exercise doing uh asan pranayam you will become focused. So he's explaining the same things but those who don't understand they should follow patanjali. One only understands the power of yoga when one experiences yoga. Definitely definitely and that is the reason I recommend everyone if you don't believe in God don't just follow the yamas and nyamas yam nyam and basically just do sura namaskar and pranay yeah you know we live in a hyper practical world nowadays especially people who listen to podcasts hyper practical reality in their own heads the simple angle here and I'll talk about this as an anecdote from my own life I started actual stretching and you know asas when I was 26 27 uh because I was getting very injured during football and I realized it was a lack of flexibility. So I started for flexibility. But every time my yoga session would get over with my instructor, I would feel very very calm. I almost felt like I am lifting my consciousness beyond my own mind. Maybe for that one two hours post the yoga session. That's how you experience yoga. Yeah. And you know we contemplate so much now. You have done it, you enjoy it, you realize that gym is different and yoga is different, breathing is different and that experience is talking. Our problem is we just want to pinpoint things and don't want to practice. Yeah. I think this experiencing things is the greatest gift you can give to yourself in your 20s. That is the greatest thing. Being aware and experiencing your own self. Yeah. I also feel your 30s there will be a slightly heavier burden of responsibilities. Your 20s are supposed to be experimental according to me a little bit. That is the reason again I'm coming to Padanjali because he said something very interesting. Satsang and suadhaya satsang is having like-minded conversations with people and suadha is self-study that is very important to be on track otherwise the mind again creates a lot of drama yeah you spoke about the three modalities of the human mind rajas satwa tamas tamas yes in balance they are all important right they can never be in balance it'll always be sliding always be and that is your sabha your behavior that is how the human mind is created That is created. Three konas are always operating and all your bad mental health, all your negative thoughts, self-doubt, anxiety, all these concepts which we have given names to happen as an outcome of having a lack of balance of these three. Yeah, let me put it technically. Satwa is a space where you are one-pointedness you are aware. Rajas is giving you activity constant movement and tamas is a space where you go into darkness. Even in that there are many combinations permutations but going into anxiety is where rajas and tamas are working together. Our goal is to be in satwa. That is the reason you do sadna. But what if your satwa is very excessive? Then you will move into higher states. Okay. So you go beyond satwa also. Wow. So the goal is to actually increase your satwa. The goal is to actually experience satwa. But I'll give you a very simple example. When we talk about the three gonas um satwa is like a silver chain. Uh rajas is like a gold chain and tamas is like an iron chain. At the end of the day all three are binding. Even satwa is binding. A satic person wants to make other happy, wants to feel happy, be happy. An enlightened being goes beyond the guas. He becomes a witness. Wow. That is what Bhagat Gita also preaches. There's a fourth state of a higher state that is called the Turya. An enlightened being is in that he goes beyond awake, dream, deep sleep. He's operating in the Turya where he becomes a witness of everything. Participates in everything. Complete participation, complete enjoyment but no expectation in the game of life. But his or her consciousness is extremely different than what we experience in extremely they become masters of acting and they established in higher states of consciousness where they have experienced subtle beyond subtle it's a state of being. I'm often asked about my own goal in life and nowadays I've started giving a very quick answer that hey everything that I'm doing in my material reality is to enable free time in order to go deeper into my spiritual practices which will hopefully take me to that point of what human society calls enlightenment in order to go towards that fourth state that you're just talking about. The only way one can actually go there practically speaking is if you give time and discipline to those practices. Yeah, true. Any other way? There are many other ways. Go on. First way is being aware of a karma because everything is binding as karma. Secondly, which is the first is very important is the knowledge of who am I? I'm not this body, not this mind, not this intellect. There was a great uh saint here called Nisaratam Maharaj. He used to live in chapati chopati. He met his guru and his guru just taught him one teaching. Keep on asking yourself who are you? Like Ramanarishi the great whenever we go to his ashram or feel his presence. Beautiful eyes staring and making us realize that nothing is constant. You are that bliss. Now when I'm talking about bliss is a state where all these great enlightened beings experience. It's called satan. It's a state where you are in ecstasy. There is no duality. There is nothing. Is it the same fourth state? It is the state of Tura. Turya is the highest. Below that there are many states, God consciousness, animal consciousness, earth consciousness. But the highest is imagine Arabai. You are in a state where you have no anxiety, no fear, no mental issues. You are a perfect instrument and you're experiencing unconditional love. It's very rare we talk about it but I'm sure these great enlightened beings have experienced it. That is the goal of human life. That is the birthright. We already that. The problem is we are covered with Maya. We have conditioned ourselves to the space time and causation to names and forms. M and if you realize that um we are so greedy we want to associate with something and when our desire satisfied we want something new again we are building up concepts of causal relation a highly evolved being is just being aware and just participating but internally completely free what can a 22year-old do right now to at least move towards this reality as I mentioned give their best secondly I think at that age the mind is so hyperactive you need tools to calm it down and thirdly reading basic reading of about existence and you know the problem is what I'm realizing now we are so high with our own uh goals and intentions we bind oursel don't bind yourself to any anything so that means if a thought is coming to you be okay that if this happens I'm okay if it doesn't I'm I'm okay keep That attitude, build that attitude. It will take time. Slightly anti-manifestation. Yeah. Kishta and Patanjali says kish is binding you and is liberating you. Now if you are telling me that bhavish take this gold okay in my mind okay if I get it I'm okay. If I don't get I'm free. I'm free. I'm free of that scenario that space time and causation. Just simple teaching to start applying. It is difficult. Well I'm aiming for to becoming an IPS officer. You're working, working, working. Keep that awareness. If it happens, I'm okay. If it doesn't happen, something else will open up automatically. You will mature. But we can't. You know, I see a lot of people taking this exact golden advice, and it is golden advice. But I see a lot of people picking up this golden advice and using it as escapism. And in the world of spirituality, it's called spiritual bypassing. Yes. They they go past a goal oriented mindset life. They're like, "N, I don't want to achieve my goals. I'll actually just go live in the Himalayas. Yeah, we call it the vdantic shuffle. It's called running away from everything and taking away so that you satisfy your own ego. But no, a yogi is a person who's participating in everything, not running away in any scenario. So until you in the body, nature will not let you rest. Okay. Can I just draw out a tiny instruction manual for a 22 year old beginning life? Yeah. Okay. And of course, this applies to 25, 30 year olds as well. Yeah. You mentioned some guidelines. Yeah. So you said your first job is to uh you you said something that kind of in my eyes I read as being kind. Yeah. Like you have to be a good human being. Karma. You said be conscious of your karma. The greatest sign of a noble being is humbleness. Be humbleness and uh never think that you are the doer. There's a greater force that is operating. And if you think that you are too smart, just hold your nose and you'll come to know that you can't survive. The sun is shining equally for everyone. That humbleness is very important. So for a 22-year-old, the basis of all forms of growth is humbleness. I also put kindness in the same bracket. Yes. Perfect. The second is to do your best in the world, which at 22 often means career and family life. Do your best for your parents, do your best at your job. And one more advice practically if you don't like something don't do it as in don't be forced by parents or don't be in any situation that you're because you won't last your shava will decide what you want to do but also don't use this as an excuse to not work hard. Perfect. Perfect. And you know it's yeah very it's a very fine line. It's a very fine line where we forget. Yeah. This is actually where most people slip off. Yeah. That's what where spiritual bypassing begins. Yes. Uh the third thing you said is study. read. You know how I look at spiritual podcasts? They point you towards spiritual books and spiritual books point your journey towards where it's supposed to go. True. Like there is something you'll gain from podcast. Definitely. But it actually should point you towards the books. And you know it is very strange. Um we forget things very easily. We forget things very easily because we are now selective surrender. If things are going my way, oh God is so nice. I always tell this because we go through the process. So that constant reading and constant being aware is very important. Right. The final two steps in my eyes, these are kind of optional. It depends on your own personal journey. Uh get into the process of yoga and by that I don't mean just as yum prana and meditation is very important. And finally I would say that really take up a sadna if you can. For me at 22 I used to just sit for 20 minutes keep my back straight. I couldn't even sit cross-legged well that time you know I would just do chanting for 20 minutes. It started off something. Yeah, it's the most powerful sadha. Even the entire text opes says that home is everything. In fact, if you think this is too much heavy for you and this is too spiritual, a very basic simple solution is being nonviolent in your thoughts. When I say non very very difficult oh I should not be jealous of our oh my brother is getting more money from me. Oh you know what tomorrow I'm not gaining popular. This is the biggest battle. If you try understanding, you will evolve and it is very very difficult. So if you think that oh praying to Kali is difficult or home chanting, be non- minded your thoughts. It will drain you out because you're conditioned again. I ask the person in front of me often. Are you a good person trying to be bad or are you a bad person trying to be good? And it's actually a question that you need to sit and really think about because it's a very nuanced answer. And very often I think society conditions us into wanting to say no. I'm a good person trying to be bad. No way. I don't I want to have a bad person trying to be good. No, no, no. I'm a good person trying to be bad. And they settle at that because that's societal conditioning. But Shikhar Davan when I asked him this, he did this. Okay. He went ooh. He did something like that cuz he understood the depth of the question. Yeah. A reality of growing up in urban centers anywhere in the world. You are taught to be mentally very tough, very street smart to survive in the city and to grow. And then you're also given a moral compass and you're told don't do the wrong things in life. Uh there's a dialogue from Batman Begins where they say that it's not who you are on the inside but it's your actions that define you. True. It's the same thought. You may be bad on the inside. you know the vicious way of going about the world but you're trying to do the right thing. I think it's kind of similar to what you're trying to say about being nonviolent in your thoughts. Yes, there is violence in your thoughts. Acknowledge it. Don't ever act upon it and eventually transform that inside as well. Beautiful. Because um uh when you read Patanjali, this is stuck to my heart because it is so practical. He's saying that being nonviolent is impossible. M impossible accept it. There is viciousness in human nature. It is but try not to. Secondly, what I believe is also the intention. If I am shouting at you, but my intention is that you evolve, I'm free. The intention matters. Intention matters and the wish to transform. Yeah. And the intention if it is for upliftment of others, you will blossom. Yeah. And but I'm fabulous. My intention is very very um toxic. I'm using such words. I'm sorry. That's fine. Then no matter what I am binded because nature knows everything. Nature will not leave you. You know people who have negative or I would even say neutral intention in their heart. It often shows up on the face. Definitely. You can't hide. I can hide from you for three times, four times. It will come up. Yeah, it will come up. a a good practice for end users and they can do this in their own social circles. Yeah. If you are doubtful about a certain person's intention, see a photo of them smiling. Yeah. You will come to know. Just just keep looking at it. Keep looking at it and and ask yourself what lies beyond the smile. And the way to polish this skill, it's also a podcasting skill honestly where you observe humans very deeply. The way to polish this skill is that you have certain people in your life who you know very deeply. You know their characters inside out. Maybe a relative, maybe a friend. See a photo of them smiling. Especially the ones where you know that this person is a good human being and the intentions are clean. And see a bunch of good human beings in your own circle. Their smiles are often representations of good intention. And do this obviously with the people who you know have been slightly twisted in their life. True. you'll be able to develop some kind of pattern recognition in your head which will protect you throughout your 20ies. True. True. And I also believe that um at times when you are around people you just come to know with time they will hide it for three times, four times but fifth time it will just come to you. Yeah. I think one of those experiences one has again in their 20s is uh understanding which people give you energy and which people take energy from. True. And the goal of life is to hang out with people who give you energy. You know, um there's a very beautiful state that we go in 20. And personally, I believe don't get attached to the experiences. It is a learning process. I've seen many people whatever has happened in 20 till 20 and also they are stuck in the 24 23. They don't let go of that and that's a major problem and it is not the end of life. But you have planned your life in such a way in your head. Again, you're binded to situation. Are you are you okay if I ask you your age? I am 36. 36. So 6 years in your 30s. Yep. Um I'm sure you have friends whom you know from childhood. I have um childhood friends, they have changed, but now I have some very good saddaks around who what do you observe about people in their 30s, you know? um if you're talking from a normal point of view or from a sadic point of view from a normal point of view uh I think during 30s there's too much of stress with their savings with their money with their lifestyle with their future they're completely entangled and they think that they have to rush into something settle down settle down settle down I've seen with many people that I know you know we spent two hours talking before I was trying to iron out my own challenges of being in my 30s with you to bring up this chapter on our episode today. Yeah. So that I don't have to trauma dump in front of the world can do it outside. Yeah. Uh I want to talk about 30s a little bit because um I'm thinking one positive thing which is that almost everyone I know is having more conversations about health and evolution. Yeah. See internal battles are different, professional battles are different and worldly battles are different completely. But that is the reason you know in 30s also people change and you are changing and also the experiences that you're going through is either taking you to other levels or also putting you back in your past. It's a very crucial time that is the reason a good friend circle sadena and I think common sense is required at times. Yeah. You know I speak for my own friend circle here but I think I speak for a lot of friend circles of people in their 30s because I view this a lot. the core friend groups uh get even closer in their 30s because you've really seen human beings by this point. Uh and you almost come together from a sense of fear and and a sense of damn bro the world is like a dirty place. I want to hang out with you guys. Yeah. Like it's it's a sad reality of human life. For a survival of any relationship, there's only one ingredient that is communication. at a very practical level, you need to communicate, you know, and this the same emotion that we're talking about right now, this trials and tribulations of your 20s and challenges of your 30s. This is what made me want to talk about time to you today because I'm getting more and more aware of aging through little things like I've started getting more gray hairs and I'm like, "Oh, okay. This is what it feels like." Like because in my head I'm still in first standard. Yeah. I'm still 6 years old. Yeah. That I'm still 18 as well. I'm still in fifth grade as well, but my hair is graying. My knees are unhealthy. There's stuff happening. So, I'm like, it feels like when you know t-shirt starts becoming old and you see that hole in the t-shirt for the first time. Yep. But this is the body version of it. Your soul's like ah can't wait for that next life where I'm given a new young body and it's more flexible again. See, you know the thing is um once the mind starts thinking no, it just creates threads. numerous threads. That is the reason that understanding that nothing is permanent should always be there. Yeah. That underlining knowledge should always be there. That will save you save you from my own miseries that you're creating. And with time when you measure you realize nothing is in your hands. Nothing. You plan out so many things. But what is in your hand? The satisfaction that no one can take away that is in your hand and that you'll get when you do things with complete awareness. What was that thing you mentioned about the Bhagat Gita? The prasad prasad buddhi prasad buddhi that is very very important. Bhagat Gita is so practical teachings you don't need to you just have to apply it that whatever I'm getting I will take it as a prasad but I will play my role 100%. Otherwise you're coming into again the shuffle. What is the playing my role 100% aspect of things. playing my role 100% aspect is that and whatever condition I am placed I'm placer because of my own karma secondly whatever I am placed in any situation the reaction depends in my hands if I respond I'm free and third deep inside you know you're doing justice or not if you have these three things in your head you are clear you can handle any situation in the world practically one of The ways I connected with Shiva Mo especially in my mid to late 20s was uh filling the gap that I felt through Shiva's presence. You know when you start worshiping Shiv in my personal experience he's Bolinat he's just when you chant and you just surrender he will look after you. Not like ferocious daties. He's very very shant very very caring and he's one of those gods that you call out he'll come first. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I had an experience when I was not doing a sadna. I got an experience of his rodu and then I realized that yes he has many forms and uh one more time when anytime when I think I'm very hoy to have some ego he will crush me down always in a good way. But uh he has different different forms. Is is behav and shiva one and the same? In higher states they all are one. All are one. All are one. She was the same as Krishna. All are one. The ways um has Takuri said jotto different different beings different different ways to worship but we all come from the same source. That is the reason that I is always constant and um I have realized I have done Krishna sadha for a very long time then I have done shiv sadna all bhagan's race they all are one but sabhava is different of different deities. And you attune to that sabha. You attune to that sa. That means the more you practice you will realize that deities have their own sabhawa. No, if if I had to ask you the traits of beer's presence um when uh I started doing bat sad now I realized it's very protecting. Okay. Very protecting. Very nurturing. Very nurturing. But this is how I project him. But when I do Kali sad, it is different. She's ferocious. She'll make me dance to her tunes. Make me realize that she is in charge of things and I'm just an instrument. Which is very good because the ego rises anytime. You think you're very special anytime. How does she get annoyed? If I lack my sadha and again if there is any pride, no, these dities will push you down. That is the reason holding on to vdanta is very different. And we slip into it that I am Brahman, I am Brahasmi, I will not do anything. No, you have to participate. The role has to be played. And association is with the dity is giving that comfort that there is someone looking after you always. Sometimes will the dity force you to reduce the sadha because of whatever? Um depending upon the sanscaras depending upon see once you completely surrender the dity will do everything. If you have that kind of bacti then even talking becomes a sadna. Imagine that ara you in a state that completely I' left it to be. So the mic is better. You are beof. The questions are better. Your life has become a sadna. So the mantra coming also be and going is also you don't have to worry about it because you become an instrument. When you start thinking space and time comes then we lose connect. Time time time is um it's very difficult to understand. We just get very deluded all the time. We forget that we are not this time. Let's speak about Mahakal a little. Let's let's begin by speaking about the Ujen temple. Y okay that's honestly my introduction to Maka. Why? Because my idol went there and said J Mahal and I saw a change in his fortunes also. fortune's already crazy but went to another level for Virat Kohli. So let's let's begin with the temple and then expand Mahakal from there. Mahakal um I will we'll talk about our experience. We were in Mahakal and it is a space which will take you beyond time. It is shift personified as the essence beyond time that when I talk about Maral we realize in we were just running and we realize that we are just dancing to his tunes. So the concept of time just dissolves that completely and that is the only only jotling in the world where you do basma. It's a constant reminder that nothing is in your hands. What is that basma? Originally in earlier times they used to do from the smashant they used to get basma and used to do basarti in the nightsh ashes here human cremated ashes but now they do it with sandalwood and cowang and everything so that arty and even um that temple is so powerful it's an experience I would personally recommend that um whenever you go to just sit cross-legg and just be do your j and just be get that essence pull that energy and of uh sh in that form. Is there some truth in the fact that you're not supposed to sleep when you go to a jin? I think uh if you're very highly sensitive saddak you will realize a lot of things we can't generalize it because uh and I believe that any spiritual place I tell this and I have experienced only when the dati calls you you can go otherwise your cal will not change. So if Mahal has called you that means your call is about to change spiritually and when spiritually things change everything will change materially also emotionally also I think hard work needs to be a very core part of one's existence otherwise life is going to punish you going forward karma yoga is very important if the human body is given action is very very important for people living in this space with the base of what I just said that hard work should be like breathing that shouldn't be a question you know uh beyond that I feel that uh the success that you gain through hard work is not just because of the hard work it's actually because of your spiritual growth definitely how kind you are how nuanced your decision- making is um your success or anything depends upon the hard work it will turn out to be fruitful if you're doing it as an offering Yeah. To that divine. Yeah. So I'm doing this podcast for the divine. I'm doing every it's a very high state to be in because uh if for a nancond things don't go your way and you forget everything again you're binded to karma. Clished again cliched again binding. So attitude your intention and I think in higher states you just do it with love. That is a solution for everything. Unconditioned love. You're talking about attaching love to your professional work right? doing it as an offering for the divine and enjoying the process. Yeah, it's such a it's such a challenging thing for a person in their early 20s to actually wrap their head around, you know, because like go on. Yeah. Early 20s, a simple solution is first see what you want to do in your life. Yeah. Understand your sava. Yeah. You're saying a very practical thing, right? Very practical. You know I remember so my first uh internship in college was in mergers and acquisitions in Ernston Young. Okay. I worked as a financial analyst and I was very grateful to be in that EI office. It was a swanky office and I was like this is a big blessing that I'm here. I first said thank you to God on my first day and I stayed there learned a lot saw the corporate world uh had a lot of respect for it. It was that whole energy of the office is actually a guru for me even today like I bow my head down to that phase of my life. This was when I was 20 or 21. But I do remember this one feeling I used to have which is that about a month or two into that internship um I had a friend called Dendra. He was a family friend who also happened to be interning at that and the only reason I wanted to go to office was to spend time with Dendra and then learn alongside him. But the feeling I used to have while entering that office was wow can't wait for 5:00 p.m. when I get to exit. Yeah. That's the universe's way of saying that this is an experience. This is not where you belong. See, you have taken this maturely. Now with time you have realized this has happened. Your subhava is doing this. And the more you do it with your subh and enjoy it, automatically nature will push you ahead. Yeah. Apparently when I started training people for money, okay, uh before YouTube began, I would approach training with a very uh I love that job. I was I was making good money also as a 22-y old because of that. I was making more money than I would have made in any of my engineering college placements. Uh people were laughing at me like that. Oh, you did engineering and you know there was a lot of psychological trauma I had to face in that phase but I enjoyed training. I could I could do it for the rest of my life. I really like helping a younger person. Uh and I had some teenage clients and all that just I looked at it as a younger sibling that I want to help your body. Uh and that then that extended into beer biceps being a fitness channel. It was effectively that the feeling I had with that professional aspect was um it felt like a plant. It didn't feel like a task. Felt like I just want to keep giving this nurturing it. Yeah. I want to nurture this. Uh and long hours of work didn't feel like that. Yeah. Yeah. Because you're enjoying it. No. Yeah. That's what people need to look for on a professional level in their early 20s. And I think these 20 or 25 are so pressurized in society and having a status or having this later they regret. Yeah. So contemplate what you enjoy the most. Yeah. You know and the truth is that there are certain fields that are perceived to be glamorous. This field included content creation uh sports uh films all the people who matter in these fields. are all young people and they're not being able to find them entering these fields out of a place of self-doubt but it's about extending yourself send emails out try getting in touch with people there's a lot of fear there's a lot of uh unknown territory the reason I'm saying this is this nurturing aspect of watering the plant when it comes to career uh people don't experience that reality cuz um they just think that hey I don't get paid in those kind of jobs. That's not true. There is money to be made. Uh and I think money is a good thing to chase when you're in your early 20s. Yeah. The thing is no, the fear is to jump in. Once you jump in only then you'll know how to swim. We don't want to jump in. We contemplate. We just create a lot of things. The reason you and me are talking about this very hyper practical career angle in a tantra based podcast is because this is actually a box one needs to tick to enable all the spiritual stuff. True. like first settle your own capitalistic mind and more than that no you have to go through the grind you can't experience things when you can't go through it so unless I have burnt my hand I'll realize the sensation of what it is so it's a process you go through it there's a reason that even this topic is choosing to split this fabric of reality around us and enter this conversation cuz there's a lot of young people listening to this conversation uh who probably understand a gore only from the perspective of media and that's fine at least that knowledge has reached them. I would point them towards an author called Roberts Voboda who we have hosted on the show. He's written a trilogy uh Agora 123 very detailed difficult to read book try reading it. Um we've also recorded podcasts with him. So if you're not a reader go listen to those podcasts. But my question to you is why has this entered this Jenzi spirituality? Because you know um people are attracted to things that gives them kicks. They don't want the long step-by-step method of going to yam nyam then doing mantra chanting then getting a guru then no they want shortcut but they don't this shortcut is hell if you just read or just you know get and an actual auror will you know there are many aurors that I've met who dress normally we don't even come to know the auror I had an interaction in kashi later I got to know when I saw him and I'm like okay then I realized that we know nothing about them Because what is project on TV is holding a kapal running like this. They are not they are very well educated and that man was so well spoken traveled the world taken the part and come into this because they are karma their situation have dragged them into this if I tell you just leave tomorrow if I tell a so-called jenzi okay pack everything leave step out in the mountain start walking they won't you need to jump into it to realize it where do you live the majority of your life um uh it has been distributed in many many parts but I would say in the mountains yes mountains Yes. I think it's very important for Indians. Every Indian should visit the mountains. Everyone should definitely at least once at least once you realize how life is say say more because you know especially for people living in metro cities we are very comforted in our own space given you step in the mountains you'll realize how life is how nature is harsh how you realize that you have to survive not proper mountains not even rishiesh rishikesh is luxury and you will step out ahead you'll come to know that and you'll you'll also um realize One important thing that we are very blessed we are humans. We can act, we can perform, we can think and we can evolve because of the mountains. You realize that the nature will teach you. Yeah. Because here everything is McDonald's this that you have to do your own thing. I remember my first trip to the mountains was with a very close friend group from school and my best friend Nandini. We were just sitting and looking at the mountains. Okay. This was a kasal to trip. This is at age 23. uh we saw these massive mountains in front of us, okay? And there was a moment at night where the moonlight was falling on them and you could see like the you know the cracks in the mountains and possible caves and we all just paused collectively as a friend group and she said that just look at how many secrets are present right in front of us and that's such an important sentence because as you travel through the mountains you realize that mountains are not the places where you choose to just be in one location. You have to sit in your car and go around and discover the secrets. True. How many secrets are there in India according to you? I think you're the right person to be asked this question. I personal experiences uh many a uh every time when we experience we think we know nothing. We know nothing. Um just sharing not a personal experience. Va and Gmuk and uh in the night u it was one of the best nights not spiritually but talking with with our all um Adi members and we looked up and we saw shooting stars we saw the Saparishi mandala and we were like what is this? This is another world. What is mandala? Um you know the saparishis we say they have come from the stars. So they form a specific uh rectangular mandala which you can see it and it's very very visible and you and you know every mountain is different. The mountains in Nepal are different. Kalash is different. Rishies is different. Himachel is different and you feel the energy is different. You feel it like those who know know it. Different gifts as well. Different gifts as well. Yes. And they are scary also. They make you realize how small you are and insignificant. I would recommend that um you know we are very secure with money with security with cell phones go for a trip don't if you're not don't know what a yatra is just pack your bags go go to go explore you will realize that you are so gifted you have so many things you'll also realize that nature's constantly supporting you if you just flow yeah a CA had once asked me why do people even go to the mountains he was fairly older than I am Yeah. And my answer at that point was because it's the best form of nature. And then he's like, "No, but I've never done a vacation where I've really see out nature. I always like pref I go to cities." I I didn't know what to say because how do you explain the joy of being out in nature? It's you know you can't explain it's you know we were in um Kedar and u there was one point where we could see Keddar we could see the ice peak mountain we could see the multiple stars and we were like we have wasted so many years we are not experiencing this practically speaking away from the depth it's very affordable as a trip yeah it is like you'll be able to explore the mountains with very less less money. Yeah. And I would say that uh don't use those fancy choppers and all. Go travel local. You will realize how local people are humble. You'll realize everything. And I think such experience is more important than studying books or running beholution as well. I'm going to ask you a very peculiar travel oriented question which is useful for young people. If I give you a timeline of four years where they can do a trip to the Himalayas every single year, can you draw out a road map that will help them evolve as human beings? See um honestly speaking every mountain has good side and bad side. Yeah. Because humans are everywhere. Every mountain where you go has a spiritually uplifting side. At the same time it has everything which you don't want to get involved with. If you're starting your trip I would say start with rishies. It's a good space to be in. Don't go to casoli. Don't go to dharam shala. You will land up doing other things and the mind will get diverted easily. Go to rishiesh. If you actually want if see depends um now if you are inclined towards shiv I would definitely say do kedat do adi kalash. If you want to do something which is challenging go to him. Just go outside your comfort zone. If you want to do something very very challenging, go to rdanat. But take the journey. Start with something very small. And I think kanat is good to start with. What is challenging about those yatras? Oh, you have to do it in a day. We were in Himkunai. One of the most beautiful experiences because oxygen goes less. And you have to go in the morning and by 3:00 they will push you down because you can't stay there. Okay. It gets very difficult. Bitter weather. Bitter weather. Oxygen problem. No other issues. So you go take dasha and come back and that is something which is mentally difficult also and of course only when the dati calls you can go. That is the sad. That is the sadna definitely. I always say that any atra that we did kana recently I was planning for a year it was not possible in 10 days we planned everything and we realized that all the doors opening because dati was calling us and it is a mental test because at any point of time you will be stuck there'll be a problem. Uh-huh. There you'll have no water and it is a beautiful journey. But when you go to the shetra and you be there, you will be charged like a battery again. O you'll be charged again. That is the reason all these jot lings and everything are so powerful. The statement you said that you'll be charged like a battery. It's something one only understands when one experiences. Yeah. Like when we go to Kashi, we visit Baraba, we go to uh Jot Ling, Kashi Vishna, we are charged. We are charged and you know it. You know it and that energy comes back again sustains again again you go but in higher states if you're talking from a Vatic point of view you don't need to go anywhere because everything is within you but we are not there those who are there they don't travel but you will realize how the battery charges and there are very strange stories I've seen people living in rishies they have not been to Har they have not been to not harad not been to Kdana yet because there's no calling and I've seen People coming from Bangalore, from Hyderabad, four five days. Amazing of the DT calls. Can I take you back to that four year timeline? Yep. Uh Rishies, you have to do uh see depending upon the spiritual calling especially talking about mountains. I would say do Rishies, do uh Badrinat, do the punched also. Very interesting. This is where Shiv had taken the form of a buffalo and there are five punched. I would say do Adi Kalash. And if you actually into it, Kalash is the highest. Okay. I'm I'm also going to have a go at it. Yeah. Okay. And I'll I'll explain why. Yeah. For each because I want to know your point of view. Yeah. I think that if you wish for your own personal spiritual evolution as well as life evolution, the mountains are a must in your 20s, especially if you're Indian. Uh first and foremost, Rishies is my pick as well because it's got the right kind of amenities to make the mountain seem friendly. Point and it's a base for you to experience the blue Ganga. Yeah. You know, uh Kunjapuri, Mata, Mandr etc. Perfect. Uh the the goua uh Basha Basha. Yes. Uh very nice first mountain trip. Uh so this is the second one that to Kiranga Kasal region go see nature go see the beauty that god has created because the landscapes and the flora there uh it's like nowhere else in India and I've traveled through Kashmir as well the third one I would point people towards is the general Kangada area uh because of all the there's too many secrets there's too many things to do you know I was blessed to have some great encounters with great saints in Kanga so it is another territory And the mountains are huge and there's such energetic differences in different parts of Kangra. Dhamala is accessible. If you want the party cafe vibe, go up to Dharmot. Uh but for me, one of the benefits of being in Kangra is closely observing Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah. Like we're blessed in India to have that presence of Tibetan Buddhism. Very strong that it should be there. Yeah. And the fourth place I'd point people towards I want to say Kdarat but we saw all the videos of it being overcrowded. Which is why perhaps I would point them uh towards Nepal. Nepal is something you know it's like if you go to Nepal go there for a month because because you do sadna there you absorb the place you understand it has everything. It has shaky beats, it has beav, it has just being there. So it's another see Kashmir, Nepal, the other dimensions if you touch into and start living it. Yeah. And if for whatever reason you are not inclined to visiting the mountains but you still want spiritual evolution just go to Banaras. Yeah. Banaras is like home. You know many people don't like Banaras because it's too much for them. Oh it's dirty. It is like this. It is overly crowded. But I think uh if you start walking on the path you will be dragged to Banaras at one point of time in your life. Yeah. Yes. Definitely. You know I adored my trip to Vindavan as well. Yeah. Uh but I faced the psychological challenge in Vindavan that because of the layers of humanization. Yes. Uh I was not able to exactly absorb the nucleus of it but it it was important. I went to the Radhar Raman temple. Beautiful. My first um encounter of renavan was with my guru and um I can't remember it's taty tatya guru tata swami there was a guru who lived there never left that space and he has taken samadi there are no lights in the ashram they're only diyas and I was like everything is same like wow yeah um again I don't know why this happened to me in vindawan on my first day I went to a riverside arti and This was the one week in the year where a lot of bugs are going through breeding season. Yeah, there were so many bugs like at the art they were doing the art there was like this blue neon light because we were already very ethereal but there were so many bugs that they were entering our ears, our nose, our mouth. Uh the people who lived in Vindavan, they were still okay with being there. It was almost like that arti pushed us out of itself comfort zone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And yet people do it there. There are these this is what people need to understand about India travel. You know even with foreigners I tell them to visit India but when they ask me where first I do a personality test on them. You have to otherwise uh but one shouldn't just seek out fivestar hotels and you should not Instagram friendly locations and more than that to experience a place what we do is we live locally we be local and if you're doing a yatra specifically don't just go to the temple and come stay there for minimum 3 to 4 days to understand the place and ask the dity for experiences yes yes yes and always have that surrender that the dity will take care that underlining knowledge should be there otherwise you won't you want in fact very strange that we were in one night dragged to Tarapit first experience in Kolkata yeah very strange so you'll realize in sad the dity will also drag you and get it done if that understanding is there then it will become a successful because you are in surrender and things will open up hell will come in one night we one day morning 6:00 you went to Darab did sad and came back again the same night and the road was horrible but we knew that it has been done that attitude should be there for such places. This is such a potent piece of information that we have dispelled in this podcast. Yeah. And uh more than that you know it's good we are opening up for people especially for generation who is new and they want to jump into it and one should not act cool go into smasha and do agori and all. No you start surrendering it will come actually the journey will take. Yeah, let's close this travel chapter. This is enough. Y because if if we we can keep going on. Yeah, true. But uh it's a very good call to action. You know, we've given good options here and it whoever wants to now benefit from this will take this information and move forward which is why we come back to the base topic of time. Yep. How is one supposed to view aging? Because honestly, even at my age, I miss my childhood. you know uh two things I'm understanding first we have to come into acceptance that we are going to die you're not a chiranji I'm not a chiranji we are going to die secondly u you will accept aging and childhood when you're living that thing 100% and that happens with time you mature with time and third is if you let go of your past three things if that commumulates together then you will realize realize you're at peace otherwise you'll never be in peace. What is letting go of one's past? Accepting everything that has happened and taking responsibility that it is not God's doing or others doing. You are responsible because you have not taken the right decision and you're suffering because uh you know um at one point of time uh you are placed in situations where you know it is wrong yet you do it and later you regret. So that awareness I do want to do let it go should come. You know what you're saying is very important life advice in terms of taking responsibility for the own for the outcomes that your life has given you. There is a counter question here asked by people when because I've spoken about this concept publicly. The counter question is uh what about the external negative stimuli that happened in childhood which you were not in control of. See this question comes to us also a lot that you know why this has happened to me I have gone through so much but in this aspect when I talk about karma or kum then it will be justice or because they won't register that has happened to me but if you have taken a human body and you're going through something you have to go through the process the mental conditioning that has happened has to be changed so if you have gone through a process of something which is not in the normals norms of the soc society come into acceptance. Yeah. And this is not us removing empathy from this conversation at all. Yeah. There is nothing. And life is going to drag you. You're not the only person that is going through it. People are going to other the things. So don't become a victim because the victim attitude is the biggest downfall even in a normal journey of life. Can we talk about this victim attitude from a sanatan dharma perspective? I hear that a lot that I've been praying to shift for so many years but I'm not getting a job. I've been doing this sa I'm not getting this. You're not doing it because your intention is not there. And you know it is very easy to become a victim. Very easy. That is the easiest way to cover a ego. And uh it is sounds it may sound very very this that how is it possible? But the high ego you're tested with your ego a lot. Um what did you say the intention is not there. Uh so um the victim attitude is that I hear so many people messaging us saying that I've done so much but Shiva is not listening to me, Kali is not listening to me, Shiva is angry with me. No he's not angry. You are not satisfied. You're expecting a lot. You're coming into victim. You just do your best of fruits. That is the main teaching of Bhagat Gita. Prasad buddhi again. One more thing is very clear. If I have done my best at one point of time, what more can I do? Leave it. that satisfaction no one can take it and I know I've done this the result will be given to you what you deserve. Yeah, I keep repeating this on so many episodes, but the divine registers hard work. Definitely. If if you feel in your heart that you're working hard, it's registered up there. Definitely your intention, your action is of course and the present action that you're doing also is giving you certain results good or bad depending upon your actions. Now you can't run away from the law. No matter who you are, human body laws are there. Which Bhagat Gita would you point the users to? I would point uh whatever I have learned is from my guru's Bhagat Gita Vanala. Vanwala. Yeah, she writes beautifully and she has written Nitya Yog. Simple language, easy to understand. But the problem is we forget what is nity? Nity yog is a constant union. Nitya means union of the individual self with the supreme self. So she has written commentaries on that. And whenever I read it, I'm again charged. But again, we forget with time. So the habit of reading it should be there. Yeah. You know, I'm wearing a whoop which like monitors my heart rate and it's like a fitness band for lack of better words. Um whenever I'm podcasting, it could be a bad guest also. Okay. Uh but obviously that happens rarely. Mostly it's great guests. Uh my stress levels fall heavily on on my app. My heart rate actually drops a lot. I'm a I'm in a very relaxed state of being. It's a good state of being. Yeah. I feel very stressed out outside of the podcast room as you've seen today and since you've known me as well. My challenge at this point is how do I bring that nity to that part of life which is outside flow state. It will come. It is coming. But the problem is you know what just in this scenario the higher you are going the higher the challenges are being placed in that is the struggle and that will also come it will become okay you will realize how to handle it you realize how to tackle it and you're much much better I say this all the time because now I'm closely associated watching you throughout the day and in fact you spent an entire day together so I'm realizing you're enjoying the process yet and uh whatever I've seen you closely and understood you are you're operating a big massive team so you're sad and you know I've realized a change in your language oh will take care I'm doing my best so it is happening it happened because of meeting people like yourself no it is all his leela we are just instrument you forget that you are not the doer I'm not the doer let it flow you may seem or you may think that it is going wrong but That great cosmic intellect knows everything. I wonder what the divine's relationship with human difficulty is. What is God's relationship with the difficulty he throws towards us? You know, uh from a very high point of view, there is no difficulty. Our mind creates difficulty because things are not going our way. In divinity, everything is a whole picture. So when you let go there is nothing to be worried about because Gangama is always flowing. It merges in the end. So even if there's a block, if there's a rock, there's a body, she will just go through it. But if we think that we are the body blocking it, if we think we are the rock, there's a difference. And you know something very important that you also mentioned at the age of 22, be good humans. That is the crux. M be good humans first then run to aguris or this or be good humans understand that the problem is within you your jealousy your anger stop blaming pushing others be good humans out of all the episodes we've done this is the one where we've mentioned tantra the least yes and we have there is so much to talk about always I say that there are so many things and I'm liking that we are addressing young people and tantra is a small aspect There is vdanta, there is bacti, there is koshas, there is upanisha, there is so much. Why people are tantra is good only if you have a guru. Again I come to that or you have right knowledge because the higher you rise the harder you fall in tantra. Why is this knowledge coming through this episode? The world needs this. I think the world needs and I think the way we are interacting a lot of young people are inclined and uh they need some no one is talking about foundation foundation foundation how to start my journey with no one's talking about that everyone's talking about mantra job yes and yes so even before mantra there are phases that a person has to go through reach mantra now I think that is the reason now we are flowing yeah so even if I chant namish or I need to know few things. I need to be satic. I need to have some discipline. I need to wake up on time. Yeah. I think the foundation is required. Yeah. Very foundationoriented conversation. Yeah. It's so weird how cyclic content is. This was the kind of conversations I used to have in year one. Yeah. And I almost felt like damn there's no market for this anymore. And this is such an enriching conversation. There is. there is because u we have been talking so much about detail aspects people are still craving for basic things that you know how can I work on my jealousy how can I let my job go how if someone cheated on me I should be okay I we get such questions even now yeah let's open up one of these this is what I have been told is a very jenzy thing u see I I actually have I work with only jenz's primarily and there's a vibe in that as well because it's a lot of young energy and a lot of intelligence I am told by a lot of them that a lot of people in their generation are run by for more driven culture. Fear of missing out. Yeah. And that's very obvious because social media is showcasing the highlight reels of other people. You think that that's a reality. Those people also suffering. Everyone is suffering. For context, you know, people again people think my life is stunning. You you're my bro beyond this. Like you've you've seen what we go through. I have spent an entire day with him bonding. He is struggling. We all are struggling. His struggles other levels. So life is different. Now that we've said that context, yeah, I really want to talk about this FOMO angle. You know, there's apps that have come out where you can rent video footage from happening concerts and happening clubs in your city. Yeah. upload it onto your story so it looks like you were present at those concerts and those clubs. Like I have so much to say here but I actually want to approach this very empathetically. Over to you. You know uh what I believe it is two important things. It is that you want to show people that you exist and you want some kind of uh recognition that I am there. Secondly, loneliness. I think loneliness is a layer beneath these two. Yes. So we want to be there to and it's a very dark phase because uh that is the reason no love is also conditioned very very conditioned and we try to seek attention. So these are way of seeking attention but beneath that is loneliness and acknowledgement that I exist. So is loneliness the root cause of this? I think it is a package of fear, loneliness, rejection and people are scared of being lonely. If I tell someone to just be in a room, they can't even stay there for half an hour. Do you think one layer deeper, do you think that this is because people run away from what's actually gone on in their life? Definitely. And I have realized that people have a fear to confront nowadays. Sure. They don't want to confront. Sure. Themselves. Yeah. two things I believe very stupid it is but it is true what the other person is going to think and what is their status and what the society will think and that has ruined the very practically I'm talking about what is happening confrontation and that is the reason again communication is very important for any relationship how do we solve for loneliness on a personal level like if I am a lonely 22 year old who is feeling for wants those expensive sneakers can't afford it wants that expensive car, can't afford it. Wants to be at the expensive concert, can't afford it. My actual problem is loneliness. Right. Yeah. This is a major problem. I think at that age, the parents play an important role. Secondly, at that age, we need someone to communicate with. And thirdly, spiritual knowledge is important. Without that, forget young people at 50 60 are feeling only having so many experiences. Oh, that's a whole other gamut. That's another they they have experienced life and when the children tell them that you're feeling they're not in acceptance because they think that they have seen more life. Yeah. It's a vicious cycle you know so that right knowledge of is very important you know I don't like saying this but it's a sad decade right now it is but time will change at one point of time it is people are like this at the other time there is a rise in awareness rise in spirituality rise of people want to do things and at the same time there's another there's too much of information too much of information you know the only solution in All this is to go back to the foundational blocks that is be kind, do your best, read spiritual thought. Yeah. Can I write can I add in a little negative like input here? Yeah. Uh cut off the wrong people from your life. Yeah. So important man. You know I've realized uh you know that the person is bad but you can't let go because you are attached to that person. There's no acceptance. But uh I think one kick and one nudge on the head at that point is very important. That cut off. If you can't cut off someone, at least distance yourself. Yeah. Like if someone's uh causing you jealousy. Yeah. If someone's causing jealousy in you because of their own jealousy, someone's projecting their own insecurities. People do that. People do that. People push it and make you come in guilt and come in very emotional stages. Yeah. Your own loneliness is a swamp that you've been pushed into because you've chosen the wrong people before the loneliness began. That is the reason I tell everyone one arm distance with everyone. Yeah. Because there's a very fine line of entering your space and just knowing you. What do you do to solve your loneliness when you can't expand your social circle? That is the thing. No, whoever you're close to, just talk it out. That is the first way to let it out. The problem is we are even scared to come out and talk about it. This is what I believe. So talk talk just let it out. But again you know if I am sharing then oh what will they think? Oh I become weak. Just talk it out. Let it out. And uh you know at that age the mind is influenced so easily so easily. That is the reason go step out do run jog. Let that energy come out. Talk it out. And I'm sure right people come if just hold on like religion is effectively psychology for many many generations of human beings. True. This is a generation that's forgotten the roots. Yeah. And I think that's why you've also grown the way you've grown on social media because you answer exactly this question that I'm sure you have lots of people on your page who at one point fought for carnivore diet, fought for veganism, fought for feminism, fought for men's rights and they're like no no I don't know why but bah's content is like settling down my head and heart. You know what we have realized on our journey is that you explain with logic you give them an understanding and don't fake up things just be the way you are people will understand but it is a run mechanism no that people go through like if I am projecting something because I'm insecure about it and then we want groups we want people but the fact is when you're being honest and you share what is written the text I think that is experiential no two things is There a book or a shastra from Sanadan that solves for loneliness. Bhagat Gita. Bhagat Gita is the book because it the first chapter it says starts with sorrow. Can you condense down the learnings of the first chapter? Um in very simple simple language. It is said that you if you channelize your sorrow or your pain in the right direction you will be experiencing the highest. Sorrow is sorrow is also energy. Yes. Everything is a yog in Bhagwat Gita 18 chapters they are talking to unite. So if I take this petty victim attitude that why god is like this why why and channel it to a divinity that okay you know what there's a greater energy in simple language that I'll leave it to bhagan I will and you know it is very amazing personally as you mentioned and I've realized throughout the day that you said oh it is better it is better it is better though it may be words for me but you have experienced it you won't repeat it all the time or though maybe it is worse for you somewhere that experience is coming so that change and channelizing is again evolution Yep. Uh I think people loosely know that the Bhagavat Gita was recited by Shri Krishna to the warrior Arjun. Yes. On the day the Mahabharat was beginning. Yes. To understand it further. Shri Krishna loosely froze time, paused time and explained it to Arjun. Because Arjun had too many questions in his head because during the war he was supposed to face his own cousins, his guru. Yes. his grandfather he was confused he was tired didn't want to go to war yeah and then over the course of the Bhagat Gita Shri Krishna explains why he must do his duty go to war and also then went on to explain how to navigate through life Shri Krishna was his sari his charioteer yes and he was literally his charity but he was also the charity of his mind yes so I've not read the entire Bhagat Gita yet I'm in the process but what I sense Hence is that when you begin reading the Bhagat Gita, you will notice that Sri Krishna becomes your charity as well. Definitely out of that pool of sorrow and confusion. We all come from the same source. Again and again the knowledge is always there. For you that divinity has taken a form of a beer. For me she has taken a form of a Kali. Wow. And uh for Arjun she has he has taken a form of Bhagwan. Yeah. And you know it is very strange when you read uh and understand the Gita in detail. He purposely got the chariot in front of his guru and his cousins. And it is a battlefield of life that we are going through all the time where we'll be placed not and it is to make us realize you will not be placed in such situation that you have to kill your own guru and your own cousins. So your problem is not higher than Ajun's problem. Yet Bhagwan has solved it. Your instigment problems will be solved when you surrender. You know when a baby is born it's a soul that's entered bulok. H sure right like yeah before when it comes out or the process yes it's re-entered bull at least it's open to material reality again it's outside the uterus um that child that baby is obviously not aware of the battlefield that awaits it in the form of human life. No, there are two possibilities. Um, if the baby has done some past sadnas, that awareness may come in this birth also from the beginning. from the beginning. Secondly also there might be a possibility that uh who knows it might be the baby's love journey like great Ramana Maharishi or so they might be in that state or the baby might be a completely u baby who born to solve all the problems. So they may go through a very difficult life. Many many possibilities. You know people don't get this. I've actually had some billionaires ask me what my goal is in life. And I say that I want to spiritually evolve and everything else is catered towards that. Another story associated with Arjun is how in his childhood he was called up by his guru in front of all his cousins and he was asked to shoot the eye of a wooden bird on a tree. But before he was called up the other cousins were called. His brothers were also called. And before any of the brothers or the cousins were allowed to take the shot, the guru would asked them, "What do you see?" Someone said, "I see the sky, the tree, the bird." Someone said, "I see the bird in the branch." Someone said, "I see you, Guru." Someone said, "I see everything around me." Arjun was the only prince who came up and said, "I only see the eye of the bird." So the guru says, "Do you see anything else at all?" He's like, "No, I only see the eye of the bird." And then the guru says, "So take your shot." And the bird's eye explodes because of his arrow. Yes. This has been such a character building story for me because I've learned focus through this. But from a very practical human life perspective, what is my eye of the bird right now in life? It is one of two things. One, it's my present catered to my final goal of spiritual evolution. But if I don't end up reaching a great point of spiritual evolution in this life, I want to ensure that my next birth when I take the form of a little baby again, that next birth should be very catered to spiritual evolution. Like I need to position my soul in the best possible place to be ready for the next birth or escape the cycle of birth and death in this birth itself. I think that this mentality is helping me right now. It's helping me keep that arrow locked in. So, one of these two things. But effectively, it's just spiritual evolution, which for me means everyday praying, meditating, doing my sad, being a kind person, trying to improve my body, doing the right thing in the world. Would you like to coach me further in this? See, this is a very similar question that Arjun had asked Bhagwan. What if I die and have not reached a pinnacle of human consciousness? What if in between I die? We call the yoke brushed. That means those evolved beings who have not reached the pakin, they come back again to continue their journey. So Bhagan said very nicely, don't worry. Whatever sanscar, whatever sadhas you have done will be taken to your next birth and your journey will start from there. You'll also be born in a family of yogis. The entire environment will be conducive and you will evolve. But again at that point of time if you waver and you go down the cycle will go again. So conditions will be provided but the human ego again is what problem. Do you consciously think of your next birth? Honest answer. How can an instrument think? It is the way it is. If he wants it is okay. If he doesn't want it is okay. Kali will decide everything what is there. This question is coming to me so I'm asking you. Okay. As you kept reading the Bhagat Gita in your process of reading it, I feel somewhere in the middle of the Gita was a very important lesson for you. Can you just repeat that lesson? Um for me very I think uh some of my past sanscaras and blessings of my guru. I used to question my guru the Gita all the time. What? Question her the Gita like ask questions from the Gita and she used to answer. What do you mean ask questions from the Gita? So when I used to read the Gita whatever doubts I had I used to go run to her and ask questions. So that was my learning and teaching of Gita phase and what I understood from Gita and what my takeaway is that in today's world you are not meant to leave everything and go in today's world participate in everything act everything go through everything but internally be established in Bhagan wow if you take this and you understand you have learned the Gita can I ask you a practical tangential question y how should one divide their time when it comes to balancing spiritual growth as well as professional life as well as family life and all that. Very important. This is what many people struggle with. You can't take a holiday. You have to get it in your system like drinking water. What do you mean? That means when you wake up in the morning, you have your time and do your sad. You have to do it that time. You can't do hanky panky that time. That means it should become a way of your life. That is the teachings of Gita. That means you divide everything equally. You um it takes time but it is possible. It is possible. That means sadha first, work time first, relax, sleeping time. You have to get it and that will change and move around according to your system. But that is the teaching that divide time equally effectively. You're saying it has to become a routine. routine and it is very difficult but if you hang on to your routine for six to eight months you will get it. Let's make it easy. Y I am of the belief that initially even a 10-minute routine can at least begin your journey. Yeah. But it has to be a routine. Then you don't miss those 10 minutes. But that's it. I'm not saying do sa for 1 hour 45 minutes. No. But 15 minutes if I'm doing something stick to it for 6 months. Yeah. Every day. Every day. No matter what. If you're sleeping at 10:00, sleep at 10:00 no matter what. If people are going clubbing, people are going for a movie. No, I will sleep. In the beginning, you have to be harsh. That is what t is all about in modern world. Not going to the mountains and leaving family. But having this, okay, I will not eat after 7:00. I'll not eat. That is my t. Once it becomes a cycle, you will realize that divinity is just you will have your own experiences. Yeah. Yeah. And honestly, I think people who get scared of this process of spiritual exercise. I don't want to meditate. I don't want to pray. I don't believe in it. What will this give me? My input is two things. One, let your experience lead your opinions. And two, eventually just know you're going to enjoy it. But take your body and your existence to that point. You know, the three important things that are binding us is sex, food, and sleep. When you get into routine and you get into higher sadness, you realize that the taste of the nectar is more beyond than anything, any relationship, any friend, any food. You are in a different state altogether. And later you realize that you don't need anyone. Everything is there within you and everything will all the experiences will be given according to your karma and whatever is required in your life. You're talking about spiritual experiences. every even material experiences if you're aiming for a big fancy car and if you don't deserve it it's not there do not come to you but that realization that okay I'll give my best leave but again simple things foundation today yes very important what an important conversation yeah what an important conversation this has been very I'm very happy that we are not justing touching tantra tantra all the time it is very rooted foundation conversation right I mean your practice is of another level. I've just begun my practices. But it it we qualified for these things because we worked on the foundations. Not saying from a place of ego, just seeing this from a place of perspective. Yeah. That yam nam basic basic Santo to be contented in any situation you don't need to chant or you just have to be aware. I have to be satisfied where I am but give my best. important. I have one last uh section I want to open up with you in this episode. Okay. Uh again because my mind is going to practicality throughout this conversation. Um the first time I experienced pranayam in my life and I think we've spoken pranayam in one of our episodes. The first time I experienced pranayam um it was almost like dizzying for my own head. I was like, "Wow, I didn't know that the simple practice of breathing through one nostril, breathing out through the other will create this shock wave in my head in a good way." Um, I'm not going to ask you to showcase a pranayam because you've done it throughout your content. We've done it on the show as well, but I would nudge the audiences to begin pranayam. Yeah. Uh, throughout. So, you know what? Can we demonstrate one if you're comfortable? Are you comfortable? I'm very comfortable. Could you can I tell you which one? Because this is the one coming through in my head. Okay. It's anulom. Anulom. Okay. There's a version of anom that my friend Sukritia spoke about on the show. It was a Shiva oriented episode. It's called Gayatri. Okay. I will show you basic anom that everyone can do. Sure. Okay. Um and let let's take the audience through it in this episode. Okay. So um I'm going to do a proper anomal with you with you. So of course you said cross leg. I can't fet your cross leg. Your spine should be straight. Now this is known as the pranam mudra. Your thumb out. Yeah. Thumb out. Last two fingers is not mentioned in any text. We call it the pranam mudra. Okay. Your your index finger your middle finger bent. Your ring finger and little finger straight. Yeah. If you can't do this you can do this. It is okay. Just keep your little finger. Yeah. But this is the mudra that we take because every mudra is also an important role. Okay. I'm telling you the traditional ankom villum if you do it for six months genuinely it will change your life I take my right hand I'm a righty secondly what people do to pranam is something for beginners that you should know never keep your elbow on your chest you're blocking your own breathing system so the elbow should be out yeah basic so that uh there are many breaths also but I'll just explain I don't know below we always start with the left nostril you keep the left nostril open no we always cover the right we start from the left you cover the right anulom means alternate nostril breathing so I'll inhale from the left left what about the other hand yeah you keep it gadra okay yeah now always start with a count of six so I'm just going to count it so because we are doing it together cover also one more thing I've seen many people complaining that the nose is bleeding this is light feather touch don't push it just feather touch you inhale to the left inhale 6 5 4 3 2 1 cover the nostril. Exhale right. 6 5 4 3 2 1. Inhale right. 6 5 4 3 2 1. Cover the nostril. Exhale. 6 5 4 3 2 1. This is just one round of anomal. You inhale left nostril. You exhale right nostril. You inhale right nostril, you exhale left nostril. If you want some results in anomal 15 minutes it should be done non-stop without any break. If you leave you start again 15 minutes. Okay. I want to add one anecdote. Yeah. Anecdotally please correct me if I'm wrong. I think this is an age where many humans are dealing with anxiety overthinking. This is one of the quickest hacks to reduce it and it will give you benefits immediately. Immediately. It's a fact. We have worked on it in a 10 to 15 minute session of anomol vom. Do it for good 3 months without any break. Start with six always. Now we go to advance but that is that's got it. Yeah that is not for today. Not for today and uh you need a lot of lung capacity. You need bandas you need mudras you need you need bhija mantras. No again if you're going to ba there's another dimension but for beginner sit straight empty stomach wake up in the morning do analom and then close your eyes and meditate tell us after 6 months you will not ask questions you will increase your sadna because after balancing the ida and pna you can meditate easily can you break down the word pranayam pranayam uh pranayam comes from the root word pran and ayam pran is a vital energy without nothing is into existence without that prank chi life force but that's it and I am is you put it away to do it what to do it what but without this breath there is nothing and uh even in every haty yogic text we take gan samita takeaipika pranam is given emphasis even in tantra we do pranayam before we do mantra jab wow even when we do meditation we do anolom in fact the next step of anulom is nadishodan where we doing the same process we're inhaling But holding a breath. So kumbak is where pranam begins. What is kumbuk? Kumbukak is holding of the breath. So when I talk from a very experiential point of view, pranam is not breath. The holding of the breath in a certain manner is pranam. Because there's an oxygen exchange also. Kumbak is the key. The highest ratio that we take is 1 is to 4 is to2 1 is to 4 is to 6. I've taken seen great people taking inhaling 10 holding 80 exhaling 40. It is crazy. Yeah. Practical superficial angle on pranayam. Okay. Yes. Uh it changes the way you look. Yeah. And we're such a cosmetics oriented society nowadays. This is the greatest makeup you will ever use. Your skin will start shining. Not even exaggerating it. But you need practice. You need practice. And of course your meditations are deeper and all that. Um you know there is no way to scientifically explain pan yet. Yes. I think it'll be worked on by scientific research and then they'll figure um and you'll often see the people who deny pranayam completely are the ones who've not experienced it themselves. You can invite all of them to experience it with you. I've actually made a lot of skeptics sit with me and experience it. They're like okay I don't believe in God and yoga but I believe in this breath without breath you're nothing. No as you mentioned today we were talking is fabulous. If you think this is too much easier so just deep brea inhale. So exhale H with awareness slowly slowly these are all preparatory to get to pranam then there's level one level two level three that is another dimension that's why yoga I say you know all I'll say is this this is something Raji Nandi mentioned on the show so he said that the law of the material world is that um people or things that contain slightly ly lower shy will be attracted to people or things that contain slightly higher shi. It's how the universe works. Now one other angle on this is if someone is famous and they're out in public, they will be a magnet for other people to come up. It's a very small way. If someone is rich, you will attract people who either want to work with you or want to benefit from your money etc. And I think that one of the material goals of human life should be to accumulate more shy. One can understand whatever they want through what I just said. But a very practical way of accumulating more shaky in your head, heart and soul is to regularly practice pranayam because pran is life force. True. It's almost like the petrol that fuels every other action in your body. Definitely. And it's not as simple as just being oxygen. It's the subtle layer beyond oxygen. It is the cleansing of the nadis, the flow of prana, the awakening of again we're coming to tantra but yes awakening of kini and it's so doable so easy. So it is a game changer. It's not even a meditation. It's it's something to do with your hands and your nostrils and it can begin unveiling the real version of reality to you. There is something called kapalati. uh kapal is this and shining skull. Yeah. And bati means to shine. So kapalbati there are seven to eight kinds of kapalati. Four are very famous. Basic kapalbati if you do with awareness 3 months you will have a drastic change in your concentration awareness. Drastic drastic means drastic and we have done it. So talking through experience but people don't want to do this. People don't want people I don't know what you know I I realized somewhere when we started as of course we are still beginners no matter what even if you are tired raining headache what we roll the mat and we do once you touch the mat automatically you start doing it but rolling the mat and sitting and that is the effort and you do it for 6 months automatically it's like going to the gym if you have not uh done your biceps for a long time the muscle will crave similarly the body will crave for M just begin. Yeah. Stay at it. Stay at it. Tiny easy goals which are doable. Yeah. Small small. Yeah. Things add up in the long term and there will be material benefits also. But that material benefit is an outcome of all the spiritual benefits. Foundation first. Arh. Thank you so much. Harm Tat. Harm Tats. Nothing to say to you. You know everything I wish to say to you already. But oh, I'm very very grateful and I'm happy. important episode. Yeah, very nice. Responsibility oriented episode. Just thank you for being in our studio again. Thank you for just being. Thank you. Har Mahade. Har Mahadev. [Music]
