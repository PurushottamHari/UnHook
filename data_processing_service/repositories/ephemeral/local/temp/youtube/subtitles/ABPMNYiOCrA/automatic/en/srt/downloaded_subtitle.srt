1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,720
90% of brain real estate is just for

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,599
your face and your hands. Everything

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
below this is

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,000
replaceable. When we talk about the

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
evolution of the human being, you show a

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
photo of a monkey, then primal man, and

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,039
finally homo sapiens. What was the force

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,039
behind evolution,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,680
efficiency, and control? The more you

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,679
are able to control, the more your

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,239
chances of survival. evolution that led

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,640
to humans began to start moving things

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,160
around with the for limbs. That is why

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
the hands started developing fingers. So

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,040
eyes were the last one to tell. Oh,

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,680
really? Cuz eyes are very expensive. It

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,079
takes a lot of energy to convert light

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,239
into meaningful signals. You hear so

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
many young parents say that, "Hey, you

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
know, my children, they're way more

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
advanced than we were when we were our

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,760
age." What does that say about where the

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,239
human species is

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,640
going?

25
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,640
Any kid growing up with an iPad, as soon

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,119
as the iPad is taken away, the babies

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,920
start crying. I fear that this behavior

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,439
pattern will lead to serious attention

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
issues. Because if this level of

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,880
stimulus is the new normal, reality can

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,320
never compete with it. What will the

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
human species look like in a thousand

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,840
years? Today, we are not really

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
controlling our environment with our

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
hands so much. Machines do all of it. We

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,880
need fingers to type but now we have

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,880
voice and suppose if we all get brain

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,799
chips it is possible that we might lose

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,260
our fingers.

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,609
Wow.

41
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,609
[Music]

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:56,590
[Music]

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
We began the last episode with the

44
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,680
intention to talk about the next stage

45
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,520
of evolution for the human species. But

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
in order to understand the next stage of

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
evolution, it was important to explore

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
the present stage of evolution. And

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,760
mental health issues are more rampant

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,920
than ever. Therefore, that conversation

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
went into the realms of mental health.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Yeah. For the sake of this conversation.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,080
So, I'm going to begin this particular

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,239
podcast with some very simple questions

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
and we can cover them very quickly in

56
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
order to head into the body of this

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,200
episode. So, doc, first and foremost,

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
let's do a recap on what neuroplasticity

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
means. Sure. In the brain, there are

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
neurons that connect with each other.

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
The pattern in which those neurons

62
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,400
connect with each other will decide your

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,239
thoughts, your behaviors, your thinking

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,239
patterns. If you want any of these

65
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,120
things to change, the neural connections

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,519
need to

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,879
change. That ability of the neurons to

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,400
change their connection is

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,599
neuroplasticity.

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,400
So every time you learn something new or

71
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,560
unlearn something that you've learned

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,760
before, that is what neuroplasticity is.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
Gotcha. Okay. Now for the key question

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,519
for this episode, which is also my

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,959
favorite subject when it comes to the

76
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,360
realms of science, the evolution of our

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
species. Yeah. Usually when we talk

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
about the evolution of the human being,

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,560
they show a photo of a monkey, then

80
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,040
primal man, then slightly more evolved

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,680
primal man, and finally homo sapiens.

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
They don't show us what's happening

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,400
next. Uh I think that within the realms

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
of science, perhaps neuroscientists are

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,879
the people who are the closest to

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
answering that question in terms of

87
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
where is the brain going next. And

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,200
that's what we're going to discuss in

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,200
this episode. Yeah. But I'd love for you

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,159
to quickly take us through the timeline

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,480
of evolution beginning from us being

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,280
unisellular organisms.

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Wow. Because you said that the lyic

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,640
system is uh ancient. It's ancient. Yes.

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,599
Right. What's the most ancient system in

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,079
the brain?

97
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,959
So why does the brain

98
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:24,320
exist? Because we have to navigate a

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,520
complex environment. Right? So the first

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,479
unicellular

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,080
organism realized that now I'm using a

102
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
lot of words that I'm using as a

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,800
conversation. So realization I hope that

104
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
people understand that the way that an

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,759
animal realizes something is different

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,000
from the way a human realizes something.

107
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,360
But the way evolution worked is life

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,320
needs to survive. For life to survive it

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840
needs to hunt and it needs to protect

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,120
itself.

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,360
So unicellular organisms don't have

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
neural

113
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,639
networks. There's nothing called nervous

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,880
system in a single cell organism. Like a

115
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,160
bacteria does not have a nervous system.

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,440
A virus does not have a nervous

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,039
system. But eventually unicellular

118
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,520
organisms figured out that if they work

119
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,160
together they can get more things done.

120
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,600
Now these figuring outs were happening

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,600
at a chemical level. So at a chemical

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,000
level the unicellular organisms started

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
clubbing together and started working

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
together and that is what led to

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,759
multisellular organisms. What is reality

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
for that unisellular organism? Because

127
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,440
it can't see things, it can't feel

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,919
things. No, but it exists. So how do we

129
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,440
define life? Now very quickly we have

130
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,880
gone to one of the hardest problems in

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,080
not just science but also philosophy,

132
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,720
spirituality. We are trying to define

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,360
what is life and what is consciousness.

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,240
I will say right at the start that we do

135
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,400
not have a clear answer right because if

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
you did that would be a huge leap

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
forward. So we won't sit here and

138
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,360
pretend that we have the answer to what

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
defines life. But there are some

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
hypothesis. There are some working

141
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
definitions that we can use for this

142
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,720
conversation. So we can say that life is

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,800
any organic

144
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,360
matter that is capable of sensing the

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,199
environment and adapting and reacting to

146
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:34,120
it that is life. So anything that can

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,560
sense something around it and change its

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,319
output you can say that it is life. So

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,840
how do you know that a rock is not

150
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,759
alive? Because a rock does not react to

151
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,560
what is going on around it. A rock is

152
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,880
the same wherever it is, whatever it is,

153
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,919
whatever is happening around it. But

154
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,400
even a small

155
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,479
plant will change depending on the

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,560
season, depending on what is going on.

157
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,680
If there is dryness or if there is

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,199
water, it changes. It reacts. So you say

159
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,319
that there is life in this. when it

160
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,440
stops reacting you say it is dead right

161
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,880
that's like a working definition of life

162
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,280
so that's why I would say that a

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,240
bacteria is alive because a bacteria can

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,039
change its cell wall a bacteria can

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,360
change the chemicals inside itself based

166
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,800
on what is going on around a bacteria

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,919
can eat or take up something that can

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,400
give it energy so it is capable of

169
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
sensing and it is capable of reacting to

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,440
the environment. Everybody agrees that

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,160
bacteria are alive. The confusion is are

172
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,960
viruses

173
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,680
alive and even before viruses because

174
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,960
some viruses only have a strand of DNA

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,039
or a strand of RNA from non-living to

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,039
living. Correct. Damn. From unconscious

177
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,960
to

178
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,599
conscious. So basically whenever

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,240
anything is capable of sensing the

180
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,319
environment and reacting to it you would

181
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,319
say that there is some evidence of

182
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,599
consciousness. H so consciousness is not

183
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
a binary. It's not that you are

184
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,520
conscious or unconscious. Consciousness

185
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,599
is a

186
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,879
spectrum and it depends on your ability

187
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,800
to spot reactions that you can say

188
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,240
something is conscious or unconscious.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,199
So for example there are certain human

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,599
conditions where the person may not be

191
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,360
reacting at all and you can say the

192
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,519
person is unconscious but actually the

193
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,240
person is conscious like so there's

194
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
something called locked in

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,640
syndrome where a particular part of the

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,760
brain in your brain stem it's an area

197
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,360
called pawns p

198
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,480
ns if there is an infact there if

199
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,279
there's an injury in that

200
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,560
part you become completely paralyzed

201
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,080
You can't move your hands. You can't

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,320
move your legs. You can't speak. You

203
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,760
can't do anything. You're completely

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,040
paralyzed, but you are able to

205
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,240
sense. But there's no way for people to

206
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,920
know whether you can sense or

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,920
not. So you can hear everything I'm

208
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,160
seeing, but you can't re respond. Not

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,040
even not even with your eyelid. Nothing.

210
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,560
So there are some small eye movements

211
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,399
that sometimes may be possible but

212
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,760
people have been thought to be in

213
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,120
coma while they were actually not in

214
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,640
coma. They were just paralyzed

215
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,320
completely.

216
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,480
So these are interesting things and you

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,720
can't know unless you have an MRI and

218
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,040
you do those tests and all of that.

219
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,320
So back to evolution like this glass is

220
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,399
not doing anything. It doesn't seem to

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
have any purpose in itself. It'll only

222
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,519
move when we move it. Whereas a bacteria

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
would not do that. It has a sense of

224
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,720
purpose. At some point, bacteria

225
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,360
combined with other bacteria and formed

226
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,480
multisellular organisms. So like fungi.

227
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,320
So there's something called hifi. Um so

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,680
or hydra. So th those are sort of fungal

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
creatures that had multiple cells

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,519
attached together. So those are called

231
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,160
as multisellular organism.

232
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,920
still no nervous system. It's still all

233
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,920
chemical. So from one side of that

234
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,320
organism to the other, all the

235
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,839
information was being carried through

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,200
chemicals. Eventually the multisellular

237
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,560
organisms became bigger and bigger and

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,720
the organism realized that for

239
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,720
information to travel from one side to

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:45,200
the other, it was taking too

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,959
long. So imagine that in human evolution

242
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,839
if there was there were two towns so

243
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
Mumbai and Pune and something very

244
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
important is happening in Mumbai that

245
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,839
Pune people had to know and the only way

246
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,440
that Pune could know is by writing a

247
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,399
letter and physically transporting that

248
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,920
letter. It would take too long. So

249
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,120
evolution figured out that instead of

250
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,600
chemicals what if we use

251
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,680
electricity to transport

252
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,760
information and that is the first time

253
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,519
that

254
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,200
nerves evolved

255
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,640
simply for speed of transfer of

256
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,240
information. So now just think about

257
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,600
this for a second all this so that you

258
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
know what is going on around

259
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:37,160
you. So imagine if you were if you lost

260
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,800
your eyes. Imagine if you lost your your

261
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,640
hearing. Imagine if you lost your

262
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,959
touch. Close your eyes and just imagine

263
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,800
what would it be like if you could not

264
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,320
see or hear or

265
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,920
touch. Would you even know that you

266
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,680
exist? You can't sense anything. There

267
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
is nothing.

268
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,600
The reason that you know that you are

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
here is because your nervous system is

270
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,720
giving you information from the world.

271
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,639
And that started in that amoeba. The

272
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,079
first time those neural networks started

273
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,800
developing, it was able to transfer

274
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,040
information and eventually there was so

275
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,040
much information and the creatures also

276
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,600
got bigger and bigger that there was no

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,519
one center that was deciding on what to

278
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,560
do.

279
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,839
So that is the first time

280
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,160
that the neural centers condensed into

281
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,360
one

282
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,240
node where all the information came and

283
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,200
decision making start and what species

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,959
is this? So all this was happening in

285
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,639
the ocean, right? All this was happening

286
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:53,040
in the water and um sort of like the

287
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,760
great great great grandfather of octopus

288
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,120
there like um so octopi have very

289
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,120
interesting neural structures because

290
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
there is one brain and then there is a

291
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
brain inside each leg and then there is

292
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,839
neural networks. So that's how the

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,880
connections happen. Right? There was an

294
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,600
organism called bilateria. It's a back

295
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
it's almost like a multisellular

296
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,079
bacteria and that was the first time

297
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,959
that nature decided that it's important

298
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,720
to know right and

299
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,800
left. So amieba has no right and left.

300
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,880
Amieba is like the circular thing and

301
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,600
right

302
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,680
left but in

303
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,560
bilateria species there was a right and

304
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,000
left and that is the first time that

305
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,760
there was a central line that came. So

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,959
there was a central line and then there

307
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,079
was nerves going on both sides. Spinal

308
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,160
cord that was the earliest version of

309
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,600
the spinal cord. So did the spinal cord

310
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
come first or the brain? The spinal

311
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,480
cord. So that that first node that

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,360
formed was the early spinal cord. Yes.

313
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,600
So that no that node was nothing that

314
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
node was just a collection of nodes.

315
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,440
Gotcha. Right. and then several nodes

316
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,959
came and all of those nodes connected

317
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,800
and that formed the earliest version of

318
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:14,399
uh spinal cord. Now what's interesting

319
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,720
is that why did all this come about? So

320
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,720
that you can get information so that

321
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,160
those creatures can hunt for

322
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,560
food. There is nothing else in life

323
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,760
except looking around and getting food

324
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,440
for energy. So alongside this

325
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,639
development of the nerves and

326
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,199
nodes there was also how to take in

327
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,959
food. So parallel to the nervous system

328
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,800
the gastric system was also

329
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,560
developing and you can't say what is

330
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
more

331
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,480
important. So the nervous system

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
developed so that you can eat and you

333
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,079
ate so that you can build a nervous

334
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,839
system better. What was the force behind

335
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,839
evolution?

336
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,639
In one word,

337
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,120
survival. That's the easiest word. But

338
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
bacteria was also

339
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,920
surviving. So you have to go one step

340
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,680
deeper. It's not just

341
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,560
survival. Because why did evolution keep

342
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,800
pushing

343
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,199
forward? And I would say the simplest

344
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,600
way of putting it

345
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,000
is

346
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,079
efficiency and control.

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,760
So yes, you can survive. Even the

348
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,079
bacteria were surviving.

349
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,120
But did it have

350
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,320
control? It had control over very little

351
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,600
things. The more you are able to

352
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,880
control, the more your chances of

353
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,360
survival.

354
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:52,240
So the one factor that seems to be

355
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,720
pushing evolution forward is a push for

356
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,120
more and more control of the

357
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,360
environment. That's the one uh engine.

358
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,519
I'm obviously linking it to you and me

359
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
in the modern day. Absolutely. Nothing

360
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,279
changes. So one of the beautiful things

361
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,040
about evolution is that every lesson

362
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,800
that every one of our ancestors have

363
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,079
learned is still in us.

364
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,079
So the lessons that our first uh

365
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,920
unisellular bacteria learned is still in

366
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,399
us. Those lessons probably became our

367
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,759
sense of smell by the way. Oh really?

368
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,199
Yeah. Because sense of smell is entirely

369
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,759
chemical and sense of taste is also

370
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,959
chemical. Imagine how much of evolution

371
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,440
needed to happen to get the ability to

372
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,800
convert rays of light which are

373
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,639
photons into signals that you can

374
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,040
understand because we are essentially

375
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,240
made of

376
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:53,839
chemicals. So it's easy for us to

377
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,040
uh sense chemicals. So taste developed,

378
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,199
smell developed both are chemicals. They

379
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,199
directly enter our body and they

380
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,920
directly cause reactions for us to

381
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,799
understand what is going

382
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,880
on. Then we develop

383
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,959
pressure. So movement things happening

384
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
around us is basically pressure. So when

385
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,520
I touch you, I am basically putting

386
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,439
pressure on you. That developed

387
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,120
next. So the sense of touch developed

388
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,600
after that. Then there was pressure but

389
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,440
from sound

390
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:32,320
waves that developed after that and then

391
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,200
eyes. So eyes were sort of like the last

392
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,080
one to develop. So there are entire

393
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,559
species of fishes deep underwater that

394
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,400
don't have eyes. They have everything

395
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,760
else. They're able to sense everything

396
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,400
else but eyes did not develop because

397
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
eyes are very expensive from an

398
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,440
evolutionary perspective. So it takes a

399
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,679
lot of energy to convert light into

400
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
meaningful

401
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,559
signals. So that evolution kept that for

402
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,880
the last right and very interesting

403
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,360
because there are some senses that other

404
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,600
animals developed that we don't even

405
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,799
have like uh there are certain insect

406
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,760
species that can see ultraviolet and

407
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,480
infrared spectrum of light. There are um

408
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,400
animals that can sense

409
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,960
geomagnetic direction. So the earth has

410
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,440
magnetic

411
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,600
waves. Sea turtles can sense that. So

412
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,679
even if you blindfold them and you leave

413
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,320
them in the water, they'll be able to

414
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,480
make their way across like thousands of

415
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
kilometers of ocean because they know

416
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,799
where is north, where is south. They're

417
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,640
able to sense it. But if you put a large

418
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,440
magnet on their heads, they get

419
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,200
lost. So they are able to sense

420
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,880
geomagnetic, you know, the poles. So

421
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
there are a lot of these senses that

422
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,160
other animals developed that we never

423
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,880
developed. We don't even know what it's

424
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,880
like. So all these senses developed so

425
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,120
that we can become more and more aware

426
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
of our

427
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,320
environment. But it's not enough to just

428
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
be aware

429
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,880
information if you don't know what to do

430
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,000
with

431
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,880
it. So then as more and more senses

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,919
developed our ability to process all

433
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,520
that information also developed.

434
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,039
So you had specific centers that was

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,480
dedicated to processing specific senses.

436
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,640
Let's go back to that timeline of

437
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
evolution. Yeah, we we reached the point

438
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,120
where we were talking about just the

439
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,160
spinal cord developing. Correct.

440
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,799
Uh do earthworms have brains? Earthworms

441
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,559
are part of the bilateral species? So

442
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,799
earthworms if you cut them in half the

443
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,160
left side left side and the right side

444
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,679
are both similar. Right? So the when you

445
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,640
cut them what happens is on top is the

446
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,440
nervous system the spinal cord and right

447
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,600
underneath is the gastric system and

448
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,320
that's it mouth to anus it's a single

449
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,640
tube these two developed together I want

450
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,039
you to remember this line so the nervous

451
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,840
system and the GI system developed

452
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,600
together they are twins they came

453
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,400
through evolution together they are

454
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,400
intricately connected Ed both of them

455
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,360
are constantly in support of each other

456
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,039
which is why we say gut brain. Yes. So

457
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
even today if something goes wrong in

458
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
your brain your gut will suffer. If

459
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,280
something goes wrong in your gut your

460
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
brain will suffer.

461
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,840
Yeah. As evolution progressed. The

462
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,039
progression happened in two main areas.

463
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,400
One is

464
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,799
movement. So earthworms had a lot of

465
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,039
legs right? They would move. But you

466
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,440
want to move more and more efficiently.

467
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,080
So how do you move faster? How do you

468
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,679
move quicker? So movement progress. So

469
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,760
their body is physically changed. And

470
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,039
the amount of processing that needs to

471
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,200
be done also changed because if you have

472
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,440
to move very quickly that means that

473
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,320
your processing time is less now. So you

474
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,600
need a more efficient processor. So the

475
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,679
nervous system evolved and that is how

476
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
it's it wasn't enough. Remember earlier

477
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,400
there was just a neural mesh there was

478
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,240
just a net then there were nodes and

479
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
then all the nodes came to the center

480
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,840
and then there was a spinal cord but

481
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,919
even that wasn't enough so one part of

482
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,559
the spinal cord became

483
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:30,080
bigger. So the node at the end of the

484
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,480
spinal cord became bigger because that

485
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,039
is where the primary sensory organ

486
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,640
started accumulating. So whichever part

487
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:43,760
of the body had the senses which was the

488
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,600
mouth and the taste and the smell since

489
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,159
that is where the maximum amount of

490
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,240
information was coming in that node

491
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
became bigger and bigger and bigger and

492
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,360
eventually that is what led to the

493
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,159
brain. That is how we had not only left

494
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,600
and right but we also developed a front

495
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,640
and back. Wow. Because the front was

496
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,320
where the mouth was and since eating was

497
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,360
the primary reason for survival or the

498
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
primary motivator for

499
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:19,280
survival senses or senses. So then that

500
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,200
node became bigger. That's the brain.

501
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,480
Wow. That's why our heads are the way

502
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,000
they are. Correct. The head is where it

503
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,919
is because the mouth is there and so the

504
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,640
other senses are there because

505
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,880
everything is about eating. Everything

506
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,159
below this is

507
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,320
replaceable. Everything below this has

508
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,720
been replaceable. If you think about it,

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,120
the face has roughly remained the same

510
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,919
forever. If you look at a

511
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,679
snake, nose,

512
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,640
eyes, doesn't really have ears as such.

513
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,480
But if you look at evolution, this part

514
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
the shape would have changed but roughly

515
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,559
it's the same because the functions of

516
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,880
this part is this much to see to hear to

517
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,760
taste and to smell and to

518
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,400
eat. Below this has been a whole range

519
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,679
of experiments. What is the most

520
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,840
efficient way of

521
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:21,360
eating? So is it slithering through the

522
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,080
floor? Is it flying? Is it running on

523
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,080
four legs? Is it walking on two legs?

524
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,559
Evolution is just playing trial and

525
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,360
error. Trial and error. What is the best

526
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,440
way to

527
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,559
eat and

528
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,559
survive? So this part is the

529
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,720
same. As long as you're eating properly

530
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,240
that that branch of evolution will

531
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,440
progress more. Okay. Now let's move on.

532
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,760
So, we've reached the first early brain

533
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
being developed. What would be a

534
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,480
modernday kind of example of this kind

535
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,840
of a species where a brain's developed

536
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,080
and probably there's some kind of a

537
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,400
spinal cord? Worms. So, um you could

538
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,200
think of worms or you could push it a

539
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,840
little bit further into

540
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,559
reptiles. So, early reptiles, fish, um

541
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,240
fish also. Yeah. So depending on so here

542
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,360
again there is a differentiation because

543
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
some creatures stayed in the ocean and

544
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,240
some of them crawled out. So it was the

545
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,480
earliest form of reptiles that crawled

546
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,559
out. So those are called as amphibians.

547
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,960
So the ancestors of crocodiles for

548
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,200
example. So they can both be in the

549
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,159
water and outside. Sea snakes. Sea

550
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,080
snakes. So there are all of those

551
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,679
reptiles they are able to function both

552
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,080
in water and out. So that happened and

553
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,200
then evolution progressed underwater

554
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,799
also and outside the water

555
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,360
also. Eventually what happened if you

556
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,720
are out of the water you need legs.

557
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,559
There is no use for legs and hands

558
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,760
underwater. So underwater what you need

559
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,080
is fins. What you need is long tails.

560
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,760
What you need is a you know aerodynamic

561
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,559
body that can go through water quickly.

562
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,240
Whereas above you need legs because you

563
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,760
need to propel yourself through the

564
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,679
ground faster. And uh that's how

565
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,799
reptiles kept evolving and eventually

566
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,000
again there was further breakage. Um you

567
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,760
had eventually you got

568
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
mammals because earlier all the

569
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,480
creatures were uh born through

570
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,080
eggs and then you got mammals. I I just

571
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,679
want to rewind a bit. Reptiles

572
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
according to the timeline of the earth

573
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,640
became the dinosaurs that we knew.

574
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Correct. Right. Correct. Along with the

575
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,279
dinosaurs, some of them evolved into I

576
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,200
believe shrews.

577
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,880
Yeah. Right. Uh shrews are the ancient

578
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,720
ancestor I believe

579
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,039
of monkeys. They're like they're like

580
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,559
ratlike creatures. Correct. So uh there

581
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,279
are there was something called as a

582
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,919
squirrel monkey and the there were

583
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:11,520
lemurs and they eventually became the

584
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,720
monkeys that we know and they evolved

585
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,200
into large apes and smaller apes

586
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,440
chimpanzees

587
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,039
orangutangs which led to humans. The

588
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,039
only reason I'm bringing up shrews is

589
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,960
because when the dinosaurs went extinct

590
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,640
because of that cataclysmic event where

591
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:35,200
the meteors hit. Yeah. Uh the shrews

592
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,120
apparently went underground, survived.

593
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
Yeah. And then were able to come out

594
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,919
after the cataclysm and those are all

595
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,320
our great grandparents. Yeah. That's

596
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,120
where that second phase of evolution of

597
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,640
life on the earth started. Uh, and the

598
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
reptiles that survived survived like

599
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,760
crocodiles survived. I'm sure snakes

600
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,600
survived etc. Uh, insects, cockroaches.

601
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,840
H, but the dinosaurs were too big to

602
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,200
survive. Yeah, that effectively that's

603
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,760
where the dinosaurs died. Yeah. So,

604
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,159
there were some uh creatures in that

605
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,440
time that were also airborne. They were

606
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,760
flying. Um, but yeah, so a lot of lot of

607
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,279
evolutionary changes happened there.

608
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,000
When we talk of neuroscience, when we

609
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,400
talk of how the brain evolved, it is

610
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
still that primary principles are still

611
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,159
there. Like there's a spinal cord,

612
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
there's a brain. Now eyes are very well

613
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,279
developed. People can see very well.

614
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,919
You're talking about now? Uh no, even

615
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,720
during the dinosaur times, um eyes,

616
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,200
nose, ear, all these senses are already

617
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,240
developed pretty well. And now the main

618
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,640
evolution, the main attention that

619
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,960
evolution was focusing on was movement.

620
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
How do we move? I'm I'm sorry. I'll have

621
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,760
to pause you a little bit here. There's

622
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,679
a very common phrase called the

623
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,679
reptilian brain. Yeah. Which is very

624
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,799
alive in us today as well. Yeah. So, I'm

625
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,679
going to have to ask you to come back to

626
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
2025 and talk about what the reptilian

627
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,600
brain is because we share this with the

628
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,480
dinosaurs. Yes. So, the reptilian brain

629
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,840
is the most primitive part of the brain.

630
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,360
That is where your brain stem is. And

631
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,279
the reptilian brain is responsible for

632
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,440
the core survival parts of our body

633
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,120
which is breathing, your heart rate and

634
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,799
your core defense mechanisms. So that

635
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,840
fight and flight basic structure

636
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,159
reptilian

637
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,559
brain it it doesn't even cover the lyic

638
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,240
system as it exists today. That is still

639
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,679
not reptilian brain. Reptilian brain is

640
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,320
even before that. So it is primarily

641
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,360
your brain stem and it has your core

642
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,760
attraction towards food and and running

643
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,000
away from

644
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,640
danger reptilian brain. That's it.

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,200
That's it. And that still exists in us

646
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,120
today. So whenever you have an urge to

647
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
not die, whenever you have an urge to

648
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,720
eat something or whenever you have an

649
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,520
urge to have

650
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,320
sex, it's actually a gift of your

651
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,559
reptile ancestors. They felt the same.

652
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,440
Yeah. Yeah. Do you think reptiles even

653
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,279
get upset? There's no way to know. I'll

654
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,799
tell you where I'm coming from. We'd

655
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,640
gone to Vantara recently and we

656
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,320
documented it and there was an

657
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,039
interaction we had with the crocodiles

658
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,520
where uh Forest Galante was guiding us

659
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,279
through it. He patted onto the crocodile

660
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,320
enclosure. All these crocodiles came

661
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,279
towards us and there was like 100

662
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,279
crocodiles in front of us. Wow.

663
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,720
B.

664
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Oh my god. They will jump. Uh-huh.

665
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,039
Yeah. A little bit of primalness in

666
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,679
their eyes for

667
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:48,320
sure. And there was just deadness in

668
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,160
their eyes. Mhm. I felt like there was

669
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,080
no like zero emotion, nothing.

670
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,080
[Music]

671
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,000
I almost was envious of

672
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:04,159
that. Recently I had gone scuba diving

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,679
and I dived with sharks in Maldives and

674
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,760
we were around 30 m underwater and we

675
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,640
were surrounded by around six tiger

676
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:18,880
sharks huge ones 10 12 ft long and one

677
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,240
of them swam next to me maybe 5t away

678
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,480
and I could see its

679
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,279
eyes. It is completely black. There's no

680
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,399
blinking and it it h you you have a

681
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,200
surreal experience because your human

682
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,240
brain is wired to look for

683
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,399
emotion. Every time you look into

684
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,080
someone's eyes, you are looking for some

685
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,440
sort of emotion. You're looking to

686
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,279
understand what is going on. You cannot

687
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
understand what is going on in a shark's

688
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,320
brain by looking into its eyes. Or are

689
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,320
things even going on?

690
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,840
It is thinking of something. It is

691
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,880
reacting to the environment. It is

692
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,279
alive. It's not dead. It will act. It

693
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,279
might bite you. But you are looking for

694
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
signals from its eyes whether it'll bite

695
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
you or not. But you are not wired. You

696
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,559
are not trained. But the people who have

697
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
been diving there for 10 years, 20

698
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,840
years, the the professionals there, the

699
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,360
guides, they know. So they know that

700
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,520
this shark is behaving like this. is the

701
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,600
shark is doing. So they are they are now

702
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,080
trained to understand the shark's

703
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,279
behavior patterns. So even in your

704
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,480
example, the guy who called the the

705
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,559
crocodiles, he might not look into their

706
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,159
eyes, but he knows how what each

707
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,799
alligator is feeling or each crocodile

708
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,279
is feeling. So emotion is a tricky thing

709
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:41,440
because it takes two to understand an

710
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,640
emotion.

711
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,440
It's you also need to learn that

712
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,880
animal's emotional behavior patterns. So

713
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,840
if you are seeing a crocodile for the

714
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,480
first time, you won't understand

715
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,840
anything. But they do have some

716
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,080
reaction. And you can see this with pets

717
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,799
all the time, right? Like with cats,

718
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,320
with dogs, you know that some things you

719
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,640
can say, you shout at them, they'll go

720
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,640
to a corner and

721
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,159
sulk. That is upset. Sometimes they'll

722
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
just look into your eyes and you know

723
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,480
what they're thinking. Yeah. They're

724
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,039
actually trying to convey something to

725
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,399
you. Yeah. And that's also your empathy

726
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,919
because it's not that it's their

727
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:23,279
thought, it is your thought and you will

728
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,200
now act accordingly. So it takes two for

729
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,960
that emotional connection to happen. Uh

730
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,919
so coming back to that evolutionary

731
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,080
story, the reptilian brain is not really

732
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,399
capable of expressing emotion.

733
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,080
The reptilian brain can't do that. In

734
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,399
fact, at the reptilian level, the facial

735
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,799
muscles are not even developed enough to

736
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,799
show

737
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,799
expression. in your face that is capable

738
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,960
of doing all these expressions. A

739
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,799
reptile's brain, a reptile's face

740
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,799
doesn't have so many muscles. Its

741
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,760
muscles are very simple. Jaw open, jaw

742
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,480
closed, eyes, whatever. That's it. Turn

743
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,919
head. It's much simpler. So, we are

744
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,840
looking for expressions that it is

745
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,240
physically incapable of

746
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,480
making. That is the communication gap.

747
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,679
Okay. Was there a difference between the

748
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,519
brains inside the shrew's skull versus

749
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,640
the brains inside the dinosaur skulls

750
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,799
because they were present at the same

751
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,519
time? Correct. So the difference would

752
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,200
be not very big. This is where the

753
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,559
differences really started when we went

754
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,919
from eggbearing to mammals. So I think

755
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,279
it's called ovaris and viviperis. M so

756
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,240
when creatures were born in eggs versus

757
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,279
when creatures were born when the female

758
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,640
of the species would carry

759
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:01,519
um the baby and deliver the

760
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:05,320
baby. Gradually there was a a difference

761
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:10,159
in the way that the brains

762
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,520
evolved at least in our our branch.

763
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,879
What was happening

764
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:19,760
was we began to have more and more use

765
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,399
of our forlims. So we have forlims and

766
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,440
we have hind limbs. So forlims is the

767
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,679
the the limbs that are in front closer

768
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,679
to the mouth and hind limbs are the ones

769
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,000
that are closer to the anus. That's

770
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,879
pretty much the difference, right?

771
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,480
And in the in the branch of evolution

772
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:42,280
that we come in, the four limbs began to

773
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,440
be used for other things than just

774
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,560
walking. Whereas in all the other uh

775
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,760
other branches like cats and dogs and

776
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,000
horses, the forlims and hind limbs are

777
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,599
exactly for the same purpose for

778
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,440
walking, for running. There's no

779
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,480
difference. Just in our branch, we began

780
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,560
to start moving things around with the

781
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
four limbs and gradually there was a

782
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,119
shift in our center of gravity

783
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,560
backwards. And this was an experiment.

784
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,640
The way I see it is this was an

785
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,880
experiment. It could have worked, it

786
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,359
could not have worked. If it wouldn't

787
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,800
have worked, we wouldn't be here. As

788
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,839
simple as that. It's how rats kind of go

789
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,400
up like that. And squirrels go up. Yes.

790
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,720
So the squirrels were actually so some

791
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,000
of the rodents the squirrels would pick

792
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,440
up a nut, right? And eat that nut like

793
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,520
this. And even beavers in the forest,

794
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,200
the beavers were able to use their four

795
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,520
legs uh four limbs to say build a dam.

796
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
You know those you've seen stories of

797
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,720
water coming in and beavers building a

798
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,560
little dam. So gradually some of the

799
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,720
animals figured out that they can

800
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,200
balance themselves on the hind legs and

801
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,480
still move their four legs to get more

802
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,720
things done. Before that, the only way

803
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,920
to interact with the environment was

804
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,800
with our mouths. So if you look at a dog

805
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,640
or a lion, the only way they will

806
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,240
interact or move anything is with their

807
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,760
mouth. They will pick up their babies

808
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,040
with their mouth. They will hunt with

809
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,480
their mouth. They will eat with their

810
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,079
mouth. They will uh try to clear the

811
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,599
area with their mouth. Everything is

812
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,839
with their mouth and their face. There's

813
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,800
no other way to interact with the

814
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:26,960
environment. More control is possible on

815
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
the environment. On the environment, if

816
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,280
you use your hind legs for something

817
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,400
else and four legs for something else.

818
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,680
So their brain started evolving because

819
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,599
of the usage of the hands. Yes. And that

820
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,440
is why the hands started developing

821
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,640
fingers.

822
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,839
This was a huge

823
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,720
thing. I cannot stress how big of a

824
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,480
thing developing fingers were for the

825
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,440
journey of the brain.

826
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,920
Yes. Simply because till

827
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,599
now dexterity or moving small things

828
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,079
accurately was not an option. Which is

829
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,320
why fingers evolved.

830
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,320
And so evolution realized

831
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:18,280
that you can have more control over the

832
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,240
environment by learning to move

833
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,160
particular digits

834
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,760
independently. Huge thing. Cut back to

835
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,560
2025. Is there still an evolving

836
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,920
relationship between your hand and your

837
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,280
brain?

838
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,160
Absolutely. If you look at the brain,

839
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,720
there's something called as the

840
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,920
humunulus. So the humunulus is a shape

841
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,280
in your brain that represents what part

842
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,200
of your brain controls what part of your

843
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,200
body.

844
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,800
Okay?

845
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,839
So you would imagine that you have your

846
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:00,000
legs, two legs, two hands. So you would

847
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,200
imagine that all of these parts will get

848
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,720
equal amount of real estate in the brain

849
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,359
because the brain real estate is very

850
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,240
precious. Aic millimeter is very

851
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,960
precious and fought for. But would you

852
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,440
believe

853
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,839
that

854
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,720
90% of that real estate is just for your

855
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,560
face and your hands?

856
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,480
Wow. Of of you're saying the physical

857
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,960
area of the human brain. Wow. And only

858
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:36,520
one small part is for

859
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:40,000
your chest and legs and

860
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,920
feet. Most of that part it is it's

861
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,440
called the motor cortex which is the

862
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,320
part of the brain that is responsible

863
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,359
for how your body moves. So your

864
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,000
movement is controlled by the motor

865
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:55,920
cortex and the majority of that area is

866
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,640
just for your fingers and your face.

867
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,480
Let's talk about our closest cousins,

868
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,000
the chimpanzees. They also have hands.

869
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
Yes. Their hands are way more powerful

870
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,280
than our hands. Okay. Yes. This a

871
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,480
stronger species. Yes. I'm assuming our

872
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,359
hands are more superior than their hands

873
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,760
in terms of intricacy.

874
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,920
Like we have a neater handwriting.

875
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,640
Yes. Um but there are very interesting

876
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,320
studies of chimpanzees doing some pretty

877
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,040
dextrous

878
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,119
work and um like there are chimpanzees

879
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,520
who have learned to

880
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,359
type on a keyboard which is pretty

881
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,280
impressive right because learning to

882
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,880
type is not an easy thing.

883
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,960
So there is a whole school of thought

884
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,599
that a chimpanzeee brain is capable of

885
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,720
learning a lot of things that a human

886
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,160
brain is.

887
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,520
Um except that it's difficult to

888
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,240
convince a chimpanzzeee brain as to why

889
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,400
why should it learn it? Um but anyway

890
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,640
that's a it's almost like an obscure

891
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,400
question but the brain

892
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,240
is almost the same. A chimpanzeee brain

893
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,800
and a human brain is almost the same. So

894
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,520
the networks are all in place and

895
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,520
chimpanzeee brain also has dexterity. So

896
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,880
um there are monkeys who can solve who

897
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,800
can work on a Rubik's cube which takes a

898
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,480
lot of dexterity like turning and all of

899
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,800
that. So it is possible. Um I'm I'm just

900
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
trying to think of the cool things that

901
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,040
humans can do with the hands that

902
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,200
chimpanzees can't. H I'd probably say

903
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,800
art or something. But that's not a

904
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,960
function of the hand. That's a function

905
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,240
of thought. Where I'm going at with this

906
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,240
is what humans are to

907
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,760
chimpanzees. The next stage of humankind

908
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,640
will be to human beings. Interesting.

909
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,720
I'll tell you what it is. So when we

910
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,599
come when we talk about

911
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,520
movement, chimpanzees and

912
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,839
humans

913
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,599
theoretically would be capable of pretty

914
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:08,440
much all of it. Okay. So when we talk of

915
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,880
evolution say reptilian brain reptilian

916
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,440
brain limbic system which is the

917
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,480
emotional part of the brain monkeys also

918
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,280
have this lyic system on top of the lyic

919
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,520
system is your prefrontal

920
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:25,240
cortex. In the prefrontal cortex the

921
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,839
oldest part is your motor

922
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,599
cortex. Does that make sense? So the

923
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,280
motor cortex is where your hands and

924
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,680
legs are getting

925
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,560
moved. Chimpanzees, orangutans, great

926
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,560
apes all have a motor cortex that is

927
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,640
pretty much as developed as us. But

928
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,280
evolution didn't end there because

929
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,880
beyond that, evolution progressed. Our

930
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,359
prefrontal cortex kept evolving and the

931
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,119
most recent parts of our prefrontal

932
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,000
cortex is where we differ from monkeys,

933
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,079
chimpanzees, chimpanzees because we are

934
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,880
capable of

935
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,760
insight. And this is where the story

936
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:13,079
changes because till

937
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:16,800
now from say the earliest

938
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:20,000
microorganisms had no sense of whether

939
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,400
it's alive or not. We are guessing at

940
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,520
some

941
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,119
point chimpanzees seem to build a lot of

942
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,000
animals actually seem to build a sense

943
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,880
of community. They would get they would

944
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,040
form longlasting relationships. They

945
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,040
would break up. They would do a lot of

946
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,280
things that human societies also do. So

947
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,359
they're also capable of thinking. They

948
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,520
would elect a leader. They would be one

949
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,680
person who's deciding everything. They

950
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,119
would fight against different tribes. A

951
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,880
lot of things that human beings are

952
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,160
still

953
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,599
doing. But as far as we know, they have

954
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,560
cognition, which means they can think.

955
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,040
But what they don't have is

956
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:06,040
metacognition which is can they think

957
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:09,720
about thinking? H can they think about

958
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,079
thinking? Can I think about why am I

959
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,000
thinking? It's like a human being

960
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,240
dwelling upon his or her own mental

961
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
health.

962
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,640
Yes, this is metacognition and this is

963
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,400
something that only an evolved

964
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,839
prefrontal cortex can do because until

965
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,640
now everything else that a human being

966
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,160
does a monkey can also do which is fight

967
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,760
for food, make a family, take care of

968
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,839
their kids, go to work technically which

969
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,359
is to go and find food, build a tribe,

970
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,040
protect your family,

971
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,200
All of this monkeys also

972
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,319
do. What can humans do currently that a

973
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,920
monkey cannot is to think about what am

974
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,880
I doing here? Why am I here? And why am

975
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,560
I thinking? What is this? What am I what

976
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,560
is going on? The spiritual aspect of

977
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,560
life. You can think of it as a spiritual

978
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,200
aspect of life. You can just think of it

979
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,200
as selfawwareness.

980
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,000
So this is the crux of the consciousness

981
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,440
conversation which is like I said at the

982
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,280
start of the episode consciousness is

983
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,880
not binary. You can't say this is

984
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,440
conscious or not conscious.

985
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,680
Consciousness is a

986
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,000
loop. It's a

987
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,920
spiral. Are you

988
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,960
conscious? A bacteria is also conscious

989
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,000
because it is acting. But are you

990
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,040
conscious of being

991
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,440
conscious? And are you conscious of

992
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:46,040
being conscious of being

993
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:48,599
conscious? That spiral is what leads to

994
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,640
evolution. Whatever our next stage

995
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,920
of evolution

996
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,119
is, what role do you think the hands

997
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,319
will play or is it too difficult to no?

998
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,560
We can extrapolate, right? Uh let's look

999
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,960
at the principles that we have formed so

1000
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,480
far. Why is evolution happening for

1001
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,839
survival?

1002
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,880
Why is the what is the other reason that

1003
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,359
evolution is happening? For control of

1004
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,240
our

1005
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:17,520
environment. So why did hands evolve?

1006
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,640
Because we wanted to control our

1007
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,200
environment

1008
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,640
better. Today we are not really

1009
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,800
controlling our environment with our

1010
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,760
hands so much.

1011
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,359
Because now we have found third party

1012
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,520
tools to control our environment for us.

1013
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,319
Right?

1014
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,880
Because monkeys needed to evolve hands

1015
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,319
because they wanted to dig and they

1016
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,319
wanted to look for things and they

1017
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,800
wanted to climb and they wanted to break

1018
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:52,079
a fruit off. Today machines do all of

1019
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,280
it. So technically we don't need fingers

1020
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,520
so much. We need fingers to type. But

1021
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,079
now we have

1022
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,680
voice. And eventually suppose if we all

1023
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,040
get brain

1024
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,680
chips. Technically the reason that we

1025
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,040
evolved hands will go away. It'll lose

1026
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,839
its purpose. It'll lose its purpose.

1027
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,880
Like a tail. Like a

1028
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:17,359
tail. So we will not need fingers

1029
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,760
because the only point of fingers was to

1030
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,520
interact with our environment. But now

1031
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,839
we are interacting with our environment

1032
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,440
in other ways. So while we are still

1033
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,599
scrolling with our fingers and typing

1034
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,319
with our fingers, we are also figuring

1035
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,440
out other ways of interacting with the

1036
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:35,119
environment. And when I say environment,

1037
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,440
I mean digital environment. We still

1038
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,880
need a hand. We still need fingers to

1039
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,200
open a car key or open a door. But what

1040
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,839
if you figure out other ways of doing

1041
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,440
all of it? What if you can just tell the

1042
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,839
door to open? What if you look at the

1043
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,400
car and it opens? All of these things if

1044
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,480
it's possible and if it sustains for a

1045
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,720
million years it is possible that we

1046
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,480
might lose our fingers because evolution

1047
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,640
will not keep anything that we don't use

1048
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,160
for a long time. What would you say is

1049
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,119
the most significant thing we do with

1050
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,079
our hands

1051
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:10,480
today? Eating would be the primary thing

1052
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,240
and that's not changed. Uh eating would

1053
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,000
always remain the most important thing

1054
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:21,680
that we do and that will always remain a

1055
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,920
core drive. Um and if you look at it

1056
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,480
very

1057
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,599
simplistically, everything else that you

1058
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:33,520
do is say at your job or whatever is in

1059
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,640
a way linked to being successful enough

1060
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,240
that you can

1061
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,960
eat.

1062
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,400
Wow. Right

1063
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,480
now this is at the reptilian brain

1064
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,720
level. Your motivation at the reptilian

1065
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,960
brain level is this much. Does that mean

1066
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,280
that we don't have more to offer? No. So

1067
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,280
at the limbic brain level, you will have

1068
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,040
other motivations. So you will have

1069
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,359
ego. So the limbic brain is where ego

1070
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,240
comes

1071
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:04,720
in. This is who I am. Tigo taking charge

1072
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,880
of its territory. Yeah. Sort of like

1073
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,560
that. Yes. So that's where the ego comes

1074
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,240
in. So ego comes with its own

1075
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,240
motivation. Then you have your

1076
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,720
prefrontal cortex. Prefrontal cortex

1077
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,160
come with its own motivation that I want

1078
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,800
people to look at me this

1079
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:23,280
way. I want to be remembered in a 100

1080
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,280
years. A tiger will not think like this

1081
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,760
because a tiger's brain is not capable

1082
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,040
of thinking 100 years ahead. Only a

1083
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,000
human brain can even conceive of time

1084
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,680
like this. What will you do? If you try

1085
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,280
to have this conversation with a tiger

1086
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,119
key, what will you do in 5

1087
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,680
years? Even if you could speak in a

1088
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,920
tiger language, how do you put that

1089
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,200
thought across? Because for a tiger,

1090
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,440
it's all dayto-day. I'll wake up and

1091
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,160
then whatever my body is telling me to

1092
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,440
do, I will do. How do you plan 5 years

1093
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,880
ahead? The part of the brain that does

1094
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,400
that is the prefrontal cortex,

1095
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,839
specifically the frontar part of the

1096
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,599
prefrontal cortex. Can can we talk about

1097
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,000
the perception of time within the human

1098
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,240
brain? Yeah. A lot of astrophysicists

1099
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,040
I've spoken to on the show have said

1100
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,359
that actually physics has still not

1101
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,920
understood what time is just a

1102
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,720
convenient uh means for certain

1103
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,640
mathematical equations that we use to

1104
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,680
explain the nature of the universe which

1105
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,240
is what we term as physics but they no

1106
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,559
one's understood what time is what is

1107
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,559
the relationship of the modern human

1108
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,359
brain with time and I also asked this

1109
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,440
from the perspective where it's like a

1110
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,160
really boring example, but it's it's a

1111
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,000
common one, which is that on vacation,

1112
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,720
time seems to pass much slower than

1113
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,280
normal. And when you're in your work

1114
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,119
environment, on a day-to-day basis, time

1115
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,400
seems to fly by. But during some

1116
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,040
tasks, time gets stretched and during

1117
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,000
tasks where having fun, time

1118
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,000
shrinks. What's actually happening in

1119
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,520
the brain? When you say time, there are

1120
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,079
two kinds of time. There is objective

1121
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,160
time and there is subjective time.

1122
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,760
And for all practical purposes in our

1123
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,880
everyday life, what we are talking about

1124
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,760
is subjective time. Objective time is

1125
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,839
the time that is calculated on paper.

1126
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,720
Right? So how much time is between 12:00

1127
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,160
and 4:00? And you would say 4 hours.

1128
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,040
Great. That's objective

1129
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,760
time. But subjectively, if you start

1130
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:35,480
working at 12:00 and you stop working at

1131
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,640
4:00, did you do 4 hours of

1132
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,040
work? It's

1133
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:45,480
impossible because subjectively the way

1134
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:49,359
that the brain is structured, you were

1135
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:53,359
aware of what you were doing for only

1136
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:56,839
around 50 to 60% of that.

1137
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,720
the rest of the time you were

1138
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:00,880
daydreaming. This is just the way that

1139
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,520
the brain is wired. Your attention will

1140
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,160
flow in and out. And when your attention

1141
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,800
is flowing out, you won't even realize

1142
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,800
that it's

1143
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,640
gone. So whatever amount of time you

1144
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,559
think you have, you actually have half

1145
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,000
of

1146
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:20,800
that in terms of subjective time. So you

1147
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,200
are only whatever time you are aware of

1148
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,960
is the time that is available to you.

1149
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,960
So that is so this whole thing is called

1150
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,680
chrono perception. What part of the

1151
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,480
brain processes time? Multiple parts. So

1152
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,640
there are so there are circardian

1153
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,040
rhythms and there are basically

1154
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,240
chronosensing apparatus at multiple

1155
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,800
levels. So there is a time loop even in

1156
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,720
the cells in the organs. So the liver

1157
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,440
keeps its own clock. The heart has its

1158
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,559
own clock. Um and different parts of the

1159
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,960
brain has they have their own clocks.

1160
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,119
So circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle

1161
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,280
and then you have your uh monthly

1162
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,280
cycles. So different loops happen. So

1163
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,599
there are multiple clocks going on in

1164
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,880
your

1165
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,839
body. The part of the brain that is

1166
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,160
aware of moment to moment

1167
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,880
um

1168
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,000
that it's

1169
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,880
um so there's something called as a

1170
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,559
default mode network which is the part

1171
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,240
that is involved in self introspection.

1172
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,800
So that's what the part that is aware of

1173
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,440
the self. Whenever you go into default

1174
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,280
mode network state, you lose awareness

1175
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,240
of

1176
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,640
time because time is an external

1177
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,319
perception. Is this like going into flow

1178
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,880
state sort of? Yeah. Even when you

1179
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,480
meditate or when you daydream also. So

1180
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,079
flow state is different because flow

1181
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,240
state is when you are engaged in

1182
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,920
something outside.

1183
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,319
So even in flow state you're not

1184
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,160
actively thinking of time but in default

1185
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,520
mode network state you're going inwards

1186
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,720
you're daydreaming you are in your own

1187
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,760
imaginary land and vape you will lose

1188
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,520
sense of time like how when you're

1189
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,280
dreaming you are in full internal state

1190
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,960
so time has no relevance when you're

1191
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,160
dreaming can you tell how long you've

1192
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:09,119
been dreaming there's no sense of time

1193
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,520
so this happens this is how your brain

1194
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,920
perceives time because there is a block

1195
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,559
that keeps track of how your attention

1196
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,079
is put out into the world. And whenever

1197
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,800
that attention goes away from the

1198
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,040
external world inside, you lose sense of

1199
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,480
time and then you come back again and

1200
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,359
you have to see a clock that

1201
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,359
oh and then you go back. With practice

1202
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,079
you can increase the duration of your

1203
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,280
focus on the external

1204
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,319
world. But you have to focus for it. You

1205
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,800
have to practice this. If you don't

1206
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:42,720
practice, people who are not attentive,

1207
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,400
this is what happens. They'll flow out,

1208
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,359
they'll be aware of time, they'll flow

1209
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,280
in, and they're not aware of

1210
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:51,440
time. So, the more daydreaming you do,

1211
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,280
the less aware of time you are. Does

1212
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,720
that make sense? Yeah. I'm I'm just

1213
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,280
trying to link it to how this whole

1214
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,280
section of our podcast can add value to

1215
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,400
a modern day human being. Sure. So I'll

1216
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,440
tell you one thing that people should do

1217
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,760
to make their time management better.

1218
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,319
First of all, understand that your

1219
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,640
attention flows in waves like a sine

1220
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,440
wave. Your attention will come and your

1221
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,319
attention will go. Expecting that you

1222
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,079
will have constant attention for 2

1223
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:26,640
hours, 3 hours is not

1224
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:28,720
possible. So first step is understand

1225
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,079
that attention is coming in waves.

1226
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,880
That's why you should focus in

1227
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:38,359
waves. The Pomodoro technique is a great

1228
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:40,880
method. So 20 minutes, set an alarm,

1229
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:43,960
sit, know that as soon as the alarm goes

1230
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,200
off, you will stop and then you will

1231
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,200
relax. So you are learning to sync your

1232
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,200
attention with the wave form that

1233
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,359
already

1234
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,240
exists. And so whenever you are in sync

1235
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,839
you can focus and then you come out and

1236
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,520
you can make more time this way.

1237
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,160
You can be more efficient with more

1238
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,400
efficient work. Correct. So you sync up.

1239
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,880
Okay. Let's go back to the main timeline

1240
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,240
of evolution. We actually reached the

1241
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,480
point where we were talking about hands

1242
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,079
and how the development of hands was

1243
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,440
very significant for the sake of the

1244
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,119
development of the brain. Yes. Because

1245
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,559
suddenly you could manipulate your

1246
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,440
environment much better. Yes.

1247
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,680
And this is the point in the timeline

1248
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,920
where we were apes. Yeah. Right. And

1249
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,800
then multiple different branches broke

1250
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,880
out. One became gorillas, one became

1251
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,119
orangutans, one became chimpanzees. What

1252
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,920
I'm actually trying to say is that at

1253
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,280
some

1254
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,280
point some of those

1255
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,319
chimpanzees evolved to the next stage.

1256
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:57,920
So there were many species. So there was

1257
00:55:52,319 --> 00:56:01,319
Homo Africanis then Homo erectus then uh

1258
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,520
Neanderthal chromagnon then Homo

1259
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:06,880
sapiens. All of these were different

1260
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,119
stages of evolution from ape to man. Why

1261
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,200
did that jump happen from chimpanzzeee

1262
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,720
to that something more than a

1263
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,119
chimpanzeee phase? There are multiple

1264
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,920
theories. Um so there's something called

1265
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,119
as a sephilization theory which is that

1266
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,160
some of the some of the species of um

1267
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:27,920
early early men who were living next to

1268
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,160
water bodies around the Nile. They were

1269
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,839
eating

1270
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,799
fish. And one of the theories is that

1271
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:37,280
fish contains more dexas hexoninoic

1272
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,799
acid. So, DHA which is a part of the

1273
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:46,200
omega-3 fatty acids and getting access

1274
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:48,799
to that food led to greater brain

1275
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:52,400
development. That is one theory that why

1276
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,480
did civilization develop around rivers

1277
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,599
and that area. Now, this is

1278
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,280
interesting. What is the biggest problem

1279
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,319
that current human beings are trying to

1280
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,599
solve? In my

1281
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:05,520
eyes, it's about making the world a

1282
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,760
kinder place.

1283
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,760
I think human empathy on a very core

1284
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,079
level because I think that's the root of

1285
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,720
many of the other problems.

1286
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:19,119
So at the brain level, how would

1287
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,200
evolution fix this? Maybe the most maybe

1288
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,920
the part of your brain responsible for

1289
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,680
empathy develops

1290
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,280
more. That's what being intuitive is in

1291
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,359
the first place. Being an empath,

1292
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,280
feeling other people's emotions. So what

1293
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,480
stops people from being empathetic? Ego.

1294
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,599
Yeah.

1295
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,920
Exactly that. The feeling that I am in

1296
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,079
danger, the feeling that who I am is

1297
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,079
going away, that if I'm empathetic

1298
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,799
towards this person that is harmful to

1299
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,440
me. Got to pause you. You remember the

1300
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:51,839
Hindi podcast we did about evolution.

1301
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,079
How do you become Shiva? We spoke about

1302
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:56,079
a part of your brain that's responsible

1303
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,160
for your sense of self and ego. Yeah.

1304
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,240
And how that switches off when you

1305
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,400
meditate. Yeah. So the

1306
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,640
part is called

1307
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,040
amygdala and it is primarily responsible

1308
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,119
for detecting

1309
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,480
threat around you. So anything that is a

1310
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:17,119
threat to who you are, the amydala will

1311
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,440
get activated. It's a very useful part.

1312
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,680
It's not a bad part. You need that

1313
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,040
because the amygdala decides what is

1314
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,240
important and what is not. What should

1315
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:29,440
you pay attention to and what is not.

1316
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,520
But that ego, that sense of I am in

1317
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,280
danger. I need to protect myself. This

1318
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,400
identity of mind is at risk. As long as

1319
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:41,440
we are holding on to that thought, it

1320
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,440
will prevent us from truly getting to

1321
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,200
the next stage of thought,

1322
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,079
right? You know, we spoke about the

1323
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,720
possibility that perhaps hands won't be

1324
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,280
that important in the future. kind of

1325
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,640
made me reflect upon all that's

1326
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,720
happening around us today. Um I think

1327
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,160
our guts are getting really affected

1328
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,640
because of

1329
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,720
uh the degraded quality of the food that

1330
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,480
we're putting into our bodies today.

1331
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Cheese is not what it used to be. Milk

1332
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,760
is not what it used to be. Wheat is not

1333
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,799
what it used to be, etc., etc.

1334
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,160
Secondly,

1335
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:23,480
um I do believe that labmade meats will

1336
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,880
become a

1337
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,720
reality maybe 100 years from now and at

1338
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,720
that point perhaps human beings are

1339
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,240
going to stop killing other beings for

1340
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,720
the sake of food. I think

1341
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,920
conjecture and the

1342
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,640
third thing that popped up in my head

1343
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,280
was love. And I realized that as we

1344
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,839
spoke about the evolutionary process, we

1345
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,400
didn't even mention love

1346
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:50,760
once. Because honestly, evolution is a

1347
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,319
lot more about sex than it is about

1348
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,000
love. Uh in saying that, of course,

1349
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:59,559
animals feel love between each other,

1350
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,160
especially parent and child

1351
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:06,799
love. But this romantic love

1352
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:10,119
situation, is it there in primates?

1353
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:12,880
So love as we experience it is an

1354
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,359
interpretation of everything that is

1355
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,920
leading up to that

1356
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:20,040
point. So let me explain what are the

1357
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,799
components of

1358
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:26,440
love. At the primal level is

1359
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:30,280
reproduction, sex,

1360
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:34,319
attraction that is there even in human

1361
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:36,079
love. If you go a little higher there is

1362
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,400
emotion.

1363
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,280
Wanting

1364
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:44,520
somebody, being afraid of losing them,

1365
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,240
jealousy also

1366
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:50,280
there, excitement is

1367
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:53,920
there, that is also part of the limbic

1368
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:57,480
system because love is at the limbic

1369
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,960
level a gamble. You find a perfect

1370
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,559
partner, you are gambling whether can we

1371
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,599
get them or not. What do you mean at the

1372
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:09,040
limbic level? at the emotional level.

1373
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,880
Okay, at the emotional level, you when

1374
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,960
you find somebody that you think is a

1375
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,920
good

1376
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,440
partner, think about this from an

1377
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,799
evolutionary sense, right? Like finding

1378
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,960
a good partner is a very valuable thing.

1379
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:25,040
And so there's a lot of adrenaline

1380
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:28,640
attached to it. So that is also there in

1381
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,160
the current human equation, even if it

1382
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,599
is in the dating scene. So suppose if

1383
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,240
you are texting somebody at 3:00 a.m.

1384
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,680
Why is there

1385
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:40,400
excitement? Because you are in that

1386
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,720
chase period. You're in that initial

1387
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,480
chase period. The adrenaline that comes

1388
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,359
with it, the dopamine that comes with it

1389
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,880
is part of a very old

1390
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:51,240
network. You are gambling. You are

1391
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,880
trying something. It's not a sure thing

1392
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:56,960
yet. Sure. Adrenaline come. Excitement

1393
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,599
come. So, if you've been in a

1394
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,520
relationship with somebody for 5 years,

1395
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,720
texting them at 3:00 a.m. doesn't give

1396
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,280
that same adrenaline spike because that

1397
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,720
uncertainty is not

1398
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,480
there. So, that is also part of the

1399
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,640
human uh experience of love. Bonding

1400
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,680
with somebody you love, whether you are

1401
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,920
now co-parenting a child, uh whether

1402
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,200
that love is towards a child, that bond

1403
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,680
which is part of the oxytocin network is

1404
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,880
also part of human love.

1405
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,760
And then you have the story that we

1406
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,000
create out of all of

1407
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,079
this. So when a human being says I'm in

1408
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,599
love, we are talking about the

1409
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:42,240
combination of all of this and we are

1410
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,720
clubbing it under one word. No wonder

1411
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,400
people are confused because we should be

1412
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,280
actually using seven different words for

1413
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,920
this. But we are combining all of this

1414
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,280
and calling it one emotion which is

1415
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,760
love.

1416
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,760
We are actually doing a disservice

1417
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,880
because the reason that people struggle

1418
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,839
is because I love

1419
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,680
you. But I love

1420
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:08,960
you. Which part of your brain said I

1421
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,799
love you? Did the reptilian part say I

1422
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,319
love you? Did the lyic system say I love

1423
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:15,359
you? Did the prefrontal cortex say I

1424
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:17,359
love you? I love you meaning. The lens

1425
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:20,640
I'm viewing this entire conversation

1426
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:23,119
through Yeah. is an evolutionary lens.

1427
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,960
Got it. And my conjectures that human

1428
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,200
beings are becoming better looking, more

1429
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,520
intelligent and more empathetic as time

1430
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,359
passes. Uh, and this is also based on

1431
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,559
the fact that you hear so many young

1432
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,760
parents say that, hey, you know, my

1433
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:40,400
children, they're way more advanced than

1434
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,599
we were when we were that age. And you

1435
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,359
actually see that I'm sure you have a

1436
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,799
nephew or a niece. I feel that with my

1437
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,599
nephew and niece. Yeah. Um, they just

1438
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:51,440
cut above what we were. What does that

1439
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,440
say about where the human species is

1440
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,799
going? See, obviously I understand this

1441
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,960
whole angle of they have Google, they

1442
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,240
have AI, you know, that whole generation

1443
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,640
beta thing that they're going to be the

1444
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,920
first generation born within a world

1445
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:06,160
governed by AI. So obviously those

1446
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,319
children are going to get some other

1447
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,480
fiery level of education and a fiery

1448
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,920
level of perhaps mental health issues

1449
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,880
because of an overactive brain within

1450
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,559
childhood. Like you know this whole

1451
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,640
narrative about how pre-teens are

1452
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,440
dealing with anxiety now. We didn't know

1453
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,920
the word anxiety when we were

1454
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:25,680
pre-teens. So, how far back will that

1455
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,920
anxiety start happening now to

1456
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,920
generation

1457
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,280
beta? They'll probably have to navigate

1458
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,599
through a lot of their own minds earlier

1459
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,599
in life. But I'm curious to see what Gen

1460
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,839
Alpha and beta are as people in their

1461
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,680
30s when you and me are like 50 60 years

1462
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,319
old. So, in a way, there's no way to

1463
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,760
answer that. But loosely speaking, we

1464
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,520
can kind of see the trajectory of where

1465
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,000
the human species is going. Yeah, we can

1466
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,839
speculate

1467
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,760
because one of the reasons for anxiety

1468
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:54,160
is that we are getting in more

1469
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:57,599
information than we know what to do with

1470
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:00,160
right. So that way I feel that our

1471
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,920
generation was at a disadvantage because

1472
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,319
when we were growing up when our brains

1473
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,640
were developing we didn't have access to

1474
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:09,280
that much information because I remember

1475
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:14,400
spending the first 13 to 15 years of my

1476
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:16,319
life reading child and it blighten and

1477
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,240
there is a certain rate of information

1478
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:21,520
transfer that can happen from books

1479
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:24,799
right and of course I would watch movies

1480
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,200
and all that but then the internet game

1481
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:30,559
and even when the internet started it

1482
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:34,880
was in this flood of information that

1483
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:37,839
happened when I was 25 to 30 and in the

1484
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,680
last 5 years the amount of information

1485
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:42,640
that I've received through scrolling on

1486
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,960
Instagram and you know on YouTube has

1487
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,760
been more than probably all the rest of

1488
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,240
my life put together. So I would say

1489
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,119
that my brain is not really wired to

1490
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,559
deal with such an information flood. Now

1491
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,280
it's an interesting question that what

1492
01:05:54,559 --> 01:06:00,079
if somebody born

1493
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:03,119
today will their brain at the age of 1 2

1494
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:06,599
3 because they've grown up with iPads

1495
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:09,920
because they've grown up with such a

1496
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:13,280
world would they be better off or worse

1497
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,559
off than us. So far what I have seen is

1498
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:20,000
that they would be worse

1499
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:22,799
off because the way that the internet is

1500
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,599
structured is that any kid growing up

1501
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:28,520
with an iPad as soon as the iPad is

1502
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:31,200
taken away I have seen the baby start

1503
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,280
crying. I have patients in my OPD. The

1504
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,559
parent will come in, but because there's

1505
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,720
nobody else at home, they'll bring the

1506
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,240
kid and the kid is nose deep into a

1507
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,039
mobile and the kid is

1508
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:44,799
two and it can barely hold the phone,

1509
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,039
but then it's just looking at YouTube

1510
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,880
videos and in the middle the mom would

1511
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,200
just take the phone away and the kid

1512
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,280
would start balling and crying. As soon

1513
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:57,680
as the phone is back, the kid is

1514
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:01,280
like I fear that this behavior pattern

1515
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,039
will lead to serious attention issues.

1516
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,799
And that is what we are seeing playing

1517
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,799
out. Also, the reason that ADHD and uh

1518
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:11,839
these sort of problems are increasing is

1519
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:14,000
because your brain is now not wired to

1520
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:16,079
pay attention to one thing that is not

1521
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,440
this level of stimulating. Because if

1522
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,920
this level of stimulus is the new

1523
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:24,319
normal, reality can never compete with

1524
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:26,240
it. So I feel that if I if I have to

1525
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:28,720
predict, I feel that there will be a

1526
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,480
correction which has already started. So

1527
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,319
in places like Australia, social media

1528
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,240
is now banned for people for kids under

1529
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,720
16. I think that is going to be the

1530
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,440
norm. We are going to have to protect

1531
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,599
children from overexposure to this level

1532
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,200
of stimulation from an early age because

1533
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,760
that developing brain needs to be

1534
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:49,839
protected. M I think there will be a

1535
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,520
correction on this and people will kind

1536
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,799
of be more into physical activity

1537
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:58,799
nature. Yes, they have to be similar to

1538
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:03,599
how uh kids were kids were given um uh

1539
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:05,839
cocaine and opium 100 years ago. Uh for

1540
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,319
even kids with some cough, they were

1541
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,440
given stuff like this because at that

1542
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,319
time heroin was given to kids because at

1543
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,000
that time they thought

1544
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,159
But then you very quickly realize how

1545
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,880
harmful it is and now it's unimaginable,

1546
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:22,480
right? But at one point it happened. So

1547
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,799
I think something similar will happen

1548
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,279
with social media where right now we're

1549
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:30,159
still figuring out and adults are

1550
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,920
realizing it's harmful and for kids I

1551
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:34,600
feel there will be a shift where kids

1552
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,279
will get protected.

1553
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,799
And the pertinent question now

1554
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:44,880
is what will the human species look like

1555
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,159
in a thousand years? H what I I think we

1556
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,920
were pretty much the same a thousand

1557
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:52,000
years ago. A thousand years ago. Yes.

1558
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,759
1,000 years is too less a time for

1559
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,400
things. Let's stretch it to 50,000

1560
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,159
years. Sure. Sure. So let's look at it

1561
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,799
logically. What are the parts of our

1562
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:03,759
body that we don't really use anymore

1563
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,880
that much? What do we not use? So we

1564
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,480
don't use hair. Wow. Really? Because

1565
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,480
hair was originally intended for

1566
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,080
temperature

1567
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:15,199
control. But currently hair does not

1568
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:17,159
have a lot of evolutionary advantage.

1569
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:19,880
And if

1570
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:23,239
tomorrow everybody goes

1571
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:25,839
bald functionally, will something

1572
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:27,679
change? Will you be will you not be able

1573
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:32,880
to do anything that you're currently

1574
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:36,799
doing? No. So hair would be one. Um

1575
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,440
there is an argument for toes.

1576
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,960
We don't really need them. We're not

1577
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,080
anyway. Most of us are now walking

1578
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,880
around with shoes. So whatever function

1579
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,679
of toes there would have been is also

1580
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,600
going away because shoes don't have toes

1581
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,839
and we are able to function pretty much

1582
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,320
all day. So why can't our feet look like

1583
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:59,600
toes? What are the functions of toes?

1584
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:02,080
Earlier they would provide grip, we were

1585
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,960
able to climb better, all of that. But

1586
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,640
now we don't need it. So just thinking

1587
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,040
logically these would be some of the

1588
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,760
things that go away. Um a lot of us are

1589
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:15,199
now

1590
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:17,040
sedentary and we are sedentary as in we

1591
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,199
are not moving around so much. Our

1592
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,800
metabolism is not wired for sedentary

1593
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,640
life. Our metabolism is wired to be

1594
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,040
walking a lot more. What if our

1595
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,239
metabolism changes?

1596
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:32,320
What if our metabolism figures out that

1597
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:34,480
hey we actually don't need this level of

1598
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,199
metabolism and activity? What if it

1599
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,960
slows down? We might have changes in the

1600
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,120
way diabetes happens and blood pressure

1601
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,000
happens because all those are a result

1602
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,640
of a previous system where we needed

1603
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,080
much more

1604
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:49,840
energy. What if you realize that a lot

1605
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,239
of the food that we eat is processed

1606
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,239
food. So our gut might change. The

1607
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:57,520
bacteria in the gut might change. We

1608
01:10:54,239 --> 01:11:00,000
might learn to eat and live with

1609
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,600
processed food better. But all this is

1610
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,480
over a 50,000 one one lakh years. I also

1611
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,159
think we've reached that point in

1612
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:11,280
the story of the earth not just the

1613
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:13,120
human story. But the story of the earth

1614
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,120
where science has suddenly started

1615
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:20,480
advancing way faster than it did until

1616
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:23,280
now. Oh yeah. So what Yuallo Mahari says

1617
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,440
is that uh obviously the next species

1618
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,320
will have machines incorporated into its

1619
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:31,360
own biology, right? Which is

1620
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:34,159
nanobots as well as neural link style uh

1621
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,679
brain chips. Yeah, I can see that

1622
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,400
happening. Absolutely. I think that's a

1623
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,040
very obvious. So evolution is now

1624
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,640
proving too

1625
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:45,199
slow because like we said natural

1626
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:48,480
evolution would take 50,0001 lakh years.

1627
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:50,320
But when have we ever waited that long

1628
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,360
for anything like we will make it

1629
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:55,280
happen? So this is where androids will

1630
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:58,320
come in. But because this is a brain

1631
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,000
centric episode. Yeah. Um whenever you

1632
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,760
speak about the prefrontal cortex, you

1633
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,640
say that this is the newest part of the

1634
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,400
brain. Yes. Uh my question to you is

1635
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,640
within the preffrontal cortex, what's

1636
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,560
the newest part? Brilliant. That that's

1637
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,560
a clue in terms of where the human brain

1638
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,400
is going. Yeah. So there are two parts

1639
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:18,440
that

1640
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:21,120
are developed the most recently.

1641
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,360
Uh again this is very very subtle

1642
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,440
because everything is new but there's

1643
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,040
one called fronttoolar which is

1644
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:31,199
responsible for planning

1645
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:35,880
ahead. So it's sort of projection

1646
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:38,159
visualization. No the best word would be

1647
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,520
prediction. How do I predict what will

1648
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,400
happen? Pattern recognition. pattern

1649
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,560
recognition over time. Pattern

1650
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,159
recognition not just in a static place.

1651
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,880
Pattern recognition is me saying this is

1652
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:52,480
a this is a

1653
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:55,960
cup but prediction is me saying where

1654
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,480
will this cup be tomorrow morning at

1655
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:01,360
10:00. For that I will need information

1656
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:03,920
as to what your house habits are. Where

1657
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,320
does the cook keep the cups? And so if

1658
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,640
I'm good at prediction, I can take a

1659
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,280
pattern from the past and project it

1660
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,760
into the future and say in 12 hours this

1661
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:17,480
cup will be there. The better I am at

1662
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,679
prediction, the better is my

1663
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,520
survival. This is where humans differ

1664
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,360
from

1665
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:26,360
animals, which over 50,000 years could

1666
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:29,960
possibly become a stronger sixth

1667
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:32,480
sense. Yes. So a stronger sixth

1668
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,239
sense could very well be the next stage

1669
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,199
of evolution. You can call it a sixth

1670
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:41,040
sense. This is simply better cognitive

1671
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:43,040
ability. We are it's not a sense. We are

1672
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:46,000
basically putting whatever we are

1673
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,600
sensing to better use. We're processing

1674
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,719
all the data around us much better.

1675
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:55,679
Exactly. Exactly how an AI neural net

1676
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:58,480
works. Correct. And so if you have the

1677
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,480
ability to incorporate AI into our

1678
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,920
prediction patterns, we would be able to

1679
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:07,040
make even better prediction. So imagine

1680
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,440
if you have an AI chip that is now able

1681
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,000
to process all of this and then if you

1682
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:14,000
ask me where will the cup be tomorrow

1683
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,239
morning at 10:00 a.m. It might be

1684
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,719
instinctive for me. Of course, it will

1685
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,960
be here. In fact, I might be able to

1686
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:24,080
tell you where will it be in one week

1687
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,640
based on previous patterns. So that

1688
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,800
calculation ability might seem like

1689
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,199
magic

1690
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:34,320
today but it is simply information

1691
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:36,960
processing. How better how well can I

1692
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,560
process information? Right? Um so this

1693
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,239
is one part you said there's another

1694
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:45,199
part. The other part is the part that is

1695
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:47,120
self-introspective. Animals couldn't do

1696
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:50,679
this but there is a part called as a

1697
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,960
ventromedial prefrontal cortex which is

1698
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:55,440
outside. The part outside is called

1699
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,800
dorsalateral prefrontal cortex. That is

1700
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,239
the part that is responsible for

1701
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,760
executive functioning. Executive

1702
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:02,560
functioning basically means logical

1703
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,040
thinking. How do I plan my action? So if

1704
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
I if you ask me to set up a chessboard,

1705
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,880
I will be able to plan. Or if you ask me

1706
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,640
to make chai, I'll be able to plan the

1707
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,520
sequence

1708
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,280
um you know keep the utensil, add water,

1709
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,280
what is the sequence of action, how do I

1710
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,679
plan it? That part is a dorsal

1711
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,679
prefrontal cortex. Logical thinking

1712
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,880
looking ahead.

1713
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,640
Inside that is a ventromedial prefrontal

1714
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,960
cortex that has the ability to think

1715
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,400
about

1716
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,880
emotions. It's new. Animals can't do

1717
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,440
that. We can do that. We are able to

1718
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,120
look at ourselves and say, "Huh, I'm

1719
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,560
feeling sad. I'm feeling

1720
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,040
angry." And I say we, but I would say

1721
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,880
that a lot of humans can't do it because

1722
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:51,280
this takes effort. So introspection,

1723
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:55,679
looking at yourself, understanding what

1724
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:57,920
is going on within you is a new skill

1725
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:00,640
and that is where spirituality comes in.

1726
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,199
Exactly. Here is where spirituality

1727
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:06,560
comes in. Because when one begins

1728
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,400
meditating regularly in life, it's

1729
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,679
discomforting. You're made to face your

1730
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,880
own truths. And that's why most people

1731
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,960
stop meditating or your brain's

1732
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,640
overactive. You can't like not even

1733
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,840
meditating. They won't even journal.

1734
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,840
They won't even think about their

1735
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,440
emotions. They don't even want to

1736
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,280
address the fact that they are feeling

1737
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,960
something. You're challenging the part

1738
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,679
of your brain that's at the brink of

1739
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,320
human evolution. Yes. That's not

1740
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,000
everyone's cup of tea. No. Today I

1741
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,400
believe that somebody who's capable of

1742
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,440
regulating themselves are at a better

1743
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,280
place than somebody who's not. Because

1744
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,760
somebody who can regulate themselves

1745
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,080
better, I believe would be able to deal

1746
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,320
with their own stresses better, which

1747
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,600
means they are at a lesser risk of

1748
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,080
mental health issues. What do you mean

1749
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,960
by regulate themselves?

1750
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,440
If I am

1751
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,760
upset, what do I do with it now? Okay,

1752
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,560
that is regulation. Viewing your own

1753
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,719
inherent emotions as external to

1754
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,080
whatever is viewing those emotions.

1755
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,920
Correct? So, so far in human history,

1756
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,679
the successful people have been the ones

1757
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,400
who could solve external problems

1758
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,120
better. So, Thomas Edison could invent a

1759
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,000
light bulb. He successful. Elon Musk

1760
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,520
could create whatever Tesla company or

1761
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,280
SpaceX

1762
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,040
successful. And that will continue. The

1763
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,280
world will still need human beings to

1764
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,120
solve external problems and all

1765
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,719
entrepreneurs will be rewarded.

1766
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:31,040
But just as important as external

1767
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,679
problems are internal problems. And so

1768
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,560
far the people who are good at solving

1769
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,199
internal

1770
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,719
problems was not given

1771
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:43,199
importance. But the rise of mental

1772
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,840
health issues highlights how important

1773
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:48,640
it is to be able to solve internal

1774
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,560
problems. And so in the future the

1775
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,360
successful people will be the ones who

1776
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,080
can do both solve internal as well as

1777
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,840
external problems. And you will get

1778
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,239
importance you will get validation if

1779
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:05,120
you are able to sort yourself out.

1780
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:07,719
Okay. Um, again I got to recap our Hindi

1781
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,000
episode from couple of years ago I

1782
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:12,640
think where we spoke about that part of

1783
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,719
the brain responsible for ego. Amydala.

1784
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,120
Amydala is part of it. Yes. What's the

1785
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:19,840
part of your brain that identifies the

1786
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:23,040
limits of your physical body like I know

1787
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,719
my finger is about a meter away from my

1788
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,120
eyes right now. Yeah. is a part of the

1789
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,719
brain that so this is called

1790
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:32,960
introsception which is awareness of your

1791
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:36,000
own body's personal space and this is a

1792
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,920
part of the parietital lobe um so the

1793
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,719
parietal lobe is responsible for

1794
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,080
recognition of space and one part of the

1795
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,239
parietital lobe is recognition of

1796
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,120
external space so I know how far you are

1797
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:49,040
from me but there is also a part of the

1798
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,440
parietal lobe that deals with internal

1799
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,880
space so I know that if I want to

1800
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:56,320
stretch my legs I know kit distance. I

1801
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,159
need this much room to stretch my

1802
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,920
correct. Um, the reason I'm bringing

1803
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:03,239
this up is because of the story of how

1804
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,120
Sguru

1805
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:09,520
supposedly hit a certain important point

1806
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,440
in his own spiritual evolution and it's

1807
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,480
not something that only he has spoken

1808
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,800
about. If you actually study uh the

1809
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,440
sages across Indian history, they all

1810
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,520
speak about this one point where the

1811
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,960
boundaries between their inner world and

1812
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,960
the external world seem to have

1813
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,120
diminished.

1814
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,800
Sure. In terms of Sguru said that I was

1815
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,159
sitting there, I was meditating under

1816
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,480
that tree on Chamundi Hill I think and

1817
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:36,560
he says that at one point something

1818
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,960
happened where everything around me and

1819
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:43,040
everything within me was the same.

1820
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:45,040
So this is um this is logical and this

1821
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,600
is a part of something called as ego

1822
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,719
dissolusion. Yes, this is what I'm

1823
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,920
talking about from a perspective of

1824
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:54,000
evolution. Yeah.

1825
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,480
So let me come back to the parietital lo

1826
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,880
thing because as you said the part of

1827
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:02,000
your brain your brain is aware of where

1828
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:05,600
your body ends right. This is called

1829
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,480
personal space. Your brain always needs

1830
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,199
to know where your personal space ends.

1831
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:15,040
Then you have perpersonal space which is

1832
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:16,800
the area which is right around my body.

1833
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,239
And then there is extra personal space

1834
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,840
which is beyond that. Why is this

1835
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:24,719
important? Because the closer somebody

1836
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,760
is, the more importance your brain will

1837
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,000
give that person in terms of both love

1838
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,360
and

1839
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,920
fear. So your brain has to judge

1840
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,719
distance. So if somebody's threatening

1841
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,480
you and they're a kilometer away, your

1842
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,960
brain is more relaxed. But they are

1843
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,480
right in your

1844
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,960
face, full alarm bells ringing, right?

1845
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,360
Like amydala is very active because it

1846
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,600
depends on the personal on the distance

1847
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,320
of

1848
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,000
space. Now very interestingly when does

1849
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:58,159
your personal space

1850
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,880
change? It can change when you are

1851
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,480
holding something that you identify as

1852
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,719
yourself.

1853
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,440
So a good example is somebody who has

1854
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:10,000
learned sword fighting for a long time

1855
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:13,360
will consider the sword as an extension

1856
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,719
of their arm. So in their brain they

1857
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,719
know exactly where the sword's tip ends

1858
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,400
because their brain has added this

1859
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,239
calculation that the sword is now part

1860
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,640
of my

1861
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:27,120
arm. And so when they will move they

1862
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,640
know where the sword is. or a batsman or

1863
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,600
a batsman or a tennis player they know

1864
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,960
exactly where the where their body ends

1865
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,199
and where the bat begins and where the

1866
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:40,400
bat ends. So it is part of their body.

1867
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:42,400
Now so I highlight this to tell you that

1868
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,320
the personal space definition is not

1869
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:49,120
fixed. It is

1870
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:52,120
fluid. A very interesting side angle to

1871
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:56,080
this is when you're in

1872
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:58,560
love, that other person is now a part of

1873
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,000
you. You're speaking from a scientific

1874
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:05,760
perspective. Yes. So when you love

1875
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,560
someone, deeply love someone, when you

1876
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:11,600
see that other person getting hurt, you

1877
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,000
will feel that hurt because your body

1878
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,960
inter your brain interprets their body

1879
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
as your own.

1880
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:24,159
And this is deep love. So a mother to a

1881
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,360
child for example, right? And when that

1882
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:29,800
child falls down, the mom will react as

1883
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,880
if she has gotten

1884
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:35,760
hurt because the your brain interprets

1885
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:38,719
it that way. And that can happen in

1886
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:42,480
romantic love as well. Especially when

1887
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:44,960
you are intimate, when you are canodling

1888
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,960
or whatever, cuddling or when you are in

1889
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,199
that same

1890
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:51,679
space, your brain can build a sense of

1891
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:55,360
intimacy that brings you to so close

1892
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:57,840
that you are one, which is a you can say

1893
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,120
that's almost a spiritual experience to

1894
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:03,400
feel your own personal space expand to

1895
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,800
involve a whole other

1896
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,239
person, which is why breakups can hurt,

1897
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,239
right? If you're very close to somebody

1898
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:12,000
and you've gone, your brain can almost

1899
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,840
feel like a part of your body is gone

1900
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,040
away. And part of recovering from a

1901
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,719
breakup is reidentifying your personal

1902
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,880
space.

1903
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:25,520
Now what

1904
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:28,400
Sguru claims to have experienced is ego

1905
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,520
disillusion which is ego is what holds

1906
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:37,040
your personal space in place. This is

1907
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:39,159
me. This is not me. self non-self this

1908
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,880
difference is

1909
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:45,040
ego suppose if my ego

1910
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:49,400
dissolves hypothetically suppose if my

1911
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:53,480
ego dissolves now where is the

1912
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:56,280
I and like I said love can dissolve that

1913
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,600
ego but love for one

1914
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,320
person what if

1915
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,960
hypothetically I build

1916
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:08,159
love for everyone

1917
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,800
Not genuine love for the world, for

1918
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:12,520
existence, for

1919
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,120
life and I am the

1920
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,400
world.

1921
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,880
Hypothetically, that would mean that my

1922
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,760
brain is now expanded enough that my

1923
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,199
personal space is now the

1924
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,719
world. From a neuroscience perspective,

1925
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,639
what would change in the structure of

1926
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,639
the brain?

1927
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,159
If you look, if you do an MRI, nothing.

1928
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,480
The brain would still look the same. We

1929
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:35,199
are talking of networks. the neural

1930
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,840
pathways would change. I don't really

1931
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:40,080
know what that would look like, but I'm

1932
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,920
talking theoretically this is possible.

1933
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,880
So, if you've lost your sense of self

1934
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,320
and you've if you've dissolved

1935
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,719
yourself, your sense of personal space

1936
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,239
could theoretically include the whole

1937
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,320
world.

1938
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,880
In your eyes, as a neuroscientist, is

1939
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,840
that a valid next stage of evolution or

1940
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,120
are we romanticizing

1941
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,199
spiritual talk here? I don't think we

1942
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:05,440
are romanticizing it but practically

1943
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:07,840
speaking I wouldn't expect this to

1944
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:11,600
happen for everybody and there is a

1945
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,320
reason for it um which is that ego plays

1946
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,960
a very useful

1947
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:18,560
role in our lives. So we tend to

1948
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,719
villainize ego a lot. We tend to say

1949
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,800
that no no we should not have ego but it

1950
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,440
is ego that makes you get up and go to

1951
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,120
work. M it's ego that makes you progress

1952
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,360
in your career. Progress in your career,

1953
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,120
protect your family. If you say that

1954
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,600
everybody is the same, it doesn't matter

1955
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:36,239
who lives or dies. Subka subluk, we are

1956
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,040
all living the same story at at that

1957
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:41,840
level. Uh it might be actively harmful

1958
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,840
for us. So I'm not convinced that this

1959
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:48,280
is the stage, this is the journey for

1960
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:51,920
everybody. But which is why in Indian

1961
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:53,920
scriptures it is written that um

1962
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,440
reaching that stage of ego dissolution

1963
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,360
too early in your life is also not a

1964
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:00,159
great idea because you still have to go

1965
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,520
through those four stages and um in the

1966
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:06,480
middle stage the ara karmama moa. So you

1967
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,800
have to go through um you have to go

1968
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:12,080
through materialism, you have to go

1969
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:14,520
through karma which is desire, then you

1970
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:17,040
have to go through detachment and then

1971
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,560
nirvana because that is the path and

1972
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,120
that's I feel that's a practical thing

1973
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,880
to do. Perhaps in this final chapter,

1974
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,520
I'd like to ask you a hypothetical

1975
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:30,840
question, which is that if I put someone

1976
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:33,679
in front of you who is supposedly

1977
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,880
actually evolved, who's gone beyond the

1978
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:39,679
point of nirvana mo as a neuroscientist,

1979
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:42,480
what would you ask him or her?

1980
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,199
The first question that I've always been

1981
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,199
curious about

1982
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:51,480
is why are

1983
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:54,600
you still talking to

1984
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:57,600
everybody? I I'm genuinely curious about

1985
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,600
it

1986
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:05,000
because if I am an enlightened

1987
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:09,440
person, I have no

1988
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,040
ego. There is no sadhhat.

1989
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,760
And I'm sitting on stage and I'm talking

1990
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,440
to

1991
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:19,520
people. Somebody insults me. Somebody

1992
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,520
makes fun of me. There is no

1993
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:27,239
me. Somebody asks me a

1994
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,239
question, but there is no me.

1995
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:35,760
Where does my motivation come from

1996
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:37,000
to answer or convince somebody or get

1997
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,000
into a

1998
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,840
debate with

1999
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,639
somebody

2000
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:46,960
because that person is also

2001
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:51,360
me, the audience is also me, the

2002
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:54,400
questioner is also me. So why am I here?

2003
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,560
Would you ask that person anything that

2004
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,199
would further your own research and

2005
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,239
understanding of the brain? So after

2006
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:04,480
they answer this

2007
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:07,560
question that will hopefully calm my

2008
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:11,920
deep cynicism

2009
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,920
um because I I I believe that a

2010
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,639
spiritual

2011
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:20,639
journey will eventually end with you

2012
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:23,040
coming to terms with everything. And I

2013
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,679
feel like that would also settle that

2014
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,080
core desire in you

2015
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:29,480
to tell people

2016
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,080
things cuz you will realize

2017
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,520
that

2018
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:38,840
journey. And I think that is a very rare

2019
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:41,440
person who will achieve

2020
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:43,120
nirvana and still come and talk to

2021
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,040
everybody.

2022
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:48,600
I think it is a very rare person who

2023
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:51,760
would truly achieve

2024
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:54,400
nirvana which is let go of their ego to

2025
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,800
that extent where nothing really

2026
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:59,320
matters, money doesn't matter, people

2027
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:04,040
don't matter

2028
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:06,440
uh and still be involved in running a

2029
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:10,400
business

2030
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:12,560
or creating a brand or trying to answer

2031
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,679
questions. I think that would be a very

2032
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:19,520
rare person and if so the world will be

2033
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:22,400
very lucky to have that. Um but if such

2034
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,920
a person does exist then and if they are

2035
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:26,239
willing then I would absolutely want to

2036
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,960
put them in a functional MRI and ask

2037
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:31,199
them to

2038
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:33,840
just talk about their experience. Just

2039
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:36,239
talk about how do you see life and just

2040
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,800
see how their amygdala is not getting

2041
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:42,639
activated at all. how they're how they

2042
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:44,800
are are they focusing outside or inside?

2043
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,120
Is there an outside or inside anymore?

2044
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,960
If there is no

2045
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:51,679
ego, then what are they what is their

2046
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:54,639
brain focusing on? Because this outside

2047
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:58,159
inside is a very ego perspective. What

2048
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,199
inside after that? I'm very curious. I

2049
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:02,159
would want to do that because people

2050
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:04,639
have done functional MRIs on um

2051
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:07,199
long-term meditators who go into a

2052
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,120
trance and we've understood a lot about

2053
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:12,159
how the brain works in deep trance like

2054
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,920
what um in terms of how your default

2055
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:17,320
mode network really shuts down. You

2056
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,159
don't um you are not caught up in

2057
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:22,080
self-introspection so much. You don't

2058
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:24,880
think about who am I, what am I doing

2059
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,800
and all that. And there is complete

2060
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,880
there's a very lowering of your amydala.

2061
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:33,480
there's no sense of threat. You go into

2062
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:36,440
a sort of almost like a sleep state but

2063
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,880
awake. Um where you are almost in

2064
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:41,360
harmony. So right now if you do an EG

2065
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,920
your brain waves are all jagged and

2066
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:46,400
that's normal. But in your deep sleep

2067
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:50,360
your brain waves are like a wave smooth

2068
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,800
wave. Imagine you can reach that at

2069
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:55,040
will. That's pretty incredible. I would

2070
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,840
want to do those experiments. But first,

2071
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,840
I have to get over this cynicism.

2072
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,040
I think we need to do a sequel episode

2073
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,760
to explore this more with the help of

2074
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,480
the comment section because it's been a

2075
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,960
very expansive episode. We've gone up to

2076
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:17,600
unisellular organisms did in order to

2077
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:21,880
understand where we are going in 3,25.

2078
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:25,199
I will say one thing which is

2079
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:29,560
consciousness the way I see it as of

2080
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:33,600
today is a loop. I'll just put this out

2081
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:36,920
there. Anything that loops upon itself

2082
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,280
becomes slightly more

2083
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,920
conscious. Anything that loops upon

2084
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:44,639
itself. Yeah.

2085
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:47,840
So the way that proteins are formed is

2086
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:52,000
amino acids will form a line and at some

2087
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:53,159
level that single strand of amino acid

2088
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,920
loops on

2089
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:59,960
itself and it forms a hairpin

2090
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:03,360
loop and that hairpin loop will loop on

2091
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:05,840
itself and that is how primary

2092
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,000
structures of proteins is formed and

2093
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,239
when that loops on itself it is called

2094
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,040
as a beta structure.

2095
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:15,760
or a beta

2096
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:17,960
helix. This is how complexity of looping

2097
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:21,080
increases and at some

2098
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:24,000
level consciousness comes out of

2099
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:25,600
it. Okay. Wow. I just wanted to put this

2100
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,199
out there. Whoever is listening,

2101
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,960
whatever sense they can make of it, let

2102
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:34,400
them make of it. I don't want to explain

2103
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:38,239
anymore. That looping never stops.

2104
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:41,960
That looping continues on and on and on.

2105
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:45,360
At every level of evolution, there is a

2106
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:49,040
looping and at some level we are doing

2107
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:50,600
the same thing. Introspection is the

2108
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:55,440
ultimate

2109
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,440
looping. It's 3 billion years of

2110
01:32:56,199 --> 01:33:01,199
evolution is an ultimate loop. Opening

2111
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,360
the third eye and turning it within.

2112
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:05,760
Yes, that's the way to look at it. So it

2113
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,159
is a loop. You look into a mirror, it's

2114
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,840
a loop. You write art, it's a loop.

2115
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:13,000
You're introspecting, you meditate, it's

2116
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,120
a loop. The more you

2117
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,520
loop, the higher the level of

2118
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:21,239
consciousness you go. So when you

2119
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:24,800
meditate about

2120
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:25,960
meditation, that's a loop. That is how

2121
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,960
consciousness

2122
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:31,600
evolves. And by definition, I don't

2123
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:35,600
think there's an upper limit.

2124
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,520
I think it can keep on looping. Can on a

2125
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,280
very basic level all these studies that

2126
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:44,159
back the the effects of meditation. Oh,

2127
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:46,960
you become calmer or your left brain and

2128
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:50,400
right brain coordinate much better. So

2129
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:53,360
very basic advantages of it. I don't

2130
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:56,159
think we know what advantages long-term

2131
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:58,880
long-term meditation can actually bring.

2132
01:33:56,159 --> 01:34:00,719
We know some things. We know that it uh

2133
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,480
calms your basic sympathetic system

2134
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,880
down. It calms your basic threat

2135
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:07,040
detection down and it leaves you in a

2136
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:10,120
position where you're able to deal with

2137
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:12,719
stresses better. I think practically

2138
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:14,400
speaking because all your practical

2139
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:18,080
problems you'll be able to deal with in

2140
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:20,960
a better way to meditate for dealing

2141
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:24,000
your life problems better very simply.

2142
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,320
Okay. Thank you. Lots of fun as usual.

2143
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,199
Thanks man. Uh, I think this episode's

2144
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,880
going to stir up a lot uh of the

2145
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:34,679
internet. So, let's wait for the comment

2146
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,679
section. Let's go. Okay.
