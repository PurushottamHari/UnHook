1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
I've had patients go from stage four

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,040
cancer to stage zero. So, I have now

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,720
seen where the end of cancer is coming

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,440
from. I've seen how the war is going to

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
finish. And here's how. Dr. William Lee

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,400
is a Harvard trained physician and

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
medical scientist whose work is

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,640
revolutionizing the way we understand

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,960
and fight some of the most devastating

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,039
diseases facing our world today. I'm

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
going to give you a brand new view of

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
thinking about cancer. And this is

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,599
shocking to some people to hear, but

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,599
every 24 hours there are 10,000 mistakes

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
that are made in your body. Each of

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
those is a microscopic cancer. But the

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
reason that we don't become more sick

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
from all kinds of diseases, including

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
cancer, is because our body is hardwired

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
with its own health defense systems. But

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,360
here's the problem. We are presently

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
seeing the fallout of some of the not so

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
good moves that we made in the 1950s

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
and60s and 70s. For example, people

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
might consume as much as a credit card's

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
worth of plastic every single week,

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,559
which is very worrying, and I won't tell

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,160
you why, but there's also the foods you

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
eat, which contribute to taking your

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
health defenses down. But the good news

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,199
is that you can actually put shields up

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
as well. So, this is our experiment, and

33
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,400
we're trying to discover drugs that

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
could be developed as cancer treatments.

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
So, we said, let's remove half of them,

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,760
and let's swap them out with food. You

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,880
know, I I was a skeptic, but when I saw

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,479
these results, it made my jaw drop

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,920
because the holy grail in the

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,960
pharmaceutical industry is to find

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,479
something that can kill cancer stem

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
cells. And we don't have a drug that can

43
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,680
do that. Turns out, mother nature beat

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,600
us to the punch. And there's more than

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,920
200 foods that I've studied that can

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
actually starve cancers. And if you had

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
to pick five based on the science you've

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
seen, what would those top five be? The

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,799
good news is that it's food that we can

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,320
eat every single day. So, number one,

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,040
this has always blown my mind a little

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,119
bit. 53% of you that listen to this show

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,240
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
before we start? If you like the show

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,200
and you like what we do here and you

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
want to support us, the free simple way

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,479
that you can do just that is by hitting

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
the subscribe button. And my commitment

60
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,000
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
everything in my power, me and my team,

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
to make sure that this show is better

63
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,119
for you every single week. We'll listen

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
to your feedback. We'll find the guest

65
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,509
that you want me to speak to and we'll

66
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,560
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

67
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:16,080
[Music]

68
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,840
much. Dr. William Lee, if someone has

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
just clicked on this conversation and

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,440
they're asking themselves, they're

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
wondering what they're going to get out

72
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,400
of spending this time with us for the

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,440
next couple of hours, what would you say

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,560
directly to them that they will learn,

75
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,319
gain, and how will their life improve?

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,920
I would say that you're going to hear

77
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,319
about food in a brand new way that you

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,800
didn't realize that a decision that you

79
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,800
can make after this listening to this or

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
watching this that you could put into

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
action to your life immediately could

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
actually help you for the rest of your

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,440
life. It could stave off disease, help

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,160
you feel stronger, even help you with

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
longevity. Uh so there's no single moves

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,400
that you can make but it's the beginning

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,040
of taking steps that can actually allow

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
you to live the rest of a long enjoyable

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,280
life. And what are the the key diseases

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,680
that people are and should be most

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,000
concerned about today based on their

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,480
correlation to the food that we eat?

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,720
Yeah, if you look at the biggest health

94
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,640
crises in the world today in developed

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
countries, um you know, you're really

96
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,800
talking about cardiovascular disease

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
being the number one killer, diabetes,

98
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
and all the consequences, the

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,000
devastating consequences that come out.

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,799
Listen, your blood sugar is not being

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,480
very well regulated. That's the

102
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,280
definition over time of diabetes. But

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,239
the knock-on effect of having high

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,640
uncontrolled sugars is really underlying

105
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,159
metabolic chaos. There's a whole litany

106
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,400
of terrible conditions that happens

107
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,720
every downstream from that from eye

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,920
disease to wounds that don't heal etc

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,400
etc. Cancer is another one. Dementia is

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
a big bigger and bigger problem as our

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
population ages. And a lot of people

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,799
don't re recognize this, but you know

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
the the saying that inflammation is a

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,319
root cause of chronic disease.

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,720
Scientifically correct, but there are

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
many many inflammatory diseases that are

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
out there that don't get enough airplay

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
that really take away the quality of

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,479
your life as you get older. And so I

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,479
think all of these things, it's not just

121
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,919
about mortality, it's about morbidity.

122
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
It's not just about living long, it's

123
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,320
about living well and feeling good along

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
the way. And where do you think we are

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,080
as a society you especially as

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
westerners as it relates to our

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
relationship with health and food?

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,680
Because when I look at some of the stats

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,720
around life

130
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,440
expectancy, there's been a bit been a

131
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,960
bit of a stagnation in I think it was

132
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,720
2020ish time. But then also when you

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
look at a lot of these chronic diseases,

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
whether it's diabetes, whether it's

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,440
cancer, these things seem to be on the

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
rise. So, as a nation, it feels like

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
we've got more information than ever

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
before, but when you look at the

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
objective numbers, for some reason,

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
we're not going in the right direction.

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,800
What's your your 30,000 foot view on it?

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,600
30,000 foot, there's more and more

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,000
people in the world. So, once you get

144
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,080
huge numbers, uh, the diseases that

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
affect most people are going to magnify.

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
So, just as a a matter of math, we're

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,960
going to see more of these chronic

148
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
diseases. Um, but we're also going to be

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
seeing two things that are happening

150
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,360
that uh actually oppose each other. One

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,560
thing is that the lifestyle and dietary

152
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,520
harms that have occurred

153
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,440
over 20, 30, 50 years from the

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,600
industrialization of food, from the

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,919
industrialization of health care, from

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,160
degradation of the environment. Those

157
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,960
are all things that take time to

158
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,560
manifest. And so to some extent we are

159
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,280
presently seeing that the fallout of

160
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,320
some of the not so good moves that we

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,160
made in the 1950s and60s and 70s and so

162
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,560
on and so forth. So decades later we're

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
beginning to see the consequences

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,120
devastation of things that happened

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,479
decades ago. That's one side of

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,560
elevating increasing the incidence and

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,880
prevalence of of health conditions bad

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,199
health conditions. There's another side

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
that is counterveailing and the other

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,319
side which is the side I that's the team

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
I play on is it really exciting because

172
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
one thing that's different is that we

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,080
have now have tremendous scientific

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,120
power to get in there and probe diseases

175
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
and also indeed pro probe health which

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
is something we're not doing often

177
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,080
enough and in so doing we're actually

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,479
able to find solutions to the problems

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,120
that that counter some of those harms.

180
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,759
So, we're beginning to discover now how

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
do we actually prevent diabetes? How do

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,919
we prevent cardiovascular disease? Can

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,120
we reverse heart disease? And even

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,080
conditions that seemed like no-win

185
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,280
situations. And I like to talk about

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,639
this is that in my career, I never

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,440
thought as a physician I would actually

188
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,520
see the cure to cancer, the end of

189
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,919
cancer. But actually, I tell you, I have

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,599
now seen where the end of cancer is

191
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
coming from. I've seen how the war is

192
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
going to finish because I've had well

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,000
over a dozen patients and there are

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
hundreds of people like this that are

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,479
starting to form that can go from stage

196
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,759
four cancer that's game over cancer to

197
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,599
stage zero. We can do this. And it not

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,319
for everybody yet, but we're beginning

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,919
to see where the light at the end of the

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,479
tunnel is. And it involves your immune

201
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,800
system. And some of the remarkable

202
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,520
scientific breakthroughs are teaching us

203
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560
that our body heals itself against

204
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,360
diseases as serious as cancer in ways

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,080
that the pharmaceutical industry can't

206
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
by itself do, but it really relies on

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,599
the body. So when you talk about food as

208
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,759
medicine or medicine as medicine, none

209
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,639
of them are as powerful as what the body

210
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
is hardwired to do by itself. When I

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
think about something like cancer, it's

212
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,680
slightly terrifying because it feels

213
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
like a game of roulette. It feels like

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,199
the the people that get cancer, it's

215
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,280
completely random and that our outcomes

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
are also a game of roulette. And this is

217
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
someone that knows very little about

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
cancer. I hear someone that I thought

219
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,440
was very very healthy get cancer and

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,240
then their outcomes whether they they

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,840
beat it or not also seem to be largely

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,840
down to chance sometimes. That's how it

223
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,680
seems. What do you think of that view?

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Yeah, I'm going to give you a brand new

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,560
view of thinking about cancer and that

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,719
is that we are all forming cancer in our

227
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
bodies all the time from the time we

228
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
were kids. you don't have clinical

229
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
cancer, you haven't gone to the doctor

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
to get a diagnosis, still start forming

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,959
cancers. And let me tell you why.

232
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,959
Cancers are like pimples in our body.

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,080
All right? And this is shocking to some

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,360
people to hear, but our the human body

235
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,480
is made up of about 40 trillion cells.

236
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,200
That's more cells in our body than stars

237
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,040
in a clear sky. All right? And these

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,240
cells have to divide uh to be able to

239
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,720
reproduce themselves. uh copy and paste.

240
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,279
Every cell has its own genetic material

241
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
called DNA. It's our instructions for

242
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,200
how our cells are work. So, you got to

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,680
copy and paste uh your DNA. All right?

244
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Now, copy and pasting is a tricky thing

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,480
to do really well. So, if I gave you a

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,279
sentence to write, Stephen, and I said,

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,440
"Copy it 10 times on a word document,

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,160
you'll do it perfectly." If I get told

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
you to copy it a thousand times, you're

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,440
going to make a few mistakes. Good thing

251
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,240
that we have spellch check to fix it, to

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,720
catch it and fix it. But if I ask you to

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,839
copy a single sentence 40 trillion

254
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,080
times, you're going to make so many

255
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
mistakes that your spell check isn't

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
even going to be a to catch all of it.

257
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,440
Okay? And that's what's happening in our

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
body every single day as we are

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
replicating ourselves. We're going to

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
make mistakes. And whenever there's a

261
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,399
mistake that's being made that isn't

262
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,399
caught and fixed, that's a mutation. And

263
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
so we have mutations that are forming in

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,519
our body just as a matter just as an

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
outcome of being alive and doing our

266
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
thing and we're not sick from those

267
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,600
mutations. But every mutation is the

268
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,800
beginning of a microscopic cancer. Take

269
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,680
a guess of how many mistakes in DNA of

270
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,760
copying and pasting your own body uh are

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,959
made every 24 hours. Take a guess. This

272
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,160
has been calculated randomly. Well, you

273
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,360
there's so many cells in my body.

274
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
It's going to be a big number. A

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,560
million. Okay. Every day, every 24

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,959
hours, there are 10,000 mistakes that

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,200
are made in your body that your body

278
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,920
doesn't catch that keep on that

279
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,440
propagate in the document of our body as

280
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,920
it goes on. 10 10,000. Each of those is

281
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,519
a microscopic cancer. A microscopic

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
cancer is just that. It's microscopic.

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
It's too small to be seen with the naked

284
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,240
eye, but it's abnormal. And that thing

285
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,640
could turn turn into a big tumor that

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
could eventually kill you. So why don't

287
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,399
we die from cancer all the time? Now

288
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
this is actually something that I see as

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,279
a physician. I have a patient diagnosed

290
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,680
with cancer. They always ask me, "Dr.

291
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,600
Lee, why me? Why did I get breast

292
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,959
cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer,

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,519
brain tumor?" A very very uh natural

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,440
question. And I do my best to try to

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,640
provide an empathic answer to that

296
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,880
question. But as a researcher, I have a

297
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
more interesting question. Given the

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
number of mutations that occur in our

299
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,640
body every single day, why don't we get

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
cancer more often? Why don't we all get

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,760
cancer as kids? You know, cancer can

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,079
happen in children, but not as often as

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,839
we have mutations. And it turns out this

304
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,640
was the great unlock for me in terms of

305
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,600
health. The reason that we don't become

306
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,040
more sick from all kinds of diseases,

307
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,040
including cancer, is because our body is

308
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,040
hardwired with its own health defense

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,000
systems. So that we've got these

310
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,639
swashbuckling defenses that are firing

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
on all cylinders. All day long from the

312
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
from the moment we're born until our

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
very last breath, these systems that are

314
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,680
inside our body defend our health,

315
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,720
including the microscopic cancers, spots

316
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,720
them, takes them out. kind of like a

317
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
police cruiser patrolling a quiet

318
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,200
neighborhood sees a drug dealer on the

319
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,200
corner, pops them in the back of the

320
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
police vehicle and takes them away

321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
cleaning up the neighborhood. That's how

322
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
our body naturally cleans up these

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,440
microscopic cancers. And so when you

324
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,320
talk about cancer as a scary disease,

325
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,360
you're thinking about the person whose

326
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,519
body has failed to detect and eliminate

327
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
the microscopic cancers and it's become

328
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
large enough to actually become a

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
threat. Now here's a question for you.

330
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,200
So we tell women to actually do a self

331
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
breast exam when they're taking a

332
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
shower. You know, look for lumps or

333
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
bumps and you know if you find one, you

334
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
know, certainly go to your doctor

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,600
immediately for an exam.

336
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,519
The smallest cancer that you could feel

337
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
with a trained person can feel with

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,639
their with their hands in the breast is

339
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:16,000
one centimeter in diameter. A 1 cm

340
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,720
breast cancer already has 1 billion

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,399
cancer cells that have already

342
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,160
multiplied. That microscopic cancer

343
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,519
multiplied a billion times. That's the

344
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,600
smallest one you can feel. Now immune

345
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,760
systems not taking that amount. All

346
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
right? So, you need a better immune

347
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,480
system if you I want a shot at this and

348
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,639
not just chemo or hormonal therapy. And

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
that's where some of these incredible

350
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,120
advances are taking place. But there's

351
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,360
another one. In order to feed a billion

352
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
cancer cells, you need blood vessels to

353
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,800
feed them. So, the cancers as they get

354
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,279
bigger, they hijack our own circulation

355
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,040
to feed themselves. Okay? It's kind of

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,880
like terrorists kicking in the cockpit

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
door to take over the controls of the

358
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
plane. They want to actually get your

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
blood vessels to feed themselves. Now

360
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,120
normally the body knows how to control

361
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,440
those blood vessels. It's called

362
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,040
angioenesis. Angio blood vessels genesis

363
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
how the body grows and controls them.

364
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,000
That's my area of research. So naturally

365
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
our body knows how to prevent blood

366
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
vessels from feeding cancers and yet

367
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,720
knows how to uh direct blood vessels to

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,560
feed healthy tissues. So guess what? A

369
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,839
one centimeter tumor with 1 billion

370
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,199
cancer cells is fed by 100 million blood

371
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,360
vessels courarssing into the tumor to

372
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,519
feed them. And we've studied this in the

373
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,839
laboratory. The moment that a single

374
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,760
blood vessel touches a tumor, tiny

375
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,399
microscopic tumor, it will grow 16,000

376
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,040
times in size in just two weeks. Wow.

377
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,959
All right. So, I've told you some scary

378
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,480
statistics, but now let me kind of give

379
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,240
you the where the breakthroughs are

380
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
coming through. Right. So with this kind

381
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,199
of knowledge, what do we what can we do

382
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,079
with cancers? Not just breast cancers,

383
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,360
but in general. Number one, we know that

384
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,480
if you boost your immune system with

385
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
foods, with exercise, diet, lifestyle,

386
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
you're going to actually make your

387
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,720
immune defense is a lot stronger to

388
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,440
patrol your body to wipe out those

389
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,760
microscopic cancers. That's why healthy

390
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,600
diet lifestyle lowers the risk of

391
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
cancer. That's why eating the right

392
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
foods that boost your immunity can

393
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,480
substantially lower your risk of cancer

394
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,120
as well. We also know that you can eat

395
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,600
foods that support, prompt up, fortify

396
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,079
your body's natural ability to control

397
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,160
blood vessels. Keep those blood vessels

398
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,760
where they're supposed to be and get rid

399
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,079
of those blood vessels where you don't

400
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,560
want them to be, which is kicking in the

401
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,120
cockpit to take over your circulation to

402
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,639
feed cancers. So, if you eat foods like

403
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,519
that are anti-androgenic foods that like

404
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,320
are unstable, you've got um coffee and

405
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,079
tea, both of those contain natural

406
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,399
substances that cut off the blood supply

407
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,959
and starve cancers. That's a good thing.

408
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,519
So, that's why we know our what we do

409
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,759
with our diet can actually help to lower

410
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,160
the risk of cancer as well. I'm assuming

411
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,199
the opposite also applies. I I could eat

412
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,399
foods, I can drink things that cause my

413
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,880
body to malfunction. I makes the blood

414
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
vessels unregulated makes and starts to

415
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
feed the cancer, right? Yeah,

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
absolutely. So, let's talk let's talk a

417
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
little bit about that. So, so I told you

418
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
the body's hardwired with these

419
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,880
defenses. Shields up, right? That's what

420
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,399
we want to do because shields are

421
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
already normally up. You want to raise

422
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,800
them higher, but what about and this is

423
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
a brilliant question you're asking a

424
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
very probing question. What are the

425
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
things that take your shields down,

426
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,680
right? What are the things that turn off

427
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,839
the smoke alarm in your house that

428
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,399
unlock the doors? Can I take a guess?

429
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,480
Is it

430
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:48,160
this? Okay, now I know the answer that

431
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,279
you're setting this conversation up for,

432
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,639
which is a burger with meat. Uh, is that

433
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,000
actually uh disease-causing? And I would

434
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,560
I would tell you that yes and no. A

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,040
burger is something that many people

436
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,319
enjoy eating. And I would say eating

437
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,439
meat, eating burgers, even eating

438
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,839
ultrarocessed foods once in a while is

439
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,919
not going to harm you if your health

440
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:20,400
defenses are naturally strong. But if

441
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,679
you make it a habit, a regular habit of

442
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,360
eating this at the expense of eating

443
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,480
healthier foods, more plant-based foods,

444
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,760
less processed foods. Okay. Um, you are

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,360
actually going to tip the uh your odds

446
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,880
where the diseases are more likely to

447
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,360
get you. What that what that means is

448
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,760
that over eating fast foods like burgers

449
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,320
will actually contribute to taking your

450
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
uh health defenses down, shields down.

451
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
So what are those things then that bring

452
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,200
the shield down? You were saying okay

453
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
excess sodium, too much salt, which can

454
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,360
be present in a lot of restaurant foods.

455
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
People eat out a lot, go to restaurants

456
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,880
all the time. You ever you ever go to

457
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,640
the back of a kitchen of a restaurant to

458
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,280
see how they're salting seasoning their

459
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,120
food? Patrons love salty food. It makes

460
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,320
food taste really great. There's a, you

461
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,760
know, our brains uh respond very well to

462
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,840
salty food. That high sodium levels

463
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,919
actually speeds up, accelerates our

464
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,679
cellular aging, so we actually age

465
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
faster. But it also um is a huge wear

466
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,679
and tear on our health defenses,

467
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,919
specifically our circulation, our our

468
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,960
blood vessels, our androgenesis system

469
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,799
is taken down by excess salt. Okay, I've

470
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
got a question here. Obviously there's a

471
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,120
a big movement at the moment around

472
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,360
hydration and electrolytes and these

473
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,200
electrolytes have magnesium, potassium,

474
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
they have sodium in them. Yeah. So a lot

475
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,760
of people are now taking electrolytes to

476
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,640
hydrate themselves.

477
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Is there a a risk here? So the great

478
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,919
news is that the healthy body has got

479
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,080
its own titration system for

480
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,320
electrolytes. If you drink a electrolyte

481
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,919
fortified beverage, you're your body's

482
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,840
going to take everything it needs and

483
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
it's going to pee out the rest. You're

484
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,400
going to eliminate through your urine.

485
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,960
All right. However, sodium

486
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
uh is one of those electrolytes is

487
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,919
present like you're not drinking

488
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
electrolyte fluid all day long, but

489
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
sodium you're eating it in almost every

490
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,880
food that you actually have except

491
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,960
perhaps dessert, but maybe even then.

492
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,799
And so this is one of the things that we

493
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,640
realize is sodium is a high risk for

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,400
hypertension, high blood pressure,

495
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
inflammation of the lining of your

496
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
circulation and that that sets up for a

497
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
lot of badness downstream when it comes

498
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
to your health and it takes down your

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,480
circulation um health defenses that we

500
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,400
talked about. High blood sugar can also

501
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,720
do the same thing. So if you're eating

502
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
an excess of added sugar, we all have

503
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,120
heard by now glucose spikes and glucose

504
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
crashes. I don't actually use those

505
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,960
words by the way. I don't like to

506
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,360
actually cast our body's metabolism in

507
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,039
terms of spikes and crashes. I think

508
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,919
those are fear words. They get

509
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,880
attention. Uh they they do make you pay

510
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,520
attention to it, but in fact really our

511
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
the healthy body sort of has, you know,

512
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,080
smooth ups and smooth downs. They're

513
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,400
gentle slopes up and down of our blood

514
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,400
sugar. And that's completely fine. All

515
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,280
right? And and it should be like that.

516
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,440
However, if you have an uphill climb of

517
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,919
your blood glucose and it continues to

518
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,400
stay up, that can actually happen if

519
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,440
you're eating too much added sugar.

520
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,080
Okay, added sugar, ultrarocessed foods.

521
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,200
What happens is that your blood sugars,

522
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,240
your intake of the sugar, glucose rises

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,080
up up up and now your body has your

524
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
metabolism to chase that blood sugar

525
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,320
down and it's got to work harder and

526
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
make more insulin. And eventually you

527
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
just wear out that system and then you

528
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,159
have a high blood blood glucose and an

529
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,760
insensitive metabolism and that's the

530
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,159
beginning of sort of the the dominoes

531
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,799
starting to fall apart in your body. And

532
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,640
so sugar, high blood sugar, added sugar

533
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,720
is a problem. You get it from fruit, not

534
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,039
a problem. Okay? No one's going to be

535
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
eating a crazy amount of fruit. This is

536
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,200
why extremes aren't good. Diversity.

537
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,760
Switch it out. Keep it interesting for

538
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,000
yourself. This is what our human nature

539
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,080
uh wants anyway. Uh it's how we're

540
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
hardwired. You you'll actually be fine.

541
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,080
So salt, sugar, those are two offenders.

542
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
Okay. Um alcohol is another one that

543
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,440
actually can take down your health

544
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
defenses over time. You know, people

545
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,360
say, "Well, what about red wine? Isn't

546
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,960
red wine healthy?" What I would say is

547
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,280
that actually the fermented products the

548
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,600
or the bioactives that come out of red

549
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,080
grapes from the skin of red grapes

550
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,000
that's found in red

551
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,760
wine, those there can be some healthful

552
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
properties of the resveratrol and other

553
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,760
polyphenols that come out of uh that are

554
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,280
in wine, but it's never the alcohol.

555
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,520
It's not the alcohol in the beer, the

556
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,520
wine, the whiskey. Nope. None, none of

557
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,600
that is the alcohol is is a universal

558
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,760
toxin. Toxic to your brain, toxic to

559
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,200
your liver, toxic to your heart. Can't

560
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,919
get away from that. Your body will

561
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
recover. Shields up little. It can take

562
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,000
a ding. It's like a, you know, like a

563
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,640
drink is sort of like a driving behind a

564
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,320
truck and it flings a little pebble

565
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
right into your windshield. You might

566
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,039
get a little spider in the windshield.

567
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay, don't worry. It'll repair itself.

568
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
You You'll fix yourself. You'll bounce

569
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
back. It's not going to break your

570
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
windshield. But if you keep on drinking,

571
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
you're actually gonna smash your

572
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,080
windshield. And that's why alcoholism is

573
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
so devastating to the health. But you

574
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,360
know, regular a small amount of alcohol.

575
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,559
So alcohol itself is is a toxin. Do you

576
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,919
drink? Uh I I rarely drink and when I

577
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,320
drink it's in moderation. Mhm. And I was

578
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,720
thinking about stress as well. Does that

579
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,480
bring down the So besides the foods you

580
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,799
eat, other things that can compromise

581
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,159
your health defenses? Uh, and by the

582
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,360
way, there are five health defenses. We

583
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
talked about blood vessels. We talked

584
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,400
about immunity, but there's three other

585
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,600
ones uh that are core to functioning in

586
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
the healthiest way possible. If you

587
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
want, if you want longevity, you need

588
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,679
all five of your health defenses and

589
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,080
more to be working in your favor. But

590
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,559
stress, what does stress do? Lowers your

591
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,200
immune system. Shields down. All right?

592
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,120
Those microscopic cancers. Whoa. That's

593
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,760
why stressful people are more vulnerable

594
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,400
to de developing diseases like cancer.

595
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,240
All right? Stress also causes your blood

596
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
pressure to go up and causes uh

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
neurotransmitters, hormones to be

598
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
released from your brain and your

599
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,640
kidneys, your adrenal glands that ought

600
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,760
to wear down your circulation. Now your

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,919
androgenesis system is also uh not

602
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,760
functioning uh as well to protect

603
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
yourself and keep good blood flow going

604
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
where it needs to go. Now your

605
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,520
circulation is actually down. Um so

606
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,520
again, stress also can actually damage

607
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,440
the DNA. We talked about naturally

608
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,679
copying and pasting and having errors.

609
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
add some stress to it. Now, it's kind of

610
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,200
like um you're trying to copy that

611
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,559
sentence I was telling you perfectly.

612
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
Now, I'm going to come in and just smash

613
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,280
your fingers down every now and then,

614
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,679
and let's see if you actually make a

615
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,000
mistake. You will. All right? Stress

616
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,080
will actually do that. It's devastating

617
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
to have so much stress continuously.

618
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,840
Listen, by the way, I want to be really

619
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,320
clear to anybody listening or watching

620
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,799
this, a little stress is actually good

621
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,559
for you. You know, like just being

622
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,320
coddled all day long and living in a

623
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
happy bubble. That doesn't that's not

624
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,720
that's not good for our health either.

625
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,120
We kind of get laxidasical. We let our

626
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,520
guard down. Little stress. I mean,

627
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,080
anybody who's hardworking, you know,

628
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,000
successful knows that, you know, it's

629
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,240
not the no pain, no gain. It's that the

630
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,320
that the grit that goes along with it,

631
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,480
which gives a little stress keeps us

632
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,960
sharp, you know, uh which is a which is

633
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,720
a good thing. You want to be on you want

634
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,840
to be on. So, a little stress is good,

635
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,919
but when that stress is unabated, it

636
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,000
literally sinks your health defenses. It

637
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,600
is just taking those shields down. Yeah,

638
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,960
I've noticed that with myself. I've

639
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,559
spent the last 10 years running

640
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,640
businesses, a little bit more than 10

641
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,200
years now, but probably the last 13

642
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,679
years running businesses. And the only

643
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
times when I really get sick, where I'm

644
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,080
like out for a week and I really, really

645
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,120
feel it

646
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,279
is one week

647
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,799
after two weeks of stress.

648
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,480
So when I say two weeks of stress, what

649
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,520
I mean there is when something happens

650
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,840
in my life business where that it's kind

651
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,520
of chronic and it's enduring stress. I

652
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,720
can deal with having a stressful day. I

653
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,039
can deal with having two stressful days

654
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
in a row. But when I've had like two

655
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,440
weeks of an enduring issue, like an

656
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,679
enduring angst or a

657
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,520
problem, almost perfectly predictably, a

658
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,799
week later, I'm sick. And I'm extremely

659
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,559
rarely sick because I think I sleep

660
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,720
really well. Like I think I eat really

661
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,559
clean. And so it's taught me something

662
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,520
about if I zoom out on that and see

663
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
what's going on in my body, well

664
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,760
eventually like my body's kind of my

665
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,919
immune system is running out of energy

666
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,159
almost more than your immune system. So

667
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,600
when you're super stressed, it also

668
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,320
interferes with your ability to sleep

669
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,400
well. Yeah. When you're sleeping well,

670
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,720
you know, sleeping is something that I

671
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,159
was taught when I was a kid. When you're

672
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
sleeping, you're resting. And when

673
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,120
you're resting, you're not active,

674
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
right? Well, that's just our physical

675
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,640
self. It turns out when we're sleeping,

676
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,880
even though our muscles may not be

677
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
moving like we are during the day, in

678
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,919
fact, a lot of other systems including

679
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,720
our health defenses are being repaired,

680
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,679
renewed, regenerated, rebooted while we

681
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,320
are sleeping. So in those ideally eight

682
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,720
hours, 7 to n hours, eight's the sweet,

683
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,880
sweet number, you know, our brain is

684
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
cleansing itself, detoxifying itself,

685
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,240
releasing. Do you know about the

686
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
lymphatic system in the brain? Not as

687
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,000
well as you do. Okay. Well, there's a

688
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,840
there's a um sewer system of the gra of

689
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,799
in our brains that's called the

690
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,120
glimpmphatic system and it's shut

691
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,200
tightly during the daytime when we're

692
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,760
using our brain doing our work uh

693
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,200
whatever we're doing and during the day

694
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,559
we accumulate a lot of uh toxins in

695
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,480
inside our brain during the day. It's

696
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,320
just a matter of functioning. All right?

697
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,080
And what happens is that those toxins

698
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,360
accumulate which is that you know at the

699
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,440
end of a really really tough hard day.

700
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,679
You got if not a headache you've got

701
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,919
your you feel like your brain is it's

702
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,320
full. It's the cup runth over. Right.

703
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,720
All right. So when you go to sleep guess

704
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,720
what this sewer system it's like the

705
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,919
sewers of par underneath Paris. The

706
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,240
grates open up suddenly and it drains

707
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,480
those toxins out while you're sleeping.

708
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,679
And only when you get good sleep. So,

709
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
when you're stressed and you're not

710
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
getting good sleep, you start to

711
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
accumulate these toxins that are never

712
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,880
quite cleaned up and your brain is not

713
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,440
that cleaned up. When your brain's not

714
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,120
cleaned up, you're feeling foggy. So,

715
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,520
think about the, you know, when you're

716
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
in college, you pull an allnighter or

717
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,799
you go to a party or whatever and you're

718
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,640
and you're staying up all night, you're

719
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,120
never quite the same. It takes a while

720
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
for your brain to clean up itself. When

721
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,520
your brain is foggy, you tend to not

722
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,039
make as good decisions. I'm too tired to

723
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,159
work out. I'm too tired. I don't care

724
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,080
what I eat. I'm just hungry. I'm going

725
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,840
to eat anything. You start to make bad

726
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,640
decisions when it comes to diet and

727
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,880
lifestyle. You see? So, it's a it it the

728
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,960
stress can cascade on your health like

729
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
that. Is there a certain stage of sleep

730
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,200
where the glimpmphatic system kicks in?

731
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,760
Yeah. It's during like the deep REM

732
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,360
sleep. Okay. That dreaming sleep. Okay.

733
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,679
And that usually comes later in the

734
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,600
night as well. Correct. Correct. And in

735
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,720
more qual quantity later in the night.

736
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,799
So, you need to really be getting a lot

737
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,960
of sleep. Now, the other thing about

738
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,480
deep sleep is while you're sleeping

739
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,720
really deeply, your metabolism is also

740
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
burning down fat. So, you think that

741
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,159
you're not working out during the night,

742
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,679
you're right, you're not actually

743
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,880
exercising, but in fact, your metabolism

744
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,279
is burning fat because while you're

745
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,640
sleeping and your insulin levels don't

746
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
need to be high because you're not

747
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,240
eating, insulin levels go down, your

748
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
metabolism shifts gears. I I sort of

749
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,279
give people the analogy. It's like your

750
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,640
your body is a race car, sports car,

751
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,720
like a Ferrari. During the day, you are

752
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,360
in gear to drive, accumulate speed, and

753
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,360
and you're you're revving your engines.

754
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,679
At night, you shift gears where you're

755
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,520
actually burning down fat. You don't

756
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,039
need to accumulate more fuel. Now,

757
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,159
you're burning down the fuel. So, when

758
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,120
you're sleeping, you're actually burning

759
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,799
away fat. But when you don't sleep well

760
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,039
or you don't sleep long enough, you're

761
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,159
not burning down that fuel. That fuel

762
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,240
accumulates, day or two of not good

763
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,200
enough sleep, that's that's okay. Think

764
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,960
about flying overseas, getting some jet

765
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,559
lag. You got to catch up. Once you get

766
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
catch up, you feel better. All right?

767
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,360
But think about this like day in and day

768
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,200
out. Chronically stressed people are

769
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,159
never getting good sleep. Add a little

770
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,279
booze, alcohol to the to the equation.

771
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,320
You can kind of see the problems that

772
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
are going to build up. Your brain's

773
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,279
going to be foggy. your metabolism is

774
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,520
going to be out of whack. You're not

775
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,039
burning as much fat from the calories

776
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,000
that you ate during the day. Now,

777
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,880
inflammation starts to uh rise in your

778
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,440
body and that inflammation really takes

779
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
down your health defenses and now you're

780
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,679
much more vulnerable. So, in your own

781
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,240
example of where chronic stress leads to

782
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,880
poor sleep and then you get sick, no

783
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,480
surprise. If we go back up the thread

784
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,159
there, we were talking about the sort of

785
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,360
individual perspective on cancer. And I

786
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
was looking at some stats here and it

787
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
says that the number one Google search

788
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
related to cancer is breast cancer. One

789
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,760
in two people will develop some form of

790
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,760
cancer during their lifetime. That's

791
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,200
according to the NHS. Cancer is the

792
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,919
second highest leading cause of death

793
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,520
worldwide. And by 2040, there will be 28

794
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
million new cases of cancer each year

795
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
worldwide. But one of the most shocking

796
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,320
things that I saw was that globally

797
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,799
early onset cancer incidents has risen

798
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,559
by about 80% by

799
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,840
1990 and 2019. And there was an article

800
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,399
which I'd sent to my team a couple of

801
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,559
weeks ago. It's it's called the worrying

802
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,399
puzzle behind the rise of early onset

803
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,159
cancer. And it says that there are

804
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,399
rising cases of breast collateral and

805
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,120
other cancers in people in their 20s,

806
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,039
30s and 40s. And it posits the question,

807
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,080
what is going on? Over the last 10

808
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,360
years, rates of colorctyl cancer among

809
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,520
25 to 49 year olds has increased in 24

810
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,600
different countries, including the UK,

811
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,399
US, France, Australia, Canada, Norway,

812
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,480
and Argentina. I mean, what is going on?

813
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:02,480
Yeah, that's a big question.

814
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,559
So, are we seeing the results of more

815
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,240
harms in our environment that we're

816
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,600
being exposed to that are more toxic and

817
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,120
leading to earlier incidents of clinical

818
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,039
cancer? They're talking about clinical

819
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,960
diagnosed cancer, not the invisible

820
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,120
microscopic ones that are forming all

821
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,840
the time. Um, it's yes, it's very

822
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,520
worrying. Are we be exposing ourselves

823
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,200
to something that is more commonly

824
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,880
encountered today than before? Number

825
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,120
one. Number two, are our defenses being

826
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,559
taken down by forces that we didn't

827
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,279
appreciate are compromising us? Most

828
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
likely both. It's most likely uh I mean

829
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,200
the human makeup hasn't changed and so

830
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,440
it's got to be the fact a combination

831
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,559
that we're being exposed to more harmful

832
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,919
things and though some of those harmful

833
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,519
things are actually that you know

834
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,200
provoking more cancers but and we're

835
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,600
also being exposed to things that take

836
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,399
down our health defenses. So the balance

837
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,399
is being tipped against us and it's

838
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,640
true. I can tell you that when I went to

839
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,399
medical school I mean colorectile cancer

840
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,039
was something that you rarely saw in

841
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,679
people even in their 50s. it was for

842
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,039
much older uh people. Uh now to see uh I

843
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,480
mean there's even teenagers that have

844
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,960
actually developed colurectal cancer

845
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,320
which was

846
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,840
unfathomable. So I will tell you one

847
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,279
thing that's actually arisen in terms of

848
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,519
like what are some of the clues of these

849
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,519
things that could be happening right? So

850
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,120
we are talking about climate change and

851
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,440
all the things that are happening in our

852
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,720
environment. That's a that's almost too

853
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,799
big a conversation to have to answer a

854
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,880
question like this. But we I think we

855
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,480
cannot afford to ignore the fact that

856
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,519
the environment, the climate that we

857
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,480
live in has changed. But there are other

858
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,480
things that we're beginning to unearth

859
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,840
that we didn't realize until just within

860
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,960
the last few years. And one of them is

861
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,960
the is how many inflammatory

862
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,720
microlastics we are ingesting. When I

863
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:03,519
was growing up, uh my mom very uh

864
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,640
well-intentioned would store foods in

865
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,440
plastic leftovers. Uh, and we'd buy

866
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,360
foods that came in plastic packages,

867
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,039
right? We wouldn't think think second

868
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,600
have a second thought about it. A

869
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,200
plastic cup, styrofoam cup, go to a

870
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,559
picnic, you're eating off of a plastic

871
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,080
plate, right? I mean, these are all

872
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,799
common uh experiences that we all have

873
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,279
uh in the modern developed world. Well,

874
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:30,799
what if I told you that we now realize

875
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,279
that the plastic touching food can shed

876
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,600
the plastic itself as microparticles

877
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,240
into the food and then we eat the food

878
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,640
and okay, we've known this for maybe

879
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,760
more than a decade. Maybe there's little

880
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,360
plastic particles uh that come off, but

881
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,880
you know, hey, there's no harm, right?

882
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,360
We we haven't been able to discover it.

883
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,640
I I used to say that. Now, just within

884
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,440
the last few years, we're beginning to

885
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,760
pinpoint that number one, it does

886
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,720
plastics can actually embed themselves

887
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
in our body. We even know where we also

888
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,960
know that these plastics uh are

889
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,200
associated with

890
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,839
inflammation. That is a big red flag.

891
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,720
The claxon alarm should start going off.

892
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,800
And third is that the volume of plastics

893
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,359
that we're consuming is crazy. There was

894
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,480
a study that came out recently that

895
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,679
showed that in normal autopsies of

896
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,440
people that didn't die of a brain

897
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,480
problem that when they were doing the

898
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,639
autopsies and looking for plastic that

899
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,560
we could find them. And the amount of

900
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,720
plastic that was found in the average

901
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,399
human

902
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,760
brain is about the amount you'd find in

903
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,520
a typical plastic picnic spoon just

904
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
distributed throughout the brain. This

905
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,280
is like a normal this is a person who's

906
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,200
died of something else. Wow. Does that

907
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,960
mean that you know like you and I are

908
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,960
actually you got a plastic spoon worth

909
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,040
of plastic in our brain. There's been

910
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,879
some people that calculated and this has

911
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,480
been the actual calcul math has been

912
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,320
challenged but there was an estimate

913
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,000
that you know some people might consume

914
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
as much as a credit card's worth of

915
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
plastic every single week in their food

916
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,040
if they're not careful about it. And let

917
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
me just tell you where we're finding

918
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
microplastics. And you know I want to

919
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,160
get to the point where we're talking

920
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
about the healthy foods that can

921
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,040
actually turn the ship around. How do we

922
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
turn the battleship of of unhealth back

923
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,560
to health? So, we're back on the course

924
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
that everybody wants to go to. We want

925
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,400
to go to that north. How do we find our

926
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,440
northstar for health? So, I do want to

927
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,599
get to that, but let me just say

928
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
something about

929
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,079
microplastics. We've now found

930
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,079
microplastics in the brain. As I

931
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,119
mentioned to you, we found it in a

932
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,160
bloodstream. A group in Italy actually

933
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,720
looking at men who had narrowing of the

934
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,880
corateed artery. That's the blood vessel

935
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
feeding the brain from comes from the

936
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,079
heart right to the brain the corateed

937
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,160
artery. Oh through the neck through the

938
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,520
neck. They found that the narrowing that

939
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,599
can occur in some men can accumulate

940
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,680
plastic. They can actually find plastic

941
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
particles. There's photographs of the

942
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,359
chunks of plastic the particles

943
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,640
fragments of plastic in there. And they

944
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,240
followed them over a period of time.

945
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,920
Those men who had plastic embedded in

946
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,320
their blood vessel lining had a

947
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,880
four-fold increase in the chances of

948
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,400
having a fatal heart attack or a stroke

949
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,400
years later. 400%. Four four-fold. Yeah.

950
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
Okay. Now, that's that's not kidding,

951
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,280
right? So, now you're now we're

952
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,079
beginning to take notice of this, but

953
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,800
we're also finding microplastics in

954
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,960
breast milk. We're finding microplastics

955
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,079
in testicles. We're finding

956
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,480
microplastics in human semen.

957
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,280
How does it get there? And urologists

958
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,640
who are doing surgery on the penis are

959
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
finding that in in the human flesh when

960
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
they look under the microscope, we never

961
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,000
used to look for this. Now we're looking

962
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,800
for it, that there's even microplastics

963
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,160
in the flesh of the penis. Okay. So if

964
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,920
anybody listening this isn't taking

965
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,640
notice about microplastics now, it's

966
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,400
time to start thinking about this. So

967
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,280
one of the questions is and I'm not

968
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
saying that the rise in rate of cancers

969
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,200
that we're seeing is due to

970
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,079
microplastics. What I what I am saying

971
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,160
is that we're beginning to wake up to

972
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
the fact. So let's close off on

973
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,040
microplastics. What are the the easy

974
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,480
wins in our lives? Do you think when you

975
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,920
think about microplastics? Is it just

976
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,079
removing anything plastic that I eat

977
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,480
from or are there some sort of easy

978
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,280
cheap wins? Is it my shampoo? Is it my

979
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,119
frying pan? Is it a container? Yeah. So,

980
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,960
I always tell people that the easiest

981
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,960
way to lower your exposure to

982
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,560
microplastics is to throw out your

983
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,520
plastic cups, your plastic plates, and

984
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,480
your plastic silverware. Mhm. Okay. And

985
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,040
get ceramic or glass. Uh that's the best

986
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,119
way to actually avoid those. And also,

987
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,440
when you're buying food, try to avoid

988
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,599
food that comes clearly packaged in

989
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,599
plastic. All right. Now, I do want to

990
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,160
point out one thing because right here

991
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,640
on this table, we are looking at a tray

992
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,599
full of beverages and I can already

993
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,480
identify the matcha and this looks like

994
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,320
a cup of coffee and we've got English

995
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
breakfast tea. I've done a lot of

996
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,400
research on tea. All right, but I'm

997
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,880
noticing something that green tea, which

998
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,880
is universally healthy, the polyphenols

999
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,160
in green tea lower the risk of

1000
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,599
inflammation. They actually improve your

1001
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,440
metabolism, lower your risk of cancer.

1002
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,920
They're heart healthy. Before you take

1003
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,240
that sip though, let me tell you, I see

1004
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,359
a tea bag in

1005
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,920
there. Okay? And there's different ways

1006
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,599
of brewing your tea. It turns out

1007
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,240
research from the University of Montreal

1008
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,400
have now shown that um tea bags can shed

1009
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,880
microplastics. So you can have a billion

1010
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,359
particles of microplastic shed from a

1011
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,960
single teabag. Okay. All right. So I

1012
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,359
just changed your mind, right? So look,

1013
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,280
this is the power of awareness and

1014
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,599
understanding. I probably should have

1015
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
stopped you. What was you were like, why

1016
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,160
didn't you save my life? You let me

1017
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,160
drink it first, but I've I

1018
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,160
sp as you were doing it. I was like, uh

1019
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,839
uh. All right. But look, there's another

1020
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,440
there's another one there that's got uh

1021
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,000
lemon ginger tea. This is like an herbal

1022
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,960
tea. That's fine. Listen, um I I would

1023
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,480
also tell you with flavored

1024
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,720
teas, just be cautious. Like always

1025
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,560
check anything that's been machined to

1026
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
be a little bit more than nature. Tea

1027
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,440
bags are supposed to be paper, right?

1028
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
Well, in order to prevent the paper from

1029
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,040
ripping, the the manufacturers of the

1030
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,760
tea bag spray it with a small amount of

1031
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,280
plastic to have it hang together better.

1032
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,720
And that's the plastic that comes off.

1033
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,960
But what about the lemon and ginger in

1034
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,000
this lemon ginger tea? That that sounds

1035
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,599
so appealing and calming, right? And and

1036
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,320
something that most people would find

1037
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,160
nice as an herbal tea. Well, listen,

1038
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,240
you're you're relying on a factory to

1039
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,960
actually put that lemon flavor, ginger

1040
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,480
ginger flavor. Is it real lemon or is it

1041
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,839
real ginger? always look at the

1042
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,960
ingredient label to know what's in there

1043
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,960
or just buy your own tea and squeeze

1044
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,280
your own lemon and and add your own

1045
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,760
piece of ginger. These are ways to

1046
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,040
actually kind of avoid the uh potential

1047
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,560
exposures to toxins that come from

1048
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,640
ultrarocessed food. So all this

1049
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,040
conversation about, you know, avoid

1050
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,640
ultra ultrarocessed foods and watch out

1051
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,480
for all those harmful things, you know,

1052
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,880
it's actually quite easy to dodge them

1053
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
if you just have in your mindset that

1054
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,400
you're just going to make it yourself.

1055
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,920
And it's uh absolutely easy. Now, I will

1056
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,800
tell you in something interesting about

1057
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,480
English breakfast tea. We did research

1058
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,280
at the Androgenesis Foundation, the

1059
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,800
nonprofit I I looked at, to look at um

1060
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,880
different types of teas, different types

1061
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,040
of green tea, Japanese tea, Chinese

1062
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,359
jasmine tea, uh English tea. And we were

1063
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,880
always assuming, again, this is the

1064
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,640
power of food as medicine research. We

1065
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
were always assuming that the green tea

1066
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,320
is going to be the best. I'd always

1067
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,640
heard that Japanese green tea is going

1068
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,920
to be like the ultra best. And what we

1069
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,320
found was that English tea, specifically

1070
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,480
Earl Grey tea, actually was the most

1071
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,079
potent when it actually supported your

1072
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,320
blood vessels, your body's defense

1073
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
system for angioenesis to keep your

1074
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,599
circulation healthy. Wow, what a

1075
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,359
surprise that is. And this spoke to me

1076
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,359
about the fact that we can't make

1077
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,920
assumptions. We need to look at facts.

1078
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,079
We need to look at data. And so I'm a

1079
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,160
big fan of Earl Gray. Now, now what

1080
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,040
could what what might make Earl Gray

1081
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,800
give Earl Grey a superpower? Well, this

1082
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,800
is where knowing a little bit about what

1083
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,640
you're eating is actually useful because

1084
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,040
Earl Grey is a fermented is a is a black

1085
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,800
tea. It's got bergamut in it and

1086
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
bergamut is a kind of a citrus. So,

1087
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,000
maybe it's combining those uh

1088
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,560
ingredients that actually provides the

1089
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,280
superpower. But I do see matcha on this

1090
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,880
uh uh tray. I want to tell you about

1091
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,720
matcha because it is a matcha is truly a

1092
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,319
superenriched polyphenol enriched tea. A

1093
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,040
lot of people don't realize it. There's

1094
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,880
no tea bag in it. So don't worry. So a

1095
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,560
lot of people think about matcha uh as

1096
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,800
just another green tea, but it's not

1097
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,319
another green tea. It is made with green

1098
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,880
tea leaves, the same kind of green tea

1099
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,839
leaves, but uh as you would find in any

1100
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,000
green tea. However, it's what's the

1101
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:02,160
composition of matcha? Matcha is green

1102
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,119
tea that is before it's ready for

1103
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,040
harvest is grown under a shade that

1104
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,560
changes its chemical structure, natural

1105
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,720
chemical structure a little bit. So,

1106
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,560
it's got a lot of potency to it. And

1107
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,560
what happens with matcha is they take

1108
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,839
the tea

1109
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,079
leaf, they take out the stem of the

1110
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,480
green of the of the green tea leaf and

1111
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,800
they ground up the actual leaf into a

1112
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,680
powder. Now, what's in that green tea

1113
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,400
leaf? You've got not just some of the

1114
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,480
polyphenols that might steep out in the

1115
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,800
cup, whether you're using a tea bag or

1116
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,800
or loose leaf tea, you are getting all

1117
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,319
the polyphenols suspended in that. So

1118
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,200
now you get 100% polyphenol, okay, in

1119
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,680
matcha. So go ahead. You're go ahead do

1120
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,160
it. That one's good. All right. Okay.

1121
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,319
For matcha and because you're getting

1122
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,960
the tea leaf ground to it, you're also

1123
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,680
getting your dietary fiber. The dietary

1124
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,440
fiber is good for your gut health, your

1125
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,920
microbiome, good for uh your metabolism,

1126
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,560
good for lowering inflammation. And the

1127
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,839
polyphenols found in green tea have also

1128
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,160
been matcha matcha tea have also been

1129
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,800
found in the lab to kill breast cancer

1130
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,319
stem cells. What's a breast cancer stem

1131
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,400
cell? What's a stem cell? Cancer stem

1132
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,800
cell. Well, look, stem cells are these

1133
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,280
renewable cells. All right? And um

1134
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,040
cancers contain stem cells that help the

1135
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,119
cancers come back, right? If you got

1136
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,400
cancer, you get it treated. One the one

1137
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,560
thing you don't want it to do is to come

1138
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,960
back. So um and by the way, other foods

1139
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,599
can also do kill cancer stem cells.

1140
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,839
Purple potatoes uh that you might have

1141
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,599
seen in the market. They're um kind of

1142
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,240
purpley looking on the outside. Slice it

1143
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,160
open, dark purple on the inside. All

1144
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,280
right. Turns out that those purple

1145
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,880
potatoes have something called

1146
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,640
anthocyanins.

1147
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,960
Purple potatoes have been studied in a

1148
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,400
lab, okay, at Penn State University and

1149
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,240
been shown to kill colon cancer stem

1150
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,240
cells which contribute to the colon

1151
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,880
cancer coming back. So, full disclaimer,

1152
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,119
I am I made a very very big investment

1153
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,680
uh a seven figure investment into a

1154
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,680
matcher company a couple of years ago.

1155
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,200
And if you look at the search trend data

1156
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,119
on the subject of ma matcher, I don't

1157
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,319
know if you've seen this, but that's

1158
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,319
I'll throw it up on the screen for

1159
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,319
anyone that's watching on video, but you

1160
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,040
can see how it's just come out of

1161
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,280
nowhere. It seems it's exploded. And

1162
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,760
when you say that matcha cells have an

1163
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,680
impact on breast cancer cells, what does

1164
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,079
that mean in reality? Does it? Because

1165
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
obviously the the the conclusion one

1166
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,200
might jump to is that if you drink

1167
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,119
matcha, you're lowering your risk of

1168
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,560
breast cancer, but that's not

1169
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,800
necessarily what you're saying. What

1170
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,319
what I what I am saying is that drinking

1171
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,880
green tea in its most healthful form,

1172
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,960
okay, um raises your body's health

1173
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,280
defense systems. And by having better

1174
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,200
health defense systems, better immunity,

1175
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,240
better control of your blood vessels,

1176
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,680
better control over your DNA and those

1177
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,000
mutations, and if you can actually kill

1178
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,839
some of those stem cells, cancer stem

1179
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,880
cells, that's going to be in your favor

1180
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,280
as well, that is overall going to

1181
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,520
actually lower your risk of cancer. And

1182
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,520
so I think that, and by the way, the

1183
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,920
other thing that green tea and matcha

1184
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,280
can actually do is improve your

1185
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,079
metabolism. It's it's really pretty much

1186
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,480
all good. I my great uncle by the way

1187
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,839
lived to 104 years old, vital, intact,

1188
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,079
uh independent. He told me that he

1189
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:26,480
attributed his longevity and his

1190
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,240
vitality to the fact that he lived at

1191
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,240
the base of a mountain that grew tea.

1192
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,800
That every morning he got up and he

1193
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,040
walked up. He walked up stone steps, a

1194
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,440
stone path to a tea garden and he had

1195
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,200
freshly picked tea. It's all organically

1196
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
grown and everything. And he and he

1197
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
drank tea all day long. He probably had

1198
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,680
10 cups of green tea a day. And this has

1199
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,560
been his whole life. He sat with his uh

1200
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,280
uh close friends who are also very

1201
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,520
vibrant and and elderly. Um social

1202
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,160
connection. All right. Watch the

1203
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,800
sunrise. It's very calming. Do you drink

1204
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,160
it? Absolutely. Um I've got to just

1205
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,640
going up the the thread again a little

1206
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,520
bit. You mentioned the word colurectal.

1207
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,319
Where is the colarctyl? All right. So,

1208
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,079
we have a little um model here cuz I'm

1209
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,319
asking this because I'm wondering why

1210
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,839
that type of cancer is increasing. So,

1211
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:21,040
is there is there a particular reason

1212
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:24,319
why? Well, okay. So, let's do a quick uh

1213
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,319
medical school uh course crash course

1214
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,319
for

1215
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:30,880
podcasters.

1216
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:32,880
Um the the gut, we talk about gut

1217
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,480
health. Most people think of the gut as

1218
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,160
sort of lower down in your belly or

1219
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,800
maybe even just your stomach. But the

1220
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,720
gut actually starts in your mouth and it

1221
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,920
runs down down down about 40 feet worth

1222
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,359
of stuff organs u your esophagus, your

1223
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,640
stomach, your small intestines, your

1224
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,119
large intestines. By the way, these

1225
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,280
squigglies are your small intestines.

1226
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,359
All right. This blue is your large

1227
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,560
intestines. This is like a it's shaped

1228
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,599
like a horseshoe. It's big thick tube

1229
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,839
that that's kind of framing your small

1230
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,599
intestines. And then it goes down the

1231
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,839
poop shoot, the rectal, and the anus.

1232
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,920
That's the end of your gut. All right?

1233
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:13,520
So, the colon is really the large uh

1234
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,920
framing thick part of the gut. It's near

1235
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,359
the very end. All right? So, all this

1236
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,040
squiggly small intestines winds up here

1237
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,640
uh at the beginning of the colon. The

1238
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,520
colon goes up. It's called the ascending

1239
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,760
colon. And then it makes a sharp angled

1240
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,440
turn right across your belly. Kind of

1241
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,119
like a belt right across your belly.

1242
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,359
This is colon here and then it goes to

1243
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,520
the descending colon. Take the elevator

1244
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,760
down down down down down. You see the

1245
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,480
blue down going down and then it kind of

1246
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
takes a little jog at the very end and

1247
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,760
goes down into your rectum and your

1248
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,400
anus. Okay. Right. So the blue thing is

1249
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,560
my colon. So this is where cancer

1250
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,160
incidence is rising in young people. So

1251
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,079
you're talking about the rising

1252
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,560
incidence of colctal cancer. That could

1253
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,040
be a cancer that's typically uh either

1254
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,359
on the right side of the colon either

1255
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,599
the going up up the upside up the

1256
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,920
elevator. Yeah. Or down the elevator. On

1257
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,240
the right side of the left side. Okay.

1258
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,319
Okay. It turns out that we've known for

1259
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,040
a long time that unhealthy diets are

1260
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,079
linked to a higher risk of colorectal

1261
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,200
cancer specifically processed meats. So

1262
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,040
the World Health Organization contains

1263
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,760
considers processed meats, salami,

1264
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,160
bologna, ultrarocessed, you know, kind

1265
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,520
of deli meats, delicates, meat you find

1266
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,839
in delicates. All right. Um th those

1267
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:36,400
would be uh considered uh

1268
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:39,200
carcinogens and and they're they're they

1269
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,119
are uh highly linked to an increased

1270
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,800
risk of bowel cancers. Now, why would

1271
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,480
that be? Well, it turns out that think

1272
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,559
about it. If you're eating a ton of

1273
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,880
meat, all right, you're actually

1274
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,520
exposing the gut to a lot of those

1275
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,680
processed meat carcinogens that when it

1276
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,680
sits around in your colon, not one, not

1277
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,240
not once in a while, go to the ball

1278
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,480
game, have a hot dog, enjoy yourself,

1279
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,680
but if you eat it day in and day out,

1280
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,200
you're giving a lot of exposure uh to

1281
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,319
your gut. This term

1282
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,079
angiogenesis, you talked about the link

1283
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,720
that that has to cancer. Angioenesis

1284
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,680
from my um novice understanding is how

1285
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,599
the blood cells provide blood to

1286
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,040
different parts of our body. Right? And

1287
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:24,760
in the case of cancer there's

1288
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:27,040
this the angioenesis system is making a

1289
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,440
mistake. Is that a simplified version of

1290
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,200
it? Yeah. So angioenesis which is the

1291
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,200
field I studied study you break it down

1292
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,000
it to to what it's elemental parts of

1293
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,000
angio blood blood vessel genesis how the

1294
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,160
body grows and maintains them so

1295
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,319
androgenesis is how our body grows and

1296
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,440
maintains our circulation a lot of

1297
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,599
people don't know this but our

1298
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,400
circulation is one of our body's health

1299
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,839
defense systems and it's so extensive

1300
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,240
that in a typical adult there are 60,000

1301
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,920
miles worth of blood vessels packed

1302
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,559
inside our body. These are the highways

1303
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,200
and byways that deliver blood to every

1304
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,119
organ and tissue. But that means that

1305
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,040
they also deliver the air we breathe,

1306
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,720
the oxygen we're breathing in, and the

1307
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,000
nutrients that we're eating. So we eat

1308
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,760
good things, they're going into our

1309
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,240
bloodstream, and our blood vessels, our

1310
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,880
androgenesis systems develing to every

1311
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,480
cell in the body. Now you eat something

1312
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,480
bad similarly or you breathe something

1313
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,400
in bad, similarly those blood vessels

1314
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,440
are delivering something negative. Now

1315
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,240
inside the blood vessels um is a lining.

1316
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,319
It's called a the lining is like a clear

1317
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,079
like a plastic wrap inside the blood

1318
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:37,359
vessel called the endothelial layer.

1319
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,520
That's like a layer of ice like on an

1320
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,040
ice skating rig to ensure that

1321
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,440
everything in the blood vessels are

1322
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,359
flowing smoothly without getting caught

1323
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,480
on the walls. So when you have

1324
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,960
cardiovascular disease, too much uh uh

1325
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,240
too much salt to hypertension. When you

1326
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,599
have diabetes where you're actually

1327
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,520
wearing down the lining of the blood

1328
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,839
vessels, endothelial layers being

1329
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,400
damaged. It's like um damaging the

1330
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,520
lining of your angioenesis defense

1331
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,920
system has really deadly consequences

1332
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,400
because it's like scraping up the ice on

1333
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,559
an ice skating rink. You know, uh if you

1334
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,200
actually have a lot of ice skaters on a

1335
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,720
rink, after a while it's unskatable,

1336
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,040
right? You can't get on it. And what

1337
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,760
will happen in your bloodstream is then

1338
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,440
elements in your blood get caught along

1339
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,000
the walls and they build up and that's

1340
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,240
actually how blood vessels narrow up. So

1341
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,680
that's one of the areas of of of so

1342
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,440
androgenesis actually is intended to

1343
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,359
deliver oxygen and nutrients to the

1344
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,000
tissues that need it for to maintain

1345
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,640
your health. But because it's so

1346
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,640
critical, it's also very very carefully

1347
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,720
controlled so you don't have blood

1348
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,839
vessels growing where they should not be

1349
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,480
growing. like in your joints, in your

1350
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,760
eyes, or of course to cancers. You don't

1351
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,160
definitely don't want to be feeding

1352
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,240
cancers by delivering oxygen or

1353
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,640
nutrients to them. I've got this graph

1354
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,440
which shows different things that cause

1355
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,400
more or less

1356
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,359
angiogenesis. If you've seen this graph,

1357
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,280
but okay. So, you are showing a graph

1358
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:09,599
that I I generated my my organization

1359
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,040
generated. And this is actually you're

1360
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,359
looking at the experiment that got me

1361
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,680
into food as medicine. Let me explain to

1362
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,160
you the experiment. Um I'll just put

1363
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,319
I'll put it over here. So um so we were

1364
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,880
studying at one

1365
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:26,640
point drugs and we're trying to discover

1366
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,800
drugs that could be developed as cancer

1367
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,160
treatments. So what we're looking for

1368
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,920
are drugs that could cut off the blood

1369
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,640
supply to tumors. So we were screening

1370
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,800
uh lots of chemicals that biotech

1371
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,880
companies were developing and inventing

1372
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,720
and professors were inventing and said

1373
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,480
hey can you take a look to see if this

1374
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,559
could be a worthwhile drug that could

1375
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,920
cut off the blood supply to a tumor as a

1376
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,760
cancer treatment. All right and at the

1377
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,200
time there were no such treatments. So

1378
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,960
it was all discovery like this was you

1379
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,559
know like the like the golden age of

1380
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,480
discovery when it came to androgenesis.

1381
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,640
We were testing oh my gosh this thing

1382
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,000
could really stop blood vessels. Could

1383
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,440
we develop this into our cancer

1384
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,200
treatment? Ultimately, yes. The answer

1385
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,800
was yes. But we were looking for them.

1386
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,800
And we would f and so we developed a

1387
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:13,520
system where we could add a substance

1388
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:16,640
into a laboratory test system to see if

1389
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,640
blood vessels would grow or shrink. And

1390
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,559
so here on this graph, you can see at

1391
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,720
the very top a very long bar of blood

1392
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,240
vessels growing. That's normal, healthy

1393
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,319
blood vessels growing out as long as

1394
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,200
they can. And then what we would do is

1395
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,400
we would throw drugs into it and we

1396
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,880
would see if we could actually shrink

1397
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,559
them up. And so some of the uh shorter

1398
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,240
bars uh uh are uh cancer drugs. Uh you

1399
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,079
can see them uh in this color in blue.

1400
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,599
Not surprisingly, some of the cancer

1401
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,359
drugs were making the blood vessels

1402
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,760
smaller. Hey, this could be a good

1403
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,640
candidate drug. And we were also testing

1404
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,000
other uh drugs that were available, not

1405
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,680
used for cancer to see if they would

1406
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,480
work. Sure, we discovered some of those,

1407
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,160
too. But I did something a little bit

1408
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,599
subversive and as you know, you know, if

1409
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,000
you want to be disruptive, you got to

1410
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,599
sometimes um disrupt yourself in order

1411
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,640
to be able to do this. So this is our

1412
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
experiment that we were doing at the

1413
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,599
Androenesis Foundation. We decided to

1414
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,520
disrupt ourselves. So we said, we have a

1415
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,680
whole system of drugs to test. Let's

1416
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,680
remove half of them and let's swap them

1417
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,280
out with powders that came from

1418
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,920
food. All right? Just to see what would

1419
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,200
happen. And when we actually tested

1420
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,680
foods in the same system used to develop

1421
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,119
drugs, food as medicine, tested in the

1422
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,599
same system that medicines are

1423
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,960
developed, we found what you see on this

1424
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:40,040
bar chart in red, we actually found that

1425
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,839
dietary factors, stuff that's found in

1426
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,760
food, could actually cut down the blood

1427
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,400
supply that would be growing to feed a

1428
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,160
cancer. In other words, there's

1429
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,839
anti-angioenic foods. You can see the

1430
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
green tea. You could see the onions and

1431
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,880
garlics and red grapes and strawberries.

1432
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,240
Um, it was really an eye openener to me

1433
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:04,760
for when I saw these results. It made my

1434
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:07,839
jaw drop and I said, "My god, foods have

1435
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,000
potency just like drugs." I was I was a

1436
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,359
skeptic. All right. And I and it just

1437
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,079
made me realize like this is something

1438
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,960
that I had to pursue. This was an area

1439
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,920
of research that I

1440
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,319
absolutely had to actually look further

1441
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,000
into. A drug takes a decade and a

1442
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,280
billion or more dollars to be able to

1443
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,520
develop from uh from scratch to reaching

1444
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,119
a patient and then not everyone who

1445
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,480
needs a treatment can actually get the

1446
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,480
drug. But a food has immediiacy. If you

1447
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,480
discover something amazing about a food,

1448
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,960
whether it's matcha, whether it's purple

1449
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,280
potatoes, whether it's a strawberry,

1450
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,960
that could that that that immediacy

1451
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,200
could be used beneficially without

1452
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,160
toxicity. All right? Uh and affordably.

1453
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,920
And so I just saw this as this was this

1454
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,359
experiment is what brought me into the

1455
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,200
realm of food is medicine. So I'm going

1456
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,119
to ask some stupid questions here. So on

1457
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,680
here I can see that for example soy

1458
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,680
extract causes less angiogenesis which

1459
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,520
what I understand is the the growth of

1460
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,400
these blood vessels. But does that mean

1461
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,480
that if I have lots of soy extract or

1462
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:17,440
arichoke or parsley or berries that it's

1463
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,079
going to cause other parts of my body

1464
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,839
not to grow blood cells? So this is the

1465
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,119
great question that let let me kind of

1466
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,559
reframe the question as you're asking

1467
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:30,480
it. If uh experiments are able to show

1468
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:33,040
that certain foods can uh prevent blood

1469
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,359
vessels from growing, will that actually

1470
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,520
cause a problem with your body's health

1471
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,799
defenses to keep blood vessels from

1472
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,680
growing in healthy tissues? Yeah. All

1473
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,119
right. Answer is no. And here's why. as

1474
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,520
a health defense system. Our

1475
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:50,319
androgenesis system is completely

1476
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,960
designed to yoke in the right number of

1477
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,319
blood vessels to give just amount just

1478
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,000
the right amount of blood flow. Not too

1479
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:58,400
much, not too little. I call it the

1480
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,040
Goldilocks zone. You know, Goldilocks a

1481
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,640
fairy tale. Um, you know, the bears were

1482
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,079
home invaders. They broke into the house

1483
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,640
and they were looking for chairs and

1484
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,040
porridge and beds. Not too hot, not too

1485
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,799
cold, but just right. All of our health

1486
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,280
defenses, including the androgenesis

1487
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:16,079
health defense, is hardwired to keep the

1488
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,200
body just right. So, what that means is

1489
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,480
that eating foods like artichokes or

1490
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,040
strawberries or soy can actually help

1491
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,640
your body prevent extra blood vessels

1492
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,359
from growing towards cancer, for

1493
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,480
example, and and other diseased tissues,

1494
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,480
but it will not override the body's

1495
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,319
natural ability to get the right amount

1496
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,000
of blood vessels to the right tissue. So

1497
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,240
you don't have to worry about starving

1498
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,240
your healthy tissues. You're just uh

1499
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,000
cutting off the bad blood vessels of the

1500
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,720
tissue. I can I call it like a

1501
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,839
landscaper on a golf course that that

1502
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,839
breaks out the lawn mower to mow that uh

1503
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:54,160
the golf course so it's got a perfect

1504
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,520
level um of the lawn. You're not going

1505
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,040
to actually uh carve out a bald spot uh

1506
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,760
in on in a country club. You're going to

1507
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,000
get just the right amount. Similarly,

1508
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,599
and um we're not talking about this

1509
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,119
graph. There's another graph that can

1510
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,040
actually show foods that you can eat

1511
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,119
that can grow blood vessels, healthy

1512
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,160
blood vessels where you want them. And

1513
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,400
it turns out things like fruit peel uh

1514
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,839
uh can actually do that. And barley can

1515
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,680
grow new blood vessels. And dark

1516
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,359
chocolate can actually help to support

1517
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,960
blood vessels as well. And some of these

1518
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,720
things can also work on both sides of

1519
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,799
the equation. They can prune away the

1520
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,160
bad extra blood vessels and it can grow

1521
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,720
them whenever you need them. So your

1522
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,760
body is sort of like the gardener

1523
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,119
extraordinaire. and knows exactly how to

1524
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,799
actually tend. You give them the right

1525
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,319
ingredients, they know exactly where to

1526
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,319
put the grass seed, and they know

1527
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:44,559
exactly where to mow the lawn. Have you

1528
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:47,040
ever had cancer in your family? Yes. Um,

1529
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,119
cancer's touched my family like it has

1530
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,520
for most people. Um, I had two uncles

1531
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,880
uh years ago that passed away. One

1532
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,280
passed away from colon cancer, one

1533
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,599
passed away from liver cancer. And, you

1534
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,880
know, I was a doctor at the time. And so

1535
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:07,440
I felt so uh

1536
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,160
helpless uh because as a doctor I could

1537
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,880
I could diagnose I could lay hands on I

1538
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,160
could feel the hard liver I could feel

1539
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,760
the masses and I felt at the time

1540
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,319
helpless even though I was doing the

1541
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,040
research cancer research and finding

1542
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:26,640
future paths I felt like this was we

1543
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,599
we're we're not there yet and we can't I

1544
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,400
couldn't help him. I felt I felt

1545
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,599
powerless. Fast

1546
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,040
forward, we're now at a point where

1547
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,280
we're beginning to see the light at the

1548
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,559
end of the tunnel. And my mother, when

1549
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,640
my mother had cancer, so my uncle's

1550
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,640
sister, my mother, wound up having

1551
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,559
endometrial cancer, she was 80 years

1552
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:51,920
old. one day um had some bleeding, went

1553
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:55,040
to the hospital, found a mass, she had a

1554
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,000
hyerectomy to remove her uterus and

1555
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,599
ovaries, and they found in there an

1556
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,839
endometrial cancer. That's a cancer, the

1557
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,960
lining of the uterus. The surgery and a

1558
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,680
little bit of radiation was supposed to

1559
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,280
take care of it.

1560
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:09,280
Unfortunately, in her case, those little

1561
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,920
cancer stem cells and it was microscopic

1562
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,599
cancers that were present took off,

1563
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,280
raced off in her 80-year-old body, which

1564
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,720
you know, weaker immune system when

1565
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,880
you're 80. Uh, and within a few months

1566
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,240
after successfully recovering from the

1567
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,119
surgery, she had stage four cancer

1568
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,720
everywhere. All right? And her

1569
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,160
oncologist told me, uh, Dr. Lee, you

1570
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,400
know, you're a doctor as well. You know,

1571
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,799
this is serious and this is pretty much

1572
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,240
the time of game over. And

1573
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:43,680
now times have changed. Science had

1574
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,680
advanced. Progress has advanced. At that

1575
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,960
time when my mother was diagnosed with

1576
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,520
stage 4 cancer,

1577
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,680
immunotherapy, the latest and greatest,

1578
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,000
I think advancement in cancer treatment

1579
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,119
had just broken through and become

1580
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,839
approved. Imunotherapy is not

1581
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,720
chemotherapy. It doesn't actually poison

1582
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,640
the cancer. Imunotherapy is a medicine

1583
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,760
that you give a cancer patient that

1584
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,760
wakes up your own immune system. Whether

1585
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,599
you're a young person or an old person,

1586
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,319
it can wake up your immune system. All

1587
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,760
right? And my mother had imunotherapy.

1588
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,319
She was one of the early patients that

1589
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,680
got imunotherapy. And her own

1590
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:26,160
80-year-old immune system woke up like a

1591
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,799
super like an army of super soldiers and

1592
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,599
went after that cancer. Now, we

1593
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:35,440
completely adjusted her diet to so that

1594
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:37,680
her body between treatments would be as

1595
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,440
strong as possible. Shields raised as

1596
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,079
we've been talking about. And we gave

1597
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,200
her a little bit of radiation to to to

1598
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,559
help the uh the her immune system spot

1599
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:50,359
the cancer. Guess what

1600
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:53,440
happened? Three treatments of

1601
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:56,079
imunotherapy, three three weeks apart.

1602
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,559
So, time zero is the first treatment.

1603
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,400
Three weeks later, the next treatment.

1604
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,559
Three weeks after that, the next

1605
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,480
treatment. All right. So, we're talking

1606
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,559
about like total nine weeks of three

1607
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,000
treatments. All right. Of these three

1608
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,799
treatments, we scanned her stage four,

1609
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,880
went to stage

1610
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:16,640
zero, and she never had chemotherapy.

1611
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,599
Now, chemotherapy can be helpful too

1612
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:23,440
with imunotherapy, but this was where I

1613
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:26,720
saw firsthand close up in my own family,

1614
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:29,520
the ability to harness your body's own

1615
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,680
health defenses in a way that I couldn't

1616
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,240
do for my

1617
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,480
uncle 15 years ago before. And we lost

1618
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,000
them. And we were to save my mom. And I

1619
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,400
can tell you, I literally had dinner

1620
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,599
with my mom two days ago, and she's 90,

1621
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,319
91, 10, 11 years later, completely

1622
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,960
healthy, completely cancer-free. And by

1623
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,319
the way, this

1624
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:55,119
amunotherapy, if we could only get this

1625
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:57,440
to work as well for everyone. This is

1626
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,839
where we are in the history of medicine.

1627
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,119
We can see an end. We know how we can

1628
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,200
get to an end. We've actually seen

1629
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,880
successes. We just can't get it to work

1630
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,319
for everyone yet. And there are

1631
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,440
different ways to actually wake up your

1632
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,839
immune system. Another way that I'm

1633
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:14,200
working on now that um a colleague of

1634
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:17,280
mine in Germany is working on is also

1635
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:20,480
absolutely jaw-droppingly amazing.

1636
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,440
Imagine this. Somebody has cancer and

1637
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,200
you're going to they're going to get a

1638
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,720
biopsy no matter what. They're going to

1639
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,640
take some tissue out to look at it under

1640
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,640
the microscope. What kind of cancer is

1641
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,079
it? A brain? Is it breast? Is it a

1642
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,359
colon? Is it pancreas? Where is it

1643
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,160
coming from? You're gonna get a

1644
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:35,599
diagnosis. Right now, up until recently,

1645
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,000
that's all we did with the tissue, the

1646
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,280
biopsy. You just got a result, and it's

1647
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,200
kind of like a death sentence, depending

1648
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,640
on what type of cancer, and you're

1649
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,599
supposed to then go to the guidelines

1650
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,440
and open up the the the the treatment

1651
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,640
book to say, well, what's the pathway we

1652
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,440
should what's the recipe we should

1653
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,680
follow for treatment. Too often, those

1654
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,400
recipes don't work very well for very

1655
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,920
long. Now, what if I told you that where

1656
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:02,960
we are headed with cancer therapy is a

1657
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,440
new frontier where you take the tumor

1658
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,559
with the biopsy, sure, look it under the

1659
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,119
microscope, call it out, uh uh define

1660
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,880
what it is, and then you send it to a

1661
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,000
lab where you do complete full-on

1662
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,520
genetics. You sequence the entire cancer

1663
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,839
genome. All right? Right now, we do

1664
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,160
sequence. We take a dozen, two dozen,

1665
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:27,200
three dozen. I'm talking about doing 20,

1666
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,880
30,000 genes, right? Right now, most

1667
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,760
people say it's not worth it. We don't

1668
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,079
know what we do with all that

1669
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,480
information. What if I told you if you

1670
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,359
took a tumor and sequenced all the

1671
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,440
genes, you find every mutation, every

1672
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:41,760
typographical error that we talked about

1673
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,760
earlier that's in that cancer. Those are

1674
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,920
the smoking guns of the cancer. Now,

1675
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,319
what if I took a piece of a little

1676
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,200
normal blood, normal cells, and sequence

1677
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,440
that too? All right. Now people are be

1678
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,039
hearing me talk who are oncologists or

1679
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,240
scientists would say I don't know what

1680
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,440
you're talking about that's double the

1681
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,680
waste of effort because now you're going

1682
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,200
to sequence the human genome twice in a

1683
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,520
single patient what are you going to do

1684
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,319
with all that information ah this is

1685
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,200
where technology sits in artificial

1686
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:12,720
intelligence machine learning let's now

1687
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,480
have a computer compare normal cells

1688
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,319
with tumor cells back and forth and back

1689
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,720
and forth and back and forth subtract

1690
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,760
out all the mutations that are found in

1691
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,880
normal cells

1692
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,880
leaving only the smoking gun mutations

1693
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,280
in the cancer. Couple hundred are going

1694
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,359
to be left. Those are the smoking guns.

1695
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,920
Those are the doers that led to this

1696
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,079
cancer. Now imagine, and I'm going to

1697
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,319
give you an analogy here. Do you

1698
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,319
remember that Tom Cruz movie uh Minority

1699
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,319
Report? Yeah. So you remember like he

1700
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:42,559
was wearing these gloves and you have a

1701
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,480
glass pane and you can actually move the

1702
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,119
uh things around on the glass with your

1703
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,119
fingertips, right? So now imagine you

1704
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,680
can take these human uh the the the

1705
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,760
cancer mutations on the bottom of this

1706
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,960
glass screen and you can just randomly

1707
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,160
with your fingers pick out 20 random

1708
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,000
mutations and move them up on the

1709
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,400
screen. All right, now you've just

1710
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
picked out the mutations and now you can

1711
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,520
connect the mutations together. I call

1712
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,520
it a pearl necklace. Imagine every

1713
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,359
mutation is a pearl and you connect them

1714
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,599
together with the string that connects a

1715
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:13,680
pearl necklace. Now now you get what I'm

1716
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,720
saying? Like now we've taken the tumor,

1717
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,319
find out the doers, the the the the uh

1718
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:22,240
the smoking guns. Now we've strung them

1719
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:24,240
together. Okay, this is the most wanted

1720
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,880
sign that you would actually place out

1721
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,039
for the criminal. And now imagine you

1722
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,960
hit

1723
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:34,000
print technology. And now you have a

1724
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,359
protein printer that prints out those

1725
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
smoking guns as a protein, as a protein

1726
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,079
full of your own individual cancer of

1727
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
that particular person. Now you take

1728
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,160
that protein and you inject it under the

1729
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,520
skin and you're challenging your own

1730
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,440
immune system. You're vaccinating

1731
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,200
yourself with the with your own cancer

1732
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,319
and you're c causing your own immune

1733
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:57,200
system to say, "Aha, this is a bad guy.

1734
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,880
We're going to develop antibodies to go

1735
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,880
find our immune system. We're going to

1736
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,079
get ratcheted up to go find that

1737
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:07,119
cancer." Well, this is happening right

1738
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,880
now in clinical trials. I have a a

1739
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,839
colleague named Saskia Biscup that is

1740
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,480
actually developing peptide vaccine

1741
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:17,359
treatments against cancer. And if you

1742
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,920
want to see some amazing results, um

1743
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:22,960
there was a paper we published in Nature

1744
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:26,039
uh communications about a year ago that

1745
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,559
showed in more than a 100 people with

1746
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,200
glyobblasto that is a game over brain

1747
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,160
cancer. Nobody lives more than a couple

1748
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,440
of years with this. All right. That with

1749
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,480
this treatment, we've been able to

1750
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,720
actually show that some patients with

1751
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,200
their own immune system woken up can

1752
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:47,200
actually keep them alive and

1753
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,760
cancer-free brain cancer. Like that is

1754
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,000
no win-win situation. Impossible to

1755
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,760
possible. And actually somebody who I've

1756
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,280
just recruited as an ambassador to my

1757
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,400
nonprofit organization, the Andrew

1758
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,720
Genesis Foundation, I strongly encourage

1759
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,079
people who want to have a modicum of

1760
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,079
hope, who wants to see what I'm talking

1761
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,240
about in real life on social media.

1762
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,319
There's a woman named Rebecca Divine.

1763
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:12,319
She's okay with me giving her name. Her

1764
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,799
handle is that brainy blonde. It's a

1765
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,920
it's a triple antandra. She's blonde.

1766
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,759
She's very smart, but she had a

1767
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,640
glyobblastoma 7 years ago and she is

1768
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,960
thriving alive with his imunotherapy. So

1769
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,719
between my mother, Rebecca Divine, I'm

1770
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,080
just telling you like I've had well I've

1771
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:33,679
known well over a dozen people who

1772
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,000
there's no way they'd be here today if

1773
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,640
it wasn't for the scientific advances

1774
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,120
that all shore up the body's health

1775
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,759
defense systems, specifically the immune

1776
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,839
system. But that's the drugs alone

1777
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,319
aren't enough. you really can take

1778
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:50,080
advantage at home of your own diet and

1779
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,319
lifestyle to be able to tip those odds

1780
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,839
in your favor. I've heard you say that

1781
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,159
amunotherapy is more likely to be

1782
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,319
successful if you have certain bacteria

1783
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:02,839
in your gut.

1784
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:05,239
Yeah, that is okay. So

1785
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:09,279
in

1786
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:12,400
2017, I helped to convene a cancer

1787
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:15,279
research conference in Paris.

1788
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,520
uh and we called it rethinking cancer

1789
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:21,040
and we brought the world's best minds

1790
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,319
out there and one of the um researchers

1791
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,080
uh uh named Dr. Laurance Zogle she's at

1792
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,359
the in Paris works in Paris at the

1793
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,080
institute Gustaf Rousi she is an

1794
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:33,040
imuninooncologist so she studies

1795
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,319
imunotherapy for cancer and at the time

1796
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,640
we had uh we we asked her to

1797
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:41,199
present uh some uh groundbreaking

1798
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,159
results that were embargoed at the time.

1799
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:47,040
So our research, our conference was the

1800
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,440
first time it was ever presented and she

1801
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,960
said

1802
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:54,920
in a 100 people who were receiving

1803
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,960
imunotherapy for uh different types of

1804
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,080
cancer that if you looked at the

1805
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:03,040
difference between people who responded

1806
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,600
lived did well versus people who didn't

1807
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,520
respond didn't do well died. All right?

1808
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,080
And that's the frustration with the

1809
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,440
types of treatments my mom had. um you

1810
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,840
know, some people do well, some people

1811
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,520
don't do well. We pull our hair out

1812
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,520
trying to figure out like what's going

1813
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,600
on? How do we make people do better?

1814
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Well, it turns out that when you compare

1815
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:26,880
everything, gender, age, coorbidities,

1816
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,960
uh uh all the other genetic factors. The

1817
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,760
research that was presented showed that

1818
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,360
there was no differences between the

1819
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,640
groups of responders, people who did

1820
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,320
well versus people who didn't do well

1821
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,800
for

1822
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,760
imunotherapy, except for one thing.

1823
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,280
That one thing was one

1824
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:46,159
bacteria. The responders had one

1825
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,920
bacteria called acromancia mucinophila.

1826
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,840
So most bacteria have a genus and

1827
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,040
species. First name, last name, first

1828
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,159
name is acrimancia, last name is

1829
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,880
mucinophila. Okay, it likes to grow in

1830
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:59,440
mucus. Mucinophilia. Where is there a

1831
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,920
lot of mucus? In the colon. Where's the

1832
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,320
colon? That's the on this model the blue

1833
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,360
area. So acromancy grows right here in

1834
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,880
the seeum which is the pouch uh in the

1835
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,199
colon right at the beginning before you

1836
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,440
take the up elevator to the top of of

1837
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:15,080
the colon. That's where it grows. If you

1838
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,880
if the people had that

1839
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,400
acromancia they would respond to

1840
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,840
imunotherapy. So what what the

1841
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,760
researcher did they she took out the

1842
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:26,719
acromancia and brought it to her lab of

1843
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,520
the responders from humans and and gave

1844
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,280
it to mice who were not responding to

1845
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:33,600
imotherapy. Boom. she'd recom she'd

1846
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,159
resurrect the immune response to kill

1847
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,239
the cancer. So this is one of the first

1848
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:40,000
bacteria and there there may be many

1849
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,520
many that we haven't yet discovered. All

1850
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,440
right. So like my whole career has all

1851
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,920
been about discovery. There may be more

1852
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,960
bacteria but we discovered at least one

1853
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,239
the presence of which seems to be

1854
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,320
absolutely vital if you are a patient

1855
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,760
receiving imunotherapy

1856
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,560
uh the type of imunotherapy called

1857
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,800
checkpoint inhibitors. uh if you want to

1858
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,840
uh uh tip the odds in your own favor of

1859
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,400
being a responder. Now, how do you get

1860
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,320
acromancia? Well, at the time uh there

1861
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,480
was no acromancia probiotics. Now, you

1862
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,320
can actually find acromancia probiotics,

1863
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,560
but but at the time this was coming out,

1864
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,199
you you had to grow your own acromancia,

1865
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,800
DIY acromancia. All right. So, how do

1866
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,320
you grow it? Well, it turns out that

1867
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,280
there are certain foods you can eat that

1868
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:25,360
grow acromancia. What are those foods?

1869
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,080
Pomegranate. Pomegranate juice.

1870
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,679
Pomegranate seeds will grow acromancia.

1871
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,600
Cranberries,

1872
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,520
uh, cranberry juice, dried cranberries

1873
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,480
will grow acromancia. Conquered grape

1874
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,159
juice or conquered grapes will grow

1875
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:41,520
acromancia. Chili peppers will actually

1876
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:43,440
grow acromancia. Chinese black vinegar.

1877
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,679
You ever go to dim sum and have soup

1878
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,440
dumplings? Oh yeah. The black vinegar

1879
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,600
sauce that they use for for as a

1880
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,840
condiment to the soup dumplings. Chinese

1881
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,159
black vinegar. That will prompt your

1882
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,520
body to grow acromancy as well. So, what

1883
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,199
is your diet of preference then? There's

1884
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,120
so many different diets that we've

1885
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:01,679
people speak about when they talk about

1886
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,840
cancer and other chronic diseases. Um,

1887
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,640
as I think I said to you beforehand, I'm

1888
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,400
on an extremely low carb diet, which is

1889
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,800
like VG is on keto, but I kind of bounce

1890
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,080
in and out of ketosis. What What do you

1891
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,159
think of Let's start with the the

1892
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,480
ketogenic diet. Do you have a view on on

1893
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:19,159
that kind of diet? Yeah. So, let me just

1894
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,280
give you my my perspective on

1895
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:24,320
diets. Lots of different diets out

1896
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,960
there. They're all designed uh with kind

1897
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,760
of a specific perspective and a

1898
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,280
particular goal in mind. Often times

1899
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,360
diet, whether you're talking about South

1900
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,880
Beach or keto or carnivore or vegan, you

1901
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,239
know, um they're all designed to achieve

1902
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,640
a certain kind of goal, uh most of them

1903
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:45,120
are very very difficult to maintain for

1904
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,520
a long period of time. Now people are

1905
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,120
vegans uh and vegetarians and they're

1906
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,640
that's something that because of the

1907
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,000
diversity of the food that you can you

1908
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,920
can actually maintain that but you know

1909
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,600
if you're only doing pure keto that's

1910
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:00,080
very difficult to do. So

1911
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,800
most popular trending diets are

1912
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,920
short-lived

1913
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,640
short-term solutions and they'll kind of

1914
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,880
force your body to do something all

1915
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,520
right but you can't keep it up. And so a

1916
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,880
diet that you can't keep up isn't to me

1917
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,000
a very practical diet because you're

1918
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:22,280
going to bursts of activity that you

1919
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:26,080
just can't do your whole life. I find

1920
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:29,040
that it's much more healthy in the long

1921
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:32,080
run if you can find a sustainable way of

1922
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,840
eating that works for you personally

1923
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,199
that you can maintain and that you're

1924
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,520
going to enjoy your life as well. Most

1925
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:39,679
people who are on really strict diets,

1926
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,679
they're not enjoying their diet, you

1927
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,320
know, like people who only eat meat,

1928
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:47,600
only eat carnivore diet or only eat raw

1929
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,199
food. Listen, you can't don't con me.

1930
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,600
You can't you can't be enjoying eating

1931
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:54,000
raw food, you know, your entire life,

1932
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,080
you know, navigating through society and

1933
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,760
seeing other people, you know, eat a big

1934
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,880
steaming plate of pasta or something,

1935
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,760
you know, or going to a Chinese

1936
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,400
restaurant. So, what I'm saying is that

1937
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,400
trending diets are well-intentioned. and

1938
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,000
they often are designed to do one thing,

1939
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,239
but you can't keep it up. So, it doesn't

1940
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,560
really at the end of the day contribute

1941
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:17,440
to the ultimate uh goal. What I prefer

1942
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,199
and where I think the science takes us

1943
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:23,040
where the next frontier for like

1944
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:25,120
lifetime health is tearing a page from

1945
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,199
the playbook of some of the healthiest

1946
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,239
cuisines in the world. And I would say

1947
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:32,719
Mediterranean is the hot bed, the

1948
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,480
crucible of a lot of healthy diets, not

1949
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,760
just the blue zones. might think but but

1950
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,560
there but there are blue zones in the

1951
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,239
Mediterranean also Asia uh there's a

1952
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,679
blue zone in Asia as well but you know

1953
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:43,520
look there's also a blue zone in Latin

1954
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,640
America if you take a look at the common

1955
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:50,600
denominator of what's going on in the

1956
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:54,719
Mediterranean and Asia is a very healthy

1957
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:57,760
plantforward fresh seasonal uh healthy

1958
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:00,560
cooking oils healthy preparation style

1959
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,480
absolutely delicious way of eating. I

1960
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,239
mean, come on. Take if I were to take

1961
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:07,360
you to a Mediterranean restaurant or to

1962
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:09,280
a Asian restaurant, I would find it hard

1963
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,640
to believe that you wouldn't, you and I

1964
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,880
opening a menu couldn't find something

1965
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,679
that we would enjoy eating. Right? So,

1966
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:19,280
Mediterranean is what how I tell people

1967
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:20,960
I actually eat. That's my quote diet.

1968
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,199
Why do the Japanese seem to do so well

1969
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,360
on when we think about the world's

1970
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:27,360
healthiest countries? Looking at some

1971
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,120
data here, some a variety of different

1972
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,880
graphs that I have in front of me. And

1973
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,920
Japan seems to continually seem to come

1974
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:37,159
out on top as it relates to health span.

1975
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,600
Yeah. Okay. Well, um there's no one

1976
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:42,560
single factor I think that was

1977
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:46,640
responsible for it, but it is true. Um

1978
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:49,520
the the Japanese uh demographics uh show

1979
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,600
uh consistently some of the uh oldest

1980
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,320
longest living people, you know, they

1981
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,920
tend first and foremost. Okay, before we

1982
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:59,800
talk about what they eat, let me tell

1983
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:02,320
you what they don't do. They don't

1984
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,520
overeat. And I'm giving a purposeful

1985
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:08,400
pause there because

1986
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:10,719
overeating, caloric loading, okay, uh is

1987
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:14,239
very damaging to our metabolism. It

1988
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:17,040
actually counters uh our ability for

1989
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:20,400
long to to live long. It actually speeds

1990
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:23,440
up our cellular aging. It's it it sets

1991
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:26,480
up inflammation. So, by cutting down on

1992
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,880
your caloric intake every day, that's

1993
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:32,120
one of the things is that the Japanese

1994
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:34,719
culture, the the the culinary and

1995
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:39,360
gastronomic approach to food in Japan

1996
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:41,920
tends to uh favor modesty. Uh uh uh

1997
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,760
undereating rather than overeating. I've

1998
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,920
got a question here. How do how do I

1999
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,760
know if I'm overeating?

2000
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,440
Okay. So, so there's a Confucian saying

2001
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,000
uh that's been translated into the

2002
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:57,360
Japanese that they that's a mantra which

2003
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,159
is harachi which means stop eating when

2004
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,880
you're 80% full. I asked this question

2005
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:04,719
because I have a friend who was I think

2006
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,000
it was on this podcast so um don't think

2007
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,320
I'm revealing anything. He actually sat

2008
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,560
next to me um when Peter was talking to

2009
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,760
him. He's Jack who um runs production

2010
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,080
for us. He had his DEXA scan done which

2011
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,600
looks at your visceral fat, subcutaneous

2012
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,280
fat, muscle mass, bone density, those

2013
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,440
kinds of things. Yeah. And he's a slim

2014
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:25,360
guy. He's much slimmer than I am.

2015
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,320
And the diagnosis that came back from

2016
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,600
the doctor basically said, "You're

2017
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,159
overnourished." And when I look at him,

2018
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,239
he doesn't look like someone that's

2019
01:18:31,159 --> 01:18:36,080
overnourished. And the the doctor

2020
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,600
essentially said to him that you need to

2021
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,199
reduce your calories. Now, I'm looking

2022
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,840
at this guy thinking, "This is a slim

2023
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:44,400
guy. This guy's like much much slimmer

2024
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,800
than I am, yet the doctor's telling him

2025
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,159
that he's overeating.

2026
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,840
Yeah. So, I wrote a whole book on this

2027
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,679
called Eat to Beat Your Diet, which is

2028
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:56,560
not a diet book. It's an anti-diet book

2029
01:18:51,679 --> 01:19:00,719
that really um uh uh unccloaks the new

2030
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:03,199
science of your metabolism. And what I

2031
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:07,199
try to say in terms of sharing that

2032
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:10,480
science is that first of all, body fat,

2033
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:12,880
which society is regarded as a bad

2034
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,600
thing. We don't nobody wants fat, right?

2035
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,360
Um is actually a good thing. Body fat's

2036
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,840
an organ in the body. Did you know that?

2037
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:22,080
Like it's it's one of our body organs.

2038
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,920
Um our body fat, it is distributed

2039
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,000
throughout our body. And what does it do

2040
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,480
as an organ? Well, it's got some

2041
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,760
cushioning effect. So, you know, like if

2042
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,360
you didn't have any body fat, by the

2043
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,000
way, you tripped on the stairs and you

2044
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,159
hit the ground, you might rupture your

2045
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
organs. All right, that's so that has a

2046
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:40,800
little bit of a cushion effect,

2047
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,400
marshmallowy cushion effect. But our fat

2048
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,679
also is a fuel tank to store fuel. So,

2049
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:49,840
when we're eating calories, our calories

2050
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,280
are our energy. We're eating food, we're

2051
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,280
eating calories. That's our energy.

2052
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,600
That's that's a fuel our body runs off

2053
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,719
of. I always tell people if you have a

2054
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,560
car and you're filling it up with

2055
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:01,199
gasoline at the petrol station or the

2056
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,000
gas station, um you don't even think

2057
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:05,920
about your gas until your fuel gauge

2058
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
starts to run low. And the same thing

2059
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,600
for our our our bodies is that we don't

2060
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,159
think about our fuel until we're hungry.

2061
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,280
And our our hunger in our brain and our

2062
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:16,320
gut is really as our fuel tank that

2063
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,640
signals, you know, we're getting towards

2064
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,960
that red line. Better go fill fill up.

2065
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:24,000
Now, unlike a gas station or petrol

2066
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,159
station, there's no clicker on our body.

2067
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,239
We can keep stuffing food into our

2068
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:31,199
system. We can very easily overload our

2069
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:32,960
fuel tank. Okay, that is you've got you

2070
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:35,440
got to cut back on your calories. That's

2071
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,719
what you your your friend heard when the

2072
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,000
doctor was saying you got to cut back on

2073
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,920
your calories because you're overloading

2074
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,640
on fuel. So, where does so where does

2075
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,800
the fat build up? It's there's different

2076
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:47,840
areas that fat in your body builds up.

2077
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,040
Now, the fat can there's white fat and

2078
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,800
there's uh uh uh brown fat. White fat

2079
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,560
can be under your chin, could be under

2080
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,239
your arms, could be in your thighs and

2081
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,719
your butt, could be your your the the

2082
01:20:56,239 --> 01:21:00,960
muffin top, you know, around your waist.

2083
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:04,000
But that's not where the most dangerous

2084
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,239
fat builds up. The most dangerous fat,

2085
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,199
inflammatory fat, is a fat that builds

2086
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:10,960
up in the inside the tube of your body.

2087
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:14,560
So if you think of your body like a

2088
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,960
poster tube, okay, inside that tube and

2089
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,880
all this gut is I'm sorry, the the body

2090
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,280
cavity, if you were to slice this body

2091
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,920
in half and look at a cross-section, all

2092
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,480
right, it's a tube. You can fill all you

2093
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,560
any of these uh interstitial areas

2094
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,159
between organs, you can pack with fat.

2095
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,679
So think about you're going to FedEx

2096
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:36,159
something to somebody overnight mail uh

2097
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,600
a vase or or a glass or bottle of wine

2098
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,719
or whatever. you're going to pack it

2099
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,159
full of peanuts and you're going to put

2100
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,679
it into a package. Well, look, you can

2101
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,199
get a big box and put a lot more peanuts

2102
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,640
on or you can take a skinny box that

2103
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,320
would just fit it and you'll put it in.

2104
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,640
So, it doesn't really matter the size of

2105
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,920
your tube. You could be a skinny person

2106
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,800
and you could pack it with a lot of

2107
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,960
peanuts. In this case, visceral fat. And

2108
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,960
that's what you're talking about in a

2109
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,880
skinny person with too much visceral

2110
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,360
fat, too many peanuts packed in there.

2111
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,840
And that is a result of overconumption

2112
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,080
of calories. that fat, that energy, the

2113
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,600
fuel tanks building up within a skinny

2114
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:11,440
body. Yeah. And that's what we call

2115
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:14,000
skinny fat. I am still like mildly in

2116
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:16,639
shock about it because because I saw his

2117
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,159
results, I I panicked. So the next day I

2118
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,639
also went to the same clinic as him. I

2119
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:24,560
had my Dexus stan scan done and it came

2120
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:26,960
back and said that I had quote zero

2121
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,760
visceral fat. So my results from Dr.

2122
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:33,199
Peter said I had zero visceral fat which

2123
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:35,840
he said was rare but I had subcutaneous

2124
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:38,960
fat which is the fat on the outside more

2125
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,520
than Jack did. So Jack had visceral fat,

2126
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,639
which is the fat inside us, and he had

2127
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,360
he has like almost no subcutaneous fat,

2128
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:49,440
and I'm kind of the inverse of that. And

2129
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,520
I don't what like I was trying to figure

2130
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,040
out why is my body when I eat something

2131
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,120
putting the fat subcutaneously on the

2132
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,280
outside, whereas Jack's body is putting

2133
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,199
the fat on the inside, which is the the

2134
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:03,520
dangerous fat. Here is um an interesting

2135
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,679
thing. Let's look at the opposite of

2136
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,360
building up subcutaneous fat, which is

2137
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,120
the external fat, not the not the

2138
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,120
danger, the external fat. Yeah. So,

2139
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:14,080
okay. So, there's two kinds of body fat.

2140
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:16,480
White fat and brown fat. White they're

2141
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,159
all good. They're all beneficial. Um,

2142
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,880
white fat can be subcutaneous.

2143
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,480
Subcutaneous means under the skin, under

2144
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,600
your jaw, under the skin of your jaw,

2145
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,480
under your arms, on your thighs. That's

2146
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,320
subcutaneous. White fat can also be

2147
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,560
visceral fat. That's deep inside the

2148
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,320
tube of your body. And then brown fat is

2149
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,440
not wiggly jiggly like the other like

2150
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:37,040
white fat. Brown fat is wafer thin and

2151
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,320
it's plastered around our neck. It's

2152
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,679
behind our breast bone, a little bit

2153
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,920
behind between our shoulder blades, a

2154
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:45,040
little bit in our belly. And brown fat

2155
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,120
actually is metabolically as a active

2156
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:50,000
and it fires up a process called

2157
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,480
thermogenesis to burn down harmful

2158
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,639
visceral extra body fat. So you can use

2159
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,199
good fat to burn down bad fat, which is

2160
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,960
the amazing thing. Again, fat is not

2161
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:02,960
universally bad. It's actually quite

2162
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:05,840
good. And uh so one of the things that I

2163
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,120
think is really important to know is

2164
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,280
that when you've got too much visceral

2165
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,600
fat, you got too much inflammation, but

2166
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,320
you can actually use your brown fat to

2167
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,239
try to um control that to try to burn it

2168
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,960
down. Brown fat, by the way, is

2169
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:20,719
activated by foods and activated by cold

2170
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,280
temperatures. So when you talk about

2171
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,440
your cold

2172
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:27,520
plunge, brown fat can actually light up.

2173
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,120
So, you you've just handed me a card.

2174
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:34,960
I'll describe this in which there's two

2175
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:36,440
pictures of a figure. And one of the uh

2176
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,040
pictured on the left is room

2177
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,400
temperature. And it's not cold. It's

2178
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,400
regular room temperature. And this is

2179
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,000
the same individual, by the way. And you

2180
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,800
can't see anything lighting up because

2181
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,880
the brown fat is just adjusted to normal

2182
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,159
room temperature. Now, on the right hand

2183
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,920
side is when you actually um lower the

2184
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:55,120
temperature in an ice bath or something.

2185
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,239
No, no. This is actually just lowering

2186
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,760
the room temperature. Really, really

2187
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,360
cold. Like a like a like a laboratory

2188
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,159
condition lowering the room temperature.

2189
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,920
And boom, you see all this brown fat

2190
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:05,760
lighting up. Remember I told you it's

2191
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,080
it's plastered around the neck, behind

2192
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,679
the breast bone, uh a little bit in your

2193
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:15,120
belly. And this is mother nature's

2194
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:16,960
adaptation in evolution to help animals

2195
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:20,639
survive cold temperatures. So before we

2196
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:22,880
had thermostats and room heaters, um uh

2197
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,360
uh think about a by the way, brown fat

2198
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:29,120
was discovered in hibernating animals.

2199
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:33,120
Um there was a zoologologist uh who was

2200
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:35,840
looking at plucked out a uh kind of a

2201
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,920
muskrat looking animal from hibernation

2202
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,040
and dissected it and found that there

2203
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,120
was this brown lump that was between its

2204
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,920
shoulder blades and nobody knew what it

2205
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,320
was. They just and the more researchers

2206
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,840
and biologists and zoologologists looked

2207
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,080
at animals that were hibernating, they

2208
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,000
they found this very consistently. In

2209
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,920
fact, they called that brown mass first

2210
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,320
a

2211
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,679
hibernoma. Hyper

2212
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:03,360
hibernating a mass we don't know what it

2213
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:03,360
does. Okay. um a

2214
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,320
hybrer who in the beginning we didn't

2215
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,960
have microscopes and then we had

2216
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:15,360
microscopes and we had really great

2217
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:18,480
microscopes and all of a sudden in 1930s

2218
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:20,639
the researcher uh at UCLA said you know

2219
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:24,320
that hibonoma is actually made of fat

2220
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:26,239
cells and those fat cells are brown and

2221
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,000
the reason they're brown is because they

2222
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:31,120
have a lot of mitochondria in it.

2223
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,800
Mitochondria being the fuel cells of our

2224
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,960
body, like they're the batteries of our

2225
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:37,000
body. They're packing the they're the

2226
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,560
energy generators in our cell. And

2227
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,719
mitochondria are very rich in iron. And

2228
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,159
when iron is oxidized, it turns brown

2229
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,480
like a pile of nails that you've put

2230
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,120
outside your door and the outdoors.

2231
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,800
Silver nails will turn

2232
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:53,280
brown. Brown fat packed with

2233
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,360
mitochondria, energy generating, packed

2234
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,920
with iron, oxidizes, turns brown. That's

2235
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:00,480
why brown fat is brown. And and so what

2236
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,960
happens is that in cold temperatures

2237
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,960
like in hibernation in winter, the brown

2238
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,480
fat fires up and that's what keep keeps

2239
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,440
these hibernating animals warm

2240
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,480
throughout the winter so they don't

2241
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:13,120
freeze to death. Now humans, we can

2242
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,840
actually use that to our advantage. We

2243
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:18,960
can actually activate our brown fat.

2244
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,800
Cold bath will do it. U sleeping in cold

2245
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,560
cooler warms will actually start to

2246
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,239
activate it as well. When that, by the

2247
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,159
way, that when those mitochondria fire

2248
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,840
up, they are burning energy. You know

2249
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:29,679
where they draw the energy from? From

2250
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,920
your white fat. From your visceral fat

2251
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,920
first. So you want brown fat, good fat

2252
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,840
to burn down bad fat, visceral fat,

2253
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,360
white fat. You want to sleep in a cool

2254
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,159
room or you want to go into a cold bath.

2255
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:43,120
And there are lots of foods that will

2256
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:46,320
also you can eat foods to activate your

2257
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:48,880
brown fat to burn down harmful fat. Um,

2258
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,639
and then the last thing is cortisol. the

2259
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,239
job that we have. I know this doesn't

2260
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,040
sound like a hard job to be a podcaster,

2261
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:56,639
but the in Jack's role, he's basically

2262
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,639
working seven days a week sometimes. You

2263
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,920
know, he's working early hours of the

2264
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,760
morning. He's traveling around the world

2265
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,840
with me to come to these studios. It is

2266
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,280
I observe it. It's a stressful job. So,

2267
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,120
I was wondering if these if all of these

2268
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,400
factors play a role in in how our body

2269
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,560
chooses where to store things. And

2270
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,400
really like the role of cortisol in

2271
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,639
determining fat storage is so

2272
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,159
interesting to me. like the role of

2273
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:19,920
stress in determining where our fat is

2274
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,639
stored.

2275
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,520
Yeah. Well, I mean cortisol is a stress

2276
01:28:21,639 --> 01:28:27,440
hormone. It actually snaps us into uh

2277
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,600
action. It actually is also healing.

2278
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,960
Cortisol is a got multiple job

2279
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,600
descriptions. It's kind of like a Swiss

2280
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:38,719
Army knife of hormones. Uh and uh in a

2281
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,400
in small bursts, cortisol incredible

2282
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,239
like and it makes you feel good as well.

2283
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:46,000
I mean it's a kind basically it's a it's

2284
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:48,400
a type of body steroid. So cortisol is a

2285
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,639
very very useful hormone for all kinds

2286
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:56,159
of reasons. But long-term stress uh will

2287
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:58,400
lead to excessive prolonged unabated

2288
01:28:56,159 --> 01:29:02,120
cortisol secretion. And when your

2289
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:04,880
cortisol levels are up up and and

2290
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,920
relentlessly that then actually changes

2291
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:11,120
your metabolism. It definitely alters

2292
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,199
your the ability for your fat to

2293
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,120
actually conduct its metabolism. I mean,

2294
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:17,920
fat releases itself about 15 different

2295
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,679
hormones. So, when you mess up the

2296
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,000
hormonal structure, the endocrine

2297
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,400
structure of your own body fat with

2298
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,239
something like excessive cortisol,

2299
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,159
you'll actually begin to derail your own

2300
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:30,159
metabolism. So, it's not the short-term

2301
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:31,760
cortisol, it's a long-term cortisol

2302
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:33,840
that's actually the most damaging. Why

2303
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,840
is visceral fat dangerous? Because

2304
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,360
people refer to it as being linked a lot

2305
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,880
of chronic disease and cancers and stuff

2306
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,960
like that, but what evidence do we have

2307
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,920
that it's dangerous? And what why is it

2308
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,520
dangerous? Yeah, because the tube of

2309
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,800
your body with all the organs packed

2310
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,239
into it, just like we're seeing here.

2311
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,159
Look at all these organs packed in. You

2312
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,840
got your liver, you got your stomach,

2313
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,560
you got your your colon and your small

2314
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,560
intestines that's packed into the tube.

2315
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,880
All right, it is it's it's kind of like

2316
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,560
uh packing for vacation. You know, some

2317
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,880
people are really really skilled at

2318
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,400
packing. They can actually uh fold their

2319
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,719
socks and underwear and their pants and

2320
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:09,199
it's like, oh my, you're a genius.

2321
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,840
You're you're packing genius right now.

2322
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:14,560
visceral fat grows between those folded

2323
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,960
shirts and pants and it and it fills all

2324
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,440
that space in there. When you have too

2325
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,080
much of it, not only does it fill up

2326
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,840
that the suitcase of your body, the tube

2327
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,080
of your body, but it starts to push on

2328
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,159
organs, which is not healthy because

2329
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,239
it's all packing inside the between the

2330
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,920
spaces, the potential spaces in there.

2331
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,360
And then when they grow, when it grows

2332
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,920
beyond its own blood supply, the

2333
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:37,280
visceral fat um starts to starve. It

2334
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,280
becomes hypoxic, meaning it's not

2335
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,400
getting enough oxygen. bigger than the

2336
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:43,280
amount of blood vessels that are growing

2337
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:46,639
in there. And now you've got the center

2338
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:48,880
of the fat star of oxygen. Uh the

2339
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,880
inflammatory cells start moving in. And

2340
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,120
now you've got this fat that's outgrown

2341
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,639
its own blood supply that's now becoming

2342
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,040
very inflammatory. And because it's

2343
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,719
packed all throughout your the tube of

2344
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,639
your body into the suitcase of your

2345
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,159
body, it's leaking out that inflammation

2346
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,560
everywhere. So, think about it like if

2347
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,760
you have a neatly packed suitcase and

2348
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,280
you're like, I'm, you know, I'm going to

2349
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:11,280
put um I'm going to put some uh uh

2350
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,639
lotion and cream, canisters of lotion

2351
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,880
and cream. I'm going to pack it

2352
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:18,080
everywhere in in between the spaces.

2353
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,520
Okay, look uh Stephen, pack a few, but

2354
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,960
but let's stop right there. And you're

2355
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,120
no, I'm going to pack like 20 or 30 of

2356
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,360
them. And you keep on stuffing it. Even

2357
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:27,520
though the suitcase it's a hard suitcase

2358
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,360
and you can you can put a lot in there.

2359
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,480
Now, you're starting to press on the the

2360
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,400
clothing. you're going to scrunch up

2361
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,800
your pants. And here in the body, you're

2362
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,520
scrunching up your organs. Now, why

2363
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,440
don't we make those one of those tubes

2364
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:43,520
uh uh of of cream. Let's break one of

2365
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,960
them open. Now, it's leaking. All right?

2366
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,679
And that's what's happening when your

2367
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,760
fat is so inflame so inflamed, it starts

2368
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,960
to leak, inflammation. Now, imagine that

2369
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,440
that cream uh starts to leak out into

2370
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,760
the interstites of your suitcase. Now,

2371
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,960
you've got a suitcase. Looks skinny on

2372
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,639
the outside. It looks like it just looks

2373
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,040
like a suitcase. It's a could be a

2374
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,199
carry-on. But now all the organs, all

2375
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:08,080
the clothes you packed so neatly are

2376
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:10,320
squeezed and scrunched off and now the

2377
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,440
lotion is leaking everywhere. That is

2378
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:16,000
the analogy of excess body fat in a

2379
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,840
small container spreading out

2380
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
compressing the organs and leaking out

2381
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,159
and that's why it's dangerous. Oh gosh.

2382
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,719
And that there's a link there to cancer.

2383
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:28,360
Yeah. So studies have actually shown

2384
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:31,600
that and this was a study uh done uh by

2385
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:35,679
Cornell in New York um looking at

2386
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:38,480
Swedish women who were normal body size

2387
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,080
or skinny. So you've heard of skinny

2388
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:43,440
fat. This is what they were studying.

2389
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:46,239
And they looked at these women uh to see

2390
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,800
they did DEEXA scans as you described um

2391
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:51,199
to see how much body fat they had. And

2392
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:54,400
then they followed them over 13 years

2393
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:57,440
and they actually found that women who

2394
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:59,600
did not have extra body fat had you know

2395
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:02,239
normal risk of breast cancer but women

2396
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,639
who had skinny fat remember all the

2397
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:07,440
women in the study and so 3,000 women

2398
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:09,040
actually were normal body size not I

2399
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,040
mean they weren't super models but they

2400
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,440
were they were just normalsized women

2401
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,280
some of them were slimmer than others

2402
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:18,239
but none of them were obese none of them

2403
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,719
were overweight u just normal size Um

2404
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:23,040
and they but they knew at the b baseline

2405
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:26,159
what the DEXA scan showed and what they

2406
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:29,199
found is that women who had excess body

2407
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:31,120
fat over the period of 13 years had a

2408
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:33,679
three-fold increase in the risk of

2409
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,760
developing breast cancer and it's linked

2410
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,280
to higher met inflammatory markers in

2411
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,520
their bloodstream which makes total

2412
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,440
sense. The leaking body cream, the

2413
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,440
leaking inflammation, you know, in a

2414
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:45,280
skinny tube, all right, or normalized

2415
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,199
tube, normal suitcase. Look, the

2416
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,520
suitcase can't expand bigger. It's it's

2417
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:52,800
got a finite size um but it's leaking

2418
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:55,040
out and and this is because cancer

2419
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,040
thrives in an inflammatory environment.

2420
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,480
If you have inflammation without even a

2421
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:01,920
microscopic cancer like we talked about

2422
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:04,159
but a small tumor putting inflammation

2423
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,000
in the environment of a cancer is like

2424
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:08,000
pouring gasoline on the embers of a

2425
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,920
fire. You ever go camping, you have a

2426
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,760
campfire, it's almost out at the very

2427
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,880
end. Now if you pour some gasoline it

2428
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,040
boom whoosh you're going to have to

2429
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,199
create a bonfire all over again. That's

2430
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,760
how dangerous inflammation is. So that's

2431
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:22,159
why excess visceral fat, inflammatory

2432
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,360
fat, is so dangerous and linked to

2433
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:25,600
cancer. And by the way, not just breast

2434
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:29,840
cancer. Turns out that excess visceral

2435
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,440
fat has been linked to 14 other cancers.

2436
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,320
Increased risk of 14 other cancers.

2437
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:38,320
Everything from colon, ovarian, lung,

2438
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:42,080
breast, prostate. Uh it it's the it's a

2439
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:44,800
it's a growing list of cancers that seem

2440
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:48,000
to be at put you would be at higher risk

2441
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,600
if you had high levels of visceral fat.

2442
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And it makes total sense given the

2443
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,239
inflammation. Don't you hate it when you

2444
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,600
have a good idea and then you forget?

2445
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:57,360
For the last two years, I've been

2446
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,960
writing my brand new book. And my book

2447
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,400
writing process is a little bit atypical

2448
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,400
in the sense that I have all of these

2449
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,400
great conversations on the diio. And I

2450
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,920
might stumble across a great idea while

2451
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,920
my guest is speaking to me in the middle

2452
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,080
of a conversation. Or I could be walking

2453
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,320
the dog. I could be out and about with

2454
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,560
my friends. I could be anywhere when I

2455
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,639
have an idea for my upcoming book. This

2456
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,000
is why notion, who are a show sponsor of

2457
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,400
mine now, has been an incredible

2458
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
platform for me. I've designed my notion

2459
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,320
so that I can pull out my phone super

2460
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,320
quickly and store the idea in the

2461
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,719
section about my new book and I can

2462
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:31,360
collect pictures, images, voice notes,

2463
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:33,120
any type of media on the go, which means

2464
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,360
I'm able to capture that point of

2465
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,520
inspiration in a flexible way and I'm no

2466
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,800
longer losing good ideas. I imagine many

2467
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,560
of the creatives and entrepreneurs

2468
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,159
listening to my podcast already use

2469
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,280
Notion. But if you want to try out

2470
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,639
Notion and you've never used it

2471
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:48,960
yourself, head over to

2472
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:48,960
notion.com/doac. That's

2473
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:55,040
notion.com/doac. There was a a shocking

2474
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,840
study that I read about this a while ago

2475
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:59,920
in JAMAMA and it examined the impact of

2476
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:04,960
illness anxiety disorder which they call

2477
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:07,679
I a formerly known as hypochondriitis

2478
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,440
and the impact that being avoidant of

2479
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,360
health and illness has on your mortality

2480
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:13,280
rates. And they the researcher analyzed

2481
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:15,600
data from approximately 45,000

2482
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,920
individuals over a 24-year period

2483
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,360
comparing 4,000 patients who had this

2484
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,600
anxiety around their health and were

2485
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,320
avoidant. And the findings showed that

2486
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,400
those with IAD that were anxious about

2487
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,880
health and getting checkups and those

2488
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:31,199
kinds of things had an 84% higher risk

2489
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,880
of death during the study period, dying

2490
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,920
on average 5 years earlier than those

2491
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,199
without the disorder. And again,

2492
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,320
causation is hard to establish there

2493
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,159
because it could mean that being an

2494
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,600
anxious person means your cortisol's up

2495
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,000
anyway. being an anxious person means

2496
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,360
you make worse dietary choices. But I

2497
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,199
I've always remembered that and thought

2498
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:48,560
about how

2499
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:49,840
um how it's I find it much more much

2500
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,360
better, especially as I age and I'm

2501
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,199
going to be now confronted with more

2502
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:56,800
risks, especially things in men like

2503
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:59,600
prostate cancer. Being on the front foot

2504
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,360
um is probably a better approach. Well,

2505
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,440
uh and if you take some proactive

2506
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:05,199
approaches using food as medicine where

2507
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,280
you got to eat three, you know, you got

2508
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:08,800
to eat every day. Most most of most

2509
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,480
people eat three times a day. Most

2510
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,080
people encounter food about five times a

2511
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:14,239
day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a

2512
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:17,000
couple of snacks. If you realize every

2513
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:20,400
time you're encountering food is an

2514
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
opportunity, an opportunity to choose a

2515
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,360
food, an ingredient that actually

2516
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,199
supports raises your shields, supports

2517
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,280
your health defense systems. and know

2518
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:30,880
that and trust your body, trust your

2519
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,719
health defense systems that if you raise

2520
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,400
your shields, you're less likely to

2521
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:38,320
actually have uh have problems later

2522
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,080
won't eliminate them. Okay? There's no

2523
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,560
guarantees in life, but it'll lower the

2524
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,880
risk. Here's an example. Um Stephen, you

2525
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,800
know, research studies have shown that

2526
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,480
tomatoes are good for overall um health.

2527
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,119
You mentioned prostate cancer. So

2528
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:55,360
studies have shown that uh men who eat

2529
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:57,760
tomatoes regularly, cooked tomatoes,

2530
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,920
actually have a 29% lower risk of

2531
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:03,199
developing prostate cancer. It's pretty

2532
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,480
good. Uh what's the dose of the tomatoes

2533
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:07,360
that you need to cook tomatoes you need

2534
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,840
to eat? Two to three servings per week.

2535
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:12,080
All right, I can probably I can probably

2536
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,440
accomplish that. How much each time do I

2537
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:17,199
got to eat a wheelbarrow of tomatoes

2538
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:19,920
each time? No. the the typical serving

2539
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:22,080
that this study supports is just half a

2540
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,679
cup of tomato cooked tomatoes is per

2541
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,199
serving. How do they know this stuff?

2542
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,400
Because obviously how do they isolate

2543
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:30,480
that in a test? So these are from

2544
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:33,679
largecale population studies. In this

2545
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:36,239
case it's a it's a uh epidemiological

2546
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,920
study called a uh health professionals

2547
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:39,360
follow-up study where they looked at

2548
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,440
they developed hypotheses and they

2549
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,600
looked at outcomes over the course of 25

2550
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,840
years and they looked for statistical

2551
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,520
correlations. So they found that um

2552
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,280
tomatoes lowered the risk of prostate

2553
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,360
cancer based on people reporting their

2554
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:53,199
tomato eating. Then they actually went

2555
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,960
back and look at the report within the

2556
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:57,600
data collected. How much how much do

2557
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,119
they eat on average every week? So that

2558
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:02,400
then you can actually back calculate the

2559
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:03,920
dose. All right. Now I I told you

2560
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,440
earlier about the way that I do research

2561
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,360
foods and medicine research. Let's take

2562
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:11,360
it further. Let's figure out what's in a

2563
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:14,800
tomato. Well, tomatoes have lots of it's

2564
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:17,360
got it's got sugar. It's got uh some

2565
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:20,080
salt. It's got uh carotenoids which are

2566
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:22,719
bioactives. One of which is lycopine.

2567
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,280
Well, okay. What does lycopine do? Guess

2568
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:29,480
what lycopine does? Lycopine in the lab

2569
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:31,360
will cut off the blood supply to tumors.

2570
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,520
Anti-androenesis shores up your health

2571
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:36,320
defense systems. Prevents cancer from

2572
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:38,960
getting a blood supply. And in fact in

2573
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:43,360
correlative studies um uh they've

2574
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:46,320
actually taken the prostate cancer

2575
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:48,880
biopsies of men who did not avoid

2576
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,880
prostate uh cancer. So they were tomato

2577
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,880
eaters who went on to develop prostate

2578
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,880
cancer anyway. There's no nothing takes

2579
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,400
you versus zero. And they looked at them

2580
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,600
and what they found is that those men

2581
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:02,159
who ate more tomatoes had fewer blood

2582
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,360
vessels in their prostate cancer and the

2583
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:06,400
prostate cancers were also less

2584
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:08,960
aggressive. So people who ate four times

2585
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,719
and five times and six times had fewer

2586
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,560
and less aggressive blood vessels

2587
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,440
growing into their prostate cancer. So

2588
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:17,400
that's an example where you know if I

2589
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:20,880
told you

2590
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:22,880
um consider having some cooked tomatoes

2591
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,360
a few times a week and you don't need a

2592
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,440
lot. Even half a cup is enough. Oh, why

2593
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:31,040
cooked tomatoes? Well, because it turns

2594
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:33,840
out lycopine is uh a natural chemical

2595
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:35,560
that in its native form, pick a tomato

2596
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,400
off the vine and eat it that like an

2597
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:41,239
apple, it's absorbed in your body, but

2598
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:43,920
not avidly, not as much as

2599
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:46,159
possible. Um, what is that? That is

2600
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,159
coffee. Okay. And we've been talking a

2601
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:50,000
little bit about brown fat. Yeah. Is

2602
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,040
there a link between fat and coffee?

2603
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,400
Because I heard someone the other day

2604
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,760
saying that if you want to lose weight,

2605
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:57,840
drink coffee. And I wasn't sure if that

2606
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:59,520
was well. So coffee is a beverage made

2607
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,000
with coffee beans. Coffee beans are

2608
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,360
plant-based foods. Coffee beans contain

2609
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,760
many polyphenols including chlorogenic

2610
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:08,960
acid. Chlorogenic acid is

2611
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:12,159
anti-inflammatory. Chlorogenic acid also

2612
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:14,320
turns on your brown fat. So it activates

2613
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:16,000
it triggers your brown fat and it causes

2614
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,560
your brown fat the mitochondria to fire

2615
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,440
up undergo thermogenesis to burn down

2616
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,920
harmful white fat or visceral fat. So

2617
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,199
cup of coffee a day or actually the dose

2618
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,679
is actually about three to four cups of

2619
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:30,800
coffee a day will definitely cause your

2620
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:32,800
brown fat, good fat to burn down your

2621
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:35,760
bad fat, your harmful fat, your visceral

2622
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,520
fat. What about fasting?

2623
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,000
People people often talk about fasting

2624
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,199
as a as an intervention as a form of

2625
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,040
medicine for the body. And I wondered if

2626
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:45,520
you had a take on that. Yeah, f listen

2627
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:47,440
fasting is beneficial. Fasting is good

2628
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,440
and fasting is very old. It's not just a

2629
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,960
recent trend. uh if you go back

2630
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,800
thousands of years, I mean if you look

2631
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,480
at some of mo some of the oldest

2632
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,400
religions of the world, fasting was part

2633
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,320
of their ritual that would happen, you

2634
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,600
know, throughout the year. Now, people

2635
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,080
go, "Well, what about intermittent

2636
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,520
fasting? How long should I fast?" I try

2637
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:07,119
to tell people there is no

2638
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:08,719
magic formula for success for fasting

2639
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:10,159
because we're all different and our

2640
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,800
bodies are different. Our lifestyles are

2641
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:14,480
different. There's no universal fasting

2642
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,159
protocol that's going to be

2643
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,960
one-sizefits-all. However, I will tell

2644
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:21,440
you an easy way to fast because fasting

2645
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,840
is very natural to us is just paying

2646
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:27,760
attention to what you do every day and

2647
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:30,000
be mindful. So, when you're sleeping,

2648
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,320
you're not eating. When you're not

2649
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,440
eating, you're fasting. So, I try to be

2650
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,960
reassuring. So, guess what? You're

2651
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,440
fasting every day anyway. When you fall

2652
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,360
asleep, you're fasting. All right? And

2653
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:42,320
the longer you're not eating and

2654
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,719
sleeping, the more time your metabolism,

2655
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:46,960
the Ferrari of your of your metabolism

2656
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:49,679
of your body can switch gears to burn

2657
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,360
down any extra fat that's accumulated.

2658
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,360
Now, if you've been eating whatever you

2659
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:56,239
want over time, you probably built up a

2660
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:58,239
lot of extra fat. Now, from your scans,

2661
01:42:56,239 --> 01:43:00,719
apparently not. You don't have too much.

2662
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:02,320
All right? But you if you you're fasting

2663
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:05,840
regularly, you're burning down all that

2664
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:08,480
extra stuff. Okay? And so then how do

2665
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:11,360
you optimize that without having to

2666
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:14,719
calendarize your fast and figure out,

2667
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,320
you know, how to uh schedule your meals?

2668
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:20,639
I try to make things

2669
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:22,320
um as scientific but as practical as

2670
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,960
possible. And so I tell people you want

2671
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:26,400
to really get involved in intermittent

2672
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,639
fasting. Easiest way is take advantage

2673
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,960
of what you're doing already. And that

2674
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,040
is if you're sleeping, try to sleep

2675
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,719
eight hours a day. So, how do you sleep

2676
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,080
eight hours a day? I don't know. I said

2677
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:37,679
if you go to bed at 11 o'clock, get up

2678
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,440
at 7 o'clock, you get to eight hours of

2679
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,280
sleep. All right, we know that that's

2680
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:43,360
the med the sweet spot for your brain,

2681
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,960
for your metabolism, for you know, for

2682
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,800
burning out harmful body fat. How do you

2683
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:50,159
get more out of that? How do you turn

2684
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:52,920
that eight hours of fasting into more?

2685
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:55,440
Well, what I say is that the night

2686
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,920
before when you're eating dinner, let's

2687
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,000
say you eat from 7 to 8 o'clock in the

2688
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,920
evening, what I say is that when you

2689
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,480
finish dinner and you put your dishes

2690
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:08,239
away in the sink or in the dishwasher,

2691
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:11,040
that's it. No more eating. Stop eating.

2692
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:12,000
Nothing until the next day. Um, if

2693
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,480
you're going to have dessert or

2694
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,320
whatever, squeeze it in there. Don't

2695
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:18,880
take a snack with you and sit by the

2696
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:21,040
television or, you know, absent minily

2697
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:23,600
gobble food and don't before you be you

2698
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,320
go to bed eat a big chunk of whatever.

2699
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,400
Okay, now you got 3 hours before you go

2700
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,639
to bed at 11. Again, this is all a

2701
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:33,440
theoretical model. 3 hours of not

2702
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:35,440
eating. Your blood sugar goes down. Your

2703
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:37,199
your insulin goes down because your

2704
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,800
blood you're not eating anymore. All

2705
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:41,600
right. Now, your metabolism shifts gears

2706
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:44,400
three hours earlier. Okay. Now you've

2707
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:47,199
got those eight hours plus three hours,

2708
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:49,040
you got 11 hours. Now when you get up in

2709
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:51,280
the morning, okay, let's say you get up

2710
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,040
at seven in the morning, don't do what

2711
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:55,199
our moms told us to do, right? So when

2712
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,040
if you were like me growing up, my mom

2713
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:58,480
when I got up like hurry up and get to

2714
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,760
breakfast and eat something so you have

2715
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,520
enough energy to actually go to school

2716
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,520
and learn something. All right? So

2717
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,880
that's I I developed this instinct of

2718
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,639
actually just getting up and eating as

2719
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,400
quickly as I can, getting some breakfast

2720
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:12,000
in. What if I told you that what I do

2721
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,679
now when I get up in the morning, I

2722
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,320
deliberately don't do what my mother

2723
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,760
told me to do. I get up, I take my time

2724
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:21,440
getting ready, uh, I get dressed. Um, I

2725
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,040
don't eat anything right away. In fact,

2726
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,960
if I'm dressed and I'm ready for the

2727
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,480
day, I might go check it out. I might go

2728
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,880
outside and take a look at the outside.

2729
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,880
I might go for a quick walk or check my

2730
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,360
emails or I might read a chapter of a

2731
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,480
book or read a few pages of a book. I

2732
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:38,719
wait at least an hour before I eat

2733
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:41,760
anything. Now, let's do the math. Uh,

2734
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:44,159
Stephen, 8:00, stop eating. 11 o'clock,

2735
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,400
go to bed. 3 hours. 11 to 7, 8 hours. 3

2736
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:48,080
plus 8 is equal to 11 hours. I got 11

2737
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:50,639
hours of fasting. Now, I get up and I

2738
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,679
don't eat for another hour. Boom. 12

2739
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,880
hours of fasting. Just like that. Okay.

2740
01:45:53,679 --> 01:46:00,560
Now, if you really want to do that

2741
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:02,719
16hour fasting, 168, just skip breakfast

2742
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,119
and get to lunch. And as long as you

2743
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:07,520
don't overeat at lunch, which does

2744
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:09,840
require a little discipline after you go

2745
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,040
for your fasting window that you don't

2746
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,280
overeat and you're eating the right

2747
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,800
foods, that's how you actually get to do

2748
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,560
intermittent fasting in the most natural

2749
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,920
way possible. So, there's one part of

2750
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:21,280
the body that we haven't talked about,

2751
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:23,840
which is and my little mannequin here

2752
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,119
inside its head, the brain. And I'm

2753
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:27,119
wondering how some of the themes we've

2754
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:28,719
talked about link to one of the most

2755
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,000
common brain diseases which people talk

2756
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,080
about, which is Alzheimer's and

2757
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,360
dementia. talked about I can't say that

2758
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,480
long word but um

2759
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:38,800
angiogenesis is there a link between

2760
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:42,800
angioenesis what we in the brain health

2761
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:45,040
dementia Alzheimer's yeah absolutely so

2762
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,760
I mentioned to you that the human body

2763
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,520
has got 60,000 miles worth of blood

2764
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,239
vessels that are coursing through the

2765
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:53,520
entire body bringing the uh oxygen and

2766
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:57,360
nutrients through the highways and

2767
01:46:53,520 --> 01:47:00,080
byways of health right 400 miles of

2768
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:01,920
those blood vessels are in your brain

2769
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,679
400 miles of blood vessels are actually

2770
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,560
coursing through our brain. And our

2771
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:08,880
brain is super metabolically active. You

2772
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,679
know, we're we're the engine of the

2773
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,520
brain is functioning all the time.

2774
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,440
Regardless of your IQ, regardless of

2775
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,119
what type of task you do, our brain is

2776
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:19,840
very very metabolically active, highly

2777
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:24,000
dependent upon a healthy circulation.

2778
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:28,000
Now, what we do know as people get older

2779
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:30,719
is that problems can occur with uh brain

2780
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,760
function. And the reason I'm framing it

2781
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:36,080
this way is that it's quick to jump to a

2782
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,400
term that people use like dementia or

2783
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:40,560
Alzheimer's disease thinking it's one

2784
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:43,679
thing, but in fact, dementia is just a

2785
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,000
descriptive term for your cognition not

2786
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:47,440
working

2787
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,480
properly most commonly as you actually

2788
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:52,480
age. Alzheimer's, even though it is one

2789
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,960
type of diagnosis, is probably several

2790
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,639
different kinds of disease as well. And

2791
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,239
we do know that there are different

2792
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:00,960
types of dementia. Alzheimer's is a

2793
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:02,719
subset of dement of dementia,

2794
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,239
Alzheimer's dementia. There's there's a

2795
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,960
more common type of dementia called

2796
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:09,520
vascular dementia and that's where those

2797
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:12,320
400 miles of blood vessels in your body

2798
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,400
actually narrow, get hard, get clogged

2799
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:16,320
up, and don't have good blood flow. So,

2800
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,920
you can imagine if you were to actually

2801
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,159
interrupt the sprinkler system, the

2802
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,960
tubing, the blood vessels, the

2803
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:25,840
tributaries bringing oxygen to your

2804
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,040
brain within those blood vessels. Okay?

2805
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,719
over time your brain is not going to

2806
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:31,040
function very well. So vascular dementia

2807
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:34,320
is is by far the more common type of

2808
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:36,880
dementia. So what can we do to maintain

2809
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,320
healthy andogenic blood vessels

2810
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,480
throughout the course of our lives for

2811
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:42,159
anybody who wants aspires towards

2812
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:45,360
longevity. All right, you should be

2813
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:47,760
thinking about how to avert that path

2814
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,280
where your blood circula your blood

2815
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:54,080
vessels your circulation to your brain

2816
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:56,719
gets impaired. the more uh vascular,

2817
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:59,280
blood vessel healthy, androgenesis

2818
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,639
supporting diet and lifestyle and

2819
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,480
medications that you take, the better

2820
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,080
it's actually going to be. Now, here's

2821
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:06,600
what what's interesting. What are some

2822
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,679
of those things? Turns out that dark

2823
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:12,360
chocolate, plant-based foods, the cacao,

2824
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:15,199
actually um produces helps your body

2825
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:18,159
produce something called nitric oxide.

2826
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:21,280
Nitric oxide actually widens your blood

2827
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:23,199
vessels so you get better blood flow. So

2828
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,840
dark chocolate is one of those foods

2829
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:28,159
that actually can see seems to be able

2830
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:30,239
to promote better vascular health

2831
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:31,679
including in the brain. Now there are

2832
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:34,719
other foods that can produce nitric

2833
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:37,119
oxide as well. Beets beetroot actually

2834
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:40,159
can produce nitric oxide. Spinach can do

2835
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:41,840
produce nitric oxide as well. Those are

2836
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:44,080
vascular healthy. Now here's the other

2837
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,760
thing. When you produce nitric oxide,

2838
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:48,679
like with these foods, you know what

2839
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:51,199
nitric oxide does? It recruits stem

2840
01:49:48,679 --> 01:49:53,280
cells, healthy stem cells, not cancer

2841
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:55,679
stem cells, but healthy stem cells from

2842
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:58,239
your bone marrow. Stem cells are stem

2843
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,400
cells are primitive cells that can turn

2844
01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:03,520
into anything you need them to be. Turn

2845
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:06,000
into a brain, heart, lung, liver, skin,

2846
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:08,480
hair. Um, our stem cells actually

2847
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,679
regenerate us from the inside out. Now,

2848
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,440
you know that one of the things that

2849
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,440
happens as we get older is our brain

2850
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:16,480
atrophies and can start to degenerate.

2851
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:18,800
It shrinks. Literally, a scan of an

2852
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:20,560
older person, the brain, the brain

2853
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,040
matter, the mass of the brain shrinks

2854
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,360
inside the skull. It's like a like a

2855
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:28,080
cotton shirt that shrank and you see

2856
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:30,080
this actually in a scan. And so in order

2857
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,199
to be able to try to keep the shrinking

2858
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,280
from happening, you want to make sure

2859
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:35,280
there's good blood flow going, which

2860
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,960
actually helps to keep the brain growing

2861
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:40,239
in a healthy and maintained in a healthy

2862
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:42,480
sort of way. So um stem cells that are

2863
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:44,080
recruited by nitric oxide actually can

2864
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,840
help to also regenerate the blood

2865
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,360
vessels and keep the blood vessels

2866
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,080
helping healthy feeding the brain.

2867
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,800
That's the connection between

2868
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,880
Alzheimer's and and I mean dementia and

2869
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:55,159
now for Alzheimer's

2870
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:58,480
um I worked with a colleague Dr. Anthony

2871
01:50:55,159 --> 01:51:01,280
Vagnucci some years ago and we published

2872
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:04,000
uh what was then an editorial in the

2873
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:06,960
Lancet uh you know very prestigious uh

2874
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,719
British medical publication and we were

2875
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,880
connecting the dots between androgenesis

2876
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,360
and Alzheimer's disease and here's how

2877
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,639
it works most people assume that if

2878
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,560
you've got Alzheimer's disease or

2879
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:17,920
someone has Alzheimer's disease they

2880
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,440
don't have very good blood flow they're

2881
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,199
not going to have a lot of androgenesis

2882
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:24,080
they got problems right of their of

2883
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:27,119
their circulation of course and in fact

2884
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:29,440
if If you look at um the blood flow

2885
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:31,840
studies, scans, brain scans looking for

2886
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,760
blood flow in Alzheimer's brain. Indeed,

2887
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,159
you

2888
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:39,360
see poorer blood flow in people who have

2889
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:42,080
actually Alzheimer's disease. But it

2890
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,960
turns out the brains of people with

2891
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:46,400
Alzheimer's disease have more blood

2892
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:49,360
vessels, more blood vessels that aren't

2893
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:50,960
working well. So their andro abnormal

2894
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,800
androgenic blood vessels are not working

2895
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,280
well. So you don't get good blood flow.

2896
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,920
So the scans don't show them just don't

2897
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:59,520
creating blood flow. Guess what those

2898
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,920
blood vessels are doing? Those abnormal

2899
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:06,639
blood vessels, they have been discovered

2900
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:10,480
to secrete a neurotoxin that kills your

2901
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:12,719
brain cells. So abnormal androenesis in

2902
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:15,280
Alzheimer's disease grows blood vessels

2903
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,360
that don't create blood flow, but they

2904
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:19,360
secrete a toxin that kills brain cells

2905
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,920
and they also secrete the precursor to

2906
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,920
build up the plaque. So, uh, we we

2907
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,599
published this as a as a hypothesis and

2908
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,119
an editorial in the Lancet and now

2909
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,800
there's a whole field looking at

2910
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:30,719
androgenesis and and Alzheimer's

2911
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:34,719
disease. It's crazy how this all stems

2912
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:36,880
back to this idea that food is medicine.

2913
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:38,440
Yeah. I mean, listen, before we had

2914
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,040
medicine as medicine, before we had

2915
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:43,840
pharmaceuticals in the 1930s, it's all

2916
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,840
we had. That's all humans had our diet

2917
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,239
and lifestyle for medicines, you know.

2918
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:51,440
And so I think that that's really I

2919
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:55,199
think what's happened is that in during

2920
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:57,159
the industrial revolution that occurred

2921
01:52:55,199 --> 01:53:00,880
with pharmaceuticals,

2922
01:52:57,159 --> 01:53:02,159
we put aside a tool in the toolbox that

2923
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,719
we've always had. In fact, that's the

2924
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:06,880
only thing we had before. And we focused

2925
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,159
myopically just on what pharmaceuticals

2926
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,400
can do. Now, I'm telling you, as

2927
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:12,400
somebody who has developed

2928
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:15,119
biioharmaceuticals and who is still very

2929
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,040
much involved in that, new medicines can

2930
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:18,480
be life-saving. Old medicines can be

2931
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,840
life-saving. And so, you never want to

2932
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,080
throw out the baby with a bath water.

2933
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,760
What we have forgotten about is that

2934
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,679
tool in the toolbox. It's been with

2935
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,080
humanity forever, which is what we do

2936
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:31,199
with our food. And and what I'm saying

2937
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:33,040
is that what we can do now with the work

2938
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:35,960
that I'm doing in food is medicine. We

2939
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:40,080
can take the modern science that deep

2940
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:42,080
probe that ex extraordinary level of

2941
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,800
sophistication that we use for drug

2942
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:47,840
development and we can use it apply it

2943
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,920
to understand why our foods help us

2944
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,760
which foods help us and what types of

2945
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,080
outcomes we're actually looking for. And

2946
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,840
so food is medicine. Bringing it back

2947
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:58,400
into the fold is just replacing a tool

2948
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:00,360
in the toolbox. But now we are actually

2949
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:03,679
fortifying it with the

2950
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:06,520
knowledge provided by science of what we

2951
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:08,239
should choose and when and why.

2952
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:09,679
Supplementation. Are you a fan of

2953
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,880
supplementation? Because I take a couple

2954
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:13,679
of supplements every morning. Things

2955
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:15,679
like creatine and omega-3 and vitamin D.

2956
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:20,159
Do you take supplements? Yep. Yes, I do.

2957
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:23,920
And I I'll I'll first say um my my first

2958
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:26,239
off approach is that uh we should get

2959
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:29,040
most of the micronutrients that we need

2960
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:32,000
to be healthy from our food. Use your

2961
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:34,400
food uh to our advantage because uh

2962
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,719
single foods will have hundreds of

2963
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,239
different uh polyphenols and fiber and

2964
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:41,440
all kinds of other beneficial things. So

2965
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:44,480
and and vitamins and minerals. So, our

2966
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:47,199
food is a much more efficient way to get

2967
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:50,400
all of our micronutrients. However,

2968
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:51,920
supplements can be helpful in the

2969
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:55,360
literal translation of the world,

2970
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:56,800
supplement, which means topping off. So,

2971
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,639
if you can't get everything that you

2972
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,920
need from your food, then feel free to

2973
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:02,639
top it off. And that's what I actually

2974
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,719
do as well. But vitamin D, vitamin D, I

2975
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,440
do it as well. Omega-3 fatty acids,

2976
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:09,679
another good uh top off uh to actually

2977
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:13,599
use for a supplement. And by the way,

2978
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:16,080
there are some probiotics that um I feel

2979
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,320
that it's prudent to actually get have

2980
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:19,360
in my body. So I'm not giving a general

2981
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,840
recommendation. I'm just telling you

2982
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:23,920
what I do, right? That's what we're

2983
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,920
talking about. Everything's personal.

2984
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,920
It's personal to them. But I, you know,

2985
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,199
we talked earlier about the acromancia,

2986
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,119
right? So I do eat the foods that

2987
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,280
support acromancia, the pomegranate,

2988
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:34,560
etc., and the chili peppers. But I'm

2989
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,320
going to take the supplement because

2990
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,560
I've seen the data that shows how

2991
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:40,159
important it can be. Oh, an acromancia

2992
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,239
improves your metabolism, lowers the

2993
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:45,040
risk of metabolic syndrome. There might

2994
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:47,280
even be some clues that acromancia um

2995
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:49,599
might also lower the risk of dementia

2996
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,560
development later on as well. So, hey,

2997
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:54,159
this is a pretty safe natural bacteria.

2998
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,159
I'll take that probiotic. And another

2999
01:55:54,159 --> 01:56:00,639
probiotic I take is called Lactobacillus

3000
01:55:57,159 --> 01:56:03,280
rutery. Lutery. What does this do?

3001
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,800
Lowers inflammation, builds immunity. It

3002
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,639
actually text This is the bacteria that

3003
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,719
text messages the brain. We talked about

3004
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:12,560
the brain and it causes our brain to

3005
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:14,080
release social hormones like oxytocin.

3006
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:16,800
That's a social hormone that makes us

3007
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,360
feel good. So, you know, uh why wouldn't

3008
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,920
I actually take that? And oh, one last

3009
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:24,000
thing. Lactobacus ruti has been I the

3010
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,239
kind I take is chewable. Why wouldn't

3011
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,239
you just take a capsule? Well, it turns

3012
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:30,239
out that the same bacteria, lactobacus

3013
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:32,239
ruterides, good for the gut, but if you

3014
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:35,840
chew it up, this is the bacteria that

3015
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:38,320
kills the bacteria that causes cavities

3016
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,080
and gum disease.

3017
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:42,719
I haven't had cavity in well over a

3018
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,719
decade, you know. And so, again, this is

3019
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,920
one of these types of practical things

3020
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:50,560
that um just knowing the science and

3021
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:52,080
knowing what I do and where where I

3022
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:55,040
don't need enough. It's hard to get

3023
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:57,360
enough vitamin D. um uh uh hard enough

3024
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,040
to get omega-3s, I will actually top off

3025
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,400
on those. I'm wondering, you know,

3026
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:02,159
you've I've got these two great books in

3027
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,760
front of me, Eat to Beat Disease, which

3028
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:05,920
is a New York Times bestseller, and Eat

3029
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,599
to Beat Your Diet, which is really about

3030
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:10,560
burning fat, healing your metabolism,

3031
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:12,560
and living longer. I know that you must

3032
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,800
have some f people use the term

3033
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,560
superfoods all the time, but there must

3034
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:19,280
be some foods where you look at them and

3035
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,679
just think they are little miracles in

3036
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:23,679
their own right. So, I wanted to a

3037
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:25,840
little challenge for you is if you had

3038
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:27,520
to pick five of your favorite foods

3039
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,280
based on the research that you've done,

3040
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,599
the science you've seen, what would

3041
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:34,400
those top fives be? I would bring

3042
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:37,199
coffee. Okay. Um because of all the

3043
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:38,400
polyphenols in coffee, I'd bring tea. Um

3044
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:40,480
I tend to drink coffee in the morning

3045
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:42,880
and I have tea at night. Um and I can

3046
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:45,840
I'm not caffeine sensitive, so I can

3047
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:47,840
have the tea at night. If if if you

3048
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,560
allow me, I'll actually lump those into

3049
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:53,040
my beverages. Okay. Under one category.

3050
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,560
Um I'll bring tree nuts. Tree nuts. Tree

3051
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:58,760
nuts. Walnuts, almonds, macadamia,

3052
01:57:55,560 --> 01:58:01,199
pistachios. Um I love nuts. U tree nuts.

3053
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,800
And you know, not the pack prepackaged

3054
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:05,040
kind, but I like to, you know, kind of

3055
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,199
like toast them up myself and see flavor

3056
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,719
them myself. Um, I would bring that

3057
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,159
because of the dietary fiber, the

3058
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:12,400
healthy pro, it's a good source of

3059
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:15,119
protein, some healthy fats in it as

3060
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:17,760
well, and can kill some cancer stem

3061
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:20,159
cells while we're at it. Okay, so tree

3062
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,560
nuts are actually good. I would bring

3063
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:24,320
tomatoes because I love tomatoes. Okay,

3064
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,679
it's a great source for hydration, good

3065
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:28,159
source of lycopine, which we talked

3066
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:31,520
about, good for metabolism. I would take

3067
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:33,920
berries. Berries, blueberries,

3068
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,560
strawberries, raspberries are are among

3069
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:38,360
my favorites. Raspberries. You might be

3070
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:40,960
surprised at this, but raspberries are

3071
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:43,920
poundfor-pound or weight for weight one

3072
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:46,239
of the most fiber richch foods out

3073
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,639
there. They're light, they're hollow,

3074
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:50,480
packed with fiber. Um, and they've got

3075
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:53,040
polyphenols and that are useful for

3076
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,560
lowering inflammation as well. Berries

3077
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:57,840
um are actually really good. And then,

3078
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:01,440
you know, I because I follow what I call

3079
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:05,119
the Mediterranean uh style of eating, I

3080
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:07,840
love to have those vegetables that are

3081
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:10,800
actually used in both the Mediterranean

3082
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:15,280
and Asia, Mediterranean style cooking,

3083
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:18,480
the bok choy, the kale, chory, escarol,

3084
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:20,480
you know, all of those types of um of of

3085
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:22,080
leafy greens. So, those would be the

3086
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,599
five I would actually take with me. And

3087
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,880
what is the most important thing that we

3088
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:29,199
didn't talk about that we should have

3089
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:31,199
talked about? You know, I think that uh

3090
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:33,360
the most one of the most important

3091
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:35,599
things that that I want people to walk

3092
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:37,119
away with is that there's more than 200

3093
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:38,560
foods that I've studied and I've written

3094
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:41,040
about in my books eat to be disease and

3095
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,639
eat to beat your diet that you know I've

3096
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,639
done all the heavy lifting to help you

3097
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:47,679
figure out what foods are healthy that

3098
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:50,080
you could consider adding to your diet.

3099
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:54,320
But if you notice, I didn't actually

3100
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:56,960
give you a formula or a set menu on what

3101
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:58,639
to do for health. Because the most

3102
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:01,920
important thing I I I want people to

3103
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:04,400
walk away with is that my humanistic

3104
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:06,560
approach to this is um you should love

3105
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:08,080
your food to love your health. And if

3106
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,320
you could actually do both at the same

3107
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:12,159
time, you have to find out what are the

3108
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:14,480
foods that resonate with you. What do

3109
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:16,480
you prefer? What do you enjoy? So, if

3110
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,239
you could look at 200 healthy foods,

3111
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:20,320
which is what what I have in my books,

3112
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:22,239
and just take a highlighter or a pencil

3113
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:24,080
and circle them. Circle the ones you

3114
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:26,080
already love. Start and stick with

3115
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:28,880
those, you're already way ahead of the

3116
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:30,719
game. And that builds confidence that

3117
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:32,239
you're actually doing the right things.

3118
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:33,679
And that's what I love about this book

3119
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,840
in particular, Eat to Beat Disease, is

3120
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:39,440
that it also comes with lots of great

3121
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:41,040
recipes um inside the book. And um I

3122
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,639
think that's super helpful because

3123
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:45,199
there's a lot of information here, but

3124
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,719
this makes it actionable. It's a it's a

3125
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:48,320
really iconic book. It's such it's sold

3126
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:50,560
so incredibly well because also it's so

3127
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:52,719
unbelievably accessible to people who

3128
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,960
aren't scientists and that are trying to

3129
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:57,040
find some things that they can add to

3130
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,239
their plate. Um and I think that's

3131
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,280
essential to the approach that you take

3132
02:00:58,239 --> 02:01:01,360
as well. You're not someone that's

3133
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:03,199
telling us we can't eat nice things and

3134
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:04,800
enjoy our life. You're talking about the

3135
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:07,280
things that we should be adding to our

3136
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,960
plate to make our lives more um healthy

3137
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,840
and increase our longevity, which I'm

3138
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,840
very excited about actually because

3139
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:15,360
you're writing a book about longevity, I

3140
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:16,880
hear. And um I'm very much awaiting that

3141
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,800
book, which when when do you think

3142
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,239
that'll be due and ready? I don't uh I'm

3143
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,840
working on a manuscript, so I'm not

3144
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:23,679
ready to give a release date yet, but

3145
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:25,199
you'll be the first to know. Okay, good.

3146
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:26,320
We have a a closing tradition on this

3147
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:27,280
podcast where the last guest leaves a

3148
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,280
question for the next not knowing who

3149
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:31,920
they're leaving it for. And the question

3150
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:36,880
that's been left for you is, how would

3151
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:39,320
you be able to tell that your time here

3152
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:42,000
on Earth has been

3153
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:44,520
successful, that you've achieved what

3154
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:46,360
you set out to

3155
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:48,920
achieve?

3156
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:52,400
Wow. I think I would

3157
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,920
have two sides, two answers for that

3158
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:57,920
that represent different sides of the

3159
02:01:53,920 --> 02:02:00,880
coin. For me, I think if I'm able to

3160
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:05,119
have made my immediate community, my

3161
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:08,800
family better, that would uh be

3162
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:12,719
meaningful, a meaningful life uh having

3163
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:15,920
been lived. And if you look at the whole

3164
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:17,320
uh rest of my career and existence and

3165
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:22,159
how I spend my

3166
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:24,159
time, I want the work that I've done to

3167
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:26,560
resonate with others in a way that can

3168
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:28,320
improve their lives. I'm, you know, what

3169
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,480
I do. I kind of say I'm taking one for

3170
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:33,199
the team. The team being the rest of the

3171
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:35,360
world. And if I can contribute even a

3172
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:36,960
small piece that makes other people's

3173
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,599
lives better, then I feel like, you

3174
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:41,320
know, I've done it. I've done my job.

3175
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,920
Well, that's what you're most certainly

3176
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:45,360
doing, my friend, because you when I was

3177
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:48,159
looking through what you've accomplished

3178
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:50,400
in your life, um whether it's the all of

3179
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:52,239
the FDA approved treatments for over 70

3180
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:53,920
diseases, including cancers, diabetes,

3181
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,679
chronic wounds, and blindness that

3182
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:57,199
you've helped to develop, um more than I

3183
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,480
could possibly count, or whether it's

3184
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:00,320
the work that you're doing through your

3185
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,599
foundation, which I think people should

3186
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,719
uh check out, which is a nonprofit

3187
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,560
organization, which helps develop

3188
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:05,480
treatments for chronic diseases that are

3189
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,280
based on

3190
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:08,480
angioenesis. You've most certainly done

3191
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,080
that and you continue to do that. But

3192
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:12,159
even maybe more importantly of all

3193
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:14,000
because there's so many billions of

3194
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:15,520
people out there that are starved of the

3195
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,199
information that you have and that you

3196
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,880
find in your research laboratory is

3197
02:03:17,199 --> 02:03:21,119
you've come out into the world into the

3198
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:23,520
public forum and you're helping to

3199
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:25,119
articulate and demystify these

3200
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,360
incredibly confusing things that people

3201
02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:30,320
like me who didn't go and get a PhD or

3202
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:32,480
didn't go to Harvard don't understand.

3203
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:34,159
And you're masterful at it. You really

3204
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,320
are masterful. your ability to break

3205
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:38,320
down. You know, I sit here week in week

3206
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,679
out speaking to very very smart people

3207
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,119
and not all of them have the very

3208
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,480
important skill of being able to turn

3209
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:44,239
something very complicated into

3210
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:45,599
something understandable. And that is a

3211
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:46,960
skill you have. It's a real real gift

3212
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:49,119
and especially your use of like

3213
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:51,040
metaphors and analogies which really

3214
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:52,560
cement these ideas in our brain in a way

3215
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,400
that we can all understand. That for me

3216
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,400
is a really really important gift. So

3217
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,760
long may you continue to continue your

3218
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,760
work of public communication as well

3219
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,280
because for people like me it it can

3220
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,639
cause a penny drop moment that then

3221
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,639
leads us to change our lives for the

3222
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,840
better. So thank you. Thank well well

3223
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:07,760
thank you for inviting me. But you know

3224
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:11,040
I would say that you know we also live

3225
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:12,960
in a time again this is about going into

3226
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:15,599
the future. I'm always about moving into

3227
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,360
the future. Well, we have the platforms.

3228
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:18,800
We have, you know, I I went on to I

3229
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:20,639
developed a YouTube channel because I

3230
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,960
realized it was a place for me to take

3231
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:25,840
to drink from the fire hydrant, distill

3232
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:27,880
it, and figure out how I can deliver it

3233
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:29,920
in swift fashion, which would have been

3234
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:31,840
impossible 10 years ago. So, for

3235
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:35,440
example, you know, we talked about how,

3236
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:37,360
you know, uh, when my uncles had had

3237
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:39,760
cancer and passed away and I felt

3238
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:41,840
helpless, then my mother had it some

3239
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,040
years later and we had progress. we had

3240
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:45,440
the ability to be able to do something

3241
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:47,599
different. Similarly for me, I look at

3242
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,480
my books, I look at my social channels,

3243
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:52,239
my YouTube um uh platform as ways of

3244
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:54,239
being able to actually solve a problem

3245
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:55,599
that I felt like needed to be solved,

3246
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:58,320
but I wasn't really sure how to do it

3247
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:59,599
until now. Dr. William Lee, I highly

3248
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,800
recommend everybody goes and checks out

3249
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:02,480
your YouTube channel because it is

3250
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,080
fantastic and that's a great place to

3251
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,119
get more of this information, but also

3252
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:06,639
I'm going to link the YouTube channel

3253
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:08,320
and all of these books below for anybody

3254
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:10,960
that wants to continue their journey of

3255
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:11,920
learning. Thank you. Thank you. I really

3256
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,400
appreciate you being so generous with

3257
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:14,400
your time and

3258
02:05:14,679 --> 02:05:19,520
wisdom. This has always blown my mind a

3259
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:21,599
little bit. 53% of you that listen to

3260
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:23,599
the show regularly haven't yet subscribe

3261
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:24,800
to the show. So, could I ask you for a

3262
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,080
favor? If you like the show and you like

3263
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,840
what we do here and you want to support

3264
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:29,360
us, the free simple way that you can do

3265
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,360
just that is by hitting the subscribe

3266
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,960
button. And my commitment to you is if

3267
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:34,639
you do that, then I'll do everything in

3268
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,320
my power, me and my team, to make sure

3269
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:37,840
that this show is better for you every

3270
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,520
single week. We'll listen to your

3271
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:41,280
feedback. We'll find the guest that you

3272
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:45,800
want me to speak to and we'll continue

3273
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:45,800
to do what we do. Thank you so much.
