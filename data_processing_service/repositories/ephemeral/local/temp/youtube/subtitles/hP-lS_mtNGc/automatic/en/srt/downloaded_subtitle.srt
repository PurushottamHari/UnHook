00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello Welcome to Career 247 I am

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,320
Prashant Dhawan and in this video we

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
will properly evaluate the war between Iran and

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,799
Israel which looks like it will

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
last in the fifth day.  Now officially both the

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,000
countries have not declared war.  But

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,720
this is very much a war like situation.  Both

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
countries are openly firing missiles at each other.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,560
And some visuals have

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,800
surfaced recently.  I will show you this and at the

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,519
same time we will also know

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,640
how much damage both the countries have done to each other so far.

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,960
Now, first of all, this

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
gentleman you see is a reporter from Iran

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
and the building behind him is a

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,000
very important building of Iran.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,640
Iran's state news outlet used to operate from here.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,640
You will be able to see it here.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,640
This whole building has been burnt.

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,039
Obviously Israeli missiles are installed here.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
Israel had made an announcement.

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,160
Very soon Iran's TV and radio will make it disappear

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,280
and the visuals that have come,

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,520
literally the news anchors were working inside.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
was delivering the news.  Then the

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,320
Israeli missiles arrive.  And I have never

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,040
seen such visuals in my life till date.

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
You will be able to see this.  It

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,280
is an Iranian news broadcaster.  She was

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
delivering the news.  At that very moment, Israel attacks.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,320
Didi

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Fabu

33
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,209
[Music]

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Akbar

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,040
Allahu Akbar

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Now Thafuli, the anchor and the rest of the

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
people around her seem to be safe and they got back to

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
work after some time, but the

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,079
building is developed and here you

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
can see the before and after of the building,

41
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,000
this is Iran's straight broadcaster.   Due to the

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,200
burning of this building,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
it will become very difficult for the Iranian government to send a message to the rest of the country.

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,239
Suppose tomorrow some

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
fake news gets spread that there has been an

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
attack on the Supreme Leader of Iran or some

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,480
other attack has taken place, then

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,640
they no longer have a

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,080
state broadcaster, state radio, to refute or reject that news.

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Israel is very thoughtfully

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
trying to slowly bring about a regime change in Iran.

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,800
And if we look at the death toll,

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,280
because many cities in Iran are being constantly

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,920
bombed by Israel.  And now no

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,400

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,400
one is thinking where the civilians are and where they are not.  It is slowly going

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
towards an all out war.  I wo

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,800
n't be surprised.  Even if both the countries declare war

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,040
here.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
You can see Iran's by the way here.  I am showing you an article from Doordarshan.  The

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
sources of

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,720
Iran's Health Ministry are saying

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,280
that 222 people of Iran have died.

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
This is the official figure.  Actual figure

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
may be higher.  If you look at the same case of Israel,

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,800
Israel is saying that 20 of their people have been killed.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
300 people have been seriously injured.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,760
Now again what are real numbers?  We will

69
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,159
know only when the war is over.  But

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,480
meanwhile, many videos have also emerged from Israel

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,319
which show the damage caused by Iran's missiles.

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,519
Here you

73
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,519
can see Benjamin Etan on Yahoo, looking at the

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,760
residential

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
buildings where

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,360
Iran's missiles have fallen.  Now Iran's missiles have

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,360
also fallen in Haifa.  It is being said that Israel's oil depots in many places have

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
also been damaged.

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,200
And overall both the countries are suffering

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,239
losses.  Yes, this is a different matter.  Israel is claiming

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,959
that it has achieved air superiority over entire Iran.

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,159
Now again look

83
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,720
I will say it again here that

84
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,879
these visuals are coming out from Israel.  Given the level of

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,879
destruction that has taken place in Israel, it does not seem

86
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,040
that only 20 people have been killed.  But again,

87
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,560
as I told you earlier, both these countries

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,879
often keep the

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
actual figures hidden

90
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,640
till the very end in order to keep the morale high.  And I believe that

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,720
as this war progresses, you will

92
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,519
see that Iran's missiles will cause more damage.

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,760
So far Iran has

94
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
not used its biggest and newest missiles.

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,519
They are still using their old stock pile of

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,440
missiles.  When Iran has the

97
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
latest missiles, they will

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,320
start using them.  He can make a big bang.

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,400
They are more potent.  So again here

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,960
you will see what an ominous scene this is.

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,360
This missile is being fired by Iran.  Iran

102
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
is moving toward Israel.  It

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
attains hypersonic speed.  This missile flies

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,800
very high above the earth's surface and then when

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,040
it comes down, Israel's Arrow

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Three missile defense system, as well as

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
Various and their other missile defense systems, are

108
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,240
often unable to stop such missiles.

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,880
And the most strange thing to me in all this is that

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,639
these people from Iran are repeatedly

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,360
giving statements that

112
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,919
Pakistan's nuclear weapons are

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,320
also for our safety.  If in the

114
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,080
meantime Israel launches nuclear weapons against Iran.

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,800
Because let me tell you that

116
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,440
tonight it is being said that Iran is going to launch a massive

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,080
attack on Israel.  It will be a

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,080
humungous attack.  It remains to be seen with what intensity

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
this attack occurs.  So Iran is also afraid

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
that these people are continuously attacking

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,479
Israel.  Even the US Embassy in

122
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,080
Tel Aviv in Israel is said to have been

123
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
damaged.  After that, let's say Israel

124
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,800

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,479
starts exploring nuclear options, then what will happen?  So here

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,639
Iran is repeatedly saying that Pakistan's

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,800
nuclear weapons are in our support.  If

128
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
we are attacked with a nuclear bomb,

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
Pakistan will take revenge by attacking Israel.

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,080
I had uploaded a video on this topic this morning

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
and I had told you that the

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,120
government of Pakistan is rejecting all this.  The

133
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,360
issue became so big that the Pakistani

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
Minister had to

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,160
stand up in the Parliament and tell their Deputy Prime Minister that it is

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,919
not the case that we will

137
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
use our nuclear weapons anywhere.  This

138
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,880
is a very funny one minute video.

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,880
Look at this.  The latest entry has been made

140
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,560
through the same social media that

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,319
quoting one of their Iranian generals, Pakistan has

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,720
said that if Israel

143
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,080
launches a nuke attack on us, then Pakistan will

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
launch a nuclear attack on Israel.  This is such an

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,520
irresponsible and false news and it is

146
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,840
circulating on the social media, I came to

147
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319
know a while ago that Daily Mill Mail picked it up

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
in England, so I and Pakistan

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,960
's deterrence is obviously Allah Taala has

150
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,240
not only made this country a nuclear dog

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,639
but has also made it a temperamental dog and many

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
citizens are also suffering.  But this is

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,680
for our own security.   It is

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,759
for our own stability.  This

155
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,800
is for stability in this region.  Otherwise after 91,

156
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
both the armies remained standing ball to ball for 9-11 months.

157
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
If this had not happened then who knows

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
what would have happened at that time because India

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
needed an opportunity.  So, I just

160
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,560
want to clarify this because brother has just

161
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
talked to me so I thought that since I am

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
sitting in the house,

163
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
I should share the developments that have happened so far.  So no one has given any such

164
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,919
statement on our behalf.  It has been

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,479
fabricated.

166
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,800
Seeing all this I was amazed and thinking that

167
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,800

168
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
Pakistan is trying to escape from here.  I mean, you think about it, the

169
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,000
statement that has come from Iran,

170
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,080
given by one of their military officers, which can be seen

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,919
in the video, it is not like that,

172
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,000
you know, their government is saying that this is a

173
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
policy, a defense pact, it has

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
given a statement from its side that yes,

175
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,560
this has come from Pakistan, if Pakistan wanted, it could have remained

176
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
silent, but look at one thing,

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
their deputy PM, in the parliament, their

178
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,800
foreign ministry, their defense minister

179
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,759
Khawaja Asif is also saying that there is no

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,919
commitment on our part that Pakistan will

181
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,120
take revenge of Iran.  If Israel

182
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,759
launches a nuclear attack.  I mean, you should think about it.

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
These people then ask Iran to give

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
them some support against India.  Now

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,879
you people do not give support.

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,720
This is the stance of Pakistan.  This is the unity of these people.

187
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
Israel hasn't even attacked yet.   Even

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
before that, they are raising their hands saying that yes,

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,400
if Israel does anything now, then do

190
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,240
n't look at us.  We are

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,160
not going to use our nuclear weapons.  And

192
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,560
amidst all this, I saw that many Indian

193
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,879
students were giving the statement that

194
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,599
they are very scared today.  They are

195
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
terrified and the Indian government is trying to get the

196
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
thousands of Indian students here.  Yes, for some more

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
reason, there are many Indian students who had

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,280
gone to Tehran to study.  So they are being

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,159
removed from here.  Indian students will be sent to Armenia, a country located

201
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,599
in the north of Iran.

202
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,159
Here you will see that

203
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,279
this is Iran.  Their capital here is

204
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,120
Tehran and Armenia is here.  So this is the

205
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,760
route we're creating for now.  In

206
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,680
this way, Indian students will first

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,720
reach Armenia and then they will be airlifted from Armenia and

208
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,399
brought back to India.

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
And if here you are asking me

210
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,800
when will this conflict end?  Well, there

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,360
seems to be no sign of it ending here.

212
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,959
Nitin Yadav had recently

213
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,519
told the media that Israel is still

214
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,800
considering launching a direct attack on Iran's Supreme Leader

215
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,839
Ali Khamenei.

216
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,440
He told the Americans that you should also

217
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,440
attack Iran with us.  A certain Netaniya

218
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
has a line.  It has become quite famous.

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,200
Today he said this, I can understand

220
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,760
America First but I do not understand

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
America Dead.  If we assume that tomorrow Iran gets

222
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
nuclear weapons then

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,800
where will America First go?  So I don't see this

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
ending any time soon.  Something miraculous may

225
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,240
happen.  Let's have some conversation overnight.

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
Iran should say that it

227
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
will dismantle its nuclear program.  I don't know.

228
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,519
But it's not going to end anytime soon.

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
Things will get better very soon.  If some

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
updates come then I will

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
keep bringing updated videos for you.  Look, I believe that

232
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
if you are

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
not using Artificial Intelligence in your work today, then you are

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,800
living in a different era because with the

235
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
help of AI, you can do many jobs.

236
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
You can make a lot of money.   You

237
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
can upskill yourself.  For

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,440
example, if I want to show

239
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,760
that Captain America is

240
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai and

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
above it is written a very attractive

242
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,959
text 'Yummy', then I

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,000
can easily do this by entering the correct 'P'.  And here you

244
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,399
can see it was just that easy.

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,120
You can make many variants of this.  If I

246
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,279
want to move this image, I can do it in the

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
way

248
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,079
you can see on your screen.  I can make

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,640
this image move with the help of a lot of generative AI software.  I

250
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,959

251
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,839
can create a story.  I can pretty much do

252
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,320
anything.  And this is just one small, I mean

253
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,600
one very small, aspect of

254
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,760
