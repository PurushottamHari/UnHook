Hello Welcome to Career 247 I am Prashant Dhawan and in this video we will properly evaluate the war between Iran and Israel which looks like it will last in the fifth day.  Now officially both the countries have not declared war.  But this is very much a war like situation.  Both countries are openly firing missiles at each other. And some visuals have surfaced recently.  I will show you this and at the same time we will also know how much damage both the countries have done to each other so far. Now, first of all, this gentleman you see is a reporter from Iran and the building behind him is a very important building of Iran. Iran's state news outlet used to operate from here. You will be able to see it here. This whole building has been burnt. Obviously Israeli missiles are installed here. Israel had made an announcement. Very soon Iran's TV and radio will make it disappear and the visuals that have come, literally the news anchors were working inside. was delivering the news.  Then the Israeli missiles arrive.  And I have never seen such visuals in my life till date. You will be able to see this.  It is an Iranian news broadcaster.  She was delivering the news.  At that very moment, Israel attacks. Didi Fabu [Music] Akbar Allahu Akbar Now Thafuli, the anchor and the rest of the people around her seem to be safe and they got back to work after some time, but the building is developed and here you can see the before and after of the building, this is Iran's straight broadcaster.   Due to the burning of this building, it will become very difficult for the Iranian government to send a message to the rest of the country. Suppose tomorrow some fake news gets spread that there has been an attack on the Supreme Leader of Iran or some other attack has taken place, then they no longer have a state broadcaster, state radio, to refute or reject that news. Israel is very thoughtfully trying to slowly bring about a regime change in Iran. And if we look at the death toll, because many cities in Iran are being constantly bombed by Israel.  And now no one is thinking where the civilians are and where they are not.  It is slowly going towards an all out war.  I wo n't be surprised.  Even if both the countries declare war here. You can see Iran's by the way here.  I am showing you an article from Doordarshan.  The sources of Iran's Health Ministry are saying that 222 people of Iran have died. This is the official figure.  Actual figure may be higher.  If you look at the same case of Israel, Israel is saying that 20 of their people have been killed. 300 people have been seriously injured. Now again what are real numbers?  We will know only when the war is over.  But meanwhile, many videos have also emerged from Israel which show the damage caused by Iran's missiles. Here you can see Benjamin Etan on Yahoo, looking at the residential buildings where Iran's missiles have fallen.  Now Iran's missiles have also fallen in Haifa.  It is being said that Israel's oil depots in many places have also been damaged. And overall both the countries are suffering losses.  Yes, this is a different matter.  Israel is claiming that it has achieved air superiority over entire Iran. Now again look I will say it again here that these visuals are coming out from Israel.  Given the level of destruction that has taken place in Israel, it does not seem that only 20 people have been killed.  But again, as I told you earlier, both these countries often keep the actual figures hidden till the very end in order to keep the morale high.  And I believe that as this war progresses, you will see that Iran's missiles will cause more damage. So far Iran has not used its biggest and newest missiles. They are still using their old stock pile of missiles.  When Iran has the latest missiles, they will start using them.  He can make a big bang. They are more potent.  So again here you will see what an ominous scene this is. This missile is being fired by Iran.  Iran is moving toward Israel.  It attains hypersonic speed.  This missile flies very high above the earth's surface and then when it comes down, Israel's Arrow Three missile defense system, as well as Various and their other missile defense systems, are often unable to stop such missiles. And the most strange thing to me in all this is that these people from Iran are repeatedly giving statements that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are also for our safety.  If in the meantime Israel launches nuclear weapons against Iran. Because let me tell you that tonight it is being said that Iran is going to launch a massive attack on Israel.  It will be a humungous attack.  It remains to be seen with what intensity this attack occurs.  So Iran is also afraid that these people are continuously attacking Israel.  Even the US Embassy in Tel Aviv in Israel is said to have been damaged.  After that, let's say Israel starts exploring nuclear options, then what will happen?  So here Iran is repeatedly saying that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are in our support.  If we are attacked with a nuclear bomb, Pakistan will take revenge by attacking Israel. I had uploaded a video on this topic this morning and I had told you that the government of Pakistan is rejecting all this.  The issue became so big that the Pakistani Minister had to stand up in the Parliament and tell their Deputy Prime Minister that it is not the case that we will use our nuclear weapons anywhere.  This is a very funny one minute video. Look at this.  The latest entry has been made through the same social media that quoting one of their Iranian generals, Pakistan has said that if Israel launches a nuke attack on us, then Pakistan will launch a nuclear attack on Israel.  This is such an irresponsible and false news and it is circulating on the social media, I came to know a while ago that Daily Mill Mail picked it up in England, so I and Pakistan 's deterrence is obviously Allah Taala has not only made this country a nuclear dog but has also made it a temperamental dog and many citizens are also suffering.  But this is for our own security.   It is for our own stability.  This is for stability in this region.  Otherwise after 91, both the armies remained standing ball to ball for 9-11 months. If this had not happened then who knows what would have happened at that time because India needed an opportunity.  So, I just want to clarify this because brother has just talked to me so I thought that since I am sitting in the house, I should share the developments that have happened so far.  So no one has given any such statement on our behalf.  It has been fabricated. Seeing all this I was amazed and thinking that Pakistan is trying to escape from here.  I mean, you think about it, the statement that has come from Iran, given by one of their military officers, which can be seen in the video, it is not like that, you know, their government is saying that this is a policy, a defense pact, it has given a statement from its side that yes, this has come from Pakistan, if Pakistan wanted, it could have remained silent, but look at one thing, their deputy PM, in the parliament, their foreign ministry, their defense minister Khawaja Asif is also saying that there is no commitment on our part that Pakistan will take revenge of Iran.  If Israel launches a nuclear attack.  I mean, you should think about it. These people then ask Iran to give them some support against India.  Now you people do not give support. This is the stance of Pakistan.  This is the unity of these people. Israel hasn't even attacked yet.   Even before that, they are raising their hands saying that yes, if Israel does anything now, then do n't look at us.  We are not going to use our nuclear weapons.  And amidst all this, I saw that many Indian students were giving the statement that they are very scared today.  They are terrified and the Indian government is trying to get the thousands of Indian students here.  Yes, for some more reason, there are many Indian students who had gone to Tehran to study.  So they are being removed from here.  Indian students will be sent to Armenia, a country located in the north of Iran. Here you will see that this is Iran.  Their capital here is Tehran and Armenia is here.  So this is the route we're creating for now.  In this way, Indian students will first reach Armenia and then they will be airlifted from Armenia and brought back to India. And if here you are asking me when will this conflict end?  Well, there seems to be no sign of it ending here. Nitin Yadav had recently told the media that Israel is still considering launching a direct attack on Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He told the Americans that you should also attack Iran with us.  A certain Netaniya has a line.  It has become quite famous. Today he said this, I can understand America First but I do not understand America Dead.  If we assume that tomorrow Iran gets nuclear weapons then where will America First go?  So I don't see this ending any time soon.  Something miraculous may happen.  Let's have some conversation overnight. Iran should say that it will dismantle its nuclear program.  I don't know. But it's not going to end anytime soon. Things will get better very soon.  If some updates come then I will keep bringing updated videos for you.
