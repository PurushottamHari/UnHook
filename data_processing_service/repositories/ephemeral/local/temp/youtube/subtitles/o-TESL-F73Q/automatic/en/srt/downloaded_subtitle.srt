My name is Siddharth Agnihotri.

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
not come there, it is possible that they were called there.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,200
You never know because he had

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,600
lunch in America for the last four days.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,760
So let's talk.  Donald Trump will

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
also talk to Modiji about what he has discussed.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,840

So the link is given in the description comment box.

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,600
So friend, you got a red carpet welcome.

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,879
Red Carpet You know that the

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,240
red carpet has been laid out for them to come and sit

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,880
because a condition has been placed, what is the condition?  I

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,200
think the condition is that we will give you the Nobel Peace

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
Prize.  Donald Trump is the

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,920
crazy man I told you he is.  He is a complete mad

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,880
man.  Ok?  He is narcissistic,

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,640
he has extreme narcissism.  Ok?

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,159
Now, for those who do not know what Narcissistic

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,840
Personality Disorder is, I have given

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
so many lectures, just type Narcissistic

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
Personality Disorder, study

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
close and you will get to know, so now what has happened is that

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Pakistan has understood his behaviour just

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,479
like India is understanding it and is

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,000
doing all those things that Donald Trump likes.

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,600
Ok?  So here Donald Trump first

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,119
rolls out the red carpet and welcomes him.  And

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,840
after that he says for Asim Munir, Aha

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
Fantastic Man I love Pakistan.  Oh my

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
God.  Don Trump is singing the song Dil Dil Pakistan.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,119
And this is the same Donald Trump who was

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,600
saying in 2018 that Pakistan is a

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,240
liar and a deceiver.

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
He doesn't know anything except cheating.

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,239
And now he is doing all those

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
anti-India activities.  Thank me.  Thank me.  I had

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
told you in my old lectures that if this Don Trump comes, he will

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
ruin it.  Mad man, I have been

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
saying this for a long time now.  I can

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,920
understand what kind of personality the friends have.

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,280
Ok?  So I told me

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
but at that time you guys were abusing me a lot.  Oh

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
no Sir, when Don Trump comes we

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
will decorate the courtyard.  Donald Trump will do it for India.  He

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,720
did nothing for India.

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,280
All steps are against India, he is such a man.  I

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,160
don't get along with his wife.  He

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,000
doesn't get along with anyone, brother.  He is a dangerous man.

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,840
Ok?  So Donald Trump has said that

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,560
look, I have said again that I have

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
personally defused a huge war between

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Pakistan and India.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
Just yesterday PM Modi scolded

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
Donald Trump for half an hour saying listen son, you have

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
not stopped the war, neither will we accept mediation nor have

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,280
you ever done it, again after the phone call

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,840
he said that no no I stopped the

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,000
war between Pakistan and India,

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,920
this is narcissism, I

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,640
stopped the war between Pakistan and India,

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,200
contempt that PM Modi told him now no

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
one will look into it, this statement is being

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
printed everywhere, this is being printed everywhere,

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
 

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
after that Don Trump is saying that sir

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,920
this is personal diplomacy and

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
due to trade pressure, nuclear

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
armed neighbours deescalated.  We

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,519
gave a trade deal to India

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
because Pakistan was about to launch a big attack.

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,879
This is being said and yesterday Vikram

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,120
Mishra also said the same thing and India said that you will

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,159
attack.  They have the capability to

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
drop so many bombs that half of their air force i.e. 20% was destroyed.

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
His call came with fear.  Is it okay

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,560
?  So here I said that both are nuclear

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,959
countries and I got it stopped again

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,760
from Prime Minister Modi ji.  I spoke and

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,080
now I also said that I had also talked

96
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,840
to PM Modi ji.  Very good, PM Modi has

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
also been praised a lot.  Let us see this also.  It's

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
not like that.

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
He also said about PM Modi that Modi is a

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,239
fantastic man.  He is a very nice man.

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,760
Ok?  And Pakistan is our friend.

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,560
This is what he is doing bluntly.  And

103
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
here Michael Kugelman, a defense

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
analyst, explains something.  He tells

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,759
that look, look, whatever happened yesterday between Trump and

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
Modi, Modi ji made it clear that he

107
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,560
said on his face that you have not

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,360
done anything brother, and you have not done anything.  Isn't it?

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
But why is there love for Pakistan?

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
Well, Pakistan's love for America is

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,759
always there. Why is America loving Pakistan so much

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,479
?  I have said many times that Pakistan

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
is a country for sale.  You throw money and he is

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
standing there to dance.  So what happened this time

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
?  A condition has been placed.  What are the conditions

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,840
?  First of all, the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize.

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,240
Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
needed at any cost.  They have to

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
stop the war.  He also says in Iran and Israel

120
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,880
that I want an end.  Rather, one of his

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,199
supporters, Mega Maga Bhaiya Tucker Kasan, who used to

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
support Donald Trump a lot, has come to Dhar's house.

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
Ok?  Elon

124
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
Musk left.  His own

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
supporters are abandoning him.  Now

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,720
mid-term elections are to be held in America next year in 2026.

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,800
Donald Trump will lose.

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,919
Donald Trump will go on to be stamped as the

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,639
worst President in American history.

130
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,960
Worst president.  After this, people will be

131
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,639
scared that what is happening in Los Angeles

132
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,320
never happened before.  Ok?  The Marines are

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
fighting in the streets.  Donald Trump will

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
destroy America.

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,919
it's gonna happen.  Now here there is a

136
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,120
lot of love for Pakistan, meeting with terrorists

137
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,919
, Syria Alshar on whom a huge bounty was

138
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,440
placed.  So they are telling the world

139
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,320
that now look at the world in Washington, this

140
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,600

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,320
news is spread in all the corridors of America that it needs Pakistan

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,120
because pressure has to be created on Iran.

143
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,039

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,520
What does it mean to stop the Iran-Israel war? That basis is

145
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,240
needed in Pakistan also.  As many air

146
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,759
bases as possible are needed.  And after that Khamenei has to

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,080
persuade all the Ayatollahs to

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
sit at the negotiating table.  But it will

149
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,319
happen now.  You think Iran is preparing for a long war

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
and Iran-Pakistan

151
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,000
enmity Pakistan is such a stupid country.

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,360
He has made such a big mistake.  First

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
he tells Iran that we will help you.

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
And as soon as he says that you hit me

155
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,720
son, I am behind you.  The chance came and he ran away.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Cheated first of all.  Their admirers

157
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,199
fearfully say that we are not going to help Iran.

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,080
Forget it, we will help Iran.

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,759
This is accounting.  Asim Munir is having

160
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,720
lunch with Kas from America.  Do you

161
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:45,039
know what will happen with this?

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,039
Who will the Islamic world ignore?  From Pakistan.

163
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,440
Now, the entire world, the entire Islamic world, there are around

164
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,080
70 countries.

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,960
They will realize that this trust is

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,919
not worthy.  But what's the bigger deal?

167
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,280
Donald Trump said, look, today I

168
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,560
met Asim Munir and I am honoured today.

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,000
Why have I called such a nice man

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,880
?  Because I wanted to thank him

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,599
that he did not go to the war.  What is

172
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,319
this brother saying, he was made a Field Marshal, the

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,639
defeated Marshal said that he did

174
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,400
not go to the war and here he said that I should

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
also thank PM Modi.  I

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
want to say thank you.  Both of them are very

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
smart people.  Who said that this

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,759
war should not turn into a nuclear war.

179
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
Well, it is Don Trump who is talking about nuclear war also.

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
Neither India

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,319
nor Pakistan is saying that we were going to go to a nuclear

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
war.  This is what

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
Donald Trump is saying and since then

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,599
he has been shouting nuclear rhetoric.

185
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,680
After that he said this when he was

186
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,400
told during lunch that look, he will

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
get the Nobel Peace Prize.  Asim Munir

188
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
proposed to Donald Trump.  That means

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,960
Pakistan is backing this.

190
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Well, Pakistan has no status.

191
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
No one will listen to him.  But Donald Trump was happy with this.  Is it

192
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
okay?  Yes brother, let me get the

193
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
Nobel Peace Prize.  Now see, Donald Trump is

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,680
very happy because the

195
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,000
Kashmir issue is unresolved.  Ok?  And

196
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,440
one country, Pakistan, was always ready and is ready

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because it knows that we have

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,479
forcefully occupied Kashmir.  And the Indus

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,319
Water Treaty is suspended.  India has said

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,680
that it has also told Donald Trump that if

201
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
Pakistan attacks, this time we will

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
retaliate with double the force.  This war will be

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,120
for us.  So Donald Trump has brought a country

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
with him.  One country has clearly said that the

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,479
meaning of Nobel Peace Prize is to get the

206
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,199
Kashmir issue solved.  You

207
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,440
take the Nobel Peace Prize.  This is the condition.  So that means at least

208
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,680
one country is with them.  Now see

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,240
what they were trying to do.  Look what Donald Trump is that

210
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,240
PM Modi called him yesterday.

211
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,800
PM Modi and Donald Trump talked for half an hour and 35 minutes.

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,120
Donald Trump

213
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,279
invited PM Modi.  Look at the timing.  Those who are

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,399
saying that we have rejected it.   Did

215
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,279
n't go.  Brother what was the reason behind that?

216
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
Donald Trump wanted to call PM Modi to America

217
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,760
when Asim Munir was also there.

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
And Donald Trump wanted

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,200
Donald Trump to be in the middle.  Here is Asim Munir, here is

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,440
PM Modi.  They wanted a photo of these three and

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
after that Donald Trump boasted,

222
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
look, we stopped the war.  If this had happened

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,600
in life, Asim Munir would have been taken away from there itself.  Are

224
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,160
you understanding?  India would have got it taken away.

225
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
That is why PM Modi has outright rejected

226
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,080
that we will not come.  Forget America.  Do you

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,680
understand brother?  It is in G7.  He said it

228
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
is Canada.  Come on.  It is right next to it.  He said,

229
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,600
I will not come.  Because this was Donald Trump's

230
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
move.  He would call both of them, get their photographs taken

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
and then say, look, the Nobel Peace Prize has been won.

232
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,480
Kashmir issue resolved.  Donald Trump

233
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,120
even used to say that he has solved the Kashmir issue.  Are

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,440
you understanding?  So that is why

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,399
they were sent an invitation to the G7 summit being held here.

236
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,200
And now there

237
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,920
were speculations that they wanted to do something diplomatic,

238
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,480
but that did not happen.  Out Rightly Well Asim

239
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,040
Munir knows this.  Friends, Asim Munir

240
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,920
knows this.  Pakistan's

241
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,440
leadership wants India to come to the table

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
but it also wants us to continue

243
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,600
spreading terrorism.  Which she has always been doing.

244
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,839
Brother, in 2021 Bajwa Qamar Javed Bajwa

245
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,040
wanted to invite PM Modi to Pakistan.  You

246
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,360
know Imran Khan did not agree.  Imran Khan

247
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,760
refused.

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,800
And today Imran Khan is in jail and Asim Munir is

249
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,920
out.  And Asim Munir, who is there for the lunch, has

250
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,040
organised such a grand welcome for him,

251
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
friends, someone like Pervez Musharraf had gone for lunch

252
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,800
in 2001.  And why did he go?  Because that

253
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,959
war and terror

254
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,600
needed the support of George W. Bush and Pervez Musharraf.  Is it okay

255
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,240
?  Because brother, where did we get terrorism from Pakistan,

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Osama bin Laden?

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,399
Before this Ziaul Haq or any other leader like

258
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
Ayub Khan have only talked and held

259
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
meetings but such a grand welcome has not been given.

260
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,200
Why has this happened now?  Because Asim

261
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,360
Munir himself knew that PM Modi would come

262
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
and Asim Munir wanted PM Modi to come.

263
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,519
This matter should end and everyone should know that

264
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
India and Pakistan are good friends, but PM

265
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
Modi clearly said that we are not coming.

266
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
Because what was happening was that

267
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
he was also invited to the military parade.  And

268
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
who knows, Asim Munir might be there?  You never know.

269
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,839
This can definitely happen.  Because the

270
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,440
crowd that was supposed to come, did not come.

271
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,880
So here we will meet the Pentagon and

272
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
also the State Department.  Now

273
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,640
tell me, this is a high profile visit

274
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:18,160
of Asim Munir.  Is it okay?  Now understand one thing that

275
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,240
whatever America is doing, the relations between India and

276
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
America are getting worse.

277
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
And India-America relations cannot deteriorate

278
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
because India

279
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,279
gives intellectual power to America.  Ok?  We

280
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,920
are the GC.  Global Capability Center.  So if

281
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,320
India

282
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,440
grows here in increasing the GDP of America, then America will

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,399
grow.  There is some slogan like this.  Ok?

284
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,760
And the Indians are all over America,

285
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,200
Indians are there.  Friends, it would not be wrong to say this.

286
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,519
Give us control of America.

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,560
Who controls Africa?  Indians.

288
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,600
India has all the business.  There are Indians in West Asia

289
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,120
too.  There are Indians in West Asia.

290
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,120
10 million people live in the Gulf region.

291
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,959
One pet reaction, look at how many there are in Saudi Arabia and UAE

292
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
and like these

293
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
Pakistanis are laborers or they do lowly jobs,

294
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,200
Indians reach high positions.

295
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,120
Reaches a very high position.  Are

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,399
you understanding?  So, in a way,

297
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
if the relations between India and America get spoilt, then that is why Americans are

298
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
jealous of Indians.  Ok?  What you

299
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
see is the racism online

300
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
against Indians because it moves very fast.

301
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,480
Look what Pakistan has to face

302
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
?  They know that people will not move forward.

303
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,760
Leave them alone.  Ok?  But whoever

304
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,480
comes in competition with you, you will do that to him.  So

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,720
what is here is that the relations between India and America

306
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,120
can get very bad and are getting worse.

307
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,760
This same Google man said that

308
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,560
you are engaging with the Army Chief of Pakistan.

309
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,320
And you hosted us here at the White House.

310
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,639
Ayub Khan Ziaul Haq also held

311
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
meetings.  But if it is not hosted

312
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,200
then the relations between India and America will

313
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,959
deteriorate significantly.  Is it okay?  And the

314
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,360
most dangerous thing is

315
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,920
what has Trump said about Pakistan?

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Donald Trump has said so many wrong things about

317
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,959
Pakistan and has stopped so many ads.

318
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,360
But now see, everything has changed.

319
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,839
Now at this time they are calling top generals and

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,000
doing press conference.  In South Asia, they

321
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,079
show that brother, we are power brokers

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,760
and we should get the Nobel Peace Prize.

323
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,760

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
So these things are why New Delhi will

325
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
not tolerate this because the line has been crossed.

326
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
We will not tolerate everything

327
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,440
and you need India.  America

328
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
needs India.

329
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,079
We have a trade deficit with America and

330
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,320
now every leader including PM Modi will have to take a very strict

331
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,839
stand.  And at the same time

332
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,880
 

333
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,279
it was also said here that there are

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,240
three men regarding the military, Iran and counter terrorism.

335
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,279
One is counter terrorism, one is Iran related

336
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,480
accounting and the other is their crypto related one.  So

337
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,920
Donald Trump will talk on these three issues â€“ counter

338
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,760
terrorism, China, crypto currency and

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
critical minerals.  Is it okay

340
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,600
?  So now see, crypto currency will

341
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,760
destroy Pakistan.  If crypto

342
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,240
mining starts.  Is it okay?

343
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,000
After that, if we talk about China, Pakistan also

344
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,320
wants that

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,079
we should balance our relations with both China and America.

346
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
Ok?  Is ISK okay when it comes to counter terrorism

347
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,279
?  For example, America just said that we

348
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,680

349
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,399

350
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
felt good when you gave them the terrorists of Islamic State Khorasan who have

351
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,360
set up bases on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran.   They have

352
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199

353
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,839
established bases on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  So they consider Pakistan as an

354
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,279
interlocutor.  That their

355
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
influence is more there.  All the

356
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,040
terrorists listen to him.  And

357
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,880
Pakistan feels that

358
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
America will be able to put pressure on India on many things including the Indus Water Treaty.

359
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,920
But India will not listen to the bell.

360
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Keep saying whatever you want to say.  And

361
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
now Pakistan is saying that it is

362
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,440
giving information about the

363
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,000
terrorists to America, that means it is

364
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,880
giving information about these terrorists to America

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,480
and America is

366
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,199
also praising it a lot because

367
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
Pakistan has a hand in the strikes that have taken place.  So

368
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,959
see how Pakistan is playing a double game.

369
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,720
He is supporting these terrorists

370
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,480
and is giving this information to America

371
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,120
and the same America is striking them.  Is it

372
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,120
okay?  So this is it.

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,399
Rest, you know about Kurila's statement,

374
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,160
how much

375
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
press he has given to Pakistan, he said that

376
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
Pakistan is very important.  There

377
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,880
is no binary switch.  It is important that we

378
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,040
work with both countries.  Now

379
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,279
you know about all these things, Pakistan has said that

380
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,560
look, a National Crypto Currency Reserve should be

381
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,199
created.  Now let me tell you ideally.

382
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,839
Crypto trading is illegal in Pakistan.

383
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,880
could you believe?

384
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,839
Crypto trading is illegal in Pakistan and their

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,320
PM says that we will create a

386
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,720
crypto currency reserve.  You can see

387
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399
what kind of country this is.  Where

388
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
they have declared crypto currency illegal.  He

389
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
says that we will create a crypto currency reserve.

390
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,440
And Donald Trump's family has

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,240

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,720
invested the most money in crypto.  Are you understanding?  So you can assume this

393
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,199
and if we talk about critical minerals as well,

394
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199
then there are many such deposits

395
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,360
in Balochistan.  Isn't it?  Critical

396
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,959
minerals, China has also banned critical minerals.

397
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,920

398
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,440
It has imposed a ban on rare earth elements.

399
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,440
America is finding all these things very

400
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
good.  But what is happening with this?  Because of this, one

401
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160
Pakistani will also be ruined.

402
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Completely based on the conditions of America.

403
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,160
After that India will go away and ultimately

404
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,920
friends, they will not get anything.

405
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
it is.  What do you think, please
