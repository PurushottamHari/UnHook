So friend, you got a red carpet welcome. Red Carpet You know that the red carpet has been laid out for them to come and sit because a condition has been placed, what is the condition?  I think the condition is that we will give you the Nobel Peace Prize.  Donald Trump is the crazy man I told you he is.  He is a complete mad man.  Ok?  He is narcissistic, he has extreme narcissism.  Ok? Now, for those who do not know what Narcissistic Personality Disorder is, I have given so many lectures, just type Narcissistic Personality Disorder, study close and you will get to know, so now what has happened is that Pakistan has understood his behaviour just like India is understanding it and is doing all those things that Donald Trump likes. Ok?  So here Donald Trump first rolls out the red carpet and welcomes him.  And after that he says for Asim Munir, Aha Fantastic Man I love Pakistan.  Oh my God.  Don Trump is singing the song Dil Dil Pakistan. And this is the same Donald Trump who was saying in 2018 that Pakistan is a liar and a deceiver. He doesn't know anything except cheating. And now he is doing all those anti-India activities.  Thank me.  Thank me.  I had told you in my old lectures that if this Don Trump comes, he will ruin it.  Mad man, I have been saying this for a long time now.  I can understand what kind of personality the friends have. Ok?  So I told me but at that time you guys were abusing me a lot.  Oh no Sir, when Don Trump comes we will decorate the courtyard.  Donald Trump will do it for India.  He did nothing for India. All steps are against India, he is such a man.  I don't get along with his wife.  He doesn't get along with anyone, brother.  He is a dangerous man. Ok?  So Donald Trump has said that look, I have said again that I have personally defused a huge war between Pakistan and India. Just yesterday PM Modi scolded Donald Trump for half an hour saying listen son, you have not stopped the war, neither will we accept mediation nor have you ever done it, again after the phone call he said that no no I stopped the war between Pakistan and India, this is narcissism, I stopped the war between Pakistan and India, contempt that PM Modi told him now no one will look into it, this statement is being printed everywhere, this is being printed everywhere, after that Don Trump is saying that sir this is personal diplomacy and due to trade pressure, nuclear armed neighbours deescalated.  We gave a trade deal to India because Pakistan was about to launch a big attack. This is being said and yesterday Vikram Mishra also said the same thing and India said that you will attack.  They have the capability to drop so many bombs that half of their air force i.e. 20% was destroyed. His call came with fear.  Is it okay ?  So here I said that both are nuclear countries and I got it stopped again from Prime Minister Modi ji.  I spoke and now I also said that I had also talked to PM Modi ji.  Very good, PM Modi has also been praised a lot.  Let us see this also.  It's not like that. He also said about PM Modi that Modi is a fantastic man.  He is a very nice man. Ok?  And Pakistan is our friend. This is what he is doing bluntly.  And here Michael Kugelman, a defense analyst, explains something.  He tells that look, look, whatever happened yesterday between Trump and Modi, Modi ji made it clear that he said on his face that you have not done anything brother, and you have not done anything.  Isn't it? But why is there love for Pakistan? Well, Pakistan's love for America is always there. Why is America loving Pakistan so much ?  I have said many times that Pakistan is a country for sale.  You throw money and he is standing there to dance.  So what happened this time ?  A condition has been placed.  What are the conditions ?  First of all, the conditions of the Nobel Peace Prize. Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is needed at any cost.  They have to stop the war.  He also says in Iran and Israel that I want an end.  Rather, one of his supporters, Mega Maga Bhaiya Tucker Kasan, who used to support Donald Trump a lot, has come to Dhar's house. Ok?  Elon Musk left.  His own supporters are abandoning him.  Now mid-term elections are to be held in America next year in 2026. Donald Trump will lose. Donald Trump will go on to be stamped as the worst President in American history. Worst president.  After this, people will be scared that what is happening in Los Angeles never happened before.  Ok?  The Marines are fighting in the streets.  Donald Trump will destroy America. it's gonna happen.  Now here there is a lot of love for Pakistan, meeting with terrorists , Syria Alshar on whom a huge bounty was placed.  So they are telling the world that now look at the world in Washington, this news is spread in all the corridors of America that it needs Pakistan because pressure has to be created on Iran. What does it mean to stop the Iran-Israel war? That basis is needed in Pakistan also.  As many air bases as possible are needed.  And after that Khamenei has to persuade all the Ayatollahs to sit at the negotiating table.  But it will happen now.  You think Iran is preparing for a long war and Iran-Pakistan enmity Pakistan is such a stupid country. He has made such a big mistake.  First he tells Iran that we will help you. And as soon as he says that you hit me son, I am behind you.  The chance came and he ran away. Cheated first of all.  Their admirers fearfully say that we are not going to help Iran. Forget it, we will help Iran. This is accounting.  Asim Munir is having lunch with Kas from America.  Do you know what will happen with this? Who will the Islamic world ignore?  From Pakistan. Now, the entire world, the entire Islamic world, there are around 70 countries. They will realize that this trust is not worthy.  But what's the bigger deal? Donald Trump said, look, today I met Asim Munir and I am honoured today. Why have I called such a nice man ?  Because I wanted to thank him that he did not go to the war.  What is this brother saying, he was made a Field Marshal, the defeated Marshal said that he did not go to the war and here he said that I should also thank PM Modi.  I want to say thank you.  Both of them are very smart people.  Who said that this war should not turn into a nuclear war. Well, it is Don Trump who is talking about nuclear war also. Neither India nor Pakistan is saying that we were going to go to a nuclear war.  This is what Donald Trump is saying and since then he has been shouting nuclear rhetoric. After that he said this when he was told during lunch that look, he will get the Nobel Peace Prize.  Asim Munir proposed to Donald Trump.  That means Pakistan is backing this. Well, Pakistan has no status. No one will listen to him.  But Donald Trump was happy with this.  Is it okay?  Yes brother, let me get the Nobel Peace Prize.  Now see, Donald Trump is very happy because the Kashmir issue is unresolved.  Ok?  And one country, Pakistan, was always ready and is ready because it knows that we have forcefully occupied Kashmir.  And the Indus Water Treaty is suspended.  India has said that it has also told Donald Trump that if Pakistan attacks, this time we will retaliate with double the force.  This war will be for us.  So Donald Trump has brought a country with him.  One country has clearly said that the meaning of Nobel Peace Prize is to get the Kashmir issue solved.  You take the Nobel Peace Prize.  This is the condition.  So that means at least one country is with them.  Now see what they were trying to do.  Look what Donald Trump is that PM Modi called him yesterday. PM Modi and Donald Trump talked for half an hour and 35 minutes. Donald Trump invited PM Modi.  Look at the timing.  Those who are saying that we have rejected it.   Did n't go.  Brother what was the reason behind that? Donald Trump wanted to call PM Modi to America when Asim Munir was also there. And Donald Trump wanted Donald Trump to be in the middle.  Here is Asim Munir, here is PM Modi.  They wanted a photo of these three and after that Donald Trump boasted, look, we stopped the war.  If this had happened in life, Asim Munir would have been taken away from there itself.  Are you understanding?  India would have got it taken away. That is why PM Modi has outright rejected that we will not come.  Forget America.  Do you understand brother?  It is in G7.  He said it is Canada.  Come on.  It is right next to it.  He said, I will not come.  Because this was Donald Trump's move.  He would call both of them, get their photographs taken and then say, look, the Nobel Peace Prize has been won. Kashmir issue resolved.  Donald Trump even used to say that he has solved the Kashmir issue.  Are you understanding?  So that is why they were sent an invitation to the G7 summit being held here. And now there were speculations that they wanted to do something diplomatic, but that did not happen.  Out Rightly Well Asim Munir knows this.  Friends, Asim Munir knows this.  Pakistan's leadership wants India to come to the table but it also wants us to continue spreading terrorism.  Which she has always been doing. Brother, in 2021 Bajwa Qamar Javed Bajwa wanted to invite PM Modi to Pakistan.  You know Imran Khan did not agree.  Imran Khan refused. And today Imran Khan is in jail and Asim Munir is out.  And Asim Munir, who is there for the lunch, has organised such a grand welcome for him, friends, someone like Pervez Musharraf had gone for lunch in 2001.  And why did he go?  Because that war and terror needed the support of George W. Bush and Pervez Musharraf.  Is it okay ?  Because brother, where did we get terrorism from Pakistan, Osama bin Laden? Before this Ziaul Haq or any other leader like Ayub Khan have only talked and held meetings but such a grand welcome has not been given. Why has this happened now?  Because Asim Munir himself knew that PM Modi would come and Asim Munir wanted PM Modi to come. This matter should end and everyone should know that India and Pakistan are good friends, but PM Modi clearly said that we are not coming. Because what was happening was that he was also invited to the military parade.  And who knows, Asim Munir might be there?  You never know. This can definitely happen.  Because the crowd that was supposed to come, did not come. So here we will meet the Pentagon and also the State Department.  Now tell me, this is a high profile visit of Asim Munir.  Is it okay?  Now understand one thing that whatever America is doing, the relations between India and America are getting worse. And India-America relations cannot deteriorate because India gives intellectual power to America.  Ok?  We are the GC.  Global Capability Center.  So if India grows here in increasing the GDP of America, then America will grow.  There is some slogan like this.  Ok? And the Indians are all over America, Indians are there.  Friends, it would not be wrong to say this. Give us control of America. Who controls Africa?  Indians. India has all the business.  There are Indians in West Asia too.  There are Indians in West Asia. 10 million people live in the Gulf region. One pet reaction, look at how many there are in Saudi Arabia and UAE and like these Pakistanis are laborers or they do lowly jobs, Indians reach high positions. Reaches a very high position.  Are you understanding?  So, in a way, if the relations between India and America get spoilt, then that is why Americans are jealous of Indians.  Ok?  What you see is the racism online against Indians because it moves very fast. Look what Pakistan has to face ?  They know that people will not move forward. Leave them alone.  Ok?  But whoever comes in competition with you, you will do that to him.  So what is here is that the relations between India and America can get very bad and are getting worse. This same Google man said that you are engaging with the Army Chief of Pakistan. And you hosted us here at the White House. Ayub Khan Ziaul Haq also held meetings.  But if it is not hosted then the relations between India and America will deteriorate significantly.  Is it okay?  And the most dangerous thing is what has Trump said about Pakistan? Donald Trump has said so many wrong things about Pakistan and has stopped so many ads. But now see, everything has changed. Now at this time they are calling top generals and doing press conference.  In South Asia, they show that brother, we are power brokers and we should get the Nobel Peace Prize. So these things are why New Delhi will not tolerate this because the line has been crossed. We will not tolerate everything and you need India.  America needs India. We have a trade deficit with America and now every leader including PM Modi will have to take a very strict stand.  And at the same time it was also said here that there are three men regarding the military, Iran and counter terrorism. One is counter terrorism, one is Iran related accounting and the other is their crypto related one.  So Donald Trump will talk on these three issues â€“ counter terrorism, China, crypto currency and critical minerals.  Is it okay ?  So now see, crypto currency will destroy Pakistan.  If crypto mining starts.  Is it okay? After that, if we talk about China, Pakistan also wants that we should balance our relations with both China and America. Ok?  Is ISK okay when it comes to counter terrorism ?  For example, America just said that we felt good when you gave them the terrorists of Islamic State Khorasan who have set up bases on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran.   They have established bases on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  So they consider Pakistan as an interlocutor.  That their influence is more there.  All the terrorists listen to him.  And Pakistan feels that America will be able to put pressure on India on many things including the Indus Water Treaty. But India will not listen to the bell. Keep saying whatever you want to say.  And now Pakistan is saying that it is giving information about the terrorists to America, that means it is giving information about these terrorists to America and America is also praising it a lot because Pakistan has a hand in the strikes that have taken place.  So see how Pakistan is playing a double game. He is supporting these terrorists and is giving this information to America and the same America is striking them.  Is it okay?  So this is it. Rest, you know about Kurila's statement, how much press he has given to Pakistan, he said that Pakistan is very important.  There is no binary switch.  It is important that we work with both countries.  Now you know about all these things, Pakistan has said that look, a National Crypto Currency Reserve should be created.  Now let me tell you ideally. Crypto trading is illegal in Pakistan. could you believe? Crypto trading is illegal in Pakistan and their PM says that we will create a crypto currency reserve.  You can see what kind of country this is.  Where they have declared crypto currency illegal.  He says that we will create a crypto currency reserve. And Donald Trump's family has invested the most money in crypto.  Are you understanding?  So you can assume this and if we talk about critical minerals as well, then there are many such deposits in Balochistan.  Isn't it?  Critical minerals, China has also banned critical minerals. It has imposed a ban on rare earth elements. America is finding all these things very good.  But what is happening with this?  Because of this, one Pakistani will also be ruined. Completely based on the conditions of America. After that India will go away and ultimately friends, they will not get anything. it is.  What do you think, please tell me in the comment box.
