[Music] welcome to hard talk i'm stephen sacker the daily street protest demanding the resignation of belarus's authoritarian president alexander lukashenko haven't yet tipped the balance against his regime lukashenka is still there the security forces are still doing his bidding so how is the geopolitics of this going to play out well my guest is katanas nausea the president of neighboring lithuania will moscow's will prevail in belarus or will people power take the country in a new direction [Music] president guitarist in vilnius welcome to hard talk good evening mr president how do you see the power dynamic in belarus right now do you think president lukashenka has ridden out the storm yes of course alexander lukashenko tries to buy the time and tries to suppress the protests of peaceful people in the streets right now the people are fighting for their fundamental rights to have free elections to express the opinion about what is going on in belarus and unfortunately we see a lot of violations and discontinues and it brings very huge concern to all of us not only for neighboring countries lithuania latvia and estonia poland ukraine but also for european union this is the reason why we started to react very fast and we proposed the plan of de-escalation of situation we consolidated our efforts together with presidents of uh surrounding countries uh unfortunately alexander lukashenko was not ready to take this initiative and he turned to roberts vladimir putin probably this is the reason why the situation in last days and last weeks the theory is deteriorating and we see again the violations we see just detained people disappearing people and we see very selective and targeted attacks against the people or persons which are in national coordination committee so the situation is not home and it's not yeah the situation is certainly not calm mr president you just referred to alexander lukashenko as the president of belarus i want to be very clear about this do you still recognize his legitimacy as the head of state or are you now of the view that he has no legitimacy because as you said recently there was no free fair election in belarus so is he legitimate or not i am talking about alexandre lukashenko as person and of course we cannot uh talk about the elections which took place on august 9th as fair and free elections so the result is not legitimate and alexander lukashenko is not legitimate president of this country but of course nobody can neglect and to reject that alexander lukashenko still has certain power and this power he is using unfortunately in very bad direction and then we can uh not agree on this you are the the neighbor of belarus you are where most of the belarusian senior opposition figures who have been forced out of belarus have gathered not least svetlana ticonovskaya who was of course the candidate who ran against lukashenka and she claims she won that election had it not been rigged so are you saying that miss tikanovskaya is actually the winner of that election and are you recognizing her as the de facto uh leader of belarus in exile we can call here as the factor leader but the problem is that the elections of uh august 9th they're spoiled and we cannot prove it by giving the figures giving the result and nobody can say what votes are the votes indeed and what votes are the fake votes because the appearance rate in some districts of belarus during this election was more than one hundred percent so this is a problem to say what was the real result we can guess that uh madame zikanovskaya was the winner of those elections we treat here as a national leader and she is the leader of opposition movement right now she is in lithuania for the moment and she is safe and safe together with her family right so you are offering her protection but i just wonder how helpless how frustrated do you feel right now mr president you as you've said you've spoken out very loud against lukashenko for weeks now but even today as we speak to each other the belarusian paramilitary forces are still continuing to repress the protesters they are picking up senior opposition figures on the streets they picked up another one a very short time ago maxime znack that forum follows the detention of maria colis kolesnikova you know this is continuing your voice makes no difference uh so this is the reason why we need actions yes rhetoric is good but rhetoric even strong rhetoric is not enough we need actions and free baltic states took the initiative and showed this example how to deal with lukashenko and initiated the national sanctions lists we have 30 persons in each of this list including alexander lukashenko i i am stressing that it's extremely important that other regions and countries european union as a whole united states united kingdom canada should apply the same sanctions to the belarusian regime and yes we had the european council some time ago i was very satisfied with the with the result of this council because there were strong commitments strong judgment of the situation all leaders spoken about a very clear vision what to do with belarus but unfortunately so far we do not see the list of european union and according to some drafts i can say that there are 17 persons included and lukashenko excluded from this list so this is very this is mr president let me stop you there this is very important people around the world need to hear what you think is going on you're saying that as you understand it the eu's list of potential targets for new sanctions in belarus the individuals do not include lukashenko himself now you baltic states have already imposed your targeted sanctions on a list of individuals including lukashenko so why do you think the european union as a whole is not following your lead the logic behind is to leave some room for possible mediation in the future we leave the door or the window open for possible negotiations with alexander lukashenko of course including the representatives of civil society but i really have my doubts that this is still possible we see that this certain breaking point and this breaking point is the contacts of alexander lukashenko with the russian president vladimir putin and we see that lukashenko is just not ready to have any mediation especially from the side of european union and what is extremely important the mediation includes the representatives of civil society if there are no representatives of civil society what mediation is it mediation between lukashenko and putin we are not we are talking not about this mediation we are talking about the mediation which includes every party and this is not the case and i have very big doubts that it will happen in the future because of unfortunately a limited readiness of alexander lukashenko to go this way let me be blunt with you why do you think the big powers in the european union including france and germany are not prepared to go as far and condemn lukashenko in the same language that you use why you know we are very close to belarus nation not only in geographic sense but also in emotional sense we feel the pain of those people in the streets of minsk and other cities and other villages in belarus we see how they are suffering we hear the stories about violations about the tortures and just we emotionally are very close to them maybe this is not the case if we are talking if we are talking about the countries which are really distant from from from uh belarus but nevertheless it's extremely important to find this common denominator in european union and sometimes it's it's pretty hard to find this solution even if they find the solution at the political level do you think and you just use the word torture about what is going on with the paramilitary forces in belarus do you think that right now alexander lukashenko is guilty of crimes against humanity and do you want to see him prosecuted for what is happening right now i'm mindful that your foreign minister mr linkovichus recently said that he is seeing stalinist nk nkvd methods being applied on the streets of minsk in 21st century europe if you are serious about that then presumably you want to see lukashenko in a courtroom you know first of all we need clear and detailed investigation and this investigation is not possible right now if this investigation is over then we can name the persons who are guilty for these violences but you are totally right by saying that it reminds us just soviet time we see how they are targeting targeting the people which are in national coordination committee or council svetlana alexeyevich other members of a coordination council i remember the time about 40 50 years ago and this time was in soviet union rostropovich solzhenitsyn they were extradicted from the country and they were persecuted and we see the same story here in belarus so it shows that the people are different the new generations are coming but the methods of certain institutions remain the same you're playing a dangerous game mr president uh vilnius where you sit today has been described as the second capital of the belarusian opposition everything you've told me today shows how determined you are to speak out against lukashenko and demand an end to his regime you are going to be directly at odds with moscow and you know it and it is very possible that you will suffer consequences as a result of that you know democratic values principal values does not have the price this is not cost benefit analysis like in the economic policy or economic analysis this is the principles fundamental values we strongly believe in we didn't forget our history newest history of lithuania let me remind you 30 years ago lithium declared the independency and it was a like dark tunnel in our life and we had hope that there will be light on the end of this tunnel and at that time small country iceland far away from lithuania stepped in and recognized our independency and we didn't forget it we think that now we must do the same the iceland did 30 years ago but the danger is you may be inadvertently assisting vladimir putin he wants to portray what is happening in belarus's an exercise in meddling from western interests the european union nato forces trying to move into russia's sphere of influence and he says that is illegitimate and dangerous fought not just for minsk but for moscow as well by being so strident you may be helping putin with his narrative you know you can not push anyone who is already hacked by the beer so i think this is a consequence of economic policy or economic model who lukashenko implemented in the last 20 years and this economic model was based on the cheap energy resources coming from russia cheap salaries or cheap labor force and of course it's not sustainable the russian economy is not competitive and he it could be kept above the water only with cheap energy resources from russia what is now going uh just we see height in deafness adapt in depthness of belarus towards russia about 50 of this debt belongs to russia and we see economic trade ties very close ties with russia and of course in this situation luke paschenko loses its power and putin has many instruments in many instruments just to achieve his goal and his goal is ultimate goal is to merge both states into one body and now he sees lukashenko as very convenient partner who lost the power and he who is totally exposed to the will of vladimir putin we should not blame the russian people that the situation is like this but what is the end game here mr president you've just said the russians want to see belarus effectively merged with russia by economic and political means and they will use whatever leverage they have over lukashenka to achieve that in the next few weeks and months so what's the end game if lukashenko looks like he is going to be toppled do you believe russia will intervene militarily i think there is no need to intervene militarily because they can use another instruments and probably they learn some lessons from ukraine so i think they will try to intervene in much more subtle way and much will depend on the people of on the ordinary people which are protesting in the streets and and we have to help them and european union and other powers in the world should not stand uh aside and just uh expressing the rhetoric rhetoric is not enough today we need actions and we need actions as quick as possible because otherwise it will be too late i want to ask you a question based on a bigger picture that is whether you are worried right now that the will of the west and let's talk about both the european union and nato the will of the western powers to stand up to vladimir putin is not good enough not strong enough i'm thinking for example of the fairly muted reaction so far to what the germans insist was the poisoning of alexi navalny on russian territory i'm also thinking of the american decision earlier this summer to begin withdrawing troops from germany and president macron recently saying that he fears nato is brain dead do you fear that the west is losing the will to confront vladimir putin i expect much more uh really i hope that we have to find the real political will to act more much more decisively we do right now so this is a problem european union was blamed many times that european union reacts to slow to late and too little so let us to prove that the reality is different let us to take decisive measures and i hope that it will happen nato as an organization is totally good for lithuania we think that nato organization the brain of nato is not dead and we enjoy very good cooperation with nato on many levels on the level of common military plans we have enhanced forward presence in lithuania several years in the row we ourself we are very serious and and responsible member of nato a lie of the nato spending two percent of gdp and we expect that other countries will do the same will increase the defense spending i don't think that the potential of nato is exhausted i think that this is only one organization very effective organization of defense and deterrence mr president we're almost out of time i want to raise one other issue with you you've talked about your discontent with the eu reaction to what is happening in belarus but of course the eu is preoccupied with other challenges not least uh ironing out all of the problems connected with brexit the british are due to end their transition relationship with the eu at the end of this year and the hope is there will be a trade agreement but right now that looks very difficult not least because the british government has just declared that it is going to pass legislation in the british parliament which ministers have explicitly said will override elements of the withdrawal agreement with the eu and which will in fact violate international law now as a head of state of an eu member how do you feel about what the british government is currently doing i feel not good and i regret the decision of united kingdom to leave european union but i respect this decision but now what is going on to renegotiate to correct the withdrawal agreement is just not acceptable and this is really pretty hard to talk about such things because we have to respect what we reached during very long negotiation period with big efforts of maine negotiators and we achieved this result and it's just not appropriate to reconsider this agreement right now and a final thought all of the tough talk right now from london from the boris johnson government about how they uh within weeks may well have to walk away from any effort to get a trade agreement and accept that there will be no trade deal with the eu after december 31st of this year do you see this as just more political maneuvering and bluffing or do you take it seriously when boris johnson says that britain can regard no deal as a good outcome is he being serious or not no deal is not good outcome for everybody for all countries for european union and for britain too so we are interested and i'm talking not only about european union but also about my country we are interested to have the process done and to have the united kingdom as a good foreign trade partner we are like-minded countries in other fields too security defense policy so let us cooperate in the future and let us not undermine our good cooperation until now all right well mr president katanas naseeda i thank you very much indeed for joining me from vilnius [Music] so [Music] you
