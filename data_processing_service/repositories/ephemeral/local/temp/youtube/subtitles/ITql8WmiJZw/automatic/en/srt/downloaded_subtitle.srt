authoritarian president alexander

lukashenko

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
haven't yet tipped the balance against

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,480
his regime

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
lukashenka is still there the security

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,720
forces are still

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
doing his bidding so how is the

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,720

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,400
welcome to hard talk

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,560
good evening mr president how do you

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,960
see the power dynamic in belarus

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,479
right now do you think president

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,920
lukashenka

27
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,240
has ridden out the storm yes of course

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,200
alexander lukashenko tries to buy the

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,119
time and tries to suppress

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,920
the protests of peaceful people

31
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,880
in the streets right now the people are

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
fighting for

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
their fundamental rights to have free

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
elections

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,479
to express the opinion about what is

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,799
going on in belarus

37
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,840
and unfortunately we see a lot of

38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,600
violations

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
and discontinues and it brings very huge

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
concern

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,079
to all of us not only for neighboring

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,720
countries

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,759
lithuania latvia and estonia poland

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,200
ukraine

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,360
but also for european union

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
this is the reason why we started to

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
react very fast

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,080
and we proposed the plan of

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
de-escalation of situation

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
we consolidated our efforts together

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
with

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
presidents of uh surrounding countries

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
uh unfortunately alexander lukashenko

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
was

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,120
not ready to take this initiative

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,599
and he turned to roberts vladimir putin

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
probably this is the reason why the

58
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,680
situation

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,959
in last days and last weeks the theory

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,160
is deteriorating and we see

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,920
again the violations we see

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,519
just detained people disappearing people

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,720
and we see very selective and targeted

64
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,760
attacks against the

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
people or persons which are in national

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,159
coordination committee

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
so the situation is not home and it's

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
not

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,200
yeah the situation is certainly not calm

70
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
mr president

71
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
you just referred to alexander

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
lukashenko

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
as the president of belarus i want to be

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,080
very clear about this do you still

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,159
recognize his legitimacy as the head of

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,040
state or are you now

77
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,760
of the view that he has no legitimacy

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,200
because

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,920
as you said recently there was no

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,440
free fair election in belarus so is he

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,959
legitimate or not

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,560
i am talking about alexandre lukashenko

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,239
as person and of course we cannot

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,680
uh talk about the elections which took

85
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,840
place on august 9th as

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,200
fair and free elections so the result is

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,159
not legitimate and alexander lukashenko

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
is not legitimate president of this

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,680
country

90
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,640
but of course nobody can neglect and to

91
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,200
reject that

92
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,080
alexander lukashenko still has certain

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
power

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,959
and this power he is using unfortunately

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,440
in very bad direction and then we can uh

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
not agree on this you are the the

97
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
neighbor

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,960
of belarus you are where most of the

99
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,280
belarusian senior opposition figures who

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,000
have been forced out of belarus have

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
gathered not least svetlana ticonovskaya

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
who was of course the

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
candidate who ran against lukashenka and

104
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
she claims

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
she won that election had it not been

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,440
rigged so are you

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
saying that miss tikanovskaya is

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,320
actually the winner of that election and

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,479
are you recognizing her as the de facto

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,000
uh leader of belarus in exile

111
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,280
we can call here as the factor leader

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,320
but the problem is that the elections of

113
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,840
uh august 9th they're spoiled

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,680
and we cannot prove it by giving the

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,840
figures giving the result

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,960
and nobody can say what votes are

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,000
the votes indeed and what votes are the

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
fake votes

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,400
because the appearance rate in some

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,880
districts of belarus

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
during this election was more than one

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
hundred percent

123
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,680
so this is a problem to say what was the

124
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
real result

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,919
we can guess that uh madame zikanovskaya

126
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
was the winner of those elections we

127
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,280
treat here as a

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,360
national leader and she is

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
the leader of opposition movement right

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
now

131
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,120
she is in lithuania for the moment and

132
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,680
she is safe and safe together with

133
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
her family right so you are offering her

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
protection but i just wonder how

135
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,720
helpless how frustrated do you feel

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
right now mr president you

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,720
as you've said you've spoken out very

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,160
loud

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,039
against lukashenko for weeks now

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,440
but even today as we speak to each other

141
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,319
the belarusian paramilitary forces

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,319
are still continuing to repress the

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,360
protesters they are picking up

144
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,400
senior opposition figures on the streets

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,039
they picked up

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,120
another one a very short time ago maxime

147
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,319
znack that forum follows the

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,199
detention of maria colis kolesnikova

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
you know this is continuing your voice

150
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,680
makes no difference

151
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,560
uh so this is the reason why we need

152
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
actions

153
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,400
yes rhetoric is good but rhetoric even

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,120
strong rhetoric is not enough

155
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,000
we need actions and free baltic states

156
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
took the initiative and showed this

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
example

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,639
how to deal with lukashenko and

159
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,160
initiated the national sanctions lists

160
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,599
we have 30 persons in each of this list

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,240
including alexander lukashenko i

162
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
i am stressing that it's extremely

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
important

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,880
that other regions and countries

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,919
european union as a whole united states

166
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
united kingdom canada should

167
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,319
apply the same sanctions to the

168
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,840
belarusian regime

169
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,039
and yes we had the european council some

170
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
time ago

171
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
i was very satisfied with the with the

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
result of this council because there

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,680
were

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,039
strong commitments strong judgment of

175
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,160
the situation

176
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,360
all leaders spoken

177
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
about a very clear vision what to do

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
with

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,000
belarus but unfortunately so far we do

180
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
not see

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
the list of european union and according

182
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,000
to some

183
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,919
drafts i can say that there are 17

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,599
persons included

185
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,800
and lukashenko excluded from this list

186
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,400
so this is very this is mr president

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
let me stop you there this is very

188
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
important people around the world need

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
to hear what you think is going on

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
you're saying that as you understand it

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,479
the eu's

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
list of potential targets for new

193
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,120
sanctions in belarus

194
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,759
the individuals do not include

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
lukashenko himself now you baltic states

196
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
have already imposed

197
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,519
your targeted sanctions on a list of

198
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,959
individuals including lukashenko

199
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,159
so why do you think the european union

200
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,719
as a whole

201
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:46,080
is not following your lead

202
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,640
the logic behind is to leave

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
some room for possible mediation in the

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,080
future

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,519
we leave the door or the window open

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
for possible negotiations with alexander

207
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
lukashenko

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,200
of course including the representatives

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,640
of civil society

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,920
but i really have my doubts

211
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,480
that this is still possible we

212
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,959
see that this certain breaking point and

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,760
this breaking point is the contacts

214
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,600
of alexander lukashenko with the russian

215
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,720
president vladimir putin

216
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,160
and we see that lukashenko is just not

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,640
ready to have any mediation

218
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
especially from the side of european

219
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
union

220
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
and what is extremely important the

221
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,959
mediation

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
includes the representatives of civil

223
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,200
society if there are no representatives

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,399
of civil society

225
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,880
what mediation is it mediation between

226
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,040
lukashenko and putin we are not we are

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
talking not about this mediation we are

228
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,920
talking about

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,720
the mediation which includes every party

230
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,560
and this is not the case and i have very

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
big doubts that it will happen in the

232
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
future

233
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,800
because of unfortunately

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,279
a limited readiness of alexander

235
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,720
lukashenko to go this way let me be

236
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
blunt with you

237
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,200
why do you think the big powers in the

238
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
european union including france and

239
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,120
germany are not prepared

240
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,560
to go as far and condemn lukashenko

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,600
in the same language that you use

242
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,839
why you know we

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,800
are very close to belarus nation

244
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,480
not only in geographic sense but also in

245
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
emotional sense

246
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,880
we feel the pain of those people in the

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,079
streets of minsk and

248
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
other cities and other villages in

249
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
belarus

250
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,480
we see how they are suffering

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,000
we hear the stories about

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,440
violations about the tortures

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
and just we emotionally are very close

254
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
to them

255
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
maybe this is not the case if we are

256
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
talking

257
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
if we are talking about the countries

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,959
which are

259
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,440
really distant from from from uh belarus

260
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,200
but nevertheless it's extremely

261
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
important to find this common

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
denominator in european union and

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,120
sometimes it's

264
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,360
it's pretty hard to find this solution

265
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,640
even if they find the solution at the

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
political level

267
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,720
do you think and you just use the word

268
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
torture about what is going on with the

269
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
paramilitary forces

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,800
in belarus do you think

271
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,519
that right now alexander lukashenko is

272
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,120
guilty of crimes against humanity and do

273
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
you want to see him

274
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
prosecuted for what is happening right

275
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
now i'm mindful that your foreign

276
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
minister mr

277
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,920
linkovichus recently said that he

278
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,160
is seeing stalinist nk

279
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,519
nkvd methods being applied on the

280
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,639
streets of minsk

281
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,480
in 21st century europe if you are

282
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,120
serious about that then presumably you

283
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,160
want to see lukashenko in a courtroom

284
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,680
you know first of all we need clear

285
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,240
and detailed investigation

286
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,440
and this investigation is not possible

287
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
right now

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
if this investigation is over then we

289
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
can

290
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,279
name the persons who are guilty for

291
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
these violences

292
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,800
but you are totally right by saying that

293
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,079
it reminds us just soviet time

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,639
we see how they are targeting

295
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,639
targeting the people which are in

296
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,600
national coordination committee or

297
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,200
council

298
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,000
svetlana alexeyevich other members of

299
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,200
a coordination council i remember

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the time about 40 50 years ago

301
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,000
and this time was in soviet union

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
rostropovich

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,160
solzhenitsyn they were

304
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
extradicted from the country and they

305
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,519
were

306
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,639
persecuted and we see the same story

307
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,079
here in belarus

308
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,959
so it shows that the people are

309
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,839
different

310
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
the new generations are coming but the

311
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
methods

312
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,480
of certain institutions remain the same

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
you're playing a dangerous game mr

314
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
president uh

315
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
vilnius where you sit today has been

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
described as

317
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,040
the second capital of the belarusian

318
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
opposition everything you've told me

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,880
today shows how determined you are

320
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,079
to speak out against lukashenko

321
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,480
and demand an end to his regime

322
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,600
you are going to be directly at odds

323
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
with moscow

324
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and you know it and it is very possible

325
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,120
that you will suffer consequences as a

326
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,720
result of that

327
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
you know democratic values principal

328
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
values

329
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,800
does not have the price this is not cost

330
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,920
benefit analysis like in the economic

331
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,519
policy or

332
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,639
economic analysis this is the

333
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,560
principles fundamental values we

334
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,160
strongly believe in

335
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,519
we didn't forget our history

336
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,760
newest history of lithuania let me

337
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,680
remind you

338
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,480
30 years ago lithium declared the

339
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,519
independency

340
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,880
and it was a like dark

341
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,240
tunnel in our life and we had

342
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,519
hope that there will be light on the end

343
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,199
of this tunnel

344
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,480
and at that time small country

345
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,000
iceland far away from lithuania stepped

346
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,040
in and recognized our independency

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,639
and we didn't forget it we think that

348
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,240
now we must do the same the iceland

349
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,680
did 30 years ago but the danger is

350
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,480
you may be inadvertently assisting

351
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
vladimir putin he wants to portray what

352
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,399
is happening

353
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,639
in belarus's an exercise in meddling

354
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,199
from western interests the european

355
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,959
union

356
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,959
nato forces trying to move into

357
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,000
russia's sphere of influence and he says

358
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,800
that is illegitimate and dangerous

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
fought not just for minsk but for moscow

360
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,720
as well

361
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,000
by being so strident you may be

362
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,680
helping putin with his narrative

363
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,639
you know you can not push

364
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,759
anyone who is already hacked

365
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,639
by the beer so

366
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,399
i think this is a consequence of

367
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,320
economic policy

368
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,639
or economic model who

369
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
lukashenko implemented in the last 20

370
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,279
years and this

371
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,399
economic model was based on the cheap

372
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:06,959
energy resources coming from russia

373
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:10,240
cheap salaries or cheap labor force

374
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,519
and of course it's not sustainable the

375
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,120
russian economy is not competitive

376
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,160
and he it could be kept

377
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,279
above the water only with cheap energy

378
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,120
resources from russia what is now

379
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:30,480
going uh just we see height in deafness

380
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,000
adapt in depthness of belarus towards

381
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,120
russia about 50

382
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,040
of this debt belongs to russia and

383
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,639
we see economic trade ties very close

384
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,360
ties with russia

385
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,240
and of course in this situation luke

386
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,839
paschenko

387
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,279
loses its power and putin has

388
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:55,199
many instruments in many instruments

389
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,399
just to achieve his goal and his goal

390
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,680
is ultimate goal is to merge

391
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,039
both states into one body and

392
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,240
now he sees lukashenko

393
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,959
as very convenient partner who lost the

394
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,319
power

395
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,720
and he who is totally exposed to the

396
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:19,839
will

397
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,839
of vladimir putin

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,280
we should not blame the russian people

399
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
that

400
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,160
the situation is like this but what is

401
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,480
the end game here mr president you've

402
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,080
just said the russians want to see

403
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,559
belarus effectively merged with russia

404
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,679
by economic and political means and they

405
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
will use

406
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
whatever leverage they have over

407
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
lukashenka to achieve that in the next

408
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
few

409
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,080
weeks and months so what's the end game

410
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,440
if lukashenko looks like he

411
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,120
is going to be toppled do you believe

412
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,320
russia will intervene militarily

413
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,520
i think there is no need to intervene

414
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
militarily because they can use another

415
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
instruments

416
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
and probably they learn some lessons

417
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,840
from ukraine

418
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:14,240
so i think they will try to

419
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,840
intervene in much more subtle way

420
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,200
and much will depend on the

421
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,480
people of on the ordinary people which

422
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,160
are protesting in the streets and and we

423
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,200
have to help them

424
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,640
and european union and other powers

425
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,080
in the world should not stand

426
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,880
uh aside and just uh

427
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,000
expressing the rhetoric rhetoric is not

428
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
enough today

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,480
we need actions and we need actions as

430
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,120
quick as possible because

431
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,760
otherwise it will be too late i want to

432
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,720
ask you

433
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,600
a question based on a bigger picture

434
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,080
that is

435
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,120
whether you are worried right now that

436
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
the will

437
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,760
of the west and let's talk about both

438
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,799
the european union and nato

439
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,120
the will of the western powers to stand

440
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,039
up to vladimir putin

441
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,799
is not good enough not strong enough i'm

442
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,000
thinking for example

443
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,400
of the fairly muted reaction so far

444
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
to what the germans insist was the

445
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
poisoning

446
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,360
of alexi navalny on russian

447
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
territory i'm also thinking of the

448
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,880
american

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,320
decision earlier this summer to begin

450
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
withdrawing troops

451
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,160
from germany and president macron

452
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,520
recently saying that he fears nato

453
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,640
is brain dead do you fear that

454
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,320
the west is losing the will to confront

455
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,400
vladimir putin

456
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,679
i expect much more uh really i hope that

457
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
we have to find the real political will

458
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,120
to act

459
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
more much more decisively we do right

460
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,520
now

461
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,919
so this is a problem european union

462
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,039
was blamed many times that european

463
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
union reacts

464
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,679
to slow to late and too little so

465
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
let us to prove that the reality is

466
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,760
different

467
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,120
let us to take decisive measures

468
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,039
and i hope that it will happen nato as

469
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,559
an organization is

470
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,840
totally good for lithuania we think that

471
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,280
nato organization

472
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,480
the brain of nato is not dead

473
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,039
and we enjoy very good cooperation with

474
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
nato

475
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,720
on many levels on the level of

476
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,520
common military plans we have enhanced

477
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,880
forward presence in lithuania

478
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,000
several years in the row we

479
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,880
ourself we are very serious and

480
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,840
and responsible member of nato a lie of

481
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,400
the nato

482
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
spending two percent of gdp and we

483
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
expect

484
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
that other countries will do the same

485
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,200
will

486
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
increase the defense spending i don't

487
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
think that

488
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,080
the potential of nato is exhausted

489
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,120
i think that this is only one

490
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
organization

491
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,880
very effective organization of defense

492
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
and deterrence

493
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
mr president we're almost out of time i

494
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
want to raise one other issue

495
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
with you you've talked about your

496
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,080
discontent with the eu reaction to what

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,919
is happening in belarus but of course

498
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,039
the eu is preoccupied with other

499
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
challenges

500
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,360
not least uh ironing out all of the

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,640
problems connected with

502
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,600
brexit the british are due to end their

503
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
transition relationship with the eu at

504
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,480
the end

505
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,640
of this year and the hope is there will

506
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,120
be a trade agreement but right now that

507
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,679
looks very difficult not least because

508
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,440
the british government has just declared

509
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,080
that it is going to

510
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799
pass legislation in the british

511
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,840
parliament

512
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,120
which ministers have explicitly said

513
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,400
will override elements of the withdrawal

514
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,559
agreement with the eu

515
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,240
and which will in fact violate

516
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,679
international law

517
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,840
now as a head of state of an eu member

518
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
how do you feel about what the british

519
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,200
government is currently doing

520
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,000
i feel not good and i regret the

521
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
decision

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,840
of united kingdom to leave european

523
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
union

524
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,720
but i respect this decision but now what

525
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,280
is going on to

526
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,080
renegotiate to correct the withdrawal

527
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,280
agreement

528
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,799
is just not acceptable

529
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,480
and this is really

530
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,200
pretty hard to talk about such things

531
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
because we have to respect what we

532
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
reached

533
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,159
during very long negotiation period with

534
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,440
big efforts of

535
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,320
maine negotiators and we achieved this

536
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
result

537
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,320
and it's just not appropriate to

538
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,080
reconsider this agreement right now and

539
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,840
a final thought all of the tough talk

540
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
right now from london from the boris

541
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,640
johnson government about how they

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,440
uh within weeks may well have to walk

543
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
away from

544
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,120
any effort to get a trade agreement and

545
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,320
accept that there will be no trade deal

546
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,360
with the eu

547
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,159
after december 31st of this year do you

548
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,480
see this

549
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
as just more political maneuvering and

550
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
bluffing

551
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
or do you take it seriously when boris

552
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,280
johnson says that britain

553
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,240
can regard no deal as a good outcome

554
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,679
is he being serious or not no deal is

555
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,720
not good outcome for

556
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,280
everybody for all countries for european

557
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,120
union

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and for britain too so we are interested

559
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,520
and i'm talking not only about european

560
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,120
union but also about my country

561
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,159
we are interested to have the

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,039
process done and to have the united

563
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,640
kingdom as a good foreign trade partner

564
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:55,120
we are like-minded countries in

565
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,640
other fields too security defense policy

566
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,919
so let us cooperate in the future

567
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,039
and let us not undermine our good

568
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,679
cooperation until now all right well mr

569
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,159
president katanas naseeda i thank you
