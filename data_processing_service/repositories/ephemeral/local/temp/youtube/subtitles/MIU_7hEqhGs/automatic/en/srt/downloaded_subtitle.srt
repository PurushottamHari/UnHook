1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,720
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:17,039
Rajnath Singh has said two very important things.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:19,279
Firstly, he has said that

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,439
Pakistan will have to face very serious

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,840
consequences.  We will

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080
destroy Pakistan if Pakistan

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
attacks now.  And secondly he has said that

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
Operation Sindoor is still going on.  So

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
we will look at both things.  Let me tell you

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,040
friends that you can avail our wonderful course which is a

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,480

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
combo of Chanakya Niti and Personality Development.  You will

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,559
benefit a lot.  So friends

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
what does this mean?  What is happening now?  What is

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,520
happening now is that America and Pakistan are

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,600
doing Dhinkha Chika together.  Both the countries are

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,039

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,559
developing very good relations with each other.  Now Operation Sindoor has happened and

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,680
you have heard from every leader that

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,280
Operation Sindoor is still

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,240
going on.  what does this mean friend?

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,280
What does it mean?  One meaning of this could be

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,320
that we are still killing terrorists selectively.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,240
Secondly it could be that

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,400
we have put it on hold for now.  Actually,

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,119
we have

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,600
not received any result regarding this.  The result was that

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,240
Pakistan was in trouble and

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
its DGMO called.  No cease fire

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
agreement has been signed.  Nothing.   It has

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
just been discussed that it is on hold, so it

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,960
means Operation Sindoor is still going on.  If

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
India attacks then no country can say anything

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,400
because we can tell that my brother,

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
Operation Sindoor is still going on and

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,640
we have not signed any agreement like Shimla Agreement.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
So that is why every leader is saying this

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,439
and everyone is saying this.  In fact,

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,200
our army, our

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,600
Chief of Defence, Anil Chauhan was also saying

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,799
that Operation Sindoor is still

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,439
going on.  Ok?  And the third thing

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,240
could be that India is planning something big to

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,439
enter India and

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,599
do something.  So what do you think out of the three

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,239
or if you have any other point then please

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,319
tell me.  Then after that Rajnath

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,160
Singh has said one more thing that terrible

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,560
consequences will have to be faced.  See where

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
terrible consequences will happen.  Where the

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
Defence Minister of Pakistan,

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,400
Khawaja Asif, it is absolutely certain that

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
he speaks anything after taking cheap drugs, he

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
himself accepts defeat, accepts defeat, he

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,160
himself tells everything, we need to do more, that

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,160
Khawaja Asif also likes to say that

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,720
brother, if there are people like you, then here it

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
means that there is no need for an enemy,

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,280
you alone are enough, so he is telling that

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
that man is strange and our

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
Defence Minister speaks very carefully

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,959
but whatever he says has a

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,360
meaning, a deeper meaning,

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,959
so what does it mean, this also

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
gave a clear message to Pakistan and this

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,480
timing is very right because Asim Munir has

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,599
again gone to America and sung the Bharat Labh Bharat

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,319
Raag and there is hatred against India,

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,959
in his speech, he had invited very few

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,680
Pakistanis and

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
when I saw this speech there, although its

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,120
bytes are not properly available,

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
but many news articles had covered it, so a

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
lot of hatred against India was

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,800
spewed there as well.

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,920
Many slogans were also raised by the outsiders that the

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,920
killer of Islamabad, Asim Munir, well this is one

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,319
and after that Donald Trump made him have

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,800
lunch and fed him.  This report is coming,

82
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,879
I am not sure.  But it is also being said

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,680
that Iran has used the basis of Pakistan.

84
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,840
See, Pakistan has broken the spine of

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
Iran.  You should assume this.

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,440
Pakistan has given a strong spine to Iran.

87
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,239
Iran has been stabbed in the back, which was

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,080
expected from them because everyone says this.

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,840
Including Donald Trump has said

90
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,640
that you cannot trust Pakistan.

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,480
So where America and Pakistan are

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,440
coming very close, they have again

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
told India that we should forget the Indus Water Treaty.

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,840
Amit Shah even said that

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,400
we will sign the Indus Water Treaty only when Pakistan stops terrorism.

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,080
Ok?  So Pakistan is

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,159
not getting water from the Indus Water Treaty anyway.

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
So forget that and

99
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,040
whatever you do after that, if you

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,640
miss the adventure even a little, you will

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,079
have to suffer the consequences.  Now look at this, there

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,160
is instability in Iran and India is suffering loss due to this.

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
Why is there a loss?  Because many

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
militant groups can come to Pakistan and

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
then create problems in India also.

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,759
Especially in Kashmir and Pakistan

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,199
can help them in this.  Now see, India has

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,720
clearly told America and

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
Narendra Modi has also told Donald Trump that

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
you did not stop our war and stop saying this.

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
But still, he keeps speaking continuously.

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
I have told many times that Donald Trump's behaviour is narcissism

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
and Pakistan has understood that very

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
well.  Ok?  And India also

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
understood this.  India was also taking decisions accordingly.

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
Benjamin is

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,479
praising Natalia Hope Don Trump so much that

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,160
your name will be written in golden words.  So Donald

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
Trump is very happy right now.  He is very happy.

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
Ok?  And because then Pakistan is accepting everything he

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,600
says.  So this is a matter of

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,000
concern for India.  That is why

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
India has said in clear words that if you

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
come, we will not let you go this time.   Is it

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,919
okay?  We will search and kill you.

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
Friends another news is about Pahalgam attack that it is being said

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,720
that whatever I was reading in Indian Express,

131
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,400
I will cover that too, I will

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,400
bring a lecture that the sketches were

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,400
made wrongly and not a single terrorist

134
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,720
was local.  Now this raises very big questions.

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
We will talk about this also.

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
But for now, this is a direct warning from Rajnath Singh

137
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,680
to Pakistan.  So maybe

138
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,000
you will see that Pakistan does

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
not carry out terrorist attacks.  Because even now if you see,

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
in the Pahalgam attack he did not accept the responsibility and said, no

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,080
we did not do it.

142
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,479
Despite that we killed you because we know

143
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
where terrorism came from.  So now if it

144
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,680
happens next time then you can understand

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,759
what its scale will be.  How big can it be?

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
Ok?  So this was a small lecture, an analysis.

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,520
Be happy, keep reading.  This is

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
Siddhant signing off.
