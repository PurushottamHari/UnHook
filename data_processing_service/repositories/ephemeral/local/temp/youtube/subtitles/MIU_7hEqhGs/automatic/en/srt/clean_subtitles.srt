I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Rajnath Singh has said two very important things. Firstly, he has said that Pakistan will have to face very serious consequences.  We will destroy Pakistan if Pakistan attacks now.  And secondly he has said that Operation Sindoor is still going on.  So we will look at both things.  Let me tell you friends that you can avail our wonderful course which is a combo of Chanakya Niti and Personality Development.  You will benefit a lot.  So friends what does this mean?  What is happening now?  What is happening now is that America and Pakistan are doing Dhinkha Chika together.  Both the countries are developing very good relations with each other.  Now Operation Sindoor has happened and you have heard from every leader that Operation Sindoor is still going on.  what does this mean friend? What does it mean?  One meaning of this could be that we are still killing terrorists selectively. Secondly it could be that we have put it on hold for now.  Actually, we have not received any result regarding this.  The result was that Pakistan was in trouble and its DGMO called.  No cease fire agreement has been signed.  Nothing.   It has just been discussed that it is on hold, so it means Operation Sindoor is still going on.  If India attacks then no country can say anything because we can tell that my brother, Operation Sindoor is still going on and we have not signed any agreement like Shimla Agreement. So that is why every leader is saying this and everyone is saying this.  In fact, our army, our Chief of Defence, Anil Chauhan was also saying that Operation Sindoor is still going on.  Ok?  And the third thing could be that India is planning something big to enter India and do something.  So what do you think out of the three or if you have any other point then please tell me.  Then after that Rajnath Singh has said one more thing that terrible consequences will have to be faced.  See where terrible consequences will happen.  Where the Defence Minister of Pakistan, Khawaja Asif, it is absolutely certain that he speaks anything after taking cheap drugs, he himself accepts defeat, accepts defeat, he himself tells everything, we need to do more, that Khawaja Asif also likes to say that brother, if there are people like you, then here it means that there is no need for an enemy, you alone are enough, so he is telling that that man is strange and our Defence Minister speaks very carefully but whatever he says has a meaning, a deeper meaning, so what does it mean, this also gave a clear message to Pakistan and this timing is very right because Asim Munir has again gone to America and sung the Bharat Labh Bharat Raag and there is hatred against India, in his speech, he had invited very few Pakistanis and when I saw this speech there, although its bytes are not properly available, but many news articles had covered it, so a lot of hatred against India was spewed there as well. Many slogans were also raised by the outsiders that the killer of Islamabad, Asim Munir, well this is one and after that Donald Trump made him have lunch and fed him.  This report is coming, I am not sure.  But it is also being said that Iran has used the basis of Pakistan. See, Pakistan has broken the spine of Iran.  You should assume this. Pakistan has given a strong spine to Iran. Iran has been stabbed in the back, which was expected from them because everyone says this. Including Donald Trump has said that you cannot trust Pakistan. So where America and Pakistan are coming very close, they have again told India that we should forget the Indus Water Treaty. Amit Shah even said that we will sign the Indus Water Treaty only when Pakistan stops terrorism. Ok?  So Pakistan is not getting water from the Indus Water Treaty anyway. So forget that and whatever you do after that, if you miss the adventure even a little, you will have to suffer the consequences.  Now look at this, there is instability in Iran and India is suffering loss due to this. Why is there a loss?  Because many militant groups can come to Pakistan and then create problems in India also. Especially in Kashmir and Pakistan can help them in this.  Now see, India has clearly told America and Narendra Modi has also told Donald Trump that you did not stop our war and stop saying this. But still, he keeps speaking continuously. I have told many times that Donald Trump's behaviour is narcissism and Pakistan has understood that very well.  Ok?  And India also understood this.  India was also taking decisions accordingly. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Benjamin is praising Natalia Hope Don Trump so much that your name will be written in golden words.  So Donald Trump is very happy right now.  He is very happy. Ok?  And because then Pakistan is accepting everything he says.  So this is a matter of concern for India.  That is why India has said in clear words that if you come, we will not let you go this time.   Is it okay?  We will search and kill you. Friends another news is about Pahalgam attack that it is being said that whatever I was reading in Indian Express, I will cover that too, I will bring a lecture that the sketches were made wrongly and not a single terrorist was local.  Now this raises very big questions. We will talk about this also. But for now, this is a direct warning from Rajnath Singh to Pakistan.  So maybe you will see that Pakistan does not carry out terrorist attacks.  Because even now if you see, in the Pahalgam attack he did not accept the responsibility and said, no we did not do it. Despite that we killed you because we know where terrorism came from.  So now if it happens next time then you can understand what its scale will be.  How big can it be? Ok?  So this was a small lecture, an analysis. Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant signing off.
