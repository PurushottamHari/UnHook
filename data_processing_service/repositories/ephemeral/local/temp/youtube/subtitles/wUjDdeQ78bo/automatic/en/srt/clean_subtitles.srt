I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. I will take lecture on these two parts and I will tell you that there is a very big good news.  This war will end this week.  They are not doing anything.  These crazy kids are fooling us.  Do you understand?  What is happening now?  I will tell you the sequence from outside.  He will say, Oh my god, what is happening in this game?  Meaning, cause complete destruction.  Even your objectives were not achieved and then you are sitting at the table. Meaning it seems as if the missile is being tested.  The defense system is being tested.  Civilians are dying.  Friends, we will talk about it very well.  Let me tell you that NCERT Combined NCERT is currently available for Rs 2000.  We have turned on the coupon code as per your request.  So you can use NCERT 80 coupon code.  I have studied History, Philosophy, Economics and Geography on my own. And yes, if you want to take UPSC course, then you should take our course only.  The reason for this is that we are going to do something very big in the UPSC segment. We will tell you that on June 30.  Ok?  So now look, let me tell you what happened ?  What happened is that Iran has attacked, where?  On Qatar.  Ok?  The airbase of Qatar, the American airbase in Qatar has been attacked.  Now this is very big, oh my god how did this happen?  This has become dangerous. But the friend had already informed Qatar.  Iran had given early notice here. This is an article from Indian Express. Learned the news from Indian Express and everywhere.   I had already given you notice that here son, whatever I have for you, I am dying for you.  You die for us.  We are telling you this in advance.  Take out your people and take out the Americans also. And let me tell you that American airplanes have already left Qatar.  This has happened a long time ago.  That is an absolutely futile attack.  There is no meaning here.  You are not going to get anything.  Just to show people that yes, we attacked the American airbase. So early notice was given here.  No Qatari or American national has died.  There has been no loss of life or property to anyone. And Donald Trump confirmed this.  Now let's see what Donald Trump says.  You won't believe it. He said thank you to Iran.  Well, this lecture has two parts.  The next part which is the ceasefire announcement by Donald Trump, I will analyze it separately.  This is saying that I want to thank Iran that they gave us advance notice. They are saying a lot that Iran responded to our demands. He is talking to us exactly what we expected. 14 missiles have been fired.  On the 13th, we have destroyed their defense system.  The one that is there, we have left it free. But no Americans were harmed.  There has been no damage. And the most important thing is that he is outside our system. Now we just hope there will be no more hatred.  I want to thank Iran for informing us in advance. We were given early notice.  Wow, what a scene.  I have already told you that if we attack then we attack after informing them that yes we are coming to kill, son, shoot me, consider it as a bullet and subscribe, friends, you guys don't subscribe, it takes just a second, it instantly.  Ok?  So then he is saying that there will be a complete and total ceasefire.  I will make a separate lecture on this.  Now friends, the biggest question is why did Iran do this ?  Iran has not destroyed its nuclear program. I took the lecture yesterday also. Why has it not happened?  Because Iran itself has said and it is absolutely certain that we have already taken out 60% uranium, 30% and 3.67% enriched uranium. So there will be no attack.  It does n't make any difference to me.  Jump as much as you can.  Isn't it?  You just wasted your money.  Showed B2 Bomber to the world.  If he buys it then it's fine.  But we are telling you that nothing happened to us brother.  We are safe.  We have saved our nuclear program. And let me tell you one more thing.  America had also informed Iran earlier.  This is a report from June 22. America had also already spoken about it.  I told him privately, listen, listen, we are going to attack you.  We will attack, then come to the table.  These things mean that in a way America had clearly said that we will resume the negotiations. We will attack.  You attack and then there will be negotiations.  that's over.  So friends, this war will end this week itself. You will see it.  Is it okay?  Now after that see, Israel is not stopping. Israel's ego has just been satisfied.  Everyone's ego got satisfied here.  Donald Trump's ego was also satisfied. Although Tehran said that there will be no agreement but everything will happen.  Because Tehran also knows that our economic situation is very bad and if we do something like this then America will destroy our colony.  Is it okay ?  If the village catches fire we will go and have fun and that will happen.  So that is why we can't do this.  Leave the regime aside, America will enter Iran. And then definitely the regime will change and you will see that the people there will also become happy. Although I am not talking about villages but people living in cities might also feel happy that come on brother, we wanted freedom and now we have got it very well. By the way, let me tell you that this culture is prevalent in Iran.  Iran's regime is not tertiary.  He knows that the people here also party. All that is set off.  Because if they do not allow the youth to release their energy, then it will be against the youth.  So there are many things going on in Iran.  It is going on parallelly.  But no one is paying attention to that.  Even their regimes are not paying any attention to it, come on friend they are young.   If you are doing these things then let them do it.  Is it okay ?  This is the thing.  After that let me tell you that when the American attack happened then Iran knew that we have reached a point where everyone becomes happy.  We needed an optimal point so that we could at least save our credibility. Otherwise we will be insulted all over the world.  We will be spit upon.  Is it okay?  Everyone will laugh at us.  When we come, we will come wrapped in this.  Could n't do anything.  So that's why he had to be killed. Now why did you choose Qatar only?  Because brother could not choose Saudi Arabia over UAE.   There would have been a direct conflict.  Qatar brother is the mediator.  The answer is, hey, it's okay friend, no problem, you can kill it.  Isn't it?  We don't have anything.  Qatar also said that we will kill.  But he is all a mediator.   There are American assets.  Everybody has gone out. And mediation will take place in Qatar itself.  Everything happens in Qatar only.  So that is why Qatar was also chosen. He did not choose any other base.  There are bases in 19 countries, 19 regions, there are bases everywhere in Iraq, Iran did not choose anywhere, okay, but did they choose them or not, let's do one thing, let's attack those who are at the bases in Qatar, okay, so you should assume that this war will stop very soon and after that, friends, it has been 12 days now.  Well, in this war Ali Khomenei even announced his successor that brother, our lives can be lost at any time.  So that is why it is very important to announce a successor.  For the first time, they have launched their own Khyber Shikan, which is their own missile. So Iran's IRGC is very active. But right now it is not at that level that you can know. Now the biggest thing, let me tell you one more thing is that Iran attacked but yesterday they were talking about closing the State of Hormos but they did not close it.  The stock market is also normal.  The Strait of Hormos is not closed friends.  Iran did not close it.  Even if their Parliament continues to approve it.  Then let me tell you one more thing, any proxy, whether it is Hezbollah or Hamas, no one attacked, whether it was Houthis, everyone was sitting quietly in this war and all of them are thriving on Iran's money, okay, no one attacked, friends, and let me tell you one more thing, like now the Hezbollah in Iran said that okay, now every proxy group said we stand with Iran, but we will take a decision only after seeing and understanding, now look Nasrullah, when Israel attacked Hamas on 7 October 2023, even then the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrullah, stayed away, but later when Israel killed Hassan Nasrullah, then Hezbollah Lebanon jumped into it, you understand, after that let me tell you one more thing, one more point, in 2019, America killed Qasim Soleimani, at the same time, Hajd al-Shaabi is a group that Iran has formed, there are 5000 fighters in Iraq and  They can attack America. Till date Iran has never used this Hajj Dal Shabi in Iraq. He could still do it.  If I wanted I could have done it. America has a base superintendent in Iraq.  If you ask a country where is its central airbase? He is in Iraq because it is the most unstable and he is also in the middle.  You cannot make it in Iran.  That is why he is very important for America and he could have also attacked their airbase.  500 means let us assume here that it is for fighters. But now the question is whether the attack happened or not.  Meaning Iranian restraint increases.  So what I mean to say friends is that nothing is going to happen. Both of them will sit and talk. All these attacks are happening by telling each other and we are going crazy.  And the biggest thing is that civilians are being killed.  Nearly 1,000 civilians have been killed in Iran.
