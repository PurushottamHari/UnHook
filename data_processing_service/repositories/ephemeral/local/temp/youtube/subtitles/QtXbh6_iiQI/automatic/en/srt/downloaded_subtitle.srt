1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
Hello Friends.  Friends, the

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
war between Israel and Iran has entered its fourth day

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
and it is

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
escalating rapidly.  Despite that, if

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
you see, a very

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
big statement has come from Donald Trump.  Here he has

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,360
given reference of mediation between India and Pakistan

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,760
and has again said that the way

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
I got the mediation between India and Pakistan done.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
Similarly, very soon Iran and Israel will

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
also make a deal.  So, it is

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,960
necessary to understand in a little detail

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
what does this statement of Donald Trump mean?  What is the position at this time

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,199
?  Meaning,

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
what has happened between Israel and Iran from yesterday till now?  And

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,479
many important reports have come here.

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,159
I will tell you all that in detail.

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's move on.  Look, first of all,

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240
if we see here, what has Donald Trump

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,280
said?  Donald Trump says

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Iran and Israel should make a deal and will make a

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,360
deal.  This means that Donald Trump is

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,799
saying with 100% certainty that very soon

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,520
Israel and Iran will make a deal.  Just like

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,920
I got India and Pakistan to make.  Meaning, just

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,240
like I got the deal done between India and Pakistan

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,240
and here again if you see,

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,159
Donald Trump is somewhere talking about trade that

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
I will put pressure for trade.

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,360
Here the caution means many

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,360
things, like regarding India-Pakistan,

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
Donald Trump has been continuously saying this for the last few days that

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
I had threatened

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
that if you do not do the deal, then

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,439
we will stop trade with you here.  So these kind of

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,600
things are happening.  In fact here

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,920
he gave many other references also.   There have been

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680
many conflicts globally

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,240
which Donald Trump says that

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,079
he has stopped, and in view of this,

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,399
he said here that I will

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,240

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
also stop the war that is going on between Israel and Iran.  In fact, here

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
he makes a very important statement.

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,720
He says sometime they have

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
to fight it out.  Meaning, Donald Trump is saying

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,879
that there is some anger on both sides

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
and once they

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,520
fight here, meaning once they fight among themselves, then

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
after that they themselves will sit at the table here

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,760
and try to deal in a way.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Well here it becomes important

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
from India's perspective because the

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,319
Indian Government has said it crystal clear

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
that whatever India-Pakistan war happened,

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,720
that is, whatever Operation Sindoor happened,

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,040
Donald Trump's America had

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,360
no role in it.  That means at least India did

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
not talk to them about this thing.

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
But Donald Trump has been repeatedly saying

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
that he got this mediation done.  So you will

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,920
get to see this one.  Secondly, here he

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,160
said that see how a lot of violence was taking place between Serbia and Koso,

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
these two European countries.

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,560
So

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,200
I had stopped that also in the first term.  Apart from

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,760
this, there was a big dispute going on in South Africa between

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Egypt and Ethiopia

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,800
regarding the Nile Dam.  So, I

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
also told him about how I had

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,720
stopped the tensions.  So in a way

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,360
Donald Trump is saying here that I will

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
try to take economic leverage.

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
They talk about tariffs that if you do

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
n't do this, then we will impose tariffs on you.

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Some people are talking about that sort of thing.   In

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
fact, here you will have to understand a little bit

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
in broader context because

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
if you see, what did Donald Trump

92
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,280
do in his first term?  The deal during Obama's time

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,519
was JCPOA, Joint

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,159
Comprehensive Action Plan of Action, which was

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,560
about the nuclear deal, meaning

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,879
Iran will not go towards the nuclear bomb, it will

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
not make it and the sanctions will be

98
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,120
removed from Iran, the

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,599
entire deal that was done during Obama's time was

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,920
cancelled by Donald Trump,

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,319
he pulled out from there and after that if you

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,959
see, Iran was

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,440
continuously promoting the enrichment for the nuclear bomb, so now

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
in the second term, Donald Trump wanted to make a

106
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,319
deal with Iran again and that is why

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,720
if you see, in the beginning of this year itself,

108
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,879
he had written a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei,

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,879
who is the supreme leader

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
of Iran, and said that let's make a deal,

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
nuclear deal, all two, Iran had

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,760
publicly rejected it, but

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,920
somewhere indirectly

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
diplomacy was going on about it, talks were going on and

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,759
then what happens here is that Israel

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
attacks Iran because

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
Israel fears that Iran is

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960
going to make a bomb very soon, within a few weeks,

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
and nobody knows what will happen to Israel because of this.

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
So that is why

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
you will have to understand its broader context also.

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Well here is Donald Trump's

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,680
prediction that Israel and

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
Iran will make a deal very soon.  This somehow

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
shows optimism on Trump's part.

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
But the reality can be quite different.

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
What has Donald Trump been doing lately?  In a way, I am

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
trying to show my domestic audience as well,

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,440
look how much power I have.

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,160
How I deal with things

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
and here even in situations like war, I

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,880
can deal with it and stop it.  And

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,720
he also said that never get credit

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
for anything.  Donald Trump is saying

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
that I have tried to bring in many peace efforts.

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,440
But despite that

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
I really don't get any credit.

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
So anyway, he said that it doesn't matter to me.

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
But here you

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
need to understand that Donald Trump may be

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
showing off here.  You are saying that look, these

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
two are going to do a deal very soon.  Now

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,680
maybe we can do a deal.  But the question is

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
what is the ground situation right now?

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
If you look at the ground situation,

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,360
you will see something quite different.   In

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
fact, Netanya, the Prime

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
Minister of Israel, even said that

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,080
Iran wants to kill Donald Trump.

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,240
Iran wants to kill US

152
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
President Donald Trump.  These kinds of things are

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,479
happening.  And in fact, if you look from last night, there are

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,720
continuous attacks on

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,720
Israel and Iran, both are

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
continuously attacking each other.  And this whole

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
war went on into the fourth day, and

158
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,600
even after it went into the fourth day, it is not decreasing.

159
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
From here things are escalating further.

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
For example, let me

161
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,400
show you.  If you see here,

162
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,720
Israel has carried out the longest range strike till date inside Iran.

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
If

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
you see this in the video, this place is

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
basically Mashhad Airport of Iran.  And

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
where is Mashad airport?  If you

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
look on the right, this is the border of Turkmenistan and the

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,759
border of Afghanistan here.  So, very

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
close to it, that is, on the extreme north-eastern

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
side of Iran, you will find this Mashad Airport.

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,880
So Israel attacked here yesterday

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,520
and Israel says that this was

173
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,479
our longest range strike till date.

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,800
So you can understand that the war here is

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
spreading more rapidly instead of stopping.  Apart from this, it is

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,759
obvious that from the other side,

178
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,919
Iran also started continuous attacks

179
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,919
and attacked Israel in a very ferocious manner.

180
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
Let me tell you.   In

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
fact, if you see, it is being said

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
that attempts have been made to attack high rise buildings in Jerusalem and many

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
important cities of Israel.  They

184
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,520

185
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
tried to strike

186
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
due to which many people lost their lives.  In

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,319
fact, it is also being said that the

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,960
power grid of Central Israel has been damaged

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
because of the Iranian strike.  And

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
because of this, I mean the way Iran

191
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
launched a barrage of missiles on Israel.

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,639
Because of this you can watch the news.  It is being said

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,360
that an explosive-like smell is coming in the air.

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,680
Meaning, it was such an intense night that

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
so many attacks took place yesterday that the

196
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,880
air in Israel is smelling like explosives.

197
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,639
This has become the situation.  In fact,

198
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
many analysts here also say that

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,160
Israel had probably underestimated Iran

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,720
's ability that if we attack Iran, we will

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,800

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
attack their nuclear sites.  The

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
important commanders of IRGC will be

204
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
killed.  So Iran will

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,240
become completely disabled.  He will not be able to attack us.

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
But the way Iran has

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,880
regrouped itself and

208
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,199
attacked Israel, analysts say that

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,240
this shows that Iran still has a

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,720
lot of power and because of this there is a fear that the

211
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,880
war here will

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
escalate even more rapidly because ultimately its effect can be

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,800
seen on the entire economy and the world economy.  The

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,199
oil prices are

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,440
continuously surging here.  In

216
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,199
fact, when I was

217
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
studying this whole thing, another report

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
came out in this.  It is being said in the report

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,319
that Donald Trump stopped Israel.

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,560
Actually, this entire war

221
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
could have escalated more quickly because

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
Israel was planning to kill Iran's

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,160
supreme leader Atullah Khamenei here.

224
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,400
Israel must have the

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
reports, where are they hidden, where are they?  So

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,879
maybe Israel will be the one to strike.

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,680
But Donald Trump

228
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,680
stopped Israel by saying that if this happens then things can get very

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
bad.

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
After this, you can forget about any deal etc. because

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
in Iran, there is a lot of respect

232
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,399
for its Supreme Leader.  So this is what the report

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,560
ultimately says.  Well if you

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
look here, the news that was coming out was whether

235
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,959
any kind of peace talks were going on between Iran and Israel,

236
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,200
then let me tell you that

237
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,760
Iran has completely rejected it.  In

238
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,839
fact, Iran has this to say to Qatar and

239
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,160
Oman because if you look at these two countries,

240
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
mediation is often going on here.

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,560
Whenever there is a situation like war etc. then

242
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,120
both the countries are made to sit together and

243
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,440
mediation is done there.  So Tehran has told Qatar and Oman

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
that look,

245
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
we are not going to do any kind of peace negotiation here

246
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
because

247
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,560
until we do

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
not respond to the way Israel attacked us and until Israel does not

249
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,680
stop striking us, then

250
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,160
any kind of peace

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,160
talks cannot take place.  So ultimately

252
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,040
look at the bottom line here is that

253
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,480
this comment by Trump that a

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,399
deal is going to be done between the two countries is

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
a very bold prediction and

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,959
somewhere it is political self-promotion

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,880
which Don Trump has been doing for a long time

258
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
that see, I did it

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,640
but whether Iran and Israel will

260
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,320
genuinely do a deal here is quite

261
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
uncertain because the way the

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
ground situation is right now and

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
whatever I have just told you, from this you will come to know

264
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,440
that the situation is getting escalated very much.

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
And let's see which

266
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
way things go from here.  But I hope that

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,720
through this video

268
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
you have understood well the news that came.

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
And before leaving, can you ask a very

270
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
interesting question?

271
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,800
Which of these countries shares its

272
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,880
border with both Israel and Saudi Arabia?

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,320
You all know its right answer.  You

274
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
will find it on my Instagram.   It doesn't

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
matter if you are not there.   You

276
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
can get its correct answer from Telegram.

277
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,120

I was like it, it won't happen, let's leave it.   If it is

297
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,880
not happening then what is the use of

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
reading them again and again?

299
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,839
