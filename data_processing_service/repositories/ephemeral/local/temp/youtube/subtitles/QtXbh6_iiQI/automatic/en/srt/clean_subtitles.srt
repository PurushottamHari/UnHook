Despite that, if you see, a very big statement has come from Donald Trump.  Here he has given reference of mediation between India and Pakistan and has again said that the way I got the mediation between India and Pakistan done. Similarly, very soon Iran and Israel will also make a deal.  So, it is necessary to understand in a little detail what does this statement of Donald Trump mean?  What is the position at this time ?  Meaning, what has happened between Israel and Iran from yesterday till now?  And many important reports have come here. I will tell you all that in detail. Let's move on.  Look, first of all, if we see here, what has Donald Trump said?  Donald Trump says Iran and Israel should make a deal and will make a deal.  This means that Donald Trump is saying with 100% certainty that very soon Israel and Iran will make a deal.  Just like I got India and Pakistan to make.  Meaning, just like I got the deal done between India and Pakistan and here again if you see, Donald Trump is somewhere talking about trade that I will put pressure for trade. Here the caution means many things, like regarding India-Pakistan, Donald Trump has been continuously saying this for the last few days that I had threatened that if you do not do the deal, then we will stop trade with you here.  So these kind of things are happening.  In fact here he gave many other references also.   There have been many conflicts globally which Donald Trump says that he has stopped, and in view of this, he said here that I will also stop the war that is going on between Israel and Iran.  In fact, here he makes a very important statement. He says sometime they have to fight it out.  Meaning, Donald Trump is saying that there is some anger on both sides and once they fight here, meaning once they fight among themselves, then after that they themselves will sit at the table here and try to deal in a way. Well here it becomes important from India's perspective because the Indian Government has said it crystal clear that whatever India-Pakistan war happened, that is, whatever Operation Sindoor happened, Donald Trump's America had no role in it.  That means at least India did not talk to them about this thing. But Donald Trump has been repeatedly saying that he got this mediation done.  So you will get to see this one.  Secondly, here he said that see how a lot of violence was taking place between Serbia and Koso, these two European countries. So I had stopped that also in the first term.  Apart from this, there was a big dispute going on in South Africa between Egypt and Ethiopia regarding the Nile Dam.  So, I also told him about how I had stopped the tensions.  So in a way Donald Trump is saying here that I will try to take economic leverage. They talk about tariffs that if you do n't do this, then we will impose tariffs on you. Some people are talking about that sort of thing.   In fact, here you will have to understand a little bit in broader context because if you see, what did Donald Trump do in his first term?  The deal during Obama's time was JCPOA, Joint Comprehensive Action Plan of Action, which was about the nuclear deal, meaning Iran will not go towards the nuclear bomb, it will not make it and the sanctions will be removed from Iran, the entire deal that was done during Obama's time was cancelled by Donald Trump, he pulled out from there and after that if you see, Iran was continuously promoting the enrichment for the nuclear bomb, so now in the second term, Donald Trump wanted to make a deal with Iran again and that is why if you see, in the beginning of this year itself, he had written a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is the supreme leader of Iran, and said that let's make a deal, nuclear deal, all two, Iran had publicly rejected it, but somewhere indirectly diplomacy was going on about it, talks were going on and then what happens here is that Israel attacks Iran because Israel fears that Iran is going to make a bomb very soon, within a few weeks, and nobody knows what will happen to Israel because of this. So that is why you will have to understand its broader context also. Well here is Donald Trump's prediction that Israel and Iran will make a deal very soon.  This somehow shows optimism on Trump's part. But the reality can be quite different. What has Donald Trump been doing lately?  In a way, I am trying to show my domestic audience as well, look how much power I have. How I deal with things and here even in situations like war, I can deal with it and stop it.  And he also said that never get credit for anything.  Donald Trump is saying that I have tried to bring in many peace efforts. But despite that I really don't get any credit. So anyway, he said that it doesn't matter to me. But here you need to understand that Donald Trump may be showing off here.  You are saying that look, these two are going to do a deal very soon.  Now maybe we can do a deal.  But the question is what is the ground situation right now? If you look at the ground situation, you will see something quite different.   In fact, Netanya, the Prime Minister of Israel, even said that Iran wants to kill Donald Trump. Iran wants to kill US President Donald Trump.  These kinds of things are happening.  And in fact, if you look from last night, there are continuous attacks on Israel and Iran, both are continuously attacking each other.  And this whole war went on into the fourth day, and even after it went into the fourth day, it is not decreasing. From here things are escalating further. For example, let me show you.  If you see here, Israel has carried out the longest range strike till date inside Iran. If you see this in the video, this place is basically Mashhad Airport of Iran.  And where is Mashad airport?  If you look on the right, this is the border of Turkmenistan and the border of Afghanistan here.  So, very close to it, that is, on the extreme north-eastern side of Iran, you will find this Mashad Airport. So Israel attacked here yesterday and Israel says that this was our longest range strike till date. So you can understand that the war here is spreading more rapidly instead of stopping.  Apart from this, it is obvious that from the other side, Iran also started continuous attacks and attacked Israel in a very ferocious manner. Let me tell you.   In fact, if you see, it is being said that attempts have been made to attack high rise buildings in Jerusalem and many important cities of Israel.  They tried to strike due to which many people lost their lives.  In fact, it is also being said that the power grid of Central Israel has been damaged because of the Iranian strike.  And because of this, I mean the way Iran launched a barrage of missiles on Israel. Because of this you can watch the news.  It is being said that an explosive-like smell is coming in the air. Meaning, it was such an intense night that so many attacks took place yesterday that the air in Israel is smelling like explosives. This has become the situation.  In fact, many analysts here also say that Israel had probably underestimated Iran 's ability that if we attack Iran, we will attack their nuclear sites.  The important commanders of IRGC will be killed.  So Iran will become completely disabled.  He will not be able to attack us. But the way Iran has regrouped itself and attacked Israel, analysts say that this shows that Iran still has a lot of power and because of this there is a fear that the war here will escalate even more rapidly because ultimately its effect can be seen on the entire economy and the world economy.  The oil prices are continuously surging here.  In fact, when I was studying this whole thing, another report came out in this.  It is being said in the report that Donald Trump stopped Israel. Actually, this entire war could have escalated more quickly because Israel was planning to kill Iran's supreme leader Atullah Khamenei here. Israel must have the reports, where are they hidden, where are they?  So maybe Israel will be the one to strike. But Donald Trump stopped Israel by saying that if this happens then things can get very bad. After this, you can forget about any deal etc. because in Iran, there is a lot of respect for its Supreme Leader.  So this is what the report ultimately says.  Well if you look here, the news that was coming out was whether any kind of peace talks were going on between Iran and Israel, then let me tell you that Iran has completely rejected it.  In fact, Iran has this to say to Qatar and Oman because if you look at these two countries, mediation is often going on here. Whenever there is a situation like war etc. then both the countries are made to sit together and mediation is done there.  So Tehran has told Qatar and Oman that look, we are not going to do any kind of peace negotiation here because until we do not respond to the way Israel attacked us and until Israel does not stop striking us, then any kind of peace talks cannot take place.  So ultimately look at the bottom line here is that this comment by Trump that a deal is going to be done between the two countries is a very bold prediction and somewhere it is political self-promotion which Don Trump has been doing for a long time that see, I did it but whether Iran and Israel will genuinely do a deal here is quite uncertain because the way the ground situation is right now and whatever I have just told you, from this you will come to know that the situation is getting escalated very much. And let's see which way things go from here.  But I hope that through this video you have understood well the news that came. And before leaving, can you ask a very interesting question?
