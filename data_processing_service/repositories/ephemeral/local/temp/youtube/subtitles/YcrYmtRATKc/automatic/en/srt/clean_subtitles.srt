Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, ever since Iran has been attacked by the USA under Operation Midnight Hammer, yes, now this operation has also been named by the USA as Night Hammer. Iran was hit with the hammer at night, Midnight Hammer, so after this operation, the whole world was looking towards Russia, that Russia is a very important partner country of Iran, what will Russia say about Iran.  Suddenly we see that a big statement has come from Russia which is being covered today by everyone – Indian media, international media. Here you will see the article Several Countries Ready to Give Iran Nuclear War Heads after US Strikes.  You will see dozens of articles being published on this.  Even Easley Media The Jerusalem Post.  It also covered the news that Nations Prepare to Arm Iran with Nuclear War Heads after US Strikes.  Russia's Medvedev has claimed this.  By the way, let me tell you that Dimarti Madad has been the Prime Minister of Russia.  He has been the President. And even today he is very close to Vladimir Putin. And that is why when their statement came that now we will definitely give nuclear weapons to Iran.  The whole world is covering up that they will give their nuclear weapons to Iran. Even if Iran is unable to develop its own nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons will reach Iran.  And further Russia has also given a statement that Iran and Russia are planning a coordinated response and whatever reply Iran will give to USA, Russia will definitely be involved in it and see here you can say that Russia is not wrong.  Just think about it, if USA helps Ukraine to hit Russia then if Russia helps Iran to hit USA, it wouldn't be wrong.  I mean obviously US will say that is wrong.  Iran is a terrorist nation.  How can Russia do this etc.  But if you look at it from the perspective of what has been happening with Russia so far, it is quite fair.  And if here you are asking me this question that what does it mean that what Dimarti Madhavath is saying that many countries are ready to deliver their nuclear warheads to Iran. So yes, if Russia wants, then North Korea, Belarus, as you all know, today it has the nuclear warhead with itself. This is the Russian nuclear warhead and western countries have imposed sanctions on Belarus too. Even Belarus does not have its own nuclear weapons.  Russia just has their nuclear war heads handed to them. is not a big deal.  Belarus can give them a nuclear warhead.  Apart from that, you can say that China can catch the nuclear war head under a secret mission.  Here Iran has many options with Russia.  These people can do this themselves. So, I have listed four countries for you immediately.  Russia, Belarus, China, North Korea, many nations ready to supply nuclear war head to Iran.  And if you people here are thinking that if Iran comes with such a strategy, then this war will go on for many months.  Yes, it is being said that Iran is ready to prepare for a 6 month war. They have made preparations for a six-month war.  Apart from that, they have also received a suggestion from Russia that you should assume that your conflict with Israel can now last for more than a year.  For example, if we look at the Russia-Ukraine war, it has been 3 years now and similarly, a very long war will start here between Israel and Iran.  At least both the countries have planned it.  And see, this will bring a great danger to Israel.  The daily strikes that Israel carries out on Iran are costing $ billion a month. If this war continues for 10 months then get ready to pay $20 billion.  Where will all this money come from?   Will come from US tax payer money.  This will be given to Israel and Israel will continue bombing Iran.  And obviously here one of your questions will also come to me that tell me one thing, is Iran going to close the Strait of Hermos?  Has it been decided?  News is coming that Iran 's Parliament has approved it.  It's not this or that.  Look, this is being discussed a lot in the USA.  For example, here you will see that the USA's current Secretary of State Marco Robio is openly asked by journalists that if the State of Hermes is closed, will the global markets fall? What is your opinion on that? You expect oil transportation by the Chinese government to be called about that because they have heavily depended on the states for their oil if they do that, it will be another terrible mistake, it's economic suicide for them if they do it and there are no options to deal with that, but other countries should be looking at that as well, I would hear other countries' economies a lot worse than ours, it would be I think a massive response not just by us but from others. You gave a very good answer here, and that is why I would like to tell you that Iran will think many times before closing the Strait of Hermouse. USA has openly said it here. See, if the Strait of Hermouse is closed, then China will suffer the most because as you people know, China purchases a lot of oil from the Strait of Hermouse, not only China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, we all purchase oil, so if we assume that Iran closes the trade of Hermouse, then first of all both India and China Will reach Tehran.  Both of them will say what happened?  Look, why are you punishing us by doing all this ?  If USA wants to do something then hurt USA.  This State Ones got choked here.  So the Iranian parliament has decided to block the trade of worms altogether.  But the final decision whether to do this or not rests with the Iranian Army.  And I definitely agree with Marco Rubio.   You are saying 100% correct thing.  If Iran does this , it will be an economic disaster.   They would be destroying themselves because in that case India would also become anti-Iran. Our interests will be against those of Iran. If Iran closes the State of Hermos. Then both China and India will together get that strait opened because 20% of the world's oil supply comes from there.  Both India and China do not want crude oil to become very expensive. So what I mean is this won't affect USA as much as it will affect India and China. And here you can ask me this question that in this Midnight Hammer Operation done by USA, they have already hit Iran’s nuclear program, so what else do they want to do now?  Iran's nuclear program has been destroyed.  I told you in my morning video that no, I do not think Iran's nuclear program has been destroyed.  This has been confirmed by Nitin Yau. He recently gave a statement to CNN that I cannot say whether Iran's nuclear program has been eliminated or not.  But it has definitely been damaged.  Obviously it cannot be said that the bunker buster bombs reached only the door. Of course the US would get very angry because of that underground facility.  But as I said look USA had two options.  Try either the Bunker Buster or the Tactical Nuclear War Head.  Trump tried a slightly easier route.  It does not seem that they have achieved success.  This nuclear facility of Iran could not be completely destroyed.  We have caused damage somewhere or the other.  But if it had to be completely obliterated then USA should have used tactical nuclear warhead here.  But clearly Trump saw that if he did this, the image of the USA would be completely ruined across the world. Countries will turn against USA. So that's why at the last moment they backed out from the tactical nuclear warrant. Although I would still say it is not off the table.  Still, if Trump does not see any other option, then it is possible that he may use a small nuclear warhead on Iran to destroy their nuclear program forever.  And I would like to add one more small thing here.  From the further details that have emerged about Operation Midnight Hammer, we have come to know that the actual bombers that attacked Iran were sent by the USA through the Atlantic Ocean.  So this bomber crossed the Atlantic Ocean.   Kept flying nonstop. Reached Israel.  They were given air refueling near Israel. These bombers did not land even once and after that they directly attacked Iran and actually you will remember that I had told in the morning's video that USA had used decoys.  They also sent some bombers here from Diego Garcia but those bombers did not attack Iran.  This was just to scare Iran that there would be an attack from here on the eastern side of Iran. But suddenly the attack happened from the other side and USA itself has admitted that it was very important for them to keep the element of surprise.  I am seeing this, this thing is becoming common in modern conflicts.  It is not the case that no one will inform you and launch a surprise attack at a fixed time. This has become very important to deceive air defense systems. So let me tell you that in the coming days, Russia is going to do something very big.  Big news will come out regarding Russia and Iran.   If some updates come then I will keep bringing updated videos for you.  Finally I will ask you a question.  Which country is hosting the World Para Athletics Championships for the first time in history in 2025 ? This topic is very much in the news.  Tell me which country is hosting the World Para Athletics Championships ?  Here are your options: India, China, Japan or Iran. Answer in the comment section. I will give heart to the comments of those who give the correct answer so that other people can understand what the correct answer is and finally a very important message for you all, India needs data scientists today.
