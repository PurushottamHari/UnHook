00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Prashant Dhawan. Now, ever since Iran has been attacked by the

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,719
USA under Operation Midnight Hammer,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,440
yes, now this operation has also been named by the USA as

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,920
Night Hammer.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,800
Iran was hit with the hammer at night, Midnight Hammer, so

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,760
after this operation, the whole world was looking

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
towards Russia, that Russia is a very

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
important partner country of Iran,

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
what will Russia say about Iran.  Suddenly we

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
see that a big

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,520
statement has come from Russia which is being

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,760
covered today by everyone – Indian media, international media.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
Here you will see the article

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,160
Several Countries Ready to Give Iran

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,239
Nuclear War Heads after US

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,559
Strikes.  You will see dozens of

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,039
articles being published on this.  Even Easley

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,920
Media The Jerusalem Post.  It also

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,480
covered the news that Nations Prepare

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,280
to Arm Iran with Nuclear War Heads

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,600
after US Strikes.  Russia's Medvedev has

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,320
claimed this.  By the way, let me

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
tell you that Dimarti Madad has been the Prime Minister of Russia.  He has been the

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,799
President.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
And even today he is very close to Vladimir Putin.

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
And that is why when their

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,840
statement came that now

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
we will definitely give nuclear weapons to Iran.  The whole world is

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
covering up that they will give their nuclear weapons to Iran.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
Even if Iran is

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,759
unable to develop its own nuclear weapons.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
Nuclear weapons will reach Iran.  And further

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
Russia has also given a statement that

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,680
Iran and Russia are planning a

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,240
coordinated response and whatever reply Iran will

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,880
give to USA, Russia will definitely be

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,680
involved in it and see here you

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,320
can say that Russia is not wrong.  Just think about it, if

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
USA

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,520
helps Ukraine to hit Russia then if

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
Russia helps Iran to hit USA,

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
it wouldn't be wrong.  I mean

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,479
obviously US will say that is wrong.  Iran

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,040
is a terrorist nation.  How can Russia do this

46
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,960
etc.  But

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
if you look at it from the perspective of what has been happening with Russia so far,

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
it is quite fair.  And if here

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
you are asking me this question that

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
what does it mean that what Dimarti Madhavath is saying that

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
many countries are ready to

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000
deliver their nuclear warheads to Iran.

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,480
So yes, if Russia wants, then North

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
Korea, Belarus, as you all know,

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,319
today it has the nuclear warhead with itself.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,480
This is the Russian nuclear warhead and western countries have imposed sanctions on Belarus too.

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Even Belarus does

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
not have its own nuclear weapons.  Russia just has

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
their nuclear war heads handed to them.

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
is not a big deal.  Belarus

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
can give them a nuclear warhead.  Apart from that,

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,800
you can say that China

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,440
can catch the nuclear

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,440
war head under a secret mission.  Here Iran has

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
many options with Russia.  These people can do this themselves.

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,400
So, I have listed four countries for you

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,280
immediately.  Russia, Belarus,

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,440
China, North Korea, many nations ready to

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
supply nuclear war head to Iran.  And

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,160
if you people here are thinking that if

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,800
Iran comes with such a strategy, then this war will

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,680
go on for many months.  Yes, it is being

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
said that Iran is ready to prepare for a 6 month war.

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280

77
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,280
They have made preparations for a six-month

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,159
war.  Apart from that, they have

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,879
also received a suggestion from Russia that you should assume that

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,599
your conflict with Israel can now last for

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,159
more than a year.  For example,

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,239
if we look at the Russia-Ukraine war, it has been 3 years now

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,480
and similarly, a

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,319
very long war will start here

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,319
between Israel and Iran.  At least both the countries have

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
planned it.  And

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,280
see, this will bring a great danger to Israel.  The

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,360
daily strikes that Israel carries out on Iran are

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,640
costing $ billion a month.

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,560
If this war continues for 10 months then get ready to pay

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,959
$20 billion.  Where will all this money come from?   Will

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
come from US tax payer money.  This will be given

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
to Israel and Israel will continue

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,879
bombing Iran.  And

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,319
obviously here one of your questions will

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,799
also come to me that tell me one thing, is Iran going to

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,400
close the Strait of Hermos?  Has it been

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
decided?  News is coming that Iran

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
's Parliament has approved it.  It's

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,040
not this or that.  Look,

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,360
this is being discussed a lot in the USA.  For

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
example, here you will see that the USA's

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
current Secretary of

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,680
State Marco Robio is openly

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
asked by journalists that if the State of Hermes is closed, will the

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,040
global markets fall?

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
What is your opinion on that?

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,160
You expect

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,919
oil transportation by the

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
Chinese government to be called about that because they have

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
heavily depended on the states for their

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,479
oil if they do that, it will be another

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,960
terrible mistake, it's economic suicide for

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
them if they do it and there are no options to deal with that, but

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,080
other countries should be looking at that as well, I would hear other countries' economies a

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
lot worse than ours, it would be I think

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,880
a massive

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
response not just by us but from others. You

120
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,759
gave a very good answer here, and that is why

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,479
I would like to tell you that Iran will

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,639
think many times before closing the Strait of Hermouse. USA has

123
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,199
openly said it here. See, if the Strait of

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,919
Hermouse is closed, then

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,160
China will suffer the most because as

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
you people know, China

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
purchases a lot of oil from the Strait of Hermouse, not

128
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,919
only China, Japan, India, Pakistan,

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,639
Indonesia, we all purchase oil, so

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,840
if we assume that Iran closes the trade of Hermouse,

131
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,479
then first of all both India and China

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
Will reach Tehran.  Both of them will say

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,199
what happened?  Look, why are you punishing us by doing all this

134
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
?  If USA wants to do something then

135
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
hurt USA.  This State Ones got

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
choked here.  So the Iranian

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
parliament has decided to block the trade of worms

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,080
altogether.  But the

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,800
final decision whether to do this or not rests with the

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,039
Iranian Army.  And I

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
definitely agree with Marco Rubio.   You are

142
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,400
saying 100% correct thing.  If Iran does this

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,000
, it will be an economic disaster.   They would be

144
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,320
destroying themselves because

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
in that case India would also become anti-Iran.

146
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,880
Our interests will be against those of Iran.

147
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,080
If Iran closes the State of Hermos.

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,800
Then both China and India will together get that

149
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
strait opened because 20% of the world's

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
oil supply comes from there.  Both India and China do

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,160
not want crude oil to become very expensive.

152
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,919
So what I mean is this won't affect USA as much

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
as it will affect India and China.

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,560
And here you

155
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,280
can ask me this question that in this Midnight Hammer

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,880
Operation done by USA, they have already

157
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,479
hit Iran’s nuclear

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
program, so what else do

159
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,759
they want to do now?  Iran's nuclear program has been

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
destroyed.  I

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,240
told you in my morning video that no, I do not

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,199
think Iran's nuclear program has been

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,039
destroyed.  This has been confirmed by Nitin Yau.

164
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
He recently

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,759
gave a statement to CNN that I

166
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,960
cannot say whether Iran's nuclear program has been

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,919
eliminated or not.  But it has

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,240
definitely been damaged.  Obviously it

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,240
cannot be said that the bunker buster bombs

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
reached only the door.

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,800
Of course the

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,680
US would get very angry because of that underground facility.  But as I said

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,280
look USA had two options.  Try either the Bunker

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
Buster or the Tactical

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,319
Nuclear War Head.  Trump

176
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,880
tried a slightly easier route.  It does not seem that

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,199
they have achieved success.  This

178
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,440
nuclear facility of Iran could

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
not be completely destroyed.  We have caused damage somewhere or the

180
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,319
other.  But if

181
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,720
it had to be completely obliterated then USA should have

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
used tactical nuclear warhead

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
here.  But clearly Trump

184
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,599
saw that if he did this, the

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,280
image of the USA would be completely ruined across the world.

186
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,840
Countries will turn against USA.

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
So that's why at the last moment they

188
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,120
backed out from the tactical nuclear warrant.

189
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,960
Although I would still say it is not off the

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,000
table.  Still, if Trump does not see any other option, then it is

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,800
possible that he may

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,960
use a small nuclear warhead on Iran to

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440

194
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
destroy their nuclear program forever.  And

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,319
I would like to add one more small thing here.  From the

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,319
further details that have emerged about Operation Midnight Hammer,

197
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,879
we have come to know

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,680
that the actual bombers that

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,560
attacked Iran were

200
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,199
sent by the USA through the Atlantic Ocean.  So this

201
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,000
bomber crossed the Atlantic Ocean.   Kept

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,160
flying nonstop.

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
Reached Israel.  They were given air refueling near Israel.

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,199
These bombers did

205
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,080
not land even once and after that

206
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
they directly attacked Iran and

207
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,039
actually you will remember that I had

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,839
told in the morning's video that USA had

209
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,719
used decoys.  They also sent some bombers here

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,760
from Diego Garcia but those bombers did

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,719
not attack Iran.  This was just to

212
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,880
scare Iran that there would be an

213
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,560
attack from here on the eastern side of Iran.

214
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,279
But suddenly the attack happened from the other side and

215
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,839
USA itself has admitted that it was

216
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,480
very important for them to keep the element of

217
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
surprise.  I am seeing this,

218
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,360
this thing is becoming common in modern conflicts.  It is

219
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,240
not the case that no one will

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,320
inform you and launch a surprise attack at a fixed time.

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
This has become very

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
important to deceive air defense systems.

223
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,720
So let

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
me tell you that in the coming days, Russia is going to

225
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,120
do something very big.  Big news will come

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
out regarding Russia and Iran.   If

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,399
some updates come then I will

228
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,200
keep bringing updated videos for you.  Finally

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,399
I will ask you a question.  Which country is hosting the World Para Athletics

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Championships for the first time in history in 2025

231
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
?

232
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
This topic is very much in the news.  Tell me

233
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,000
which country is hosting the World Para Athletics Championships

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,080
?  Here are

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
your options: India, China, Japan or Iran.

236
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
Answer in the comment section.

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,920
I will give heart to the comments of those who give the correct answer

238
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,560
so that other people can understand

239
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,959
what the correct answer is and finally a

240
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,600
very important message for you all, India

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,800
needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have

242
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,560
noticed that the IITs of our country have also

243
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,399

244
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
started offering certificate programmes related to data science and the

245
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,839
reason for this is very simple.  The global

246
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,240
economy is now largely data driven.

247
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,560
Unless this company has proper

248
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
information about the data, the company cannot progress further.

249
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,200
And that is why you must have noticed that

250
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,760
almost every startup today wants a data

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,560
scientist and you have the opportunity to

252
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,360

253
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,320
make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a data

254
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,320
scientist yourself as a data scientist the

255
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
doors of the whole world are open for you.

256
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,279
You can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American Express,

257
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,519
Accenture

258
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,000
because frankly

259
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,040
you will find the requirement of Data Scientist everywhere.  And Careers

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,760
247 brings you our flagship

261
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,920
Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative

262
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
AI course.  We specifically

263
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,959
included generative AI here because today there is

264
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and Machine

265
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,760
Learning cannot be mastered and

266
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,320
hence our online course will run for 6 months.  There

267
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,880
are 260 hours of live classes here.

268
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,760
Usefully see what are the

269
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,839
courses available online today because

270
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Google is offering data science courses, Harvard is offering them,

271
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,760
mostly you will get pre-

272
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
recorded classes and their quality is also

273
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,040
not that good. Where as when you

274
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,279
get a live class, you

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,839
can openly talk to the teacher yourself through a webcam or a

276
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,160
microphone, you will be able to ask questions at that time that

277
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,640
when will this topic be taught in the syllabus,

278
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,440
which tools do you need to learn,

279
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,560
Pandas, Amazon Web Services, Jupiter,

280
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,959
you will be able to understand all these properly and

281
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,800
then of course under this course you will

282
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,720
also do projects with us, so that you will

283
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
properly understand

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,120
how to actually use the skills, so

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,839
what you have to do here, simply

286
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,000
go to the comment section of the video you are watching,

287
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,279

apply here.  After that the Career 247 consultant will

297
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,480
call you.  You can talk to them about the

298
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,959
eligibility for this course?   Is

299
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
this course for you?  And by the way, let me

300
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,880
tell you that if you are a working professional.

301
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,519
Right now you are already working somewhere.  If

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,120
you want a better job, a better paying

303
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,360
job, then definitely you should do Data

304
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
Science and Machine Learning course.  It will

305
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,160
really boost your career.  And let me tell you that

306
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
mostly working

307
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
professionals come to us.  Because the one who has

308
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,920
not got a job yet cannot understand

309
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
what impact skilling brings.

310
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,639

311
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,440
Only that person who has worked somewhere once, knows that the more skilled you are,

312
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,920
the better you will be paid.  So our Data

313
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Science and Machine Learning Vi Gen course is

314
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
starting very soon.  The first

315
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,600
class will start in a few days.
