00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,520
Here's a whole village living in one room.

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,200
This is our room.  At least six

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,559
families live in it.  There has been war going on in our Manipur for two years.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,880
Here people are just eating dal and rice.

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,840

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,880
Children are studying by setting up tents.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,279
So this is for 100 people.  Yes.  Please don't go

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,480
late.  I feel very uncomfortable.  It's

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,240
okay kids.  Is your village in front?  O our

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
village is just here in front.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,600
And now you can't go to the village you see there in front

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,040
?  Can't go.  This is

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Manipur where there are 170 relief camps.  My team

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,480
reached there to show the truth about the people trapped in these.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,800
We have just passed six check points here.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,360

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Where we are staying.  This shows that

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,960
even after 2 years the conditions here are

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,920
not normal.  2 years ago it was a market place.  A

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,640
market used to be held here.  But now people are

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,039

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
living here using mosquito nets and bedsheets.  This is where my husband, my

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,400
baby and I will sleep.  My father-in-law and

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,840
my elder brother will sleep there.  Sister will also sleep there

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,760
who sells clothes after everyone has gone to sleep.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you want for your child?

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,400
We want a good future for the children

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,439
because we feel that he is my

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,400
child, if he asks for something to eat then

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,680
we could not give it to his mother, that is why

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,320
seeing this condition we have gone

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,520
crazy, how will we make him a

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,520
big man

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,680
[Music] Not only were the

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,159

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
houses that the people of Manipur built with years of hard work snatched away, but their

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,880
work was also snatched away which is their means of earning a living

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,520
and then they were not just separated from the roof of their houses.  He was

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,520
even distanced from his own family members.  Who all are there

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,479
in your house?

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,799
Our wife is in Susapur right now.  Why does your wife have to

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,159
live separately?  But it

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,159
was a different caste.  Do you talk to me?  Yes.  Sometimes it's been a

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
year or two longer.  The point is not to not meet.  I have

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,600
n't even done it.  There is a slight restlessness in the heart.  If

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
those people do the right work and not politics

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
then no one will be harmed.

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,280
A. Don't do it.  Don't fight.

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,480
Keep quiet.  One should live in peace.  By talking like this

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,280
everything will remain peaceful.  We will keep

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,160
beating both of them.  What will be getting?  You will not

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,280
get anything.  Your blood is red.  My blood

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,319
is also red.  There is only one God.  Man has been

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,319
making different names.   There is

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,160
a temple just outside this camp where

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,640
food is cooked for 1500 people.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,640
But in the name of food,

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,480
only dal and rice has been available here for the last two years.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,560
What is being made here right now?  Just now the

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,080
morning dal and rice has been cooked here and now we

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,480
cook food here for 1500 people.   There

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
is no opportunity to work here.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
That's why we are cooking food for the relief camp here.

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,879
Where are you from?  From Churachandpur.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,519
What did you do there?  We were laborers there.  He

67
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,480
builds a house there.  Is your job to

68
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
build a house?  Yes.  And what happened to your house

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
?  Everything was burnt.  Everything is over there.

70
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,680
 

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
Now there is no one left there.  Away from their own family members,

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
these people cook food for other people's families.

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Only dal and rice is prepared

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,760
but still people stand in line and wait with utensils in their hands.  There is

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,680

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
an under construction building behind me

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,280
and this relief camp is also here.

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
People are living here also.  Sir, since when have you been living

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,400
here?

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:46,080
We are in our village since 23rd May, the Manipuri

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,360
people burnt everything on fire, that is why we ran away and came here.

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,360
How does it feel to live here?

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:00,080
My wife is sick, her stomach is sick. There is not

84
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,080
even a fan here. No, there is no fan

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:09,760
from there. When the house burnt, only a few things could be saved and

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,480
brought, everything was burnt.  No,

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,599
Manipur has a population of only 30 lakh people.

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,199
But still how come it is so difficult to maintain peace here

89
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,600
?  11,000 houses burnt, more than 250

90
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,759
lives lost.  But still our national

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,479
media never told the story of Manipur.  At

92
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,639
that.

93
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,360
I was living in Imphal when the conflict was going on.  And your

94
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,360
parents?  When the conflict started, we

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,560
ran away separately.  Because of this our name got

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,680
registered here and theirs there.  That's why

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,639
we can't live together anymore.  How does it feel living here

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,000
?   It is a

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,360
bit uncomfortable but I think

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,919
God has thought of something for us.  He does

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,560
not do anything wrong because we are his

102
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,240
children.  Now I don't miss home

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,360
because the way we were treated there was

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:09,120
very bad.  But when I

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,759
think about my childhood I miss it a lot.

106
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,560
And this is our kitchen.

107
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,560
We cook for here.

108
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,600
Here water also has to be filled from tankers

109
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,039
and sometimes when tankers do not come, people have to

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,800
fill water from the pond.  The

111
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,800
water is so dirty, there is a

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,680
fight between two communities here.

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Mehti and Kuki and this fight started in 2023 itself

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320
when the Mehti community

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,360
demanded to become a Scheduled Tribe.  People have

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,600
doubt that weather I am may and weather I am

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
from the cooking

118
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,039
side.  I've been struggling from nightmarish

119
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,039
sleep walks then like a sudden bang of

120
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,880
sound really scares me.  I will see people

121
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,280
dying in my dreams.  I will see people

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,880
killing each other and I will be stealing there

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,759
and watching them.  Shooting each other.

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,120
We cannot even imagine what

125
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,319
that scene would be like that still scares Kajal and many others like her.

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,039
One night my child was

127
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,919
very unwell.  Suddenly

128
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,160
tear gas started entering our entire house.  My sick

129
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,120
child wasnâ€™t even moving anymore.  I

130
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,240
tried to wake him up but he wouldn't get up.

131
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Deadly gas and fire had spread rapidly throughout the house.

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
My mother was also in my house

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,280
but she could not walk.  I then ran away from home to save my life along with my 5-

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,319
month old child and mother.

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,319

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,800
Here people are forced to live in schools, colleges,

137
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,120
markets and even under construction

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,199
buildings.

this guy is junior to me in high

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,840
school.  He was shot down on the night

148
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
of May 3rd, I think he was just a few

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,720
meters away from his house when he was

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,319
shot dead.  Today many such Walls of

151
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,599
Remembrance can be seen in Manipur.  These are the Kuki, Methi,

152
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,560
Manipuri, you Indians who

153
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,000
lost their lives in this conflict.  Whose

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,039
faces remained only in these pictures.  These two

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
young women were earning their livelihood by

156
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,240
working in a car wash.  The two were raped at

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,520
the same time and were killed.

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,680
When a man is filled with hatred he becomes

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,160
as scary as a hungry animal.  Then he

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,800
sees the crowd, but the faces of the crowd

161
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,800
become blurred.  And today this helpless crowd is on both sides.

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
 

163
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,879
[MUSIC]

164
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,840
What do you think is the possible solution to

165
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,919
bring everything back to normal?  It's

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,560
normal it may be a little

167
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:23,840
difficult since two years

168
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,759
already and then they have been you know most

169
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,919
and then they are raped and then naked raped, after all this

170
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,760
I don't think there should be peace

171
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,000
again.

172
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,800
Perhaps if this much violence had happened in any other Indian

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,120
state, it would have been talked about everywhere.

174
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,880
But the people of Manipur have been left at the mercy of time.
