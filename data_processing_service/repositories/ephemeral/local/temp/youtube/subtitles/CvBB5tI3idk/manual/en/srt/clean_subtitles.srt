[MUSIC] Here's a whole village living in one room. This is our room.  At least six families live in it.  There has been war going on in our Manipur for two years. Here people are just eating dal and rice. Children are studying by setting up tents. So this is for 100 people.  Yes.  Please don't go late.  I feel very uncomfortable.  It's okay kids.  Is your village in front?  O our village is just here in front. And now you can't go to the village you see there in front ?  Can't go.  This is Manipur where there are 170 relief camps.  My team reached there to show the truth about the people trapped in these. We have just passed six check points here. Where we are staying.  This shows that even after 2 years the conditions here are not normal.  2 years ago it was a market place.  A market used to be held here.  But now people are living here using mosquito nets and bedsheets.  This is where my husband, my baby and I will sleep.  My father-in-law and my elder brother will sleep there.  Sister will also sleep there who sells clothes after everyone has gone to sleep. What do you want for your child? We want a good future for the children because we feel that he is my child, if he asks for something to eat then we could not give it to his mother, that is why seeing this condition we have gone crazy, how will we make him a big man [Music] Not only were the houses that the people of Manipur built with years of hard work snatched away, but their work was also snatched away which is their means of earning a living and then they were not just separated from the roof of their houses.  He was even distanced from his own family members.  Who all are there in your house? Our wife is in Susapur right now.  Why does your wife have to live separately?  But it was a different caste.  Do you talk to me?  Yes.  Sometimes it's been a year or two longer.  The point is not to not meet.  I have n't even done it.  There is a slight restlessness in the heart.  If those people do the right work and not politics then no one will be harmed. A. Don't do it.  Don't fight. Keep quiet.  One should live in peace.  By talking like this everything will remain peaceful.  We will keep beating both of them.  What will be getting?  You will not get anything.  Your blood is red.  My blood is also red.  There is only one God.  Man has been making different names.   There is a temple just outside this camp where food is cooked for 1500 people. But in the name of food, only dal and rice has been available here for the last two years. What is being made here right now?  Just now the morning dal and rice has been cooked here and now we cook food here for 1500 people.   There is no opportunity to work here. That's why we are cooking food for the relief camp here. Where are you from?  From Churachandpur. What did you do there?  We were laborers there.  He builds a house there.  Is your job to build a house?  Yes.  And what happened to your house ?  Everything was burnt.  Everything is over there. Now there is no one left there.  Away from their own family members, these people cook food for other people's families. Only dal and rice is prepared but still people stand in line and wait with utensils in their hands.  There is an under construction building behind me and this relief camp is also here. People are living here also.  Sir, since when have you been living here? We are in our village since 23rd May, the Manipuri people burnt everything on fire, that is why we ran away and came here. How does it feel to live here? My wife is sick, her stomach is sick. There is not even a fan here. No, there is no fan from there. When the house burnt, only a few things could be saved and brought, everything was burnt.  No, Manipur has a population of only 30 lakh people. But still how come it is so difficult to maintain peace here ?  11,000 houses burnt, more than 250 lives lost.  But still our national media never told the story of Manipur.  At that. I was living in Imphal when the conflict was going on.  And your parents?  When the conflict started, we ran away separately.  Because of this our name got registered here and theirs there.  That's why we can't live together anymore.  How does it feel living here ?   It is a bit uncomfortable but I think God has thought of something for us.  He does not do anything wrong because we are his children.  Now I don't miss home because the way we were treated there was very bad.  But when I think about my childhood I miss it a lot. And this is our kitchen. We cook for here. Here water also has to be filled from tankers and sometimes when tankers do not come, people have to fill water from the pond.  The water is so dirty, there is a fight between two communities here. Mehti and Kuki and this fight started in 2023 itself when the Mehti community demanded to become a Scheduled Tribe.  People have doubt that weather I am may and weather I am from the cooking side.  I've been struggling from nightmarish sleep walks then like a sudden bang of sound really scares me.  I will see people dying in my dreams.  I will see people killing each other and I will be stealing there and watching them.  Shooting each other. We cannot even imagine what that scene would be like that still scares Kajal and many others like her. One night my child was very unwell.  Suddenly tear gas started entering our entire house.  My sick child wasnâ€™t even moving anymore.  I tried to wake him up but he wouldn't get up. Deadly gas and fire had spread rapidly throughout the house. My mother was also in my house but she could not walk.  I then ran away from home to save my life along with my 5- month old child and mother. Here people are forced to live in schools, colleges, markets and even under construction buildings. S bag manipur manipur S bag manipur ko mpur langi mani nik manipur m this guy is junior to me in high school.  He was shot down on the night of May 3rd, I think he was just a few meters away from his house when he was shot dead.  Today many such Walls of Remembrance can be seen in Manipur.  These are the Kuki, Methi, Manipuri, you Indians who lost their lives in this conflict.  Whose faces remained only in these pictures.  These two young women were earning their livelihood by working in a car wash.  The two were raped at the same time and were killed. When a man is filled with hatred he becomes as scary as a hungry animal.  Then he sees the crowd, but the faces of the crowd become blurred.  And today this helpless crowd is on both sides. [MUSIC] What do you think is the possible solution to bring everything back to normal?  It's normal it may be a little difficult since two years already and then they have been you know most and then they are raped and then naked raped, after all this I don't think there should be peace again. Perhaps if this much violence had happened in any other Indian state, it would have been talked about everywhere. But the people of Manipur have been left at the mercy of time.
