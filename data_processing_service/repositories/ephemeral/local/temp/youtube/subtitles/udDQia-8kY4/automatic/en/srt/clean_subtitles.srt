Hello Friends.  Friends, there have been many developments late last night.  As you all know, after the way America attacked Iran's nuclear sites, many indications were coming from Iran.  The supreme leader of Iran had said that the enemy will be punished.  The enemy will be punished, and the punishment is being given right now.  In fact, Iran here also said that any country that supports the US, should understand this carefully because it becomes very important in tomorrow's context.  That means that the entire land of America is on the Western side, as you all know, it is across the Atlantic Ocean, Iran's missiles cannot reach there.  So here Iran's statement was that any country in the Middle East that supports America anywhere, provides space to America for air bases, is also our enemy in a way, we will attack them too and here again you can see that Iran said that even though the war here has been started by America, we will end it and in view of this, news came last night that suddenly Iran has started attacking the US air bases in the Middle East, especially in Qatar. Fire multiple missiles.  Now look, two things are happening here.  On one side there is Iran, which is saying that we have caused a lot of damage. But on the other hand, a statement has come from America.  A statement has come from Trump.  In fact, Iran's response was very weak.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening at this time.  But first we need to know which are the US military bases in the Middle East ?  It will be important for you to understand this. Only then will you be able to understand the entire context.  Look, first of all let me tell you that based on the report that came out in 2024, it was told that the US Department of Defense operates and manages around 128 overseas bases across the world, which you will find in 51 countries. Well, it is divided in two ways.  That means, among all the bases that America has all over the world, be it naval bases, air bases or any other, some of them are called Persistent Bases and others are called Selected Other US Military Sites.  So persistent bases are most important and their number is less.  Meaning that if you look at their numbers, you will find them much less than this and how is it divided? For example, a Persistent Base is one where the US Department of Defense has been using that place for the last 15 years and the US military exercises exercise operational control over that airbase to a large extent and the places where these two criteria are not met are called other bases. Meaning America has some control. I will explain it to you a little bit in the map also. If you look at this map of the Middle East, you will see this red color here a lot, especially inside Kuwait.  It happened in Bahrain, it happened in Qatar.  So this red colored base here is called persistent basis, which is very important for America.  And the rest of the orange color that you are seeing in Iraq, the rest of the orange color sites are of the US.  Again, you will get to know this very well.  This blue colored mark that you are seeing is the persistent base.  That means you can call it America's almost permanent base.  For example, if we talk about Kuwait, there is Al Mubarak Airbase here.  Then apart from this there is Aljaber Airbase.  There are many.  Along with this, you will also get to see an airbase in Bahrain.  And if you look in Qatar, there is a very important airbase here whose name is Al Udeid Airbase.  In fact, even in UAE, if you look, there is Al Dhafra Airbase. You will get to see this American airbase.  Now the question is, which one of these airbases is the most important ?  First of all, if you look at Bahrain, the Fifth Fleet of the US Navy is present there and the headquarters of the Central Command of the US Naval Forces will also be seen in Bahrain. And there is a small Gulf Kingdom, you can understand, and America's very critical assets are seen there, and it is not very far from Iran.  That means, if you look at this, this Bahrain is just above Qatar.  So this is very important.  In fact, it is said that the US Navy has been using it since 1948. When it operated under the Britain Royal Navy.  Then the second most important one is Qatar.  That means this is Qatar just close to Bahrain.  And in Qatar there is Al Udeid Airbase. Why is this important?  Because this is the largest US military base in the entire Middle East. You can say airbase which is in Qatar. And it includes the forward component of the Central Command as well as the Air Forces and the Special Operations Forces that operate from this particular location throughout the region.  So both of these are very important.  Now I was telling this because in the attack that Iran carried out yesterday on the American base, you will see the Qatar air base.  And you can see what actually happened is that because of the way Donald Trump gave permission on the nuclear sites, Iran's nuclear sites have in a way been crippled.  There is also news coming from Iran that they had already hidden a lot of enriched uranium, around 400 kilograms. Then after that there were continuous discussions as to whether things were heading towards World War 3, what was happening, and as I told you earlier a crystal clear warning was given by Iran that we will give a similar response and what happened was that you can see yesterday suddenly at around 9:30-10 o'clock the news came that near Doha in Qatar, I will show you on the map, again you see, what I was telling you, this is Bahrain, a very small tiny island country, and below it is Qatar, the capital of Qatar is Doha and just near it if you look, this is Al Udeid Airbase.  Now let me tell you that in Al Udeid Airbase, you get to see more than 10,000 US troops, long range bombers, drones, Sent Com Command, etc. So it was told that Iran, in a way, attacked here on a large scale. Many ballistic missiles were fired.  For example, Fateh 110 Zulfiqar short to medium range missiles of different variants were fired and Qatar's US Integrated Air Defence System was immediately activated.  As Third became Patriot Pack Three.  Meaning, the US had deployed its air defense systems here so that if any attack comes from Iran, it can be stopped.  So if you look at this, what is the message being given from Iran ?  Iran claimed that the entire attack was symbolic and calibrated.  This means that it is not as if Iran has carried out a different type of attack on a very large scale. Iran says that the same number of bombs that were dropped on us by America, we have also dropped the same number of bombs here. And hence, if you see, there has been no casualty here.  No one has been killed. No Casualties in Iranian Strikes on US Bases, Reserve Right to Respond.  Look, Qatar says that since it happened on our soil, we can respond to it.  Now it remains to be seen whether Qatar does it or not.  But what is an interesting thing to understand here?   The interesting thing is that Iran says that we have dropped the same number of bombs as the US dropped on us.  Meaning, you might be seeing this somewhere towards de-escalation. Because let me tell you when Iran fired missiles on Qatar from this Al Udeid airbase and its explosion is said to have been heard till Doha but no one was killed here and the most important thing is that Qatar had already told, sorry Iran had already told Qatar that we are going to attack you. So this becomes important. Because of this, it is being said that a lot of things had already been moved so that no damage of any kind could happen and at the same time, if you see here, it has also been said from the US side, in fact, a statement came from Trump yesterday and it was told in it that Iran had fired 14 missiles at us, out of which we had already intercepted 13 missiles and one missile must have fallen here.  Now see what is the reality?  what not?  No, now you cannot say this 100% because Iran says that all our missiles have fallen there. America is saying that no, we had intercepted almost all the missiles. So you will get to see all these situations.  In fact, let me tell you that just yesterday, before this attack, America had also issued a worldwide, that is, global alert for its citizens.  And in fact, all the American citizens in Qatar and in the Middle East have been sent mail from America that they should be alert and hide somewhere, meaning you could be attacked here. So what happened was that this news came from Qatar that an attack had taken place.  Secondly, suddenly news started coming in that there had been an attack on the Ain Al Asad airbase in Iraq. But then later it is revealed that no such attack might have happened but things might be being prepared. Your Iran-backed forces in Iraq were trying to attack in a way because here Iran does not want to attack directly again because the matter can escalate from here. But look, because the matter had become very serious. Looking at this, you can say that the entire airspace in the entire Middle East has been shut down.   In fact, I was looking at the flight radar data here, here you will see clearly that a lot of flights are flying around the Middle East.  Going from Europe towards Asia towards India. But if you look at this entire area, it is missing.  Meaning, you will not get to see flights here. Be it Kuwait, Bahrain , Qatar or UAE, all had shut down their airspace here.   In fact, all the Air India flights from India which were going via that route were suspended because obviously Qatar is a very important place from where flights go via that route, so they were also stopped here for once.  In fact, in view of this, the Indian Embassy in Qatar has also issued an advisory and you can see that they said that in view of the ongoing situation of India and Qatar, we request the Indian community in Qatar to be cautious and not stay at home but stay indoors and they have to work and whatever local news is coming, instructions are coming, whatever the Qatari authorities are saying, you should work accordingly and the Embassy will keep you updated, so this advisory was also issued for Indians on an immediate basis. Well let me tell you that if you look at the population of Indians in Qatar, out of the total population of Qatar which is 3.1 million, you will find around 25%, i.e. around 8 lakh Indians.  And that means the largest expectant community is that of Indians.  And after that you will get to see Nepal, Bangladesh, Philippines and the rest. And what occupation do you do? Indians there are basically in blue collar and white collar sectors.  You will see it everywhere in construction, engineering, health care, education, IT, banking and media. You can see more than 20,000 Indian odd companies in Qatar. For example, LNT, Wipro, TCS, Mahindra, Tech Mahindra, Lulu Group, Lulu Mall, you must have heard about India, all of that has become Malabar.  So by a lot, it means an investment of $350 million is said to be made. Well, the important thing here is that what implication does the attack by Iran on the US airbase yesterday have ?  Meaning, what does the employee do? Where can things go from here?  The most important thing here is that Iran's strategy has been that missile strikes will be carried out but no one 's life will be lost.  You can understand that Iran has already informed Qatar that we are going to strike. You remove things.  Just us because you must understand that Iran will also show it to its domestic audience that look we are also retooling.  You will get to see some of those kinds of things.  Now it is possible that some back channel communication is going on here and regional realignment can also happen because Qatar allowed Iranian retaliation on its soil but it was also coordinated, meaning it was coordinated between the two parties, this can be clearly seen.  Now what could be the US's strategic calculus to do is counter retaliation.  It is possible that they may not do so because Trump himself had said that whatever things came, the way Iran attacked was very weak. So whether the US attacks or not is a different matter.  But the question here is whether the full scale war that was being talked about can break out. Look, both sides are trying to demonstrate their military strength here.  But the signal that is coming here is of deescalation. Iran has done symbolic retaliation and the US has not done any retaliation yet.  As far as India is concerned, we are trying to restrain ourselves so that our interests are not harmed.  On the other hand, Russia and China are holding diplomatic talks with Iran.  If you look back, just yesterday the news came that Iran's Foreign Minister suddenly went to Russia and many other news were also coming. Some talk was going on about whether Russia would provide nuclear weapons.  Some different types of things were coming.  But no official information has been received yet. So, I wouldn’t want to go there either. But Vladimir Putin talked directly with the Foreign Minister of Iran.  Now what could have happened in that?  Will Russia help ?  Or Russia might have said that no, right now I am stuck in the Ukraine war. Now only time will tell all that.  But I hope that I have told you about the important developments till now.  Before I go, I have a very interesting question. Can you tell me? There are three statements given here related to Qatar. You have to tell which one is correct and you all know the right answer to this.  You will find it on my Instagram, if you are not there it doesn't matter.
