00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello Friends.  Friends, there have been

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,319
many developments late last night.  As you all

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,720
know, after the way America

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,040
attacked Iran's nuclear sites,

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,200
many indications were coming from Iran.  The

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,519
supreme leader of Iran had

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,240
said that the enemy will be punished.  The

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,560
enemy will be punished, and the punishment is being

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
given right now.  In fact, Iran here

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
also said that any country that

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
supports the US, should understand this carefully because

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
it becomes very important in tomorrow's context.  That

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
means that the

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,840
entire land of America is on the Western side,

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,399
as you all know, it

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,719
is across the Atlantic Ocean, Iran's missiles

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,280
cannot reach there.  So here Iran's

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,760
statement was that any country in the Middle East that

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
supports America anywhere,

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,719
provides space to America for air bases, is

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
also our enemy in a way,

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
we will attack them too and here again you

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,520
can see that Iran said that

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
even though the war here has been started

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,960
by America, we will end it

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,239
and in view of this, news came last night that

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,560
suddenly Iran has started attacking the US air

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,880
bases in the Middle East, especially in Qatar.

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,680
Fire multiple missiles.  Now look,

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
two things are happening here.  On one side there

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
is Iran, which is saying that we have caused a lot of damage.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
But on the other hand, a

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,119
statement has come from America.  A

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,759
statement has come from Trump.  In fact, Iran's

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,360
response was very weak.  So there is a

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
need to understand this in a little detail as to

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,159
what exactly is happening at this time.  But

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,320
first we need to know which are the US

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
military bases in the Middle East

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
?  It will be important for you to understand this.

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
Only then will

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,640
you be able to understand the entire context.  Look,

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
first of all let me tell you that

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
based on the report that came out in 2024, it was

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,920
told that the US Department of

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,119
Defense operates and manages around 128 overseas bases across the world,

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,680

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,079
which you will find in 51 countries.

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
Well, it is divided in two ways.  That

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
means, among all the

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
bases that America has all over the world, be it naval

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,800
bases, air bases or any other,

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,599
some of them are called

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
Persistent Bases and others are

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,640
called Selected Other US Military

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Sites.  So persistent bases are most

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,440
important and their

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,400
number is less.  Meaning that if you look at their numbers, you will

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,239
find them much less than this

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
and how is it divided?

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,760
For example, a Persistent Base is one where the

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,640
US Department of Defense has been

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
using that place for the last 15 years

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,480
and the US military exercises exercise

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,680
operational control over that airbase to a large extent

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
and the places where these two criteria are

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
not met are called other bases.

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
Meaning America has some control.

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,239
I will explain it to you a little bit in the map also.

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
If you look at this map of the Middle East,

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
you will see this red color here a lot, especially inside Kuwait.  It

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
happened in Bahrain, it happened

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,080
in Qatar.  So this red colored

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,959
base here is called

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
persistent basis, which is

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,599
very important for America.  And the rest of the

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,840
orange color that

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,560
you are seeing in Iraq, the rest of the orange color

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,120
sites are of the US.  Again, you will get to

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,879
know this very well.  This blue colored

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
mark that you are seeing is the

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,840
persistent base.  That means

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,239
you can call it America's almost permanent base.  For

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,720
example, if we talk about Kuwait, there is

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,959
Al Mubarak Airbase here.  Then

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,840
apart from this there is Aljaber Airbase.  There

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,400
are many.  Along with this, you will also

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,799
get to see an airbase in Bahrain.  And

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
if you look in Qatar, there is a very

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,319
important airbase here whose name is Al

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,360
Udeid Airbase.  In fact, even in UAE, if you

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,360
look, there is Al Dhafra Airbase.

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
You will get to see this American airbase.  Now the

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
question is,

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,599
which one of these airbases is the most important

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,239
?  First of all, if you look

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,799
at Bahrain, the Fifth Fleet of the US Navy is

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,040
present there and the

101
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
headquarters of the Central Command of the US Naval Forces will

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,599
also be seen in Bahrain.

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,159
And there is a small Gulf Kingdom,

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,640
you can understand, and America's

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,880
very critical assets are seen there, and it is

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
not very far from Iran.  That means,

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,000
if you look at this, this Bahrain is

108
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,759
just above Qatar.  So this

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,040
is very important.  In fact, it is said

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,360
that the US Navy has been using it since 1948.

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
When

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
it operated under the Britain Royal Navy.  Then the second

113
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,960
most important one is Qatar.  That means

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
this is Qatar just close to Bahrain.  And

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
in Qatar there is Al Udeid Airbase.

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Why is this important?  Because

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,040
this is the largest US military base in the entire Middle East.

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,440
You can say airbase which is in Qatar.

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
And it includes the forward component

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,560
of the Central Command as well as the Air

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,120
Forces and the Special Operations Forces

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
that operate from this particular location

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,520
throughout the region.  So both of these are very

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,600
important.  Now I was telling this

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,639
because in the attack that Iran carried out yesterday

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
on the American base, you will

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
see the Qatar air base.  And you

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,280
can see what actually happened is that because of the

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,360
way Donald Trump gave permission on the

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
nuclear sites, Iran's

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
nuclear sites have in a

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,680
way been crippled.  There is also news coming from Iran

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,320
that they had already hidden a lot of enriched

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
uranium, around 400 kilograms.

135
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Then after that there were continuous

136
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
discussions as to whether

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
things were heading towards World War 3, what was happening,

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
and as I told you earlier a

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
crystal clear warning was given by Iran

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,280
that we will give a similar response

141
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,919
and what happened was that you can see yesterday

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,800
suddenly at around 9:30-10 o'clock the news

143
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,880
came that near Doha in Qatar, I will

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
show you on the map, again you see,

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,520
what I was telling you, this is Bahrain, a

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
very small tiny island country, and

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,560
below it is Qatar, the capital of Qatar is

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Doha and just near it if you

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,479
look, this is Al Udeid Airbase.  Now let

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,800
me tell you that in Al Udeid Airbase, you get to see

151
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,000
more than 10,000 US troops, long range

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,319
bombers, drones, Sent Com Command, etc.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,880
So it was told that

154
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,880
Iran, in a way, attacked here on a large scale.

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
Many ballistic

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,120
missiles were fired.  For example, Fateh

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,039
110 Zulfiqar short to medium range

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
missiles of different variants were

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,600
fired and Qatar's US

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,240
Integrated Air Defence System was

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,800
immediately activated.  As Third

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,800
became Patriot Pack Three.  Meaning, the

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,440
US had deployed its air defense systems

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,600
here so that if any

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
attack comes from Iran, it

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,240
can be stopped.  So if

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
you look at this, what is the message being given from Iran

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
?  Iran claimed that the

169
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,360
entire attack was symbolic and calibrated.  This

170
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,080
means that it is not as if Iran has carried out a

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
different type of attack on a very large scale.

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
Iran says that the same number of bombs that were

173
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
dropped on us by America,

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,440
we have also dropped the same number of bombs here.

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,599
And hence, if you see, there has been no

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
casualty here.  No one has been killed.

177
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,639
No Casualties in Iranian

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
Strikes on US Bases, Reserve Right

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
to Respond.  Look, Qatar says that

180
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,800
since it happened on our soil, we

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
can respond to it.  Now it remains to be seen whether Qatar

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,400
does it or not.  But

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
what is an interesting thing to understand here?   The

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,599
interesting thing is that Iran says

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,400
that we have dropped the same number of bombs as the

186
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,720
US dropped on us.  Meaning,

187
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,720
you might be seeing this somewhere towards de-escalation.

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,840
Because let me

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,560
tell you when Iran fired missiles on Qatar from

190
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,720
this Al Udeid airbase

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,120
and its explosion is said to have been

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
heard till Doha

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,520
but no one was killed here and the most

194
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,000
important thing is that Qatar had already told,

195
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,720
sorry Iran had already told

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Qatar that we are going to attack you.

197
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
So this becomes important.

198
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Because of this, it is being said that a lot of

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
things had already been moved

200
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
so that no damage of any kind could happen

201
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,440
and at the same time, if you see here, it has

202
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
also been said from the US side, in fact, a

203
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,919
statement came from Trump yesterday and it was

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,639
told in it that Iran had

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,039
fired 14 missiles at us, out of which

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,280
we had already

207
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,440
intercepted 13 missiles and one missile must have

208
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,360
fallen here.  Now see what is the reality?  what

209
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
not?  No, now you cannot say this 100%

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
because Iran says that

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
all our missiles have fallen there.

212
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,120
America is saying that no, we had

213
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
intercepted almost all the missiles.

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,599
So you will get to see all these situations.  In

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
fact, let me tell you that

216
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
just yesterday, before this attack, America had

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,800
also issued a worldwide, that is, global alert

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
for its citizens.  And in

219
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
fact, all the American

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
citizens in Qatar and in the Middle East have been

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,440
sent mail from America

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,000
that they should be alert and hide somewhere,

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
meaning you could be attacked here.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,800
So what happened was that this news came from Qatar that an

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,760
attack had taken place.  Secondly, suddenly news started coming in

226
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,560
that there had been an attack on the Ain Al Asad airbase in Iraq.

227
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240

228
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,920
But then later it is revealed that no

229
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,800
such attack might have happened but

230
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,800
things might be being prepared.

231
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,959
Your Iran-backed forces in Iraq were

232
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,959
trying to attack in a way

233
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,959
because here Iran does

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,200
not want to attack directly again

235
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,600
because the matter can escalate from here.

236
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,920
But look, because the matter had become very serious.

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760
Looking at this,

238
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,000
you can say that the entire airspace in the entire Middle East has been

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
shut down.   In

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
fact, I was looking at the flight

241
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
radar data here, here you will

242
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,800
see clearly that a

243
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,279
lot of flights are

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
flying around the Middle East.  Going from Europe towards Asia towards India.

245
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
But

246
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,839
if you look at this entire area, it is

247
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
missing.  Meaning, you will not get to see flights here.

248
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,800
Be it Kuwait, Bahrain

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
, Qatar or UAE, all had

250
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,440
shut down their airspace here.   In

251
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,920
fact, all the Air India

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,839
flights from India which were going via that route were

253
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
suspended because

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,519
obviously Qatar is a very

255
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,600
important place from where flights go via that route,

256
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,920
so they were also

257
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
stopped here for once.  In fact, in

258
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
view of this, the Indian Embassy in Qatar has

259
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
also

260
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
issued an advisory and you can see that they said that

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,360
in view of the ongoing situation of India and Qatar,

262
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,680

263
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,959
we request the Indian community in Qatar to be cautious and

264
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,959
not stay at home but stay indoors and they have to

265
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,200
work and whatever local news is coming,

266
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,600
instructions are coming, whatever the Qatari authorities are

267
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
saying, you should work accordingly

268
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,079
and the Embassy will keep you

269
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,640
updated, so this

270
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,399
advisory was also issued for Indians on an immediate basis.

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,720
Well let me tell you that if you

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,959
look at the population of Indians in Qatar,

273
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,040
out of the total population of Qatar which is 3.1 million,

274
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,440

275
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,680
you will find around 25%, i.e. around 8 lakh Indians.  And that means the

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,079
largest expectant community is that of

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,640
Indians.  And after that

278
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,560
you will get to see Nepal, Bangladesh, Philippines and the rest.

279
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,560
And what occupation do you do?

280
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,320
Indians there are basically in blue collar and white

281
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,320
collar sectors.  You will see it everywhere in construction,

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
engineering, health care, education, IT,

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
banking and media.

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,959

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,920
You can see more than 20,000 Indian odd companies in Qatar.

286
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,240
For example, LNT, Wipro, TCS, Mahindra,

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,240
Tech Mahindra, Lulu Group, Lulu

288
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
Mall, you must have heard about India, all of that has

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,959
become Malabar.  So by a lot, it means an

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,680
investment of $350 million is said to be made.

291
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
Well, the important thing here is that what implication does the

292
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,920
attack by Iran on the US airbase yesterday have

293
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,600
?  Meaning,

294
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
what does the employee do?

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
Where can things go from here?  The most important thing here is

296
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,279
that Iran's strategy has been

297
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,320
that missile strikes will be carried out but no one

298
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,399
's life will be lost.  You can understand that Iran has

299
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,959
already informed Qatar that we are going to strike.

300
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
You remove things.  Just us because

301
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,519
you must understand that Iran will

302
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
also show it to its domestic audience that look we are also

303
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,920
retooling.  You will get to see some of those kinds of

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,160
things.  Now it is

305
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,720
possible that some back channel communication is going on

306
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,120
here and regional realignment can also happen

307
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,680
because Qatar allowed

308
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
Iranian retaliation on its soil but it

309
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
was also coordinated, meaning it was

310
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
coordinated between the two parties, this can be

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,079
clearly seen.  Now

312
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,399
what could be the US's strategic calculus to do is

313
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,320
counter retaliation.  It is possible that they may not

314
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,399
do so because Trump himself had said

315
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,720
that whatever things came, the way

316
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
Iran attacked was very weak.

317
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
So whether the US attacks or not is a different

318
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,519
matter.  But the question here is

319
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,079
whether the full scale war that was being talked about can break out.

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,680
Look, both sides are

321
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200

322
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,959

323
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
trying to demonstrate their military strength here.  But the

324
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,880
signal that is coming here is of deescalation.

325
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
Iran has done symbolic

326
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
retaliation and the US has

327
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
not done any retaliation yet.  As far as India is

328
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
concerned, we are trying to restrain ourselves

329
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,760
so that our interests are

330
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,000
not harmed.  On the other hand, Russia and China are holding

331
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,079
diplomatic talks

332
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
with Iran.  If you look back, just yesterday the news came

333
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,120
that Iran's Foreign Minister

334
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,959
suddenly went to Russia and many other news were also coming.

335
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
Some talk was going on about whether

336
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,200
Russia would provide nuclear weapons.  Some

337
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
different types of things were coming.  But no

338
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,880
official information has been received yet.

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,440
So, I wouldn’t want to go there either.

340
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,680
But Vladimir Putin talked

341
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
directly with the Foreign Minister of Iran.  Now

342
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,200
what could have happened in that?  Will Russia help

343
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,040
?  Or Russia might have said that

344
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
no, right now I am stuck in the Ukraine war.

345
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,200
Now only time will tell all that.  But I hope that

346
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,040

347
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
I have told you about the important developments till now.  Before I go, I have a

348
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,720
very interesting question. Can you tell me? There are

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
three statements given here related to Qatar.

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
You have to tell which one is correct

351
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839
and

352
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,200
you all know the right answer to this.  You will find it on my Instagram,

353

can get its correct answer from Telegram.

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
then your entire fee is also

363
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,079
refunded to you.  And if you have any

364
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
kind of doubt then my team is

365
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,839
here.  The phone number is given

366
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,000
exactly.  This is the number you have to dial

367
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
and tell it to me.  Do you have doubts?

368
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,079
Any problem you have will be resolved.

369
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,920
And this is the entire batch, then you

370
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
can do it accordingly.  So I hope

371
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,839

372
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,839
