2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
I was just breaking down mentally of

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
like what have I done? I have I don't

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,040
know what else to do with my life. And I

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,280
think I wrote a letter to my best friend

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,160
like I'm losing it, dude. What did it

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,670
say? It's a deep one. Jesus.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,560

[Applause]

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,000
Jimmy, I was reading through your

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,439
business portfolio and it's extremely

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,680
extensive. You found a production

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,480
company, a ride shoes, you got the ice

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,160
cream, the tonight dough. But the

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
through line here is about making people

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
happy. I've always wanted to please

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
people since I was a kid. And in your

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,239
eighth grade class, you were voted most

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
likely to replace David Letterman on the

21
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
Late Night Show. Is that crazy? Cuz I

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
ended up doing that. Well, it does feel

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,520
like you pulled that into existence

24
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,960
somehow. Well, I was beyond obsessed. I

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
wanted to be on Saturday a lot. So, I

26
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
worked at the improv where I think the

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
paycheck was

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,239
$7.25. You didn't really eat much. Like,

29
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,879
I would turn cardboard boxes on the

30
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
street into tables. It's tough. It's a

31
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,039
lot of rejection, but the stage time was

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
priceless. And eventually, you get a

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
phone call. I got an audition for Siren

34
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,119
Live. This was my big opportunity. I

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
remember going on stage, did my first

36
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,760
impression, and I blew it. That was

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,760
probably my lowest moment. It was very

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
depressing. You'd said that if you

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,320
didn't make it on SNL before the age of

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,799
25, I was going to kill myself. Did you

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
mean that? Yeah, but I just knew that I

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,880
would be on Sarah. It was going to

43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,720
happen. And against all odds, I did it.

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,479
How old were you? 23. So crazy. Jimmy, I

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,439
found some photos. Can you tell me about

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
this one? Oh my

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,600
god. Uh,

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,079
wow. This has always blown my mind a

49
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
little bit. 53% of you that listen to

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,759
the show regularly haven't yet

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
subscribed to the show. So, could I ask

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,399

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920

[Music]

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,440
much. Jimmy, what do I need to know

67
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
about you to understand the man that you

68
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
are? And when I ask that question, I'm

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,879
specifically trying to understand your

70
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,160
earliest context because you're in many

71
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
respects an anomaly, but you're an

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
anomaly that was very, very clear on

73
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,239
where you wanted to go in your life from

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,840
a shockingly young age. So, I'm

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,040
wondering what gave you such clarity and

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,640
what the context was that made made you

77
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
the unique way that you are. Gosh,

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
that's a great question. That's going to

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
be the whole that's going to be the

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,040
whole show right here because I want to

81
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,599
find out. Uh I you know maybe uh um

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,040
entertaining or being funny is probably

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,840
or wanting to just satisfy people. I

84
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,239
think you know wanting to please people.

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
I've always wanted to please people

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
since I was a kid. Like I don't know if

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,959
it was my parents or my grandparents or

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
I wanted to make people feel good and

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,319
and give everyone or if I'm at a party I

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
want to make sure it's the I'm it's the

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,640
best party, you know, and I'm giving

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
everything. I want to make sure. So,

93
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,040
it's pleasing or appeasing, one of those

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,440
words. But I think I've always wanted to

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,920
do that. And that's kind of what I do

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,640
now. Do you have like an earliest memory

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,280
of that behavior?

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,840
I think wanting to do good in like I

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,120
don't know at at uh sports maybe or you

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,000
know in grade school or or I I remember

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
I was an alter boy you know. So I I I

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
was uh at one point at one point in my

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
life I want to be a priest. Yeah. Which

104
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,640
I thought I think I'd be a pretty good

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,879
priest. I would be funny and you know I

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
could have good delivery. You know

107
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,120
someone said to me once they said maybe

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,680
you got your first taste of uh wanting

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,560
to be an entertainer from being an alter

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
boy because you're up on stage kind of.

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,879
Yeah. Yeah. Technically and there's an

112
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,879
audience. Yeah. And you're up kind of

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,360
performing. I mean, walking around and

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,680
you're wearing an outfit kind of, you

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
know, wearing costume and, you know, so

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
it's kind of theater in a weird way, but

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,400
I remember just kind of wanting to do

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,440
good for like be like make my parents

119
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,720
proud or my grandparents proud or there

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,720
was a kind of I mean it it all happened

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,479
so fast that I don't I don't I don't

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
have problems with it or or go back to

123
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,800
it and go that was traumatic, you know?

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,720
I just think that I was always like a

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,520
people pleaser. Your parents were very

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,600
strict. Yeah. Very Catholic, very

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,199
strict. No

128
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,440
cursing, no sex, you know, very

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,080
Catholic, you know, no no dirty words,

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
no my I would listen to comedy albums,

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
you know, and my dad would take a key

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,160
and scratch the curse words out of the

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
record. He would find where the dirty

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
word was and stopping and scratch it out

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,880
of the record so I wouldn't hear it. So

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
I would hear Rodney Dangerfield and it

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
would skip to the end of the joke. It

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
was like tell and then cut to people

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,520
clapping and laughing. I go, "Well, I

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
don't even know what the joke was." I

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
mean, it kind of ruined it. I go, "Why

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,800
are they laughing?" But I didn't quite

143
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,039
But he would, my dad would tape music

144
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,000
videos, you know, on these shows in

145
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,680
America, you know, called like uh USA

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
Nightflight or Friday Night Videos, and

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,960
they he tape these music videos. He

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,919
would watch them on Saturdays and go

149
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,600
tape to tape of what videos we could see

150
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,440
that wasn't offensive at all or sexually

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
inappropriate or something too advanced

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,240
for us or something. What was he like as

153
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,479
a man? Funny, life at the party,

154
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,840
hardworking, very Brooklyn, very New

155
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,759
York. He sang in a doo-op group uh on

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
the street corners. So he would go, you

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
know, not professionally, but just that

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
was one of the things he did in high

159
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,280
school. And then he also fought in gangs

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
like um not just beat each other up

161
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,520
gangs. Like I don't think anyone killed

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,000
each other, but this was back in the 50s

163
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,840
where they just would one street corner

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
would fight another street corner and

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,360
they got together and just have a fist

166
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,120
fight or something. Tough guy. He was a

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,720
tough guy. Yeah, he's emotional. No, not

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,639
emotional.

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Uh, I've never seen my dad cry or any of

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,520
that stuff. Affectionate.

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Yeah. I mean, I got I love yous and hugs

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,800
and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean, not

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,000
overly. Not the way I think I am. I'm

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,479
I'm hugging my kids every single day and

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,319
telling them how proud I am of them and

176
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,440
saying I love you and they say I love

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,919
you back and you know I I'm I'm overly,

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,560
you know, where I didn't have that, you

179
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
know, I I think it was just my mom was

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,440
more that and I think that was kind of

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
put on my mom is you're the emotional,

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,479
you know, you hug the kids and love them

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,720
and he was just more like, "Yep, I I

184
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,240
love you." You know, that's great. He

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,039
was rooting for me always, you know, but

186
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,479
you know, a little harsh, but not not

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:16,960
crazy harsh like we, you know. Yeah. Not

188
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,840
nothing that crazy.

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,520
Gloria, your mother. Yeah. Gloria is my

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,080
mom. Yeah. Uh, sadly passed away. Uh,

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
miss my mom. My mom's name is Gloria. My

192
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,639
sister names is Gloria. My dad's name is

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Jim. And I'm named Jim. very unoriginal

194
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,720
parents. Couldn't come up with any other

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,880
name. Like th those are the perfect

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,039
names for you. But yeah, my mom was my

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,919
she rooted for me. That was my number

198
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,840
one fan. I was the golden child in her

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,680
head, you know, like whatever I did, she

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,720
was like, "That's that's my kid. That's

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,960
my Oh my god, you're fantastic. You got

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
to go. You're great." You know, and she

203
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,680
would always root me on whatever it is I

204
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,759
did. She would laugh, you know. And uh I

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,360
I I miss her not being around, you know,

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,840
cuz I would talk to her every day, you

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
know, sometimes multiple times a day and

208
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
you know, talk about Sarah Live and

209
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
she'd watch the show and see Sketchers

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,000
thought was funny. I mean, I would she

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,000
was part of

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,960
my life and I think part of what built

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,120
my confidence even as an adult. Yeah,

214
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,520
completely. You talk to her almost daily

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
as an adult. Yeah. I would call her and

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,440
just go, "What's going on?" You know,

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
she loved to talk. That was her. She was

218
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,279
great at that. She had one of those

219
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,760
phones that had the phone cords that was

220
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
so stretched out from walking all around

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,640
the house and talking all day that the

222
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,880
phone cord probably was 2 miles long. I

223
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
mean, it's it was a pile of spaghetti on

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,760
the floor. I'm like, it's so I go, gosh,

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
you should get a cordless phone. You

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
won't even believe how your life

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,279
changes. You can go anywhere, Mom. Uh,

228
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,200
but she loved to walk around and talk.

229
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,200
So she could talk all day long. But then

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,760
she would call me and she like I saw you

231
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,760
on TV or you know if she saw I go I know

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,480
mom. I'm on that show. But she was like

233
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,279
you're on Ellen today. I know I I was

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
there. I was that was me. I was on it,

235
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,839
you know, but she was my number one fan

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,880
and

237
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,320
loved bits that I would do and she

238
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,080
was one of the most interesting people

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,720
ever and like they, you know, both of

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,320
them together are kind of cartoon

241
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,880
characters, you know, and by the end,

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
you know, they both kind of would

243
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
couldn't really hear each other, you

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,120
know, it was a lot of like what? And my

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,600
dad would go, "Huh?" You know, I said

246
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
what? Huh? What? Huh? And they just say

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
what? Huh? Until I interrupted. Go stop.

248
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
just stop talking because let's just

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,760
move on. You can't hear each other. This

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,839
is uh insane. But I wish I can give you

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,080
the best story of kind of what my mom

252
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,480
was like. I mean, I remember going home

253
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,040
to the house where I grew up in so New

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,880
York after I was on Sarah Live and or

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,720
maybe even during and I came home and

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,040
mom's like, "Let's go out to dinner."

257
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,640
And I go, "Okay." I go, "But I I don't

258
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
really need to. I live in Manhattan.

259
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,399
There's some of the best restaurants. I

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,959
I come home because I want home-cooked,

261
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,959
you know, meals, you know, but but I was

262
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,080
I go, "Sure." I go I go, "But just don't

263
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
make a big deal. Don't embarrass me."

264
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,360
She's like, "I'm not going to embarrass

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,760
you. I'm not." I go, "Okay, let's go."

266
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,160
So, we go into this restaurant and we

267
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
sit in and we sit down and she goes,

268
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
"I'm kind of getting a draft." And I go,

269
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
"No, no, no. We're not moving. We're not

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
making a big deal. Remember, that's the

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,959
deal. We're just not making a scene.

272
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,800
We're having dinner like you said. We're

273
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,839
going to go out." Okay, fine. So, we're

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,519
sitting there and she goes, "Let's

275
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
order." I go, "You're great." And she

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
goes, "I'll have this." My dad's like,

277
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
"I'll have steak." And I go, she goes,

278
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
"I'll have the lamb chops or something."

279
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,399
Great. So, we're waiting and they come

280
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,000
over with my dad and my meal, but they

281
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
forget my mom's meal. They go, "You

282
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
know, we didn't put in the uh lamb."

283
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,399
She's like, "Okay." So, we can't really

284
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
eat. So, she goes, she go, "Thank you."

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,839
As they leave, she goes, "I'm not going

286
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,959
to eat." I go, "You can't do that

287
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,160
because you're going to make a scene.

288
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,079
You have to eat whatever." She goes,

289
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,680
"No, I'm just I'm fine. I don't care." I

290
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,959
go, "Please don't make a big deal." She

291
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
goes, "I'm not making pizza. Just

292
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
where's my thing? I ordered it." I'm

293
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,519
like, "Okay." I go, "Don't make a big

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
deal." Finally, they bring over this

295
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
lamb thing after this whole thing. I go,

296
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,040
"Great. Just eat it." She's like, "So,

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,560
she's eating out of spite." And she

298
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,120
takes the first bite and she

299
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,200
goes, and I go, "Oh, oh my god. She's

300
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,560
not joking." And she's like pointing at

301
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,240
her throat. And I go, "Oh my god." So my

302
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,200
dad sticks his finger down my mom's

303
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
throat and he's like and she's like

304
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,680
making these noises and I go, "Oh, this

305
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,360
is a nightmare." And then some woman

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
runs over. She goes, "I'm a nurse. I'm a

307
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
nurse." And knocking over tables and

308
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
knocking everything over and grabs my

309
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
mom and picks up my mom and gives her

310
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
the himlick. And my mom is making a

311
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,959
noise that I've never heard anyone ever.

312
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,760
She was making I've never heard my mom

313
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,760
make this. She was going

314
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,560
like and and then a and she pulled it

315
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,959
and then a lambball flew out of my mom's

316
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
mouth and hit the wall and the whole

317
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,399
restaurant is just looking at us and

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
they sit down and she's crying, you

319
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
know, and she's, you know, alive. And my

320
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,680
dad goes, "All right, let's just finish

321
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,160
dinner." And I go, "Finish dinner. It's

322
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
over. We're going home. We're we're

323
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
buying a bottle of wine for that lady

324
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,800
and we're getting out of here." My dad

325
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
was like, "That lady should have minded

326
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,720
her own business." I go, "What?" Maybe

327
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,639
it was mom's time to go, you

328
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,519
know,, you know, but it was it they were

329
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,399
that weird and funny where they're like

330
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,399
odd people, but always making jokes. But

331
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,079
that was so and it was embarrassing.

332
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,760
But, you know, I remember telling that

333
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,600
story, you know, and she at a party and

334
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,240
she would love to hear it because that

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,480
was just very her and you know, she she

336
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
she just did stuff like that where she's

337
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
like, "H, this can't be real." A lot of

338
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
that. Of both your parents, who are you

339
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,720
trying to please the most, do you think?

340
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,839
Who are you who are you waiting for the

341
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,760
well done from the most?

342
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,320
God, and that's a great question. I

343
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,800
would say probably my my mom. I think

344
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
she she I I would like to make her

345
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,279
laugh, you know, because she had a great

346
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000
laugh. They both did, but I think of

347
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,160
both of them, I think my mom would be

348
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,320
the one cuz I was like she was a fan of

349
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,880
mine. So, it's almost like going like,

350
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
"Do you like my new song? Do you like

351
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,320
the second record?"

352
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
If you're a fan of the Beatles, you

353
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
know, like, "Do you like Sergeant

354
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
Pepper?" You know, you know, and she

355
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
would be like, "I like it. I like this."

356
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
You know, that because I could tell that

357
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,519
she's a fan of mine. She's like, "Oh, I

358
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,320
like this new thing you're doing, or I

359
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,720
like the song you did." You know, I I

360
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,800
think that was great because I could get

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
feedback from someone I could tell was

362
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,360
kind of studying what I was doing. For

363
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,519
me, being a comedian and being comedic

364
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,680
is

365
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,000
so

366
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,480
so I say this with the the most amount

367
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
of respect, but it's so so strange

368
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
because it's such a big risk and it's

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,000
such a unique career to pursue with very

370
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,360
little promise of it of financial return

371
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,600
or any real Yeah. Yeah. notoriety. Like

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
when I spoke to Jim uh Jimmy Carr and

373
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,320
other comedians that I've interviewed,

374
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,320
there's something a little bit

375
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,800
Say it

376
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,279
crazy. Crazy mental. Yeah. Crazy about

377
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,360
it. You know, I never and I still to

378
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,360
this day I don't care about money. I

379
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,560
never cared about money. I never did

380
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,560
anything for I don't I I just don't do

381
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,839
it. I never did it for money. And I I

382
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,279
was just I worked because I liked

383
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,120
working, you know. I liked I worked

384
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,040
since I was 13 because I

385
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,880
enjoyed I guess getting a paycheck but

386
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
you know and paying for things but I

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,639
don't know what things I was paying for.

388
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,920
I was 13 years old. But I mean, I I

389
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,560
liked the idea of going into work and

390
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,279
working a 9 toive day and, you know,

391
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,920
doing overtime. And I I I looked forward

392
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
to working wherever it was. And like

393
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
maybe it was because I was trying to be

394
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
my dad cuz he would go to work in the

395
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,639
mornings and then I would see him at

396
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,720
night, you know, when he came home. But

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,760
I I remember just not caring about

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,279
money. And my mom I would always put our

399
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
laundry in the laundry basket or

400
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
whatever and my mom would do the

401
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,440
laundry. She go, "Jimmy, I found $5 in

402
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,880
your jeans." And I go, "Okay." Yeah.

403
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah. She go, "Thanks." She goes, "Next

404
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,360
time I'm going to keep it." And I go,

405
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,680
"Do it. I could care less. What am I

406
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
going to do? I take" She's like, you

407
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
know, and then my dad's like, "You got

408
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,839
to start caring about money." I go, "I

409
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,680
don't I don't I don't think I ever will.

410
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,760
I just don't It never was a thing for

411
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,320
me. I never cared about, oh, I got the

412
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,079
most or I I got paid blah blah." I just

413
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,320
loved the experience of it all. the

414
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,040
experience of work uh of any work or any

415
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
work it led to comedy as well as you

416
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,680
know when I did comedy shows you know

417
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,800
when you when you worked at the Improv

418
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,839
in LA which is a great comedy club in

419
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,720
Los Angeles on Melrose Avenue you would

420
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,639
go up and I think the paycheck was

421
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,240
$725 that's what you get paid total

422
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,399
there's no way you could do that for the

423
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,959
money because I mean it's worthless

424
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
what's $7 going to do for you. But it

425
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,320
was the getting on stage, the stage time

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,320
that was priceless and building an act

427
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,600
and trying to get a persona and build a

428
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,160
brand and build a character and work in

429
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,800
your act that could lead to a bigger act

430
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,800
or a Saturday night gig. A Saturday

431
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,279
night gig paid maybe

432
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,120
$20 a a gig. And that was kind of okay

433
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,720
money. And they would also feed you on a

434
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,880
Saturday. So, which is great because I

435
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,440
had no food, you know. I was just like

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,160
living there going like, you know, I

437
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,639
make got to $7. I can buy some things,

438
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,360
but I you didn't really eat much.

439
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,079
Saturday, they would feed you. And I

440
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,880
remember my first Saturday gig at the

441
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,360
improv. I go in, it's a big deal. And

442
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm brand new, uh, probably out in LA,

443
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,160
maybe six months or something. And I

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
worked my way. You have to do any week

445
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,440
night, anytime they call, you have to be

446
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
up there. And so I did that and I put my

447
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
dues in for that and showed up and I had

448
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,520
I did pretty well. I had a good

449
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,760
10-minute act and um Saturday night gig

450
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,520
and I get there and I see Jerry Seinfeld

451
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,760
in the restaurant. I go and I go out to

452
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,439
the pay phone and I call my parents 1800

453
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,600
collect. Do you know what that is? Yeah.

454
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,839
At least just about. Yeah. It's like a

455
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,679
way to make a collect call so that you

456
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
don't pay for it if you have no money.

457
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
So you would call 1800 collect and

458
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
someone would have to pay for the my

459
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
parents would pay for the phone call

460
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,039
from LA. And I call my mom 1800 collect

461
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,600
and she goes, "What's Hi, Jimmy." I go,

462
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,280
"Mom, Jerry Seinfeld is at the club at

463
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,400
the improv tonight." She's like, "Oh my

464
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,400
god, Jerry Seinfeld. Oh my god, I can't

465
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,640
believe it." Uh, she's like, "This is

466
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
the peak of Seinfeld." She goes, "Is he

467
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
going to go do stand up?" And I go, "I

468
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,720
don't think so. I don't know. He's just

469
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,520
eating at the restaurant. He's I know

470
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
he's a fan of comedy." And uh the owner

471
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,760
was name is Bud Freeman. And so he was

472
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,600
there with Bud. So I go So I go in and

473
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm getting ready to do my act which is

474
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,320
a lot of impressions and I'm waiting

475
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,400
there and who goes on stage but Jerry

476
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Seinfeld. He just walks on they go we

477
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
have a surprise for you tonight and he

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,679
gets a standing ovation cr before he

479
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,760
even says anything comes out does his

480
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,840

everything. Then he says, "Good night,

484
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,039
standing ovation." And he leaves. And

485
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,039
the guy goes, "Okay, who's on next?"

486
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,960
"Uh, Mark." And this guy, Mark goes,

487
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,799
"I'm not following that." And he goes,

488
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,360
"Uh, how about uh you?" And he, you

my gosh, my first Saturday night, I have

495
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,000
to follow the greatest comedian of all."

496
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
I mean, he was the hottest comedian.

497
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
Might be one of the best comedians of

498
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,799
all time now. I He's the greatest. I had

499
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,400
to follow that was my first act. I'm

500
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,640
like, and so I went up and I had this

501
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,880
doll and I would do these impressions

502
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
about a troll doll and different

503
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,360
impressions of celebrities that would be

504
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,520
the host of

505
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:16,799
the like this one. Wow. You do your

506
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,799
research. Unless you just carry that

507
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,080
around like that one. So I would have

508
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,919
this doll. Oh my gosh, this is my act.

509
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
This is So I would have this and I go,

510
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,440
"Hello, I'm Jimmy Fallon and welcome to

511
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,440
the auditions for Troll Productions

512
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,280
Incorporated. We're looking for a star

513
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
or sponsor for our new line of Troll." I

514
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
would do like a British accent. I don't

515
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
know why. I thought that was cool for me

516
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,280
at the time. Probably sounds terrible to

517
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
you. Um, and I don't mean to be

518
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,640
offensive. I go, "Uh, we're looking for

519
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
a star or celebrity to sponsor our new

520
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,559
line of Troll Dolls for our new uh line

521
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,080
of commercials. Uh, first up, John

522
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,280
Travolta." Then I go, "She's like, I

523
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,039
swear to God." I mean, like, look at his

524
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,640
hair. Like, who does this who does his

525
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,400
hair? Like, it's so weird. Like, what

526
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,240
kind of doll is this, right? I mean,

527
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
like, I can't even like play with this

528
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
thing over here, you know? You know,

529
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,160
Sandy, you know, would do something like

530
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,120
that. And but this time I came out and I

531
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,799
go, "First up for the celebrities,

532
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,280
Seinfeld." And I go, "Okay, people.

533
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,600
Okay, look at these dolls. They don't

534
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,880
Their arms and legs don't move. These

535
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,400
aren't fun. He's got no pants on. He's

536
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,039
not even wearing pants. What kind of a

537
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,840
doll is this? And it worked. And I

538
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,760
followed Jerry Cipha and I was like, and

539
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,600
that was cool. And then I went down the

540
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
list and I finished my act and I pulled

541
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,039
out a guitar and I played guitar with

542
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,960
the troll doll and that was my act for

543
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,559
years. My name is Jimmy Fallon and

544
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
welcome to the auditions for Troll

545
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,480
Productions Incorporated. Remember these

546
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,799
little guys with fuzzy hair. We're

547
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,200
looking for like a jingle for our new

548
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,240
line of throw doll commercials. First

549
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
up, you

550
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,720
two out on the street.

551
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,720
[Music]

552
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,919
Were you a confident young man?

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,159
So if I zoom back to when you were 12

554
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,919
and you were a class clown in 1986, were

555
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,760
you a confident man? What was going on

556
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,000
in your head? I think I was pretty

557
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,080
confident. I wasn't cocky. I mean, I

558
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,919
remember like my grandfather and my

559
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
parents being like, "Hey, don't be too

560
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,120
full of yourself." They didn't like kids

561
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,480
that were too full of themselves or

562
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,480
cocky. I was pretty, but I was

563
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
confident. In your eighth grade class,

564
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,440
you were voted by your peers most likely

565
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,240
to replace David Letterman on the Late

566
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,159
Night Show and you're 13 years old at

567
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
the time. Is that crazy? Cuz I ended up

568
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,080
doing that. Crazy. I ended up doing

569
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,559
that. I replaced David Letterman. But

570
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,480
you were aiming at that. I wasn't. you

571
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,039
aiming at the SNL thing. Yeah, Saturday

572
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,880
Night Live was my aim. I wanted to be a

573
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:47,120
cast member on Saturday Night Live. Um,

574
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,159
which I ended up doing, but then

575
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,159
Saturday Night Live is what got me Late

576
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,080
Night, you know, to which is Letterman's

577
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,400
show. And then Late Night got me the

578
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,039
Tonight Show. When you look back at how

579
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,360
at that age you were aiming, you know,

580
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,840
as a young man to be on SNL, which is

581
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,520
exceedingly rare,

582
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,760
but you also went on to, you know,

583
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,200
replace David Letterman on the the late

584
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,919
night show, when you look back in

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,039
hindsight and go, so if you if one if

586
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,720
your child came to you and said, "Dad,

587
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,039
how does one aim at a goal and then

588
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,039
accomplish it? And how did you aim at

589
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
such a goal? And in hindsight, what were

590
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
the factors that went into you

591
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
accomplishing that goal? Are there like

592
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,039
principles that you could transfer to

593
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
somebody to make them accomplish such a

594
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,400
goal? Because you know, one of your best

595
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,960
friends, I think it was Frank Gentile,

596
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,760
recalled that you are, he says, I've

597
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,400
never met anybody more focused on what

598
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,159
their goal was in life. It's, you know,

599
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm not a huge believer in manifestation

600
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,240
as people often describe it, but it does

601
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,520
feel like you pulled that into existence

602
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,679
somehow. I remember just being I I don't

603
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,280
know what it is. I I wasn't that well

604
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,960
read or anything like that, but I just

605
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,320
knew that what I wanted to do I think

606
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,240
from around 12 or

607
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,679
13 and maybe it's because people said I

608
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,240
was good at it or I was making people

609
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,240
laugh, you know. So, I think when my

610
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,240
peers and my friends said like you

611
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
should do this like I I think you're

612
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,000
going to be famous one day or I think

613
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
you're going to be a comedian, you know.

614
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,120
I think you start believing it and

615
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,960
you're like, "Oh, maybe I am good at

616
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,480
this." Like I don't even remember

617
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,480
watching Late Night or David Letterman

618
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,960
around that time. I knew Siren Live and

619
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,679
I probably did watch Letterman and

620
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,000
Johnny Carson the Tonight Show, but I

621
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,840
think I started thinking, "Oh yeah,

622
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,360
Siren Live will be that's what I want to

623
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,159
do. That's that would be the ultimate

624
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,080
dream." Because that felt exciting and

625
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,280
electric and show business, but also

626
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,840
cool and edgy. And I was like, if that

627
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,600
would be my goal, like how would I do

628
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,760
that? And I remember like secretly if I

629
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,760
threw a coin in a fountain or if I made

630
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
a wish on a birthday cake, you know,

631
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
which I still do, you know, that's not

632
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,520
my wish anymore. But I remember I would

633
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,640
blow out the candles and I'd say, I want

634
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,720
to be on Saturday Alive every year, all

635
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,120
of my birthdays, any wish that I could

636
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,520
make, that's what I wished, that I could

637
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,320
be on Saturday live. And so maybe

638
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:19,279
that pressure that I put on myself drove

639
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,720
me to figure it out and see what were

640
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,559
the right steps. I think, you know, my

641
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
big

642
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,440
decision, you know, was going into

643
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,880
standup and doing impressions. I knew

644
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
the show could always use impressions

645
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
and people doing impersonations of

646
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,640
celebrities, you know, and so I thought

647
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,480
that was one way in. And so I remember

648
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,559
doing that. And then I remember reading

649
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,279
that people that uh study at the

650
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,240
Groundlings, which is an improv troop,

651
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,240
uh if they study there, some people go

652
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,039
from the Groundlings Society Lab. So I

653
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,039
moved out to LA and started taking

654
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,440
classes at the Groundlings just in case

655
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,840
that could help me. I also knew that

656
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,400
there was a management company named

657
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,480
Brilstein Gray that managed a lot of the

658
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,960
people that were on Sarant Live. And if

659
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
I could get seen by Brostein Gay, maybe

660
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
they would put me in touch with, you

661
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,799
know, the Adam Sandlers of the world or

662
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,559
the, you know, people that, uh, you

663
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,600
know, they they had everyone from, I

664
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,120
think, Belushi on till, you know, they

665
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,880
probably have people on the show now,

666
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,279
but I remember getting a call from a

667
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,919
manager who used to work at Broing Gray,

668
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,919
just left. Her name was Randy Seagull,

669
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
and she was great, and she was my

670
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,559
manager. I moved out to LA with a

671
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,600
manager and so I thought she would know

672
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,720
how to guide me to Ser Live. What are

673
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,480
your parents saying at this time?

674
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Because if you're if one's kid says,

675
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
"I'm going to go out to LA to do comedy

676
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,440
and improv and these kinds of things."

677
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,200
Your dad was a a career man. He was

678
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
working at IBM, I believe. Yes, he was

679
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,600
working at IBM. And he said to me, I

680
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,679
said, "Uh," he said, "Look, just

681
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,279
guarantee me two years of college.

682
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,919
just just go to college for at least two

683
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,520
years. Uh, I think we made a deal where

684
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,480
we said, "If you go for four years, I'll

685
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,559
I'll pay for two years and you pay for

686
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,279
two years." Like, okay, that was kind of

687
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,320
a deal for us. And so, I remember going

688
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,840
to college for three and a half years.

689
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,320
And on that half of that last semester,

690
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,279
I I got kind of an opportunity to go to

691
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,760
LA to meet with this manager. And I

692
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,960
said, I called my parents and I said, "I

693
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,760
think I'm gonna drop out and move and go

694
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,640
to LA." and go for it and just try to

695
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,559
take acting lessons and take class at

696
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,120
the Groundlings and try to get an

697
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,720
audition for Saturday Live. And they

698
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,080
were like, "All right,

699
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,080
well, really think about this. You know,

700
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
this is really what you did. Who is this

701
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
person that you're going out to?" And I

702
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,279
go, "Her name is Randy Seagull. She's a

703
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:55,039
manager." And I had met her through a

704
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,360
guy that I used to work for in in Troy,

705
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,000
New York. I was a receptionist at a news

706
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,080
weekly called Metroand. I used to answer

707
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,080
the phones and I would also do the

708
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,440
personal ads like, you know, men seeking

709
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,440
women and blah blah blah. And I type

710
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,640
those things out and I remember he moved

711
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
to LA to be a music manager. And so I

712
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,799
gave him my tape on his way out, a

713
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,720
videotape of me doing my troll act. And

714
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
I said, "Uh, if you see anybody," he

715
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,200
goes, "I'm not doing comedy. I'm doing

716
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,039
music." I go, "I know, but if you see

717
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,279
anybody, maybe pass it along." And so he

718
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,279
passed it along to this manager. So, she

719
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,200
talked to my parents and they got a

720
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
phone call where she was like, "I think

721
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,159
Jimmy's got something. You know, he's

722
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,880
green, but I think if he gets, you know,

723
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,039
if he goes to work and puts in the work,

724
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
I think that he'll get something. You

725
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,279
know, I I I I think he'll be successful.

726
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
He's

727
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,360
green, amateur. He's, you know, he's not

728
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,000
ready yet. If you, you know, you're not

729
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,400
ripe. He's he's green. So if you're

730
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,559
green, you're you're like uh you know a

731
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,399
green banana, you know. You know, did

732
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,240
you ever give up on yourself or did you

733
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,240
ever doubt yourself while you were out

734
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,360
in LA? Yeah, definitely a bunch of

735
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,799
times. It's tough when you're just not

736
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,000
getting the the it's not working and you

737
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,799
want to tell everyone that it is

738
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,919
working, but it's hard. It's a lot of

739
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,679
rejection and you end up like you just

740
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,480
trying so hard and you go I know what I

741
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,480
want but it it takes it takes so much

742
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,880
time to get there but in the meantime

743
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,640
you have to take auditions. You you have

744
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
to cuz I was like I I didn't want to

745
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,559
take acting lessons cuz I read somewhere

746
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,559
that James Dean would go to acting class

747
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,960
and just watch and never do the acting

748
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,200
lessons and I like James Dean for some

749
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,600
reason. So I would go and I just sit in

750
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
the back of the and watch everybody. And

751
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,720
finally the acting teacher came up to

752
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
me. He's like, "Are you sure you want to

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,520
do this? Because I mean, you can get so

754
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,880
much more out if you did this and

755
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
started working with other actors. I

756
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,000
think you should because you're a

757
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,000
stand-up comedian. You don't perform

758
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,679
with anyone. You're by yourself on

759
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,240
stage. I think you should learn how to

760
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,720
act with other other actors." And I was

761
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,600
like, "Yeah, maybe he's right." Like I'm

762
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,080
I'm not James Dean. So, I started acting

763
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,440
and then you realize, "Oh gosh, I'm

764
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,080
really not good at this. I got to learn

765
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,600
how to do this. It's a skill to play off

766
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
of other people and to listen to other

767
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,520
people." So, then I started doing

768
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
auditions because that's my manager

769
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,559
would get me an audition for movies and

770
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,399
stuff. And I think my first audition was

771
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,399
to play a lifeguard in the Brady Bunch 2

772
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,440
movie or something. And I had to say

773
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,360
like one line like, "Get out of the

774
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,360
pool." Something like that. And uh so I

775
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,840
remember going and my my my line was

776
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,000
printed on fax paper. They faxed it over

777
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,679
when fax machines were a thing. And so I

778
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,360
had and they they would tell you bring

779
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,520
in the paper when you do the audition.

780
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
Hold the lines so that they don't think

781
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,200
that you're off book so they think that

782
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,039
you have a chance of getting better. I

783
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,480
go okay great. So I'd hold the paper and

784
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:57,279
I go and action. I go get out of the get

785
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,240
out of the pool. Go. Okay. You want to

786
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,760
just do it one more time? I go,

787
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,279
"Okay." It's quiet and it's just so

788
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,039
awkward. And I go, "Get out of the

789
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,720
pool." Or whatever it was. And she goes,

790
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,320
"Okay. Uh, bye-bye." It actually said,

791
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,640
"Bye-bye." And I was like, my face got

792
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,640
red. I got so embarrassed. And I got

793
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
back to my apartment and my manager

794
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,640
called me and I go, "Uh, did you hear

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
feedback?" She goes, "Yeah, you didn't

796
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,320
get it. Uh, they said that." Weirdly,

797
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,159
she goes, "They said you're uh too

798
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,520
green." And I go, "Okay." She goes, "But

799
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,440
we have to work on it, you know, just

800
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
keep doing it and keep doing auditions

801
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,559
and working on these lines and you

802
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,640
should get an acting coach and go bring

803
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,399
the lines to the acting class and go

804
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,320
here's can you do get out of the pool,

805
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
you know, whatever better." So, it just

806
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,600
got over and over again you get rejected

807
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,760
and you you wouldn't get parts. I got no

808
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,799
parts. I probably auditioned for, you

809
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,159
know, 30 shows and movies and stuff like

810
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,720
that. And I you just kind of It's tough.

811
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:00,080
It's really tough. say anyone going into

812
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,360
the business or acting or or any of that

813
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,120
stuff, the entertainment stuff, you're

814
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,039
gonna get beat up. Really, it's going to

815
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,559
be to the point where you're like, I'm

816
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,279
so depressed I can't do it. But just

817
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,000
know that if you can just get through it

818
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,360
and keep working eventually, whatever it

819
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
is is going to happen in life will work

820
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,320
out. Maybe you won't even be an actor,

821
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,720
but maybe you'll be a lighting director.

822
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,960
Maybe you'll work on sets. Maybe maybe

823
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,960
it won't be acting, but it will get you

824
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,679
to where you're supposed to be if you

825
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,080
just keep going and keep doing. I just

826
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,159
kept kind of telling myself that. And I,

827
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,720
you know, I ran out of money. And I was

828
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,559
like, I'm going to have to go

829
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,960
home to live with my parents and

830
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,200
probably go back to college if I can if

831
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,279
they can let me back in. And I think I

832
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
even might have looked into it. But I

833
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,799
was just so bummed out because that's

834
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,480
not what I wanted at all. I wanted to be

835
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:57,200
on Siren Live. And um you know it's just

836
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,279
reality was like oh you almost didn't

837
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,960
feel like of living in this world cuz

838
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,320
it's like people couldn't believe that

839
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
they're like that's not reality. You

840
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,039
can't just say I'm going to be on

841
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,200
Saturday live. I remember going to my

842
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,080
ground's class my first teacher who's

843
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,440
great. His name is Jim Wise and he goes

844
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,120
uh what do you want to do? And he would

845
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
go around the horn and people like I

846
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,799
want to be in movies. I want to be in a

847
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
TV show. I want to be in a sitcom. And I

848
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,799
said I want to be on Saturday Night

849
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,440
Live.

850
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,480
like that's very specific. That's like

851
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,039
it's one in a zillion. That's what I

852
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,799
want. Like and he brought that up to me.

853
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,960
He brings it up every like I'll never

854
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,279
forget that you said that that's what

855
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,519
you wanted to do. And that was my

856
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,519
ultimate ultimate. I said if I do

857
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,480
nothing else in life, that's all I

858
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,440
wanted to do. And like even if that if I

859
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,840
got on for one season or one episode,

860
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,279
then I could do whatever I could. I I

861
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,880
didn't care what I did after that. That

862
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,600
was what was the fixation with Saturday

863
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,519
Night Live? I think my parents loved it

864
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,840
and and their friends loved it, but that

865
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,000
was what they would watch and that was

866
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,279
like the pinnacle of comedy. That was

867
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,200
the best comedy show in America. And so

868
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,320
that was the best. So it's like playing

869
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,840
for the greatest team, you know, playing

870
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,840
for the Yankees or, you know, whatever.

871
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,039
I don't know soccer, but Arsenal, I have

872
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
no idea.

873
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,679
Manchester United. Oh, Manchester

874
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,919
United. You couldn't help yourself. Oh

875
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
my gosh. But yes, playing for that.

876
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,039
You're playing you want to play play for

877
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,720
the best. If you can make it

878
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:34,159
there, that's the best team. Then you

879
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,600
could do whatever for that if you play

880
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,600
for Manu. But it's slightly different

881
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,799
with you because a lot of upcoming

882
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
football players would be happy to play

883
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,600
for any Premier League team. Man United

884
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,799
is, you know, of course great, but they

885
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,760
would aim for any Premier League team

886
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,760
ways. You seem to be like religiously

887
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,519
intent on it being Saturday Night Live.

888
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Yeah. Had to be that because I think

889
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,399
that's what we we would watch, we would

890
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,960
talk about as a family. As kind of a

891
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,240
family. Yeah. As a family. They would uh

892
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
they would tape it. You know, we were

893
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,200
one of the first families to have a VCR,

894
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,840
which is uh anyone young listening to

895
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,560
this podcast, a video cassette recorder.

896
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
So, it would tape. It's like a DVR

897
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,159
digital video recording. So, it's a

898
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,720
video cassette and you would tape it on

899
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,280
these giant tapes and they would record

900
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,359
two hours, you know, on television. And

901
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,119
so, we would tape the show and then you

902
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,960
could rewatch it and then I would

903
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,720
rewatch it and study it and watch the

904
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
sketches over and over again and watch

905
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,440
repeats and watch the greats and watch

906
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,040
Belushi and Dan Akroyd and people I want

907
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,679
Bill Murray and Steve Martin, people I

908
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,320
wanted to be like. As it got into high

909
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,919
school, I was taping it, watching the

910
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,839
best sketches, and I would go to my

911
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,919
friend's party and show the best sketch

912
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,760
that week and go, "Oh, this is the best

913
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,480
sketch. It's Chris Farley, and it's blah

914
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,280
blah blah." Or, you know, I I I would be

915
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,079
obsessed that way. I be almost became so

916
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,760
obsessed in high school that I couldn't

917
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,359
really hang out with anyone while I

918
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
watched the show because I didn't like

919
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,520
it if anyone didn't like the show. And

920
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,680
my parents used to let me drink if I

921
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,839
stayed in the if I stayed home. So if I

922
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,240
didn't go out, they would buy me a

923
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,599
six-ack of beer and I could drink at

924
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,760
probably, you know, 16 or something or

925
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,560
something like that. you know, not the

926
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,560
smarts, but but they would, you know, I

927
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,599
would hang out with my friends and they

928
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,200
would say, "Yeah, they're gonna have a

929
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,240
couple beers and, you know, but I would

930
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,760
watch Siren Live with a six-pack and

931
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,640
watch it and um study it." And I ended

932
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,880
up just stopped watching it with anyone

933
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,880
else. I, you know, I guess I still

934
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,280
drank. That's sad to say. I drank by

935
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,839
myself, but uh I became an alcoholic at

936
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,079
16. Uh uh but but it was it was a thing

937
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,480
that I would do and I would just study

938
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,960
it and I would every Saturday night and

939
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
it continuing into college my friends

940
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,119
would have parties and they go you got

941
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,599
to come right I go I'll be there at 1:00

942
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,400
they go you no the parties you got to

943
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,720

945
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,400
have to watch it live obsessed yeah I

946
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,480
was beyond

947
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,000
obsessed obsessed Without a doubt, that

948
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,400
was it. That was the pinnacle.

949
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,320
Like even I went on like an NBC tour

950
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,119
with my dad, like a bus trip to New York

951
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,040
City and took me on a tour of NBC to see

952
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,400
Siren Live and you know, this is I was

953
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,960
older. I was just so nervous to go in

954
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,320
the building and oh my gosh, this is the

955
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
building. This is what it looks like.

956
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,400
And this is the, you know, the the the

957
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,320
the doorway and the revolving door. I

958
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,000
know all this and I know everything. I

959
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,920
know the what the walls look like. I

960
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,079
know what the ceiling is painted like. I

961
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,560
know art deco decor, you know, I knew

962
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,560
everything. I geeked out and I was like,

963
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,599
this is the best day just going on tour

964
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,640
there. Now I've worked there for 20

965
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,079
something years, you know, it's my home.

966
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,560
I I've been working in that building

967
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,520
since 1998. I don't even think about it

968
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,119
anymore. That's the door I go into work.

969
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,680
Every now and then I'll walk to you know

970
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,839
I I walk to work almost every day but

971
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,800
I'll get that feeling again like oh yeah

972
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,800
don't lose that. This word obsession it

973
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,960
seems to be earlier when I said you know

974
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
the principles of all the

975
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,400
characteristics that got you to to where

976
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,079
you are today but clearly obsession is

977
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,440
one of them. I mean you're you're

978
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,000
obsessed to an extent that I didn't

979
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,640
actually realize with becoming a host on

980
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Saturday Night Live. Yeah. An obsession

981
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,359
is a powerful force isn't it? because it

982
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,280
it means that one can bang their head

983
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,280
against an immovable object over and

984
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,119
over again until the immovable object

985
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,560
moves out its way. And that's kind of

986
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,760
what you found yourself doing in LA.

987
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,000
You're sat you're going to these

988
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,440
auditions. You're getting rejected. What

989
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,839
was your mental health like in that

990
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,040
period when you're in

991
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,480
LA? Because you're dealing with constant

992
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
rejection. You're you're running out of

993
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,440
money. You're contending with having to

994
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,800
go home. It wasn't the greatest and I'm

995
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,839
a pretty positive guy in general, but I

996
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,280
think that was probably my lowest

997
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,839
looking back. I mean, I remember

998
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,079
like, you know, trying to see what

999
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,040
therapy was or if I could afford a

1000
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,079
therapist or what that meant or why

1001
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,320
because I was just breaking down

1002
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,240
mentally of like what what what have I

1003
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,359
what have I done? Like what have I done?

1004
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,000
And I' I've kind of made these decisions

1005
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,440
and I wasn't getting anywhere. And it

1006
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,920
was like I mean I

1007
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,720
had really kind of no friends and no

1008
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,920
social life. Just obsessed with work and

1009
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,560
obsessed with standup and trying to make

1010
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,800
my act better and trying to see if I can

1011
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,760
get on Saturday live and having no money

1012
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
and just going like what is this all

1013
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,960
about? You know, I can't I don't know if

1014
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,119
I could afford to keep failing. you

1015
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,200
know, I can't live in an apartment if

1016
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,240
you don't make money, you know, and I I

1017
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,400
can't can't afford gas to get to the

1018
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,160
audition. You can't eat. You you just

1019
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,720
like you just go, "Oh, yeah. I just got

1020
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,880
to keep doing gigs, but I'm running out

1021
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,040
of space, so maybe if I go home, I can

1022
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,640
go back to doing like these little clubs

1023
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,200
and make some money, save up money, then

1024
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,880
go back out and try again in LA." I

1025
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,599
remember they became a moment where I'm

1026
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,119
like, "Oh, I think I wrote a letter to

1027
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,920
my best friend like I'm losing it,

1028
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,480
dude." And in fact, I know I did because

1029
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,640
he still has the letter and he works for

1030
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,800
our show now. And he says, "I have it

1031
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,680
and I'll publish it one day. I'll give

1032
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,960
it to people if I need the money. I I'll

1033
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,839
I'll I'll release your letter you

1034
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,359
emotionally broken." I go, you know, but

1035
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,240
that's what best friends do. They hold

1036
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,560
it over your head. He's a sick dude.

1037
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah, exactly. I'll sell it on eBay. And

1038
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,079
I go, gosh. I mean, you know, it's one

1039
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,760
of those embarrassing things. I probably

1040
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,320
wish I didn't write that. But what did

1041
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,800
he say?

1042
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
I go, I I don't even ask, but I think it

1043
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,160
was something to the point like I'm

1044
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
losing it and I don't know if I can make

1045
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,480
it and I have I don't know what else to

1046
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,960
do with my life. And you know, something

1047
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,760
to that

1048
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,079
or effect or you know, I miss college. I

1049
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,560
miss my I miss you. I miss having

1050
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,440
friends. I miss going out. I miss, you

1051
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:21,200
know, I think it was that it was like

1052
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,079
maybe regretting my decision to to move

1053
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,839
to LA. Was there anything that this

1054
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,839
Jimmy might go back to that Jimmy and

1055
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,119
say to him at that time if you could

1056
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:32,359
to a message that maybe he needed to

1057
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,920
hear that he wasn't

1058
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,599
hearing? Maybe advice or Yeah. I mean,

1059
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,480
of course, the advice would be like,

1060
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,000
"It's going to be

1061
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,359
okay." You know? I I I I think probably

1062
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,160
the best would to go back and be like,

1063
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,040
"Hey, I'm proud of you, dude. Like,

1064
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,240
you're doing exactly what you have to

1065
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,359
do. You're doing what you have to do to

1066
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:01,319
become me. So, I'm so proud of you. So,

1067
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,480
keep it up." you know, you

1068
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:07,440
know, I mean, I would all the things

1069
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,880
that like I remember just in LA and like

1070
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,040
I remember like finding cardboard boxes

1071
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,079
that were thrown out in this garage next

1072
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,319
to me and bringing that in, not dirty or

1073
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,960
anything, but new boxes, and I would put

1074
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,079
sheets over and they would become

1075
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,160
tables. So, I would use that as like

1076
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,240
kind of an end table next to my bed,

1077
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,520
stuff like that. And you go, "Oh, yeah,

1078
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,359
those are It's creative. You know, it

1079
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,800
could you could look at it so sad to

1080
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,240
talk about now and go, "Oh my god,

1081
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,200
you're by yourself. You had cardboard

1082
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,480
boxes as tables and you go, I didn't

1083
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,240
think about that. I was just trying to

1084
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,000
be that would look nice if it had a

1085
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,599
sheet over it and that looks kind of

1086
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,119
cool." It was very kind of dormy, you

1087
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,480
know, but I think about I don't know why

1088
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,520
it just made me think about it now. I'm

1089
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,240
just so maybe I mean having cardboard

1090
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,480
furniture was depressing but you know

1091
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,520
you know I I think that's where you have

1092
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,000
to dig and see if you can make the find

1093
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,240
the funny in and go like if you can

1094
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,319
perform

1095
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,960
now then get ready when if you're if you

1096
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:11,400
get if you step in the ring you're an

1097
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,400
animal. Why I'm proud of you?

1098
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,599
You didn't quit. you didn't you're

1099
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,200
really like against all odds. You're

1100
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,280
doing something that no one in the

1101
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,040
family has done that none of your

1102
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,960
friends have done. You really don't know

1103
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,560
where this is going to end. And you're

1104
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,119
kind of in adventuring into an odd

1105
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,920
place. You're discovering all new stuff

1106
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,359
that's never been done. And it's it's

1107
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,640
it's it's great to do this because one

1108
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,520
day you'll get tested in a different way

1109
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,319
and you'll be mentally stronger. And so

1110
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,319
I I'm proud of you because this is all

1111
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,400
tough now, but it will pay off when when

1112
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,160
you need to show your strengths or you

1113
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,960
know, it's almost like you're going to

1114
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,560
the gym. You know, it will pay off one

1115
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,480
day. Like I don't want to do it. I don't

1116
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,520
want to run. I don't want to lift. I

1117
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,480
don't want to do anything. I don't want

1118
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,160
to eat. You go. I know. But the future

1119
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,000
me is telling you this is great that

1120
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,839
you're doing this because you're going

1121
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,440
to have a it's just going to be when

1122
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,319
when you need it, you'll be strong

1123
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,079
enough. And so I think I was becoming

1124
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,400
stronger as I was building it. And uh I

1125
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,760
look back and I I wouldn't change

1126
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,640
anything. You know, at the time, you

1127
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
know, if anything,

1128
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,359
I you know, I would say I want it to

1129
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,680
happen faster, but not really. I think

1130
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,839
you have to live through all the stuff

1131
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,079
and go, "Oh, now I remember that. That

1132
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,240
was cringey. Oh, that was rough. Oh, I

1133
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,440
remember that. That was bad. But that

1134
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,800
was a good one." And then you go, "Oh

1135
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,079
yeah, that was another great one." And

1136
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
then, "Oh, yeah." And then you start

1137
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,480
thinking of all these stuff that you

1138
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,040
thought was depressing then. It's kind

1139
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,720
of charming now. And you go kind of I

1140
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,880
love those days. And I love the days

1141
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,960
where you bombed and that was the

1142
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,640
biggest problem. The biggest problem in

1143
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,440
your life was that you didn't do a great

1144
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,760
impression of Jerry Seinfeld. Like that

1145
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,000
was the biggest problem in your life.

1146
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,040
Okay. Then I think your life is pretty

1147
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,440
good. Like, dude, you look back and go,

1148
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,800
that was it meant so much to me, though.

1149
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,280
You know, and I think about that now

1150
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
with my daughters, you know, they tell

1151
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
me stuff that's going on in school and

1152
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,480
stuff and to me, I'm like, you won't

1153
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,800
even see these kids. They mean this will

1154
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,319
mean nothing to you. These kids, maybe

1155
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,839
you'll be friends with them for life. I

1156
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,599
hope that' be great, but I don't think

1157
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,599
so. I don't remember anyone. I don't

1158
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,880
talk to anyone from my grade school, but

1159
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,359
it's the biggest thing in their life

1160
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,760
now. So, you can't say that because it's

1161
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,040
like, "Dad, this is my life. What are

1162
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,119
you talking about? This is the biggest

1163
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,359
thing. Like high school is so slow when

1164
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,079
you're in high school. Right now, four

1165
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,000
years is a joke. Four years is like a

1166
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,760
joke to me. I go, "Oh my god, I can do

1167
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,079
anything for four years." When you're in

1168
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,520
it, it's long. Four years feels like 25

1169
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,760
years. You know, could you have imagined

1170
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,680
a reality where you didn't end up

1171
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,040
getting on to SNL at some point? So, if

1172
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,359
we were sat here now, you're 50 years

1173
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,040
old and you're sat here and you'd never

1174
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,839
done it. I would have done it. But so

1175
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,839
this is what I'm I'm getting at is

1176
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,640
I would have found a way and done it and

1177
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:15,520
even just walked on or something. I

1178
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,599
would have found a way to get on it. I I

1179
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,560
would have found some way to either be

1180
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:24,760
an extra or walk in the background or do

1181
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:28,640
something or I I would have There's no

1182
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,119
way. There's no way. I I'd have to. But

1183
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,640
you're saying if I didn't, what would

1184
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,800
happen? or you saying I don't think it

1185
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,319
would ever

1186
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,520
happen. I had to be on it. I was going

1187
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,520
to make it happen and I had to do

1188
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,200
it. You know, I don't think there was an

1189
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,359
option. I don't think there I would have

1190
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,640
done it. I don't think there's ever an

1191
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,319
option. I wouldn't ever have been on

1192
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,119
that show. I asked the question because

1193
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,359
there are areas of my life where I

1194
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,040
sometimes reflect and go, I always

1195
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,560
thought that that was going to happen.

1196
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,400
And the consideration that that might

1197
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,640
not have happened makes it's almost like

1198
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,960
this like then life wouldn't have been

1199
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,720
real. Like then everything I believed

1200
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,720
would have been a lie. There's small

1201
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,359
things in my life that when you look at

1202
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,520
me as a young man and I'm filming myself

1203
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,200
pretending that a TV show have asked me

1204
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,119
to do something that ended up happening

1205
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,359
10 years ago and I go it was that was

1206
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,200
always how in my brain I did that too.

1207
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,720
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I I think a lot

1208
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,319
of us performers have done this where

1209
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,640
you interview yourself and you pretend

1210
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,880
you're on a radio show and you go like,

1211
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,119
"Here I am. I'm counting down the top 10

1212
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,280
songs and here's the and I have

1213
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,960
cassettes of me doing that." You know, I

1214
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,720
think a lot of people do that. When I

1215
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,800
ask you the question about SNL, you are

1216
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,880
so convinced that that's always the way

1217
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
that it was going to go. And I'm like,

1218
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,920
that's what I'm trying to I wanted to

1219
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,480
see your reaction when I make you

1220
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,560
consider that it didn't go that way.

1221
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,200
I can't see it not happening. I had to

1222
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,280
It was going to happen. I I don't know.

1223
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,560
I I don't know if I can tell you

1224
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,119
honestly that I could imagine another

1225
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,720
path. I I don't even know if I could

1226
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,440
fake it cuz I would be lying. I know I

1227
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,680
would be on Sarah. I have to. I just

1228
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,760
That was I I can't even I can't lie and

1229
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,359
say, "Well, I guess I could have done

1230
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,960
it." I just know. So, how did you go

1231
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,200
from that kid who's writing the letter

1232
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,920
to his friend saying that he's

1233
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,280
considering giving up and seeking out

1234
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,920
therapy and those kinds of things? How

1235
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,480
did you get from that moment to that

1236
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,240
first Saturday Night Live audition? I

1237
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,720
think you get little things, little good

1238
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,720
things happen to you. You were going to

1239
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,160
use the word luck, right? It sounded

1240
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,000
like you paused on the word luck there,

1241
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:47,359
but uh I could use luck, but I I'm just

1242
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,400
going to say good things. I mean, it

1243
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,400
probably is luck. I I I feel like I am a

1244
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,720
lucky person, but I think they're just

1245
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,040
like uh like you I I think I got a

1246
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,440
holding deal at Warner Brothers

1247
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,640
television to do like to act for a

1248
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,720
sitcom or something. Even though I

1249
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,280
didn't want a sitcom, I remember putting

1250
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,839
in the contract

1251
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:12,760
that if I get Siren Live while I'm doing

1252
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,720
the sitcom that I can contractually get

1253
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,160
out. And they said, "No, that's the

1254
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,079
whole reason. No, no one can. You

1255
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,760
can't." I go, "Well, that's that's the

1256
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,319
only reason I could I have to get this

1257
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,240
in this clause in my contract." And they

1258
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,319
said, "No one's ever asked for that, but

1259
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,640
um okay." So, they put it in my

1260
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,480
contract. So if I was on the show, the

1261
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,960
show didn't get picked up. But if the

1262
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,400
show got picked up and I got a chance to

1263
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,160
audition for Sent Live, I could leave

1264
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
the show contractually cuz they were

1265
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,559
like, it's just no, it's not going to

1266
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,599
happen. But so I I ended up acting and

1267
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,760
getting a little money which is great

1268
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,400
because it actually I could stay at my

1269
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,440
apartment and actually still work on my

1270
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,839
goal of Sarah live you know while not

1271
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,040
doing I didn't want to act in sitcoms

1272
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,520
but that that helped

1273
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,240
me take a breath and like okay I got a

1274
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,920
couple more months

1275
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,040
of opportunity

1276
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:15,760
and eventually you get a phone call.

1277
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,800
Yes. Um, my manager sent tapes and tapes

1278
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,319
and tapes to Sant Live saying, "Can you

1279
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,720
know this is he really wants it, blah

1280
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,960
blah blah." And so I got an audition for

1281
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,520
Siren Live. This was my first of two

1282
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,440
auditions. Um, my first one I went to do

1283
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:37,119
standup, my troll bit on stage at the

1284
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,000
comic strip here in uh in in New York.

1285
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,680
And I remember going in and having my

1286
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,480
one outfit that I owned that I thought

1287
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,559
was the best and you know some shirt

1288
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,440
from the Gap or something and Nike

1289
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,119
sneakers that were like such a big deal.

1290
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,400
I only wore them on special occasions

1291
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,559
and this was it. And uh I went on stage

1292
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,400
with my troll doll and I saw Lauren was

1293
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,640
in the audience. He had his hat on. He's

1294
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,040
the founder creator. Yes. his creative

1295
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,359
siren live and now the late night on the

1296
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,280
Tonight Show. And I remember going on

1297
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,640
stage as soon as I did as I did my first

1298
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,280
impression, I knew it just didn't work

1299
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,599
if I didn't have the audience. It was

1300
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,599
cut down from a 10-minute act to I think

1301
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,760
3 minutes. And I had to catch the

1302
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,599
audience, hook them in 3 minutes and

1303
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,839
leave. And I started the first 20

1304
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:28,400
seconds. I could tell this is bad. And

1305
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:31,280
it was sweaty. It was a bad audition.

1306
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,599
And I left and I go and we went to a

1307
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,319
diner next door to the club with my

1308
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,040
manager and I had coffee and it was very

1309
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,559
depressing like wow that was my this

1310
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,800
that was it that was my just for

1311
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,119
Saturday Night Live. Lauren Michaels

1312
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,440
who's the creator of the show was there

1313
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,960
that was my big opportunity and I blew

1314
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,800
it. All right, let me figure it'll be

1315
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,559
fine. Let's figure it out. Went back to

1316
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,960
LA. They said you didn't get it. How did

1317
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,440
that feel?

1318
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,359
For some reason at that point I don't

1319
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:09,960
remember I was a bit numb I think

1320
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:13,200
then and I think I was

1321
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,680
on I was starting to work on my act and

1322
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,880
really getting into standup and I just

1323
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,280
kind

1324
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,319
of kept thinking in my

1325
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,960
head I have to get another

1326
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:29,280
shot another chance

1327
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,480
at auditioning or showing them what I

1328
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,520
could really do because that was just

1329
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,359
not the best that I could do. But it

1330
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,200
wasn't too long after that where I got

1331
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,599
another phone call from Sarah. How old

1332
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,520
were you when you got that second call?

1333
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,119
23.

1334
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,160
So I heard you had said um that if you

1335
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:51,839
didn't make it on SNL before the age of

1336
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,119
25, you were going to I was going to

1337
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,760
kill myself. Were you actually? Yeah, I

1338
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,240
wrote that in something in some journal

1339
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,800
or something. You wrote what? If I don't

1340
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,480
get on Sent Live by the age of 25 that

1341
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,240
I'll I'll kill myself. Did you mean

1342
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,880
that?

1343
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,880
Yeah, I did. But again, I knew that I

1344
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,000
was going to be on Sar Live, so I guess

1345
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:22,319
I didn't really mean it because I I was

1346
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,119
going to be on Sar Live before I was 25.

1347
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,680
So crazy. I I just I I knew that I was

1348
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,599
going to be honest, so I wasn't really a

1349
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,079
threat. So funny. Do you know what's

1350
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,680
funny is the um actually it's in my book

1351
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,160
behind there. There's a screenshot of my

1352
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,359
diary and in the front page of my diary

1353
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,040
it says before I'm 25 and it has my goal

1354
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,960
written in the front of my diary and

1355
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,280
I've published it in my book which is on

1356
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,480
the shelf

1357
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,480
somewhere. Isn't that funny that I had

1358
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,359
the same thing where I'm like before I'm

1359
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,240
25 years old I will have to do this.

1360
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,800
Yes. Yeah. And it's and and it happened

1361
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,000
thankfully. But did you think in your

1362
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,720
when you were typing? I didn't say I was

1363
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,280
going to kill myself, but yeah, I don't

1364
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,880
I think I typed it out, but again, I was

1365
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,040
into computers, so I think I typed it. I

1366
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,839
think it's on some file somewhere. Okay.

1367
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,680
I think I said I will kill myself. Um

1368
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,960
but uh I definitely said, you know,

1369
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,640
uh yeah, 25 was my thing. I started my

1370
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,839
first business at 12 years old and then

1371
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,559
I started more businesses at 14, 15, 16,

1372
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,720
17 and 18. And at that time, what I

1373
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,119
didn't realize is that being a founder

1374
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,040
with no money meant that I also had to

1375
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,280
be the marketeteer, the sales rep, the

1376
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,200
finance team, customer service, and the

1377
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,280
recruiter. But if you're starting a

1378
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,119
business today, thankfully there's a

1379
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,119

1380

1395
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,400
And you get the second call for the

1396
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,440
second audition around 23 24 years old.

1397
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,079
Yeah. So I then I said, "Do you want me

1398
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,160
to do the troll doll?" And they go, "No,

1399
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,079
we'd rather you not do the troll dolls

1400
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,680
cuz we've seen that already." Okay. Was

1401
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,680
that the end of the troll doll? Well,

1402
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,920
that was my whole act. I don't have any

1403
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,079
I don't have much more. That was that's

1404
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,240
all I did was the troll doll act. So I'm

1405
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,960
like, what do I do? So, I just kind of

1406
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,400
did the troll doll act under a guise of

1407
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,800
a different thing where it's like a

1408
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,720
celebrity charity or you know, so you

1409
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,480
know, I think it was a how you doing?

1410
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,359
Here we go. Uh, oh my god. You know, my

1411
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,200
mom always told me to, uh, get a lot of

1412
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,680
how you doing to get some exercise. And

1413
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,839
so she used to say all the time she'd

1414
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:02,000
say, "Why don't you go to the store with

1415
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:04,480
your mother?" And I skinny kid.

1416
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,960
And I would say, uh, I'd say, "Uh, why

1417
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,800
don't you shut up?"

1418
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,480
That That was the big That was my big

1419
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,160
moment. That was the biggest moment for

1420
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,559
me. That was That's crazy. That was the

1421
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,240
moment in the audition too that changed

1422
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,160
everything because I was doing a bunch

1423
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,680
of impressions and before I did

1424
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:27,680
that I'm so nervous. But now I'm on the

1425
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,920
actual stage and you're there and um uh

1426
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,520
the producer comes over and says Jimmy

1427
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,200
Fallon go yeah come with us. They go

1428
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,559
just to let you know Lauren Michaels

1429
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,760
doesn't laugh so don't let that throw

1430
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,000
you if you're doing your act. They go

1431
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,160

1432
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,680

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,040
and makeup. I go get hair and makeup.

1434
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,079
They're doing my hair. They're putting

1435
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,720
makeup on me because they're

1436
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,000
broadcasting my audition to California

1437
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,720
so that the heads of NBC can and the guy

1438
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,559
and girl doing my hair and makeup go

1439
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,559
just so you know Lauren doesn't really

1440
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,720
laugh in these auditions so don't let

1441
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,640
that throw you when I go okay yeah

1442
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,920
that's what I heard great thank you I go

1443
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,240
get your microphone on so they're

1444
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,960
putting a microphone on me and a mic

1445
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,280
pack and the audio goes just a little

1446
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,880
advice doesn't really laugh so if you do

1447
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,559
your thing I go what is this guy's

1448
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,720
problem why is he not laughing he's in

1449
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,319
the wrong business. I mean, he's in a

1450
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,520
comedy show. And so, as I was doing that

1451
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:22,160
audition, I did an impression of Adam

1452
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,079
Sandler, which was what you just played.

1453
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,559
And I remember at the time, it was kind

1454
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,839
of new because Adam just left Siren Live

1455
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:32,079
and no one was really doing Adam

1456
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:32,079
Sandler. And I was doing, you know,

1457
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:38,559
like whatever. And I remember Lauren

1458
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,559
started laughing and I go, "That's cool.

1459
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,280
That's a cool story. even if I don't get

1460
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,119
sire alive. But I just knew that he

1461
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,599
started laughing. He put his head in his

1462
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,599
hand and was laughing. And I go, "That's

1463
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,480
a good story. I'll tell my kids." I made

1464
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,720
Laura Michaels laugh and on on Sarah

1465
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,280
Live, on the set of Sarah Live. I wasn't

1466
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,720
really on the show, but I was on the set

1467
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,520
and uh uh I remember doing that and

1468
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,240
feeling good about the audition. Like I

1469
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,599
left that going, "That that went as good

1470
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,440
as it could go." You know, that was the

1471
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,400
best I can that's the best I can give

1472
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,520
him. That was it. And I remember one of

1473
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,520
the uh producers, Marcy Klein, came up

1474
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,079
to me and said, grabbed my hand. She

1475
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,720
goes, Jimmy, that was fantastic. You got

1476
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,119
to feel good. And I was like, and I just

1477
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,200
felt like, okay, if they're saying it, I

1478
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,400
feel good. Then you didn't hear I didn't

1479
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,960
hear back for a couple weeks or

1480
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,000
whatever. It's like it's crazy how long

1481
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,760
you wait cuz you and they go, "Look, we

1482
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,200
like Jimmy. We saw him at the comedy

1483
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,440
club. We were looking for a different

1484
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,280
direction, you know, for that audition.

1485
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,400
I think they hired Tracy Morgan. So,

1486
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,720
they were going in a different

1487
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,040
direction, the first audition. But this

1488
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,680
one, they called, they go, Lauren wants

1489
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,240
to meet you and talk to you. He's going

1490
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:58,319
to be out in LA. And he had an office on

1491
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,920
the Paramount lot. And so, I drove into

1492
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,040
the Paramount lot. I get my name to the

1493
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,040
front gate. It's a great It's a great

1494
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,240
studio. It It feels like you're in the

1495
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,760
business. I don't know if you've ever

1496
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,000
been to the Paramount Lot, but the giant

1497
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,520
gates and you you're it's a movie set

1498
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,440
and the gates open and you go to a

1499
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,960
parking spot like and there's actors

1500
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,319
walking around and it just feels like

1501
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,480
you're in the business and it's

1502
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,240
nerve-wracking. I went into Lauren's

1503
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,280
office. He had like a you know some

1504
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,960
office on the on the lot and I remember

1505
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,200
going into his office and everything was

1506
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,280
white and it kind of felt heavenly

1507
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,200
almost and you're just like and I sat

1508
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,240
across the desk from him and he goes,

1509
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,799
"Uh, Jimmy, do you wear wigs?" And I was

1510
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,000
like, "Oh, no. I just I do this to my

1511
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,359
hair. I just spike it up." He's like,

1512
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,079
"No, no, no. I'm saying like for

1513
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,760
characters and stuff like do you uh have

1514
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,160
you done characters like where you wear

1515
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,960
wigs and stuff?" I go, "Uh, no." He

1516
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,480
goes, "Because we want you for the

1517
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,319
show." And I just think, you know, with

1518
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,559
more practice and if you try to do

1519
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,000
different PE and as soon as he whatever

1520
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,799
he was saying, I couldn't hear. The rest

1521
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,440
was slow motion. I was like, "Oh my

1522
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:04,799
gosh." He just said, "I got some life. I

1523
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,280
did it. I got Sarah laughed. It's

1524
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,599
happening. I couldn't believe it. And I

1525
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,160
go, "Okay." And I shook his hand. I go,

1526
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,599
"I hope I make you

1527
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:17,040
proud." And I left.

1528
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:19,680
And I think I pulled over to the first

1529
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,160
pay phone I could get to and called my

1530
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,640
mom. I'm like, I just got sized. And it

1531
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:29,200
was like, you know, you

1532
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,880
know, you know, it was just, it's crazy.

1533
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,599
The whole thing is crazy. I'm coming

1534
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,960
back to New York because I'm going to be

1535
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:41,280
on the show that I tried to be on my

1536
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:44,559
whole life. I did it. It's happening.

1537
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,880
And here we go. And it was like, wow.

1538
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,319
And I said goodbye to LA and my

1539
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,720
roommates and everyone's just so happy

1540
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,880
for me.

1541
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:56,640
And and then I went to New York and got

1542
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,200
an apartment and in Midtown and it was

1543
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,839
the greatest uh thing. I took Silent

1544
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,480
Live and went from there and did a

1545
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,839
couple movies. I met my wife. It's the

1546
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:12,319
best thing that ever happened to me. And

1547
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:15,359
then uh I didn't work for a while after

1548
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:17,680
the movies and then Lauren asked me to

1549
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:20,240
be on to host Late Night and replace

1550
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,200
Conan O'Brien. I did. I worked hard at

1551
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,760
that and then I got asked to replace Jay

1552
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,480
Leno on the Tonight Show and I did that

1553
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:33,359
and here I am. and I'm host of the

1554
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:36,480
Tonight Show and crazy life and crazy

1555
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,480
opportunities and it's just so

1556
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,160
interesting and fun. There was a motion

1557
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,040
in your face where you talked about

1558
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:48,680
getting SNL and calling your mom. It's

1559
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,680
so interesting that it's decades ago.

1560
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,720
Yeah. You know, again, like it's the end

1561
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:59,960
of Rocky, you know, it's the thing. It's

1562
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,160
like, I did it. It's like,

1563
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:06,440
yes, you know, you you did it. That's

1564
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:10,400
insane. You you you got to be kidding

1565
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,720
me. You you you you did it. What we all

1566
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,240
said you were going to do, but you went

1567
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,799
and actually this is it's

1568
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:24,079
crazy. It's it's not many people get do

1569
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:27,119
this. And I was like, yeah. and to talk

1570
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,000
to your mom who was your biggest fan and

1571
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,319
always believed in

1572
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,680
you, you know, that's emotional and it's

1573
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:40,640
like it's just this is how can this be?

1574
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,000
It's just I don't know. It was just un

1575
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,520
it's just the whole thing is kind of

1576
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,200
crazy. It's it's it's amazing. Is there

1577
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,520
anticlimax?

1578
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,280
No. Because if you aim at that one goal

1579
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,760
and put it on a pedestal for that long

1580
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,000
in your life, no. It paid off. It was ex

1581
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,920
everything was what I dreamt. It was

1582
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,720
crazy. Everything. Uh the the announcer

1583
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,559
Jimmy Fall and him saying my name. I was

1584
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,799
like dreamt of it. He was really saying

1585
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,240
it. I could watch him. I enjoyed every

1586
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:12,559
second of it. Every bit. The internet

1587
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,799
was happening at the time. And then

1588
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,760
people started getting sending me fan

1589
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:19,760
letters and then web pages and it was

1590
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,359
just like you started getting famous.

1591
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,400
And here's the New York City street. I

1592
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,400
walked on not too long ago being kind of

1593
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,280
afraid and intimidated. Now I'm walking

1594
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,680
and people are going Jim, you know, and

1595
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,680
and it's and it's cool and you go,

1596
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,680
"Yeah." What weren't you prepared for?

1597
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,400
Getting

1598
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,079
rejection, you know, getting your

1599
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,319
sketches cut, being told you're not

1600
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:46,960
funny, you know, haters. This is before

1601
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,720
Twitter and all that stuff, which is a

1602
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,280
different ball game that I wasn't ready

1603
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,400
for either. But you you think that it's

1604
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,559
just going to be, oh, this is cool.

1605
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,720
Everyone will be great. But then just

1606
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:00,640
people not everyone's rooting for you.

1607
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,119
You some people want you to fail.

1608
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,079
People's jobs are to take me down, you

1609
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,240
know, and and to put bad press out and

1610
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,160
stuff. It's just that's their job. And

1611
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,200
that's and you're just like, oo, I

1612
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,720
didn't think it was I I don't live in

1613
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,880
that world. I don't believe that it's

1614
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,960
real, but it kind of is real. and you

1615
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,680
go, "Oh, people are just going to be

1616
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,440
mean." And you got to again just toughen

1617
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,359
up and get through it and just keep your

1618
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,760
head down and keep being funny and just

1619
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,480
keep doing things and keep keep being

1620
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,079
creative and just if you move that out,

1621
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,720
you realize it's not even real. That's

1622
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:37,520
not it's it's real, but it's noise and

1623
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,680
it's just it doesn't affect you. Uh you

1624
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,559
can only believe in yourself and and

1625
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,839
know that you have to keep going and if

1626
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:48,160
you keep scoring that will show. your

1627
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,880
work will show that that stuff I wasn't

1628
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,599
prepared for of of dealing with the

1629
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,280
overcoming that you know overcoming

1630
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,680
that.

1631
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,680
Yeah. Overcoming like hating on you or

1632
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,000
or you know saying you're not good or

1633
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,799
something. It's like you don't think

1634
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,520
that's going to happen, but it, you

1635
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:12,839
know, it will if you're successful

1636
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:15,280
because someone will be like,

1637
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:17,039
uh, you know, someone's not going to

1638
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,039
like you no matter what. As someone

1639
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,760
that's always trying to please, is that

1640
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,839
the antithesis of pleasing for for one's

1641
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,559
brain who is orientated towards making

1642
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:30,240
people happy? It's the worst. Yes, it is

1643
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:33,039
the absolute worst. You're I hate it. I

1644
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,680
I want everyone to like me. I I can't

1645
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,280
stand it. I go, "Oh my gosh, what can I

1646
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:42,799
do to make you like

1647
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:46,079
me?" I think the answer is you can't you

1648
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,000
can't make everyone like you. You just

1649
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,599
have to do what you do and do the best

1650
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that you can at what you do and be happy

1651
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,280
with yourself.

1652
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,520
I mean, like, what's the what's the

1653
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,720
alternative? The alternative is you you

1654
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:04,720
quit. You Yeah. you quit or you you you

1655
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,640
change you to be I guess what the person

1656
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,880
who hates you likes and someone else

1657
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,280
will just hate that then what yeah the

1658
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,160
original people will will hate that that

1659
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,640
you change and you go oh yeah I mean I

1660
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,520
and then you'll hate yourself yeah I

1661
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:22,400
mean there's I used I I love music but I

1662
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,160
remember like I love the Beasty Boys um

1663
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,880
growing up and there's that one line

1664
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,160
Mike D says like um be true to yourself

1665
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,799
and you will never fall And it's like

1666
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,559
kind of is the

1667
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:36,720
move. It's just be that's be true to

1668
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,400
yourself. Then there's no everyone can

1669
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,400
say whatever they want. It's like that's

1670
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,319
who I am. How did you cope with that

1671
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,599
stardom being thrust into public

1672
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,880
spotlight? You're getting feedback from

1673
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,160
everywhere. You're getting the good, the

1674
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,880
bad, the ugly. You're someone that wants

1675
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,319
to please. Do you Did you seek any

1676
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,680
professional help? Did you get any

1677
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:57,319
support? No. No. I just kind of live

1678
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,480
through it and go like,

1679
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:04,000
"Yeah, I think I'll I'll figure it out."

1680
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:06,400
You know, I think fame was fun, you

1681
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,039
know? It's it's cooler. It's cooler than

1682
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,839
cool. It's like, "Wow, this is what I

1683
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,520
thought it would be." But it's

1684
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:15,680
also at the end of the day, it's it's

1685
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,760
the work and the the I than the stuff

1686
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,760
that you do and the stuff that comes out

1687
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,680
of it where I'm most proud of where I'm

1688
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,440
like, "Oh, I get to do this. I think

1689
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,000
this bit could be fun." You know, like I

1690
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,079
remember we had Mick Jagger on the show

1691
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,599
and Lauren said, "Mick, we'll do a

1692
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,680
sketch if anyone has an idea." And they

1693
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,359
go, "I could do an idea where I'm the

1694
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,880
reflection of Mick Jagger in the

1695
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:37,039
mirror." And I'm like, "You know what?

1696
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,440
Why don't shut that what?" And Lauren

1697
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,880
goes, "Please don't do that. Absolutely.

1698
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,119
Please, please don't do that." He goes,

1699
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,599
"It's been done. The Mark's brothers

1700
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,039
have done it. It's just Lucille Ball is

1701
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,799
just it's been done. Don't please don't

1702
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,400
do that." I go, "Okay." He goes, "But go

1703
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,680
pitch Mick ideas." I go, "I don't want

1704
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,200
to pitch him ideas. I'm You're the

1705
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,039
producer. I'm nervous. I don't I don't

1706
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,880
know MC Jagger. He's like, "Just go in

1707
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:00,480
and pitch me the ideas." I go, "So, I

1708
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,400
wrote out like 10 ideas." I'm like, "Uh,

1709
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,400
hi Mick." He's like, he's very nice. And

1710
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,359
uh and I go, "Um, you know, I was

1711
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,720
thinking maybe me and you uh I play you

1712
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:13,440
play Keith and I'm you and you know um

1713
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,559
we work at a you know, sunglass hut or

1714
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,720
something like that." And he's like,

1715
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:20,240
"Not that." And I go, "Uh, well, then I

1716
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,920
have this other idea, you know, where,

1717
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,440
you know, you and I work in an ice cream

1718
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,119
shop, but we're, you know, blah, blah,

1719
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,520
blah." And he's like, "Nah, nah, I don't

1720
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,359
really like that. I don't not I don't

1721
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,880
want to do that." And I go, "All right."

1722
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,559
Um, and I'm going down the list and the

1723
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,880
ideas are getting worse and worse. And

1724
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,880
I'm just like, "Oh my gosh." And then

1725
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,319
out of desperation, I go, "Or we could

1726
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,240
do something where you come in your

1727
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,079
dressing room and I'm your reflection in

1728
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,760
the mirror and you're like, "What? Why

1729
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,680
am I doing this shot? Done in the 70s

1730
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,599
and done in the ' 80s and what why am I

1731
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,280
doing that? Walmart that. And he goes,

1732
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,799
"Oh, I like that." And I go, "So I go

1733
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,440
back to Lauren's office. I go, "Good

1734
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:57,760
news, bad news. Good news. Mick wants to

1735
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,119
do a sketch. Bad news is it's the mirror

1736
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:03,920
sketch." And he So Lauren was like,

1737
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:06,319
"Okay, we'll do it." And uh we wrote it

1738
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,839
in a night, which never been done, I

1739
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:11,680
don't think, when I was on the show. We

1740
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:14,359
wrote it on a Thursday night, rehearsed

1741
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,960
it once on Friday, and did the show on

1742
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:18,560
Saturday. And it worked. And it really

1743
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,400
worked. It was might be the one of the

1744
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,520
best sketches I was ever in. And Mick

1745
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,960
was so happy that he like was so giddy.

1746
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,199
And he kind of shook my hand through the

1747
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,880
mirror, which is funny cuz we I'm

1748
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,880
supposed to be his reflection. And it

1749
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,400
was just kind of cool. And I I remember

1750
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,960
one of those things where I'm like the

1751
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,400
room was shaking and I go, "That's

1752
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,759
cool." Like, dude, that's beyond what I

1753
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,319
dreamt I I could do. You know, being on

1754
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,839
S Live is one dream, but now you you're

1755
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,560
doing it sketch with one of your rock

1756
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:52,640
idols, you know, and and scoring and

1757
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,000
it's great. It's really funny and

1758
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,839
everyone's having a good time. Like, you

1759
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
really like But that's something. And it

1760
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:59,199
was wasn't meant to be. It wasn't

1761
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,839
written. It was all just kind of

1762
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:04,080
happened last minute. And you know, but

1763
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:06,799
those little moments all kind of add up

1764
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,719
and you go, "Oh my gosh, this is so

1765
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,159
crazy that this is all happening." How

1766
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,440
was that? I was looking before you

1767
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,799
arrived at all the people you've

1768
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,880
interviewed going back more than a

1769
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:18,719
decade and it's just everybody. It's

1770
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,719
like Floyd Mayweather to you insert the

1771
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,239
name of the person who's at the top of

1772
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,759
an industry. You've sat with them.

1773
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:26,000
They've been on your show. I was

1774
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,799
thinking like how has that altered your

1775
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,199
perception of not just what fame is but

1776
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:32,880
like what life is about because you've

1777
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:34,480
met the best of the best, the top of the

1778
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,640
top, the richest of the rich, the most

1779
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,199
famous of the

1780
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,759
famous. I'm interested, you know, in

1781
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,159
people, whoever it may be, whether it's

1782
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,600
Bruce Springsteen or, you know, Angelina

1783
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:47,560
Jolie or something, you know, you're

1784
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,799
talking to them just

1785
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,279
like talk to me about this thing or what

1786
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,800
I don't know. It's like uh also with my

1787
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,760
show I got to jump right in. I have

1788
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:01,520
probably Yeah. 10 minutes interview, you

1789
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,760
know, which is you got to get in there

1790
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,679
fast and you go like I got to make them

1791
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,159
comfortable and know that I'm not going

1792
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,400
to make them look bad. I just want to

1793
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,159
talk to them and go like, "Hey, blah

1794
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,239
blah blah." Or I'll make a thing or I'll

1795
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:16,320
just say some joke or I don't know what

1796
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:18,159
I'll do. And they're like, "Really?" And

1797
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,320
then they'll be themselves. And then you

1798
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:21,920
go, "Now it's flowing." and you go,

1799
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,080
"Yeah, yeah, yeah." And then you can get

1800
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,480
into the movie talk and you know, you

1801
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,320
know, and sell the product or whatever,

1802
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,800
you know, which is whatever. But it's

1803
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,800
that first kind of five to seven minutes

1804
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,960
where you get in there and then you

1805
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,080
start playing with them and you start

1806
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,080
like if you can get a laugh out of Floyd

1807
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,159
Mayweather or something, it's cool. How

1808
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,719
do you make them feel comfortable? Is

1809
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:46,320
this You must have something that you

1810
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,719
have learned about what it is that makes

1811
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,280
someone feel comfortable. I don't know.

1812
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:53,120
Oh, I don't have an exact recipe. I I

1813
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,560
will tell you that I go in before the

1814
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,199
show to their dress room to say hello

1815
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,640
before the show. Okay. Just to say hi,

1816
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,159
how's it going? Then I'll just talk to

1817
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,239
them. Sometimes I talk to them longer

1818
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:04,640
than the interview cuz I we'll get

1819
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:07,920
talking about something or life or some

1820
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,280
bit or you know, you know, their parents

1821
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,360
or something, you know, just get into

1822
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,679
real life talk and by the time they come

1823
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,080
out, they feel like we've already

1824
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:20,320
talked. So, it's less pressure. I think

1825
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:23,040
also after 16 years of talking to I've

1826
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,960
seen everyone at their highest. I've

1827
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,640
seen everyone at their lowest. I've seen

1828
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,440
people date people they shouldn't date.

1829
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,760
I've seen people get married and have

1830
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,719
babies and just really fun to watch. And

1831
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,120
it's fun to go back and now even if I

1832
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,800
see these people once a year, twice a

1833
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,800
year, I feel like I know them a little

1834
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,040
bit and you're like, "Oh yeah, Floyd,

1835
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,040
good to see you. What's up?" Or Mick,

1836
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,199
you know, you know, how's it going? has,

1837
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,520
you know, has your kids what, you know,

1838
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,840
we can just talk and we're caught up and

1839
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,400
you're like, "Oh, yeah." And it's kind

1840
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,640
of feels like maybe it doesn't to them,

1841
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,800
but to me it's it's it feels like I just

1842
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,239
saw them yesterday and that we're, you

1843
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,840
know, even though it's probably I

1844
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,600
haven't seen them in a year, it feels

1845
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,199
like I just saw you. They go, "Oh,

1846
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,080
yeah." How do you stop it from getting

1847
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,760
old? And I say this because I um

1848
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,280
obviously have been doing this podcast

1849
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,640
now, really for about four years. That's

1850
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,560
really that I consider the starting

1851
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,040
point when we started on YouTube. And I

1852
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:20,640
wonder what I've got to do to make sure

1853
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,840
that I never get bored of doing this. I

1854
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,440
don't think you ever will. There's just

1855
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,199
so many interesting people. Yeah,

1856
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,560
there's so many people in this world and

1857
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:30,320
it's it it doesn't end. I mean, four

1858
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,480
years. I'm trying to think of where that

1859
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,320
was. That was round at the end of late

1860
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,120
night for me. I mean, you're just you're

1861
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:39,360
you're doing all the things. You're

1862
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,280
you're just expanding. I mean, but

1863
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,080
you're working hard. I mean, you're

1864
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,560
you're trying. I think just keep trying.

1865
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,480
If you stop trying, you get boring

1866
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,960
tomorrow. But here you are in New York

1867
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,960
with 10 cameras. I mean, you're not in

1868
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,960
London. You're not in your kitchen. This

1869
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,840
is fake. Don't Don't break the illusion.

1870
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,840
This is fake. This wall's not real. This

1871
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,320
is not This is There's a light here.

1872
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,560
This is all fake. This is all a fake

1873
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:07,280
thing. This is how This is how you don't

1874
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,600
make it old. You don't You have to work.

1875
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,239
This is all nothing here is real. This

1876
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,560
is all a studio. But that's how you make

1877
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:17,760
it now. Get old. This is Yes. But this

1878
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:20,080
is I think how you make it uh exciting

1879
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,640
is you you got to put the work in. Don't

1880
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,320
get tired. You got to show up and you

1881
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,480
you always got to show up. You got to be

1882
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,280
there and you got to be there for your

1883
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:32,320
uh audience. And you do that. You you

1884
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,719
show up. You you you do all the stuff. I

1885
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,800
mean, you have to. And that's like you

1886
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,159
said, it's kind of a seven days a week

1887
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,159
thing, but it's every day you go, what

1888
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,679
can I do? What can I do? What can I do?

1889
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:46,239
It just becomes part of your life. It's

1890
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,000
brushing your teeth. It's like, oh yeah,

1891
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,159
I guess brushing your teeth. Someone at

1892
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,840
one point told me I had to do that. You

1893
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,760
know, but now I do it every day, so I

1894
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,480
don't think about it. I brush them three

1895
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,040
times, four times a day. Now I'm like,

1896
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,560
how do you keep yourself challenged?

1897
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,239
Uh, is there something that you're doing

1898
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,600
to to push yourself? because you know we

1899
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:06,080
expand around the world. We go to

1900
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,159
different places. We have increasingly

1901
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,600
more interesting different guests and

1902
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,040
challenge ourselves in that way. But you

1903
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,880
when I looked at your show I was like he

1904
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,159
started with the biggest in the world. I

1905
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,360
know you started in the biggest city in

1906
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,440
the world. Start putting more pressure

1907
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,040
on yourself for any little challenges or

1908
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,960
trying something. You go like I've

1909
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:24,159
always wanted to put out a Christmas

1910
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,080
album, you know, uh and and and just

1911
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,000
come out with and and write original

1912
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,320
songs. You know, trying to write songs

1913
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,120
is hard enough. trying to write 20

1914
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:35,679
original Christmas songs. It's insane.

1915
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,280
And what's what's what hasn't been said?

1916
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,960
I have an idea for a kids book that I

1917
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,960
think could be funny, you know? Yeah,

1918
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,120
data was the first one that was a big

1919
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,280
deal. It's really the same word on every

1920
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,400
page. It's just getting your kid to say

1921
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,880
dada. So, I thought that no one's done

1922
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,880
this. So, I go basically if you get to

1923
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,440
the end of the book, it's you saying the

1924
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,400
word da so many times that I think your

1925
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,320
baby has to eventually just go da da.

1926
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,800
So, it'll work. But then you released

1927
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:07,679
Mama. I had to because my wife

1928
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,960
and and all my female fans were like,

1929
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,719
"Really? You have two daughters and

1930
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,800
you're not going to write mama because

1931
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,800
this is the real truth. Everything is

1932
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:18,000
mama." So, that's kind of the same book

1933
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,520
except I changed it to you want the kids

1934
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,320
to say dada and they just keep saying

1935
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,360
mama. I have a I found some wonderful

1936
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,159
photos of your childhood which I adored.

1937
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,239
Go these photos. You probably recognize

1938
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,679
quite a few of them. Did I post these?

1939
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,320
Where would you find these? I went

1940
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,719
through your house. Oh my god. This is

1941
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:41,040
my Catholic uh teacher, kindergarten

1942
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,840
teacher. Um that's Mrs. Fulling. That's

1943
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,159
Frank Gentiel we talked about earlier.

1944
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,080
Friend Steve Tabboutout. These are my

1945
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,719
dorm room friends. I would do stand up

1946
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:53,679
with Frank and Steve was kind of the

1947
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:57,040
artist in the group. Is that Gloria

1948
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:59,480
underneath? This is Yeah. Gloria. Yeah,

1949
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:04,000
that's my mom. That's my mom in our

1950
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:07,040
kitchen. Um where we spent many a time.

1951
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,400
We we parted many times in that kitchen.

1952
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:12,719
In November 2017 when she passed away,

1953
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,480
you said as a tribute on the Tonight

1954
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,239
Show, which I watched, the best

1955
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,840
audience, referring to your mother that

1956
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,480
she was the best audience. She was the

1957
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,320
one I was always trying to make laugh.

1958
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,080
Mom, I'll never stop trying to make you

1959
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,600
laugh. And I heard you talk about

1960
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,040
squeezing her hand three times when you

1961
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,600
were younger and her squeezing yours

1962
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,600
back. In a fraction of like public

1963
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,440
attention I've experienced, one of the

1964
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:37,280
things that acts as an insulator to all

1965
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:39,760
of that for me is knowing that I have a

1966
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,800
home to return to. And home for me isn't

1967
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,560
a place, it's people, you know? Yeah.

1968
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,199
And that's the thing that makes all of

1969
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:51,040
the noise feel fake and like it's not

1970
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:52,480
real and that there is something real.

1971
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,120
And so when I was thinking about all of

1972
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,480
that and you losing her and her being

1973
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,320
the audience, her being home for

1974
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,320
you,

1975
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:04,360
I I have to understand like how that

1976
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,199
changed

1977
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,040
you. Yeah. It's it's it was it's the

1978
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,600
toughest thing that I had to go through.

1979
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,040
I think see it. You know that it's going

1980
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:17,600
to come eventually, but it's just it was

1981
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:21,440
uh just so sad because just she was so

1982
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:25,760
much joy in my life.

1983
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:28,480
Uh, I just miss her. Yeah. But you don't

1984
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,280
stop thinking about the people, you

1985
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:33,920
know, and you think about all these

1986
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,280
things and you look at all these other

1987
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,440
photos and you go, "Yeah, that was

1988
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,280
probably she probably gave me the

1989
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,920
microphone. My mom was probably here

1990
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,840
giving me the microphone."

1991
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,679
And when you think about people dying,

1992
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,719
especially when it happens for the first

1993
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,159
week, you go, I'm going to forget about

1994
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:56,560
them and I can't. And you go, it's so

1995
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:58,719
sad. And then the truth is it just you

1996
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,040
don't you don't forget about them ever.

1997
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:03,520
They will never they're in your life.

1998
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,000
You think about them in the weirdest

1999
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,400
moments. And you'll hear a song and I'll

2000
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,920
hear like Duran Durant or something. I

2001
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,640
don't even know if my mom liked Randran,

2002
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,239
but something remind me of me and my mom

2003
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,080
listen, you know, think of my mom like,

2004
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:20,080
"Oh my god, can't believe I'm listening

2005
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:21,520
to Hungry Like the Wolf or whatever Rio

2006
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,440
and I'm thinking about my mom and

2007
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,080
getting sad." But you do you have those

2008
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,560
moments when it's like but but it's it's

2009
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,840
more happier moments and you don't get

2010
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:34,880
that emotional. You know, if I you know

2011
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,600
want to I can just start crying because

2012
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:42,159
I just miss her. But I I I I think of

2013
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:44,239
the best times and you know I think I

2014
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:46,400
wouldn't be who I am with without her.

2015
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:48,320
You know when you say that you miss her,

2016
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,520
you've said that a few times. What what

2017
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:53,360
precisely is it that you miss?

2018
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,159
She had a great sense of humor and she

2019
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:58,760
was always, you know, and I think

2020
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:01,480
there's so many things.

2021
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,239
uh talking

2022
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,400
about probably talking about myself a

2023
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,239
lot. I go like did you see the thing I

2024
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,080
did or the thing or I want her to bring

2025
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,520
it up like that thing you did was great

2026
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,600
and then it makes you feel good. So, I

2027
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,360
kind of miss the positive reinforcement,

2028
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,880
the feedback, positive feedback of

2029
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,679
something that I did that I kind of

2030
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,120
miss. And her, you know, complaining

2031
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,960
about something or talking about

2032
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,120
something she doesn't like or I feel

2033
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,000
like that would kind of give me material

2034
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,520
and I miss

2035
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,199
like, you know, calling on my birthdays

2036
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:36,480
and, you know, just she's so much love.

2037
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:38,159
She just loved me so much.

2038
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,000
I do worry about I worry about this

2039
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,920
because I I think sometimes we don't

2040
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,360
realize the importance of certain

2041
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,520
relationships until we lose them and my

2042
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,960
parents are getting older and I think I

2043
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,840
have some kind of like subconscious

2044
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,600
existential fear

2045
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:54,400
that there will be words unsaid or I

2046
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,480
will I will learn the hard way that

2047
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,600
there's things I should have said, you

2048
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,440
know. Yeah. Yeah. You kind of Yeah. I I

2049
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,800
think I said everything. I think I said

2050
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,960
everything. Sounds like you spoke to her

2051
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,120
a lot. I I did. I said everything. She

2052
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,239
knew that I loved her. And you know, it

2053
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:13,040
just it kind of happened fast, which I

2054
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,880
kind of hope uh I I think that was a

2055
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,360
good thing. I I hope it doesn't happen

2056
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:20,560
slow for you cuz I don't know if I could

2057
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:23,320
take that. This happened really quickly.

2058
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:26,159
And so I was like, are you able to

2059
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:27,760
grieve? Were you able to grieve? Yes, I

2060
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,560
went for it. My wife was really helpful

2061
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,920
with that. She was like, go for it. just

2062
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,840
you just cry and just grieve because

2063
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,159
eventually you actually just have to

2064
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,920
stop crying. There's no way you can keep

2065
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:42,080
crying. There's no way. But you feel

2066
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,000
like there's a hole in your heart and a

2067
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,320
hole in your lungs. You feel unhealthy

2068
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,480
and you feel like like you have to go to

2069
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,080
the hospital that you're going to die.

2070
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,679
You know, you just have to go through

2071
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,880
that and you go and then you

2072
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:58,640
just just get it out of your system. And

2073
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,320
then, you know, as time goes on, you

2074
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,960
just start be able to laugh at the

2075
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,800
things kind of happy memories, you know,

2076
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,760
and sad she's not here anymore,

2077
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:11,760
but glad for what she gave me. And when

2078
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,880
all the memories, I mean, it's way

2079
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,400
outweighs the the sad thing. I just wish

2080
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,159
it was around is the only thing. And if

2081
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,000
you harp on that, then it's too

2082
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,880
depressing. Did it change your

2083
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,719
perspective on your own work? Cuz it's

2084
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,080
funny. I I remember thinking about my

2085
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,880
old business when it was like the it was

2086
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,040
my entire life. I was thinking if I lost

2087
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,960
this person in my life now. I don't know

2088
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:36,440
if my business would mean the same to me

2089
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:40,920
because in part I'm doing this for them.

2090
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:43,280
Yeah. Yes. You still do it for

2091
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:46,239
them. In a weird way. I still do this

2092
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:49,280
for my mom. I I think of her when I do

2093
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:51,199
things. I go she would be she would be

2094
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,800
psyched. She would be proud. She would

2095
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:57,040
that would make her laugh. I still think

2096
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,800
of her for most things I do. Like she

2097
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,560
would love that. That would make her

2098
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,440
laugh. That would make her proud. She'd

2099
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,840
be like, "Oh, that's funny." Or, "That's

2100
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,760
that's good that you did that." Her

2101
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,280
loss, you turning 50. Yeah.

2102
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,639
putting all these pieces together, it

2103
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:17,520
seems like this might have inspired your

2104
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:19,760
increased concern and uh I guess drive

2105
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,960
for longevity and health because we

2106
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,320
talked just before we started recording

2107
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,440
and I asked you what's sort of front of

2108
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,520
mind for you at the moment and one of

2109
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,920
the things you mentioned was longevity

2110
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:32,480
and health. Yeah. When did

2111
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:35,040
that emerge? I maybe around I mean I'm

2112
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,040
50 right now but I think you know I I

2113
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,199
think about my my parents are they were

2114
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,400
never healthy. you know, they used to

2115
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:44,000
drink a lot at the time they smoked, you

2116
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,360
know, when everyone smoked. I think

2117
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,080
there's a picture of my mom pregnant

2118
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:51,840
with me drinking and smoking. Um, which

2119
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:54,239
is fantastic. I mean, gosh, terrible.

2120
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,280
Um, but man, I turned out okay, right?

2121
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:59,920
Sure.

2122
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:02,239
Wink. We see listen to this back. Yeah,

2123
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:06,159
maybe I didn't turn out. Maybe this is a

2124
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:09,360
lesson. Uh but uh yeah, I think about uh

2125
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:12,520
being around for my kids and trying to

2126
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:16,159
be alive and kind of

2127
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:18,400
um uh financially stable for my kids,

2128
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,600
too. Cuz I I don't think my parents

2129
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,320
thought about any of that stuff. They

2130
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,159
just go, "No, this just have it was a

2131
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,239
lot of fun and like a lot of support and

2132
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:28,159
like we're that was a lot of the thing,

2133
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:30,840
you know, but they didn't really didn't

2134
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:32,960
work out. I think I think we bought a

2135
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,560
treadmill twice, you know, different

2136
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,639
times, just tried to make it something

2137
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,239
that we would all do and no one ever did

2138
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,520
it. So, what does that actually mean for

2139
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,639
you in terms of your longevity and

2140
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,840
health journey? Does it mean that you're

2141
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,159
you're going to the gym, you're thinking

2142
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,719
about what you're eating? Yeah, I'm

2143
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:49,840
definitely eating better. I'm I'm work

2144
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:53,760
out when I can. You know, I walk every

2145
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:57,760
day. Um I love walking. Um, but yeah, I

2146
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:01,280
try to uh, you know, I don't drink as

2147
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,520
much as I used to. And, you know, uh, I

2148
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,639
I get

2149
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:08,560
checkups. Not that I'm unhealthy, but I

2150
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:10,480
think, you know, I I I just want to be

2151
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,800
around for a long time. I don't even

2152
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,239
know how long I want to live, to be

2153
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:16,480
honest. I don't want to be that old that

2154
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,560
I'm older than everyone in my I mean, I

2155
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:22,159
want to have people my age. I don't want

2156
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,320
to be 130. Yeah. and no one else is

2157
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:26,560
like, "Dude, that guy won't die." I

2158
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:29,040
mean, eventually it's it should happen.

2159
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,040
I just want to be I want it to all

2160
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,480
happen kind of in the right way and then

2161
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,960
eventually as you get you go on and

2162
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:40,000
they'll all pass away, but I want to be

2163
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,520
able to be enjoying everything. Now, for

2164
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,679
anybody that likes matcha, for anybody

2165
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,400
that likes lattes, one of my companies

2166
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,360
has just launched canned matcha lattes.

2167
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,520
I was speaking with the founder,

2168
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:52,080
Marissa, and she said that creating this

2169
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,639
product has been no easy feat. They

2170
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,320
tried launching in 2021, but as is often

2171
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,000
the case in business, the development

2172
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,239
process turned out to be extremely

2173
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,560
complex. So, they've spent the last four

2174
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:04,960
years testing and refining every single

2175
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,760
detail to create this, which is a

2176
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,719
perfect Ted matcha vanilla latte and a

2177
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,480
perfect Ted matcha strawberry latte. So,

2178
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,639
what we have here in these cans is

2179
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,480
barista quality matcha straight from the

2180
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,960
can. And it tastes like it's just been

2181
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:21,600
made from your favorite cafe. Naturally

2182
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,960
sweet and naturally creamy in a can. And

2183
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,480
the reason why I've invested in this

2184
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,080
company and I drink matcha is because

2185
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,000
matcha as an energy source gives me

2186
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,679
lasting energy without the big crashes

2187
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,120
that I get from other products. Grab

2188
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,960
their ready to drink canned matcha

2189
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:35,120

01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,560
I'm launching to the world. We have so

2199
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,120
many incredible things that happen that

01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,639
you are never shown. We have the briefs

2201
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,719
that are on my iPad when I'm recording

2202
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:02,000
the conversation. We have clips we've

2203
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,679
never released. We have behind the

2204
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,159
scenes conversations with the guest and

2205
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:09,440
also the episodes that we've never ever

2206
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:11,199
released. And so much more. In the

2207
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,800
circle, you'll have direct access to me.

the types of conversations you would

2211
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,719
love us to have. But remember, for now,

2212
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,960

2213
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,239

2214
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,440

description below or go to

2217
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:33,679
daccircle.com. I will speak to you

2218
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,920
there.

2219
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,520
Is there a next chapter in your mind

2220
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:42,639
that you're looking at already? Are you

2221
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:44,239
thinking about life beyond TV?

2222
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,760
Media is changing so much. I mean, you

2223
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,840
were one of the sort of real pioneers

2224
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,000
that rode the shift towards the internet

2225
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,159
and digital, and you've got more bloody

2226
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,400
followers on YouTube and Twitter and

2227
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,440
Instagram than anybody, I think, of I

2228
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,159
think you've got like 100 million

2229
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:01,120
followers or something crazy. Um, but

2230
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:03,600
are you thinking about the next wave of

2231
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:06,080
Jimmy?

2232
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:10,639
Not not really. I feel like this is a

2233
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:12,080
good gig for that type of aging. I think

2234
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,560
the older you get, the kind of the

2235
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:18,320
better the talk show gets. Like, you

2236
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:21,679
know, Johnny Carson did it for 30 years,

2237
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:23,199
I want to say. And, you know, I think I

2238
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,639
can do it as long as there's an

2239
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,159
audience. And I feel like there is

2240
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,600
always going to be an audience. I feel

2241
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:31,280
like I know everyone's like, "TV is

2242
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:33,440
dying. You know, the ratings are dying."

2243
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,159
But I don't think it is. I think TV is

2244
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,560
just as powerful as it ever was. I think

2245
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:41,199
they're making some of the best

2246
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,880
entertainment, the best shows are on

2247
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,400
television. If you call it something

2248
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,600
else, if you call it Netflix or if you

2249
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:49,040
call it, you know, live podcast or

2250
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,040
whatever it is, you're still watching,

2251
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,679
you need entertainment. And thank God

2252
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,159
for entertainment because you just find

2253
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:59,120
yourself when

2254
01:27:55,159 --> 01:28:01,840
you're when you're needing some out

2255
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,960
outlet or creative or something or even

2256
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,560
a break, whatever you want to call it,

2257
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,480
meditation. Television is there for you.

2258
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,639
You can turn on television, watch a

2259
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,120
movie, watch a show, and you're like,

2260
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,400
"Ah, this is great. For an hour of my

2261
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,080
life, I don't have to think about my

2262
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,679
problems. I'm thinking about their

2263
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,000
problems." or watching a reality show,

2264
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,760
whatever show you it is you're watching,

2265
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,679
but your brain's moving. It's not like

2266
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,440
your brain's shut off. You're you're

2267
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:28,080
listening to this podcast. It's not

2268
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,520
you're not just zoning out going, you're

2269
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,199
actually thinking while you're listening

2270
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,199
to this and this is changing the way you

2271
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:36,960
think. You may not agree that I think

2272
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:38,480
you might think, oh, television's over

2273
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,239
what, but that's interesting. It's still

2274
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:43,440
your brain's moving and this is fun for

2275
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:45,120
people to listen to. And this is I think

2276
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,280
entertainment is always going to be

2277
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:50,960
there. has to be around. And I think

2278
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:53,520
it's it's just in it it it's moving this

2279
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,400
way and that way, but I still feel like

2280
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,320
eventually there's a screen in your

2281
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,480
house or wherever you're living that

2282
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,440
you're going to want to see things on.

2283
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,440
You know, whether it's going to be

2284
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,159
through your eyeglasses or if it's going

2285
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:08,880
to be through your, you know, contact

2286
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:11,280
lenses or uh your phone or whatever it

2287
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,600
is, you know, I don't think it's going

2288
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:16,960
to be the Apple goggles, but they have

2289
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,719
to try. Outside of um TV, you're very

2290
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,440
busy. I was reading through your

2291
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,560
business portfolio and it's extremely

2292
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:25,199
extensive. You founded a production

2293
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,639
company. Oh, yeah. Producing several

2294
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:31,600
shows, series, films. You made a comedy

2295
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:34,400
a series of comedy albums. Yeah. The

2296
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,280
last one was called Holiday Seasoning,

2297
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:40,400
which I I it's a it's a Christmas album,

2298
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:43,199
but I I wanted to create like a new verb

2299
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,800
like, hey, we're all we're all holiday

2300
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:47,120
seasoning. Like, are you holiday

2301
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,280
seasoning? I'm celebrating Hanukkah.

2302
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,520
I'm, you know, I'm celebrating Quanza.

2303
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,840
We're all holiday seasoning. Uh, it

2304
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,239
didn't take off, but you know what?

2305
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,080
Maybe in the future, maybe, you know, at

2306
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:59,920
2050, people will all be saying, "Hey,

2307
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,159
are you holiday seasoning?" You know,

2308
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,000
yeah, we're all I don't know. I didn't I

2309
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:05,360
don't know if I created what I wanted to

2310
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,400
on that one, but but you got the ice

2311
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,960
cream, the Tonight D. Tonight dough ice

2312
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:13,120
cream. We've raised a lot of money for

2313
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,120
uh Serious Fun, which is a great

2314
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,800
charity. It's a great ice cream, by the

2315
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:19,760
way, but it's actually goes to a great

2316
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,280
cause, so it's win-win. Beautiful. I was

2317
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,960
reading about it before. It's really

2318
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,920
cool. Yeah. And outside of that, there's

2319
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,480
lots of other things from uh a ride at

2320
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,080
the Universal Studios to spinnies to

2321
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:33,120
Yeah, we got our own roller coaster.

2322
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:35,920
Yeah. Crazy. Gob God stompers skate

2323
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:38,560
shoes. Yes. Gobstoppers were a sneaker

2324
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,560
that um we came up with that the more

2325
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,520
you wear them, the more the leather

2326
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:46,320
wears down and they become different

2327
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:47,800
colors. So eventually every pair of

2328
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,639
shoes

2329
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:52,880
become unique to that person. There's no

2330
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,000
two pairs of the same shoe. The through

2331
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:59,199
line here, Jimmy, is about making people

2332
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,639
happy. from rides to ice cream to the

2333
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,800
creativity and the fun of the products

2334
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:06,880
that you've made. That's appears to be

2335
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:08,159
the through line. I like that. Yeah. But

2336
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,159
that's the through line of your life in

2337
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:14,159
many respects. It's it's a really

2338
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:15,440
relentless attempt to to please others

2339
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:19,520
and to make people smile and to make

2340
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:22,159
them happy. Yeah, I I I do. I like that.

2341
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,679
I like making people happy. It it makes

2342
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,960
me happy.

2343
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,560
And now you've got two beautiful

2344
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,320
children.

2345
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,080
It's the greatest thing. You're a dad.

2346
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:33,040
It's the greatest thing. I'm a dad. Can

2347
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:35,840
you believe that? This guy would be This

2348
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,800
guy would be a dad. This guy would be a

2349
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:42,320
dad. This is silliest. And I I think I'm

2350
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,840
a good dad. Uh they're the best kids. I

2351
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:46,480
love them so much. They're so fun.

2352
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:49,040
They're funny. They They make jokes.

2353
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,280
They're interesting. They're interested.

2354
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:54,480
How did that shift the meaning of life

2355
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,840
for you becoming a father? Because I I'm

2356
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,400
in the process of hopefully having

2357
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,080
children at some point. I'm I'm trying.

2358
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,920
You I'll tell you one thing that

2359
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:05,159
surprised me. I I don't want to tell you

2360
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:08,080
about your own kids cuz no

2361
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:09,360
spoilers. You're going to you're just

2362
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,800
going to figure it all out. And when

2363
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,280
they get to a certain age, we'll talk

2364
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,880
and you be like, "Dude, and they go,

2365
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,840
"Yeah, of course." I didn't I didn't

2366
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,719
want to ruin it for you. It's it's

2367
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,080
great. It's a lot. It's great. Um, but

2368
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,280
the one thing I didn't think I would

2369
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:27,600
happen to me is I like other kids more.

2370
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,600
I I actually appreciate other kids and

2371
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,840
they go, "Hey, are you not sharing with

2372
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,480
that or that kid's got no friends, go

2373
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,719
talk to that kid or cuz you go that

2374
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,480
could happen to me, my kid." So you

2375
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,520
start thinking about other hey no no no

2376
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:43,760
no be nice to him or he's you know it's

2377
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:46,159
like you and then the screaming baby in

2378
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,760
the restaurant that once when you were

2379
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:50,080
younger you go like will you shut that

2380
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,480
baby up now you go like dude give me the

2381
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,480
kid I'll take the kid for a walk I will

2382
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,080
shut the baby will cut I understand what

2383
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,960
it's like to get out and be a parent and

2384
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,360
you don't want the kid to cry and I I

2385
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,040
get all that now and you go oh I'm much

2386
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,400
more patient with that. What advice

2387
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,760
would you give your two daughters for

2388
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,880
life? A life

2389
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:11,880
well-lived. They said, "Dad, listen. How

2390
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:15,520
do we how do we live a good

2391
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,520
life?" Be nice to

2392
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:20,000
people. Give when you

2393
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:26,679
can. Make people smile.

2394
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:31,320
What if they say, "Dad,

2395
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:35,480
I I want to know how to be

2396
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:39,239
successful." Then go do what you want to

2397
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:41,639
do. I think that will make make you

2398
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:44,480
successful. Do what you want to

2399
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:45,880
do. If you do what you want to do,

2400
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:50,360
you'll be

2401
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,360
successful. How are you misunderstood?

2402
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,120
Because we're all misunderstood in some

2403
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,800
way, you know?

2404
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:01,280
Maybe someone that

2405
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,520
laughs at everything. I don't really

2406
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:06,520
laugh at everything. I do have a good

2407
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,360
time, but I don't laugh at everything. I

2408
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,760
think one way I'm misunderstood is maybe

2409
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:14,400
people don't think that I know what I'm

2410
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,159
doing or that I, you know, I'm just

2411
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,000
living through life like I don't know

2412
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:21,920
what's going on. But I do know what's

2413
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,480
going on. And uh I do care and and I I I

2414
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,800
put a lot of work into what I do and I

2415
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,040
really put a lot of thought and care

2416
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,760
into things that I put out. What does

2417
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:33,840
your gravestone say, Jimmy? If you could

2418
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,320
write it yourself,

2419
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,320
I would

2420
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:40,480
say he had a good

2421
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:49,040
time. That's not bad. I like

2422
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:51,679
that. Jimmy, thank thank you for

2423
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:53,520
doing what you do. Um, it's uh it's so

2424
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,560
unbelievably apparent to to me as

2425
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,639
someone that's just spent a little bit

2426
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,199
of time for you that in your

2427
01:34:57,639 --> 01:35:03,400
heart you are an

2428
01:35:00,199 --> 01:35:07,199
incredibly pure, well-intentioned,

2429
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:08,840
happy, radiant person who has a really

2430
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:11,199
authentic

2431
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,600
desire to spread that to other people.

2432
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:16,800
and in fact gains a tremendous amount of

2433
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,400
energy and happiness from making people

2434
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,800
like me and everyone that you met in my

2435
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:22,000
team behind the scenes happy. And we

2436
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,000
need more people like that in the world,

2437
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,600
especially in times like these where

2438
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
there's so much division and the the

2439
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,679
internet is an absolute war zone. It

2440
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,600
feels like everybody's frankly losing if

2441
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,159
I'm being honest because everybody's

2442
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,639
just firing shots at each other on both

2443
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:38,239
sides of the aisle, but just generally

2444
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,440
just all sides of life. So, it's

2445
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:41,440
wonderful to have people in the world

2446
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,480
and safe spaces and fun places that

2447
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:46,719
maintain a bubble of happiness and joy

2448
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:48,719
and humor. And you're one of those

2449
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,080
incredible spaces on the internet, but

2450
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,199
just generally in life as well. So,

2451
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,080
thank you. It's such an honor to have

2452
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,679
spent time with you and you're someone

2453
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,120
that I've looked up to forever. You

2454
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:57,600
know, I've you've been on screen for

2455
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:59,199
most of my adult life and I've before I

2456
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,320
was interviewing people and I had the

2457
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,840
privilege of doing this. So, you're one

2458
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,280
of my idols as well and so thank you for

2459
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,120
that as well. It's been um tremendous

2460
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,639
honor and I feel somewhat it's it's

2461
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,639
incredible that I'm like in New York and

2462
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,159
I'm sat across from you. It's really

2463
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,480
something special. Keep doing what

2464
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:15,040
you're doing. You're great. You're

2465
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,800
fantastic. And I had the greatest time.

2466
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,120
It was so fun. I want to say thank you

2467
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,360
to every camera. Thank you. Thank you.

2468
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,760
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

2469
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,920
you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a

2470
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,760
closing tradition. Oh. Where the last

2471
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,040
guests leaves a question for the next

2472
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,239
guest not knowing who they're leaving it

2473
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,760
for. and we'll ask you to do the same.

2474
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,520
The question left for you is an

2475
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,920
interesting one. It was how would your

2476
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,000
view of yourself

2477
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:43,880
change and how would your behavior

2478
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:49,400
change if you learned beyond doubt that

2479
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:53,400
reality is not objective but exists

2480
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:56,000
only in what you do and your

2481
01:36:53,400 --> 01:37:00,199
actions. God, the edibles kicked in

2482
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,800
whoever wrote that one. It's a deep one.

2483
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:06,760
Jesus. I wouldn't be

2484
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:09,520
shocked. I I wouldn't be shocked. I go,

2485
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,880
"Wow." I I probably would take credit

2486
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:14,400
for it. I'd probably say, "I knew

2487
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,080
that." And then you go, "Wait, what? You

2488
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,360
knew that?" You go, "Yeah, I wouldn't be

2489
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:22,280
shocked if if all of this was just my

2490
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:26,159
based on what I'm doing." It's

2491
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:28,320
fascinating I if that's the real truth.

2492
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:31,639
How fascinating that what a great

2493
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:35,840
experiment this was and I

2494
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:38,639
hope I can't I hope I I passed and again

2495
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,320
I'm a people pleaser. I I whoever is

2496
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:42,400
playing this game I hope they're

2497
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,080
enjoying the game they're playing. I

2498
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,600
sometimes think it's a simulation and we

2499
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:47,600
we think we've like banned that as a

2500
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,880
conversation and someone's playing us.

2501
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,600
Yeah. They're just like messing around.

2502
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,040
It would make sense. But do do you think

2503
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,040
whoever's playing us is enjoying

2504
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,199
themselves? Like we're we're good

2505
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,920
characters. Maybe they like started the

2506
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:01,840
game and they've like wandered off and

2507
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,880
they'll Oh no. It's like Toy Story. They

2508
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,000
don't play us anymore. Yeah. They just

2509
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,440
like they're off into things and they

2510
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,119
like forgot and we're like [ __ ]

2511
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,159
around. Yeah. And then they go I didn't

2512
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:12,639
play that in so long. Jimmy Fallon game.

2513
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:14,400
Oh god. Ste the No, we don't I didn't

2514
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,679
play that game anymore. Yeah. No, I had

2515
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,760
him create a business. They forgot to

2516
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:21,199
turn it off.

2517
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,239
Gosh. But yeah. Well, hopefully that you

2518
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,600
don't have to use You don't have to play

2519
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:26,000

2520
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,920
level. You will, Jimmy. Thank you.

2521

done with the place.

2527
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,920
This has always blown my mind a little

2528
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:44,000
bit. 53% of you that listen to this show
