Bro, I studied from a private college. It was a terrible college and we were associated with the Pune University BAR and that's why the market gap is that we need founder of masters union. I thought what a crazy idea. I came to gather that your object is to be one of the top 10 business schools. Why not? It will happen sooner than you think. I know it. Harvard gave us a model. Upupen gave us a model that spawned thousands of other universities across the world. But I think it's time for us to bring a new model and that's what I'm trying to do. You know at Masters Union they're trying to train all of you guys business by getting you to do business and that's really how you learn business. So your goal is cultivating business acumen and not getting your students to build companies right after college. 20% of my students should not even consider placements. What are you doing so deliberately to increase this percentage? What I do is very interesting. Okay. My question to you is how many of these 1 cr graduates get a job that pays at least 40,000 rupees a month or almost 5 lakh rupees a year 75,000 no India requires 120 more universities 1 1200 more 1200 more universities to become a $30 trillion economy my impact is not going to come from mast's union my impact is going to come from the [Music] This podcast is brought to you by ODO.

Hi brother, how are you? I'm doing well. Thank you so much for having me, bro. I'm so excited to talk to you, and I'll tell you why. Um, I have seen what you've built, but not a lot of people have seen what you've built. What people don't recognize about you, and I'm sure they'll recognize this in 10 years, I can give this to everybody in writing that one day people will recognize Masters Union as a revolution in the Indian education system. And the reason why I admire your work so much is because I keep saying this very often, I am a result of a failed education system or And you know we both believe this that business and entrepreneurship is one of the best way to empower somebody because it turns them into leaders who then create jobs who then push the fabric of the Indian civilization further and eventually they go on to become the greatest contributors to the Indian economy as free birds not as um confined individuals. Um and I think it's an audacious vision to to find a way there right to not really beat them but to at least present an alternative to them from India right most importantly that's a humble way of saying it master pratam wants to beat them okay you know we learn so much from them we are here because of them I am a product of one of those top 10 institutions right I was very very lucky that I got to go to University of Pennsylvania which is an Ivy League school at that time it was ranked two or three Right. And so I am a product of that system. So I can't really say I want to beat it, but I want to learn from it and I want to evolve it. Everything evolves. But I think our education system has not evolved as much as it should have. Our classrooms look essentially the same as they did hundreds 200 years ago, you know. Yeah. And today uh the the agenda that I have for the podcast is pretty clear like I'm somebody who wants to build a business school and I'm going to consider this as a master class from a person who's done it to try and understand a what are the opportunities that exist in the market and I remember when we were sitting and chatting at masters union you told me that India requires 120 more universities 1200 more 1200 more sorry 1200 more universities to become a $30 trillion economy so we have this vision trillion economy but we do not have the machinery to be able to get to that 30 trillion. Yeah. The infrastructure required to get to that which also talks about a very big opportunity and this is something that I admire a lot about you. Um and you are very giving in terms of saying that you know what bro you should go and build another university which is quite interesting and that's not something that a lot of founders say. So today I want to decode all of this in such a way we try and understand what exactly are the biggest opportunities that lie in the education space so that out of this podcast if there is if there is only a dozen of people who go out there get inspired and try to tap into that opportunity one of them may become successful that could be me as well that would be a great thing so that's the agenda for this podcast if that's clear shall we get let's get started okay Pratam let's talk about your background first um from a family that has been into business for two generations, right? And you're the third generation. Third generation. Yeah. The risky one. Third generation. Third generation entrepreneur. But I have seen a lot of large businesses. I can name them right now which are in the news who are failing. I can't take names but people understand what I'm talking about. So a it's not very it's not very easy to be a third generation entrepreneur and to carry the weight of your parents responsibilities. It's easier than being a first generation entrepreneur. I would say that but it has its own set of challenges generation entrepreneur. But I'll tell you why I think it's more difficult. Okay, a you have money that's fine but the other thing that I have seen a lot of people face in fact I was at the gym about a week ago and I saw a guy who was a second generation entrepreneur and he was struggling bro when I asked him bro why the hell are you struggling? like you've got all the money in the world. He told me one thing and that is so So first I want to talk about your family. Tell me where did your grandfather start? I know it's a fascinating story. So go as deep as possible. All right. Sounds good. My grandfather actually moved from Mulan to India to a place called Jalander in Punjab. Mulan was in Pakistan. In Pakistan. Right. So during partition or just before partition he moved to India. He essentially attached himself with the local battalion the local army unit that was stationed in Jalander cantonement at the time and he essentially became for lack of a better word a chaiwala for that battalion. So every battalion used to have people who would serve them food, serve them tea, serve them biscuits. He became that person, right? And that's where his journey started. Uh it was essentially a freelance gig if you know what I mean, right? He wasn't employed, but he was just helping the army. And that freelance gig sort of grew a little bit larger. He was able to set up a small retail store for the army for that unit. Again, serving a little bit more now than just biscuits and tea. Uh eventually he realized that the real margin is in the sweets. Okay. Why in Mitai? Because the thing is when you're selling a parli, you're buying it at a certain price and you're selling it at cost plus, right? You're making a 10% 5% margin. But when you're selling sweets, you're actually making them at home yourself. So your gross margin on that becomes much higher. Right. So he realized that the highest margin in all of the products he was selling were sweets. Right. This is walk me through this margin so that people understand the value addition power. Sure. So I mean he would literally just buy milk, sugar, ghee, um all of the raw materials that go into mitai, make that mai at home with his wife and kids and the next morning go to the store and sell it. Right? The margin on that will always be more than if you ever were to purchase let's say a parliy packet and then sell it tomorrow at a slightly higher price. Hence the gross margin the business economics were much better. Right. From 5% to I would say close to 30 to 40%. No it could even be 70 80%. Oh wow. Right. Uh depending on the kind of product that it is that you're selling and also depending on the cost of the raw material which keeps changing. Right. Uh so he basically then decided or he graduated to building his own sweet shop right he's like let me forget about parli and let me forget about coke camper whatever products were coming at that time and let me just focus on my own products that I make at home with my recipes with my wife with my kids right and uh in one of those workshops is where my dad was actually born right with the entire family making sweets rolling laddus flattening the buries um and and I have some pictures from that time I'll send them to Uh but that's how he built a small mitai dukan called lovely sweets. The reason he called it lovely is also very interesting actually he called it lovely because that was perhaps the only English word or an English adjective that he knew. Okay. Right. The rest of the sweet shops at that time if you you know go back in that time were all gassar or hiram or you know one of those more traditional sounding Indian names. He wanted to be ahead of his time. Aspirational. Aspirational. And so he named it lovely. And and that sweet shop became a hot favorite of the people living in the 5 mile radius. Right. That area was called Jalander Cantonement. By the way, I still live there in that same house. That shop that my grandfather started still exists and we still go there almost every day to go for some mosas in the morning and rasala in the evening. you know uh next time you come to Jalanda I'm going to take you there 100%. U and you know one shop led to another shop, one brand led to another brand. Uh and eventually his business grew, right? He was able to start a much larger store which again runs to this day. It's almost a one lakh square foot store, right? It's a one lakh square foot candyland, right? It's beautiful. Um he built it with his own two hands. My father and his two elder brothers, they all worked there as they were growing up. Um and that's where I think entrepreneurship was sort of instilled in our family, right? Uh I remember even as I was growing up and and you know my dad used to uh be in that sweet shop uh I used to sit on the counter counting money right giving change to people and I started learning I think business at that age right at least starting to understand the concept of profit and mafa and all of that. Um so that's the story of my grandfather. uh he passed away just around the time when I was about to go to high school and so I didn't get a lot of time to speak to him deeply about his business and about his life but all the stories that I'm told by my parents uh he was an awesome man honestly like as a refugee to start from scratch right right from Stelling Chai to building a what I would call like at least a mitai conglomerate at least in that region a local conglomerate if I can um and that gave wings to my dad uh to the rest of my family to me. Um, and that's why I'm stand sitting here with you today. It's very easy for you to say that, you know, that's how he built it. Now, I want to go slightly deeper because I know that there are more stories to that man, right? Because there are so many sweet stop there are so many sweet shops out there. Pratam, not all of those sweet shops become as big as lovely sweets. So, can you please take me a little deeper and talk to me about three or four attributes of your grandfather that turned him into who he was? Because going from selling chai biscuit then to sweets and then turning that into a mitai conglomerate mitai conglomerate conglomerate. Yeah, that was tough for me too. And this is something that gets and I'll tell you why am I asking this question because right now I know for a fact that not a lot of parents can teach people how to do business because they don't come from a business background. But the one thing that they can inculcate are the values that get passed on from one generation to the other that make the next generation more successful. So and your father is incredibly successful. So talk to me about what are those four or five values that your grandfather has passed down the generation which makes you guys such incredible entrepreneurs. I think the first thing is strategy, right? And this is a story my dad tells me about one of the early strategies that my granddad deployed to bring in more customers into the store. So what he would do is he would sell samosas in the morning at a huge loss loss. At a loss if the samosa costed him let's say one rupee he would sell it for 50 pesa. What that would do is that would bring the customers inside the store. And if people get inside the store and they look at the mitai and they smell the aroma automatically, right? And because of that people people would come in to buy the samosa, but they would buy maybe three four other products which probably were at a 50 60 70% gross margin. Wow. So on the cart level, he made a profit. And loss leader strategy. Correct. There you go. Right. So he deployed that without having an MBA very early on and that really became the reason that that first store became successful. It always would have a line outside. Wow. Which is so interesting. I'll give you another strategy that he deployed. If you remember even today when you go out into the market and you look at a sweet shop, it will always have u no doors, right? The sweets will literally be kept on the street, right? And all the dust etc is all going onto those laddus. We have all seen that and that exists till today. At that time in the 60s when he was building the store he decided to build it as a closed store right with proper doors right with proper at that time perhaps fans inside to make sure that the product remains clean and away from the dust. Now it's a very small thing but even till today mitai wallas make that mistake of keeping their mitai out in the open on the street. Yeah. So that's so strategy is something you know thinking beyond his own time is something that was very interesting about him. I think one very core value that he instilled in my dad passed down to me is frugality always do more with less right. So if you have to let's say create a counter for your sweet shop right rather than buying it from the market go to the carpenter yourself and actually construct it in front of you right so just pay for the basic wood etc make it right there and buy it rather than paying some retailer who's taking a commission and then the distributor is taking a commission all of that um I think frugality is something that has been at the core and been a very important reason for our success I think the third thing is taking your team along, right? So the people whom my granddad worked with in the 60s, you wouldn't believe they still work with us today, right? He has taken care of them beyond work, right? He's involved in their families. They are involved in our families. We go to their children's weddings and birthdays and they come to our weddings and birthdays. So taking the team along really creates this this almost family-like attitude in the team, right? So everyone is ready to give their 100%. I remember when my granddad passed away, right? There were less family members. There were more people that he used to work with. His employees had come and they were at the front and center. They were the ones carrying the ais. They were the ones leading the charge, right? And and I think that really changes the culture of the organization at the end of the day especially for an education institution or even a mitigan which is a service business. Uh people is what matters. True. True. So you're saying strategy, frugality and team and team taking the team together like really making them part of the business making them feel like part of the business and no amount of esops can do that right it's the smaller things you do for your team and for their family most importantly that talk to me about these smaller things pratam because I know for a fact that if somebody's treated like family because in business there is a slight conflict of interest you can either build a family or you can build a sports team or you can build a sports team and then treat them like family but But if you do the opposite, then it's going to be a problem. If you treat people like family and then you remove and add people on the basis of merit, it becomes a problem. But if you only have people on the basis of merit and they're doing insanely well and then you build that family connection, it makes a huge difference, right? Talk to me about how do you do the small things to make sure that your team stays together and how do you do the hard things when things go south? Yeah. No, I think merit is important, right? But I think merit can also be created. So like for example, I'll give you the story of my dad and one of his team members. He was not performing very well, right? He was a CXO but not performing very well. Now as per the going corporate theory, uh he should be given feedback once or twice. If he doesn't respond then he should be asked to leave. Essentially that's what most corporates would do. I think the culture in our system is that give them one chance, sit with them, give them another chance, train them, still not learning, send them for an executive MBA program, invest in them, right? And really speak to them, not at the corporate level, but at an emotional level. Say, "Bai, I want to work with you. You have been a very important part of this journey, but you're not growing as fast as the organization is." Right? So, you need to change these five things about yourself. And if you do it then I'll take you along otherwise I'll have to leave you behind. Right? If you have a conversation like this, I think if you have a conversation at that level which maybe many MBAs also do not teach, right, or recommend I think something very beautiful can be created, right? And it's a very interesting assimilation, if I can use that word, of a sports team, a family and a meritocratic corporate system can all come together. Why does it have to be one or the other? Why can't it be all three together? At the end of the day, you know, if someone is connected to you emotionally, that will add more value to your organization than someone who's not connected to you emotionally but is very good at his job or her job, right? Longevity is also super important. You can be you like for example, I have some team members who have been with me for 2, three, four years now. If I don't treat them like family and if I don't build that sports team also after three four years if someone offers them a better salary they will go right uh but them staying with me compounds what they can do for me over a period of time right so the value of compounding is a lot more than at times the value of someone's merit in that moment does that make sense that makes a lot of sense now I want you to give out a message to these people who are being treated like family within in the organization because you know I've seen I've spoken to a few people again at the gym only somehow happen to I happen to have these conversations at the gym where people say you know what um and this is something that is largely coming because of the IT culture what happens is that growing very very fast you're riding the wave right but the thing with compounding is that for the first three years it doesn't show up. It's only after the fourth year or the fifth year, after 10 years in fact, you see you you start to see it and then after 10 years the compounding is evident enough for you to witness it, peel it and then showcase it to other people in your society as well. But what I find very strange about this generation particularly is that we are a hop skip and jump generation. We want to ride a boat and considering there are so many startups out there. A lot of these startups will tomorrow go on to become legendary companies and they're going to grow very very fast as compared to the companies that their fathers worked at. How would you ask a young executive to look at that company and assess this compounding and check if this organization is going to compound or not? If yes, I will stay with persistence. If not, then I can hop, skip and jump. Just look at the seniors who are working in the organization. People you're reporting into their job, their bosses, their bosses, the CEO himself and see how long they have been working with that organization. If if there's a culture of longlasting relationships with that organization where people stay for a long period of time, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, then you can feel comfortable with the fact that this organization invests in people and doesn't use people transactionally, right? So just look at go to LinkedIn, right, of that organization. see what the average tenure of people is. If it's 1, two years and there's huge turnover, then that organization still has some distance to cover in terms of building their culture. But if people have been there for 10, 15, 20 years, then I think you can take comfort in that. However, if the organization is only 5 years old, if the organization is only 2 years old, it's a startup, it doesn't have any history, then I think you have to really look into the eyes of the promoter, the founder, the CEO, the leadership team, and try to really read their eyes to see whether this person will invest in me or not, right? Whether this person only needs me for what I can provide him today or whether this person looks at me as an asset that he can keep investing in and growing and eventually that person only will reap the benefits of the compounding right and and there has to be some amount of gut feeling that you'll have to go with right there is no science to it people can fake these things also but I think if you can just look into the eyes and even ask this question in the interview that hey um Ganesh like will you invest in me what will you do to make sure that I grow with you? Ask these kind of questions in the interview and see whether the founder is stumped or whether he has a plan for you. You'll have your answer. Now talk to me about it from the founders's perspective because as a founder when I look at people there are some people that I know for sure that these are the people who are going to stick with me for the next 5 years and these are the people with whom I can build very large businesses if not very large highly impactful businesses. But then there are some people who are underdogs who don't seem like they're going to do something really really extraordinary. And over the years I realized that you know these are insane people who can go on to do something extraordinary. But as a founder how how quickly can I identify this? And I'll also tell you why am I asking you this question. That is because your grandfather has done it. Your father has done it and I've seen you do it with your team. So how do you pick your battles? because there will always be someone in the organization and this is something that we don't want it to be but there will always be some people in the organization 50% of the organization that I would consider who are here to hop skip and jump only but it's only that 10% who are people who could be consistent compounders so how do you identify these consistent compounders in your team I have a slightly different answer to this question my Hindi teacher in my school used to say this and this is what I believe about teams as well. I think if someone's joined your company, they've not joined that company to leave that company, right? They've joined it maybe to hop, skip and jump. But if they are able to build a good career there, then they will not hop, skip, and jump, right? So people are coming in with good intention. They're joining you with good intention, right? They have the potential also because you saw something in them. Now it's up to the founder that what you do with that kachimiti. If someone is leaving in one two three years and not staying long then founder has to look into the company's culture and look within himself to see right and whether he's doing enough to invest in people or not whether his temper is maybe pushing people away whether you know the policies are not good enough whether the company is just not growing right generally I don't think that you can find a fault with a team member I think the fault will always lie in the person who has the role which is the founder which is the leader right so as founders and as leaders we have to make sure that we are doing enough for the team we are investing in them we're giving the right culture that they stay for long and if you make that culture people will stay 5 10 15 20 30 years I mean look at tatas look at beras right like 30 40 year people have been working right and and that's only when compounding kicks in after 10 years so founders also by the way you know it happened with me also someone is not performing for 6 months I've and paying this guy, he's not performing, he's not growing. You get frustrated, you start screaming at him, you start shouting at them. I have done this. I still do this. But that's a recipe for disaster. I think you have to sit back, understand where that person is coming from. Why is he or she not able to perform and then find that fix with them, counsel them and then grow with them. You will not be able to solve 10 on 10 times, but at least I think your success rate will increase. people will stay longer. Compounding will kick in. Your business will experience a lot of growth because of that compounding. Right? So even if you have to have patience for six, eight months and let somebody grow through those six 8 months, have that patience. Don't be in a hurry to just throw somebody out because two quarters they were not able to perform. Got it. But do you think this also applies to large companies like TCS where the job is boring? there is no compounding and there is no opportunity for everybody to compound with the company because there is no compounding growth as well. I think a lot of times people stay in a company not because they find the work very interesting but sometimes they stay there because they find the people very interesting or the boss very inspiring or the mission very inspiring right so sometimes it's not about what you're doing 9 to5 you are only in a job from 9 to5 right let's call a corporate job 9 to5 there is still 16 more hours in the day and they're also dictating your decisions right so let's say the job is very boring you're sitting in front of a computer doing the same again and again and again and again. But let's say it pays you really well. There's a reason for you to stay, right? The job is really bad, but the founder and the mission of the founder is so inspiring that you're ready to go through that grind. You'll stay for that reason, right? So there are a lot of reasons beyond just the quality of work that people stay TC. So right like I think you know TCS, Infosys, HCL, uh there's very high turnover there, right? I understand that that's also the nature of the job. However, if you were to talk to the founder, the CEO of TCS, they will tell you, boss, we don't like this turnover. You know, give us ideas on how we can improve the working conditions, how we can improve the incentives, how we can improve the culture of the organization that this reduces. Even they would love for that to be the case. Um, I think in TCS for example, I've been to their campuses. They have the most beautiful campuses. I went to Cognizant's office in Chennai. I don't know if you've been there, right? It's like I mean beyond the office it's it's it's amazing. They have like amazing dining rooms and uh sporting infrastructure and like trees and gardens and all of that and I would love to just spend time there for that reason. Um you also have to understand one more thing right this what is my best alternative what is my batner there at the end of the day right if I as an as a team member feel that okay TCS is giving me this ladder it's giving me this culture and I'm enjoying this they're taking care of my family they're giving me insurance um you know when when my mother was not well my boss actually came in uh and and helped me through it gave me a shoulder to cry on all of that I think people will stay so you're saying it's the key is leadership it's leadership ship culture. I think all of those things sometimes matter even more than the quality of work, right? Like I mean people at TCS and people at Google like their work is not all that different. They are both sitting in front of a computer. They're both coding away on problems, right? But it's the culture that is different, right? It is the way the organization is investing in you that is different. And that is the reason people are staying longer at Google and perhaps not so long at TCS. Most people think Google is all fancy work while it is not. you you'll have to be there only only what two or three lakh people would have worked in Google so they have the right to say that I haven't I don't know if you have ever I've seen I have friends who work at Google and they tell me that yeah it's just like a normal job like you see a lot of fancy stuff on YouTube but that's reserved only for a certain category of people otherwise even in fact they also have to do boring work we also have to do boring work but it's that 10 20% that gets very very exciting wonderful I have understood a few things I would just like to summarize this section quickly that is your grandfather your grandfather father had a very humble beginning where he went from Mulan to Punjab and he became a chaiwalla and from chivalala um he also went on to sell biscuits and when he sold both of them he realized that I'm just a trader over here but I could make a lot more money if I could if I could use value addition to sell sweets that is because the cost difference between getting raw material for sweets and selling them at the cost price sorry getting raw material for sweets and then selling them in the market results into much higher gross margins as compared to just selling chai and parli and the margins as you mentioned go from anywhere between from 5 to 10% while selling chai and biscuits all the way up to 70 80% in some cases for sweets and then you spoke about the name lovely sweets the lovely word which today's sounds pretty strange but back then it was used because back then all the other businesses had names like gasita and haldi ram and great names by the way he decided to keep lovely because he saw that lovely was the only English word that he knew and he also felt like because it's an English word people would find it aspirational and you and then you spoke about the loss leader strategy that he deployed to sell samosas at a loss eventually to make money with sweets and then when we spoke about your grandfather's greatest attributes which turned him into such a wonderful and successful entrepreneur you mentioned three attributes strategy frugality and team when it comes to strategy like loss leader strategy he would think ahead of the curve to understand how can I do better to build better systems, better strategies to grow my business. Eventually, he became successful. And this is something, by the way, not a lot of people think. Um, I see a lot of these sweet shops, they function exactly the way other sweet shops function. They function exactly the way other sweet shops function. They have a standard SOP and they're happy wherever they are. Nothing wrong with that. But that also says that if a lovely sweets could go from a refugee to becoming a very successful entrepreneur so can every other sweet shop especially in Mumbai. Then you spoke about frugality. An example of that would be instead of going to the market and getting the furniture he would just go to the carpenter sit down with them make the furniture himself and then get it because of which he can save cost eventually resulting into same output but at less cost. And then you spoke about team where you mentioned that if somebody's not performing well first of all build a sports team and treat them like a family and if they're not performing well talk to them train them educate them talk to them emotionally to understand what exactly is the problem because talk to them as a human being talk to them as not as a resource you know not as a resource so that and so that people understand that you really want to invest in them and after you've given them all the chances in the world then you can let them go if they don't perform beyond that because that's how businesses can evolve and then you spoke about the three attributes that can turn a work environment into a healthy work environment even if the job is boring which is great leadership great culture and a mission statement that can inspire other people absolutely does that sum up our first segment that's amazing thank you great let's move on to the second segment and here's where I want to talk to you about your audacious vision of masters union I must tell you that dreaming big is a very very big deal And I'm saying this because every now and then I get asked what what do I want to do 5 years down the line, 10 years down the line. Um, and I often have dreams that are quite calculative and they're not so big that they scare me. But then when I saw you in fact Shashank told me this that top 10 business school which is a very big deal man. So I first want to understand what exactly is this insane driving force within you the purpose as to why are you doing what are you doing? You know currently there are two reasons right one is the fact that India is home to 1.5 billion people right from the world however we have absolutely no universities absolutely no universities in the top 10 top 50 and by some measure even the top 100 right ranks across the world the top 10 ranks are still belonging to your Harvard Wharton Stanford Yale Stern Sloan right those same top 10 top 20 top have been ruling the education world for the longest time. India has not made its presence felt and I really feel that I owe it to India right and India deserves a top 10 position a top 20 position in the education rankings why can't we be right next to Harvard Wart and Stanford that's really the main driving force that I have at least to build masters union right um and you know India deserves to be in the top 10 because most of the professors in the US not most many are actually Indians themselves right they are products of India so why not an Indian university also in the top 10 and I'll tell you why this is important because we don't have universities in top 10 top 20 a lot of our brightest right who graduate from IITs etc they actually end up going abroad right and we lose them forever right because when they go for their MBA abroad or MS abroad to an MIT or a Stanford these are India's best they eventually end up finding jobs there get green cards there and continue to live there of course they send money back and that's great for India but what would have been the case had they just stayed in India had India had its own top 10 ranked institution that they could have actually honed their skills there as well right so I really feel that from the perspective of keeping our talent in India we need to have a top 10 top 20 institution from India does that make sense that makes a lot of sense but tell me something what exactly is preventing the existing universities from becoming the best they have the infrastructure they have all the money in the world and yet they're not becoming the best I so in India if you see most of our top universities that have all the money are all public right they're run by the government they're run by the bureaucracy they're run by the system right and not by a private individual or private individuals or by a private board as soon as you have a university that's run by a private board you see something like Bits Pilani coming up and really growing uh you see like something like Manipal coming up and really growing right so if you have more universities that are run privately outside of the government system they have their own funding they have their own policies they have their own board of governors and they don't have to wait for approvals from the bureaucracy right so in IIT today if you want to build a lab right you first have to make a proposal that will go to the department the department will send it to the central team the central team will send it to the board the board will send it to the central IT council then central IT council will send it to the education ministry the education ministry will send it to the cabinet the cabinet will then approve it then if it's a larger one then you'll have to wait for the budget to come in and then the budget will get passed past you know how much time it may take just to get the budget passed for a lab 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years a long period of time but when you have a private body right and I'm not saying for-profit I'm saying a private body a private trust running an institution something like a bitsani or a manipal dare I say mast's union I think things will become a lot easier for these innovations to come in if you look at the US the top 10 let's count Harvard private MIT private Stanford private university of Pennsylvania private Dartmouth private right they're all privately run there's a reason for that in fact the highest ranked governmentr run university in the US is probably ranked 21st which is University of California Berkeley right so the top 20 are all private so in India we need more private universities to come in have the right intent right be run completely not for profofit and then you'll start seeing some Indian universities starting to get into the top 10 top 20 right so the biggest reason is most of our universities are run by the And just by nature of the government, it takes time for budgets to get passed, for innovations to be delivered. Bro, I studied from a private college. It was a terrible college. Teachers were incompetent. They couldn't teach properly. Textbooks were outdated and we were associated with the Pune University. Yeah. You were affiliated college university. Why? Because they had to follow certain norms of the university. In fact, I also spoke to a school in Delhi and they also said that I'm KPI match 75% attendance college again I'll have to confirm. But you need a PhD. PhD in India is useless. Most people know that only a handful of PhDs are somebody who actually end up doing something really crazy. PhD is just a stamp in India. PhD is just a bloody stamp and there also there is so much politics that your guide may steal your idea. Yeah, we have all heard those stories. And publish it and your hard work goes to the drain. Sometimes you could be a brilliant student of PhD and your guide may not approve it simply because that person does not like you. In this kind of a system if you're producing PhDs and then we're putting these PhDs as professors in these private colleges who are then affiliated to the university, it becomes a messed up system. Um so my question is now this is still fine. Now I know the reason behind why private universities why private um colleges working under universities do not function properly. That's because of the university norms. Because the university norms, the syllabus is decided by the university. The structure, the system, the policies are all decided by the university. The college is just a physical location where those services are delivered. Correct. The college promoters have absolutely no autonomy. Yeah. And then we come to private colleges who are not affiliated to a university. These are in deemed unities. These are called state private universities or deemed universities. Deemed universities which are very few. They're only 400 in India. 400 to 500. These 400 universities do not produce the best talent in the world. But why is that? Is that because they optimize for profit? Because profit is still fine. Like I was just looking at the AIAS is 30 to 50%. They should be able to produce great talent, right? Why don't they produce great talent? So the thing is that it starts with a few things. Number one, availability of professors. You know how many Indians complete their PhD every year? No idea, bro. Just throw a guess. 10,000. It's a little bit more. It's around 20 25,000 right of them who are actually doing it with proper research with proper intent probably 20% of that 3 4,000 right you know how many students are there in Indian colleges enrolled at any one point in time um I would speak for engineering somewhere around 10 to 13 lakhs that's every year so that times four would be 40 45 lakhs but engineering is only 10% of the Indian students right so the total number of students enrolled in all colleges in India and all universities in India is approximately 4 crores 4 crores 40 million 40 million it's 44 million I think almost now the data hasn't come in for this year now 20,000 or 30,000 new PhDs coming into the market for 4 cr people the total number of PhDs in India let's say you count that you know 20,000 people have graduated for the last 40 years that's what 8 lakh that's 8 lakh PhDs that means 8 lakh PhDs are teaching four cr students four cr students what's the ratio there the ratio is almost 1 is to 5 50 is it a lot more doesn't make any sense 1 is to 50 yeah 1 is to 50 1 is to 50 so when the student toteer ratio is only 1 is to 50 right what can you expect from the education system every teacher to every student that that to every teacher to every student and some of these teachers will not be good yeah competent or incompetent doesn't matter and we're assuming that all the teachers are still teaching right there are lots of assumptions there and we are assuming that they're teaching every term every semester that's also probably not true right they're probably teaching just once in a year so because of that I We don't have at the top enough teachers only to teach the kind of scale of students that we have in India. So that's problem number one. Right? Even if I as a college promoter have the right intent, I want to teach when I go into the market to get faculty, it is incredibly hard. That's number one. Number two, when I do get the faculty, the faculty is also product of a somewhat flawed system, right? And they're going to teach in the same way that they were taught, right? And the current UGC, AICT, Knack, NIRF. These are all bodies that govern universities today. There are almost if you can count almost 18 different bodies that have created policies that dictate how how a university will function. Why the hell do we have these boards? I mean over a period of time, India has had what 70 75 years of independence and over this period of time every government with the right intent has come in with some new policies, right? and have it to to get those policies enforced. They've created new agencies and new bodies, right? Bro, I'll tell you what. These are all revenue streams. I'll tell you why. I've seen this practically, okay? And will confirm this. RT mission and vision of college mission or vision and I was the student who was a rebel right so they would say you know what you can take a leave sit at home get out of the college but just don't stay here when the knack team comes in So I think you know there is this understanding in the Indian population and it may be right also that colleges make a lot of money right and These promoters are only enriching themselves. And I'll tell you from the other side of the table that all colleges in India, all universities in India have to be not for-p profofit and they're audited almost as much as a public company is. Okay. Right. There is so much auditing that happens from all of these bodies that it's very hard for someone to steal money to steal students money. Right? Uh you know I think some movies or some instances or obviously students maybe have their reasons to believe that I'm sure. Yeah, that used to happen, right? The concept of donation today is very small and in very few colleges and that also is going very very fast, right? So for example, uh earlier if you needed an MBBS seat, you can easily donate your way into getting a seat, right? And there was so much corruption. But since this neat exam has come in, all of that has really reduced quite a bit quite it's not fully gone, right? maybe 5 10 15% is still there but it's going very very fast and you know there's a very interesting story even that at Harvard and Watton and at all of these large universities in the US some of this gapla has happened yeah yeah there is a Netflix documentary on this by the way where some rich parents were able to get their kids into Harvard and Stanford through the sports teams route right so India but I think it's blown out of proportion a little bit all universities colleges are audited ed very very strictly and they're all technically not for profofits. Got it. So you're saying that the three reasons why this entire system is broken is because of lack of teachers. Lack of teachers. Um this university affiliation which brings in norms that do not dictate the quality of education but what is being taught and all the unnecessary specifications which which kind of paralyze the the and the which kind of paralyze the trustees or the management I would say. uh which prevents them from giving out great education and thirdly like you mentioned there is so much of auditing that happens about the smallest of things that it becomes quite difficult for them to focus on the real stuff which is great education. Great. Now tell me amidst all of this you are building a college. So first let's talk about the opportunity in the education space and then let's talk about masters union as a business because I know for a fact that education is still easier to give but then quality education with profit is something that's very difficult and you've over the period of time built a sustainable economic engine which is tapping onto this huge opportunity of education in India and you're revenue positive um and you are and you're able to make a profit out of it which is great which means that you can then reinvest that capital further and turn this into a large organization which gives out world-class education very very quickly which can then rank into hopefully a top 10 that's the so I'm trying to understand the economic engine that you're building through the lens of a capitalist and I want to start with the market opportunity let's start with the market opportunity of education in India um to be more specific the higher education space business education space yeah go let's start so first of all I'll start by saying that if you're looking to build a public company if you're looking to become a billionaire right and if you want to earn a lot of money and buy a jet education is not the right space for you acha okay it's not going to happen right because you have to run your institution as a not forprofit okay so that's at the base of the argument that if you want to become a billionaire I think there are many other industries that you should target in education you will not be able to become a billionaire you can't go public right that's number one however you can definitely create a longlasting evergreen green timeless institution that will survive centuries okay and self-sustaining completely now your question is what is the opportunity right in India people have no problem paying for an expensive educational program if that program gives the right outcomes right and if that program has the right quality okay and that is a huge opportunity for people so if you can create a good institution Even if you were to charge 10 lakhs, 20 lakhs, 30 lakhs, 40 lakhs in fees and you're able to give commensurate value, you will be successful, right? Because India is an aspiring society. People want better than what they have today. People want growth and education is the only way to deliver that growth to people. Right? So people are ready to pay if you're able to give commensurate service. It is like saying that if you go to Agra and if there's a hotel there that is charging even 10 lakh rupees a night there will be takers for it because Agra is able to give that commensurate value to the people right or that hotel is able to give that commensurate value just to put it into numbers in terms of the return on investment if somebody puts in four lakh rupees into engineering they can literally graduate with a 4 lakh LPA package which gives them sustainably 4 lakh rupees every single year similarly when it comes to business school you invest 30 lakh rupees the reason why it sounds very lucrative is because you can actually graduate with a 20 30 lakh rupee package. So you invest 30 lakh once and you keep getting 30 lakh again and again. So the equation becomes very lucrative for somebody to invest which is you know exactly. So it's like buying a house like you can't afford the house today but you can keep paying off your mortgage with the earnings over a period of time. So similarly with an education program with an MBA program for example you don't mind paying 30 lakhs by taking a loan because you know right that you'll be able to pay off that loan with the rent you receive from the job that you do over a period of time. However I will say one thing here that we should not look at education in just this ROI format. Okay. Right. Going to an institution adds a lot more value to you as an individual than just the job that it gets you at the end of the four years. I think that is very important to understand. Like for example, I met some of my best friends for life in college. There is no value to that, right? I became from a boy to a man in college. There is no value to that. There's no price to that. There's no price to that. Sorry. There's a lot of value to that. It's priceless, right? Um I in fact found my godfather in a swimming pool in my college. Right. Who's that godfather? Uh his name is Peter Blair. He's a professor at Harvard who I became friends with. He was a PhD student when I was in undergrad and he's from Bahamas and we just happened to be on the same end of the swimming pool at one time and we started a conversation about cricket about West Indies versus India and that conversation became a lifelong friendship and today you know I don't take any major decision in my life without talking to him and consulting with him right very priceless so you know college and those four years or those two years of MBA add a lot more value than just that job that it gets you a lot of people that start their companies while in college, right? And I mean, imagine the ROI if Mark Zuckerberg goes to calculate it, right? Like, okay, I gave Harvard $100,000 and now I've made what? 1 trillion, right? There's no there's so sometimes you can't value it like that, but for most people, I understand that's how they think. So, let's go with that. Got it. So, the first point of opportunity is that it's a high ticket business which results into very high outcome. not so with the with with not a lot of difficulty you put four lakh rupees in for engineering it's not very difficult to get you a four lakh LPA job so that's the first opportunity which is high ticket high outcome resulting into high revenue high revenues now at with any like any other business at small scale you will not make any aida you will not make any margin but as you start hitting 1,000 2,000 10,000 40,000 students that's when you'll start making some surplus which you can then start investing in more capital, more research equipment, more buildings, more sports infrastructure, etc., etc., right? And that's how the flywheel starts to run, that's how the business starts to sort of run by itself, right? Once you hit a certain amount of scale, so you'll see colleges in India that have achieved some scale, let's say a manipal, let's say a VIT, let's say an SRM, let's say an amity, right? We've heard all of these names. um they have achieved some scale of tens of thousands of students and they've reached a stage where every year they are able to plow back that profit into building new campuses and serving the nation even more and more and more. Got it. So it's a flywheel. It's a it's a flywheel driven by scale, right? Which compounds which compounds like anything, right? What would you define as a healthy scale? Like for a school I would say thousand students is a good skill where the flywheel can actually start for a college. What do you think is a good scale? because I'm I'm thinking about it from the lens of an entrepreneur who today wants to start a college. For example, if I'm thinking about starting a business school, what kind of scale should I aim to achieve in the next 5 years for the flywheel to get started? You know, u there's a very crude way of looking at this and I'll be a little capitalist about this. If you're trying to build a gradea institution, if you're trying to build an institution for the most aspirational of class, right? If you're trying to compete with Harvard, Watton, Stanford, if you want to build the top 10, you cannot build it at a very large scale. Right? I don't think I can run masters union. If masters union had more than a thousand students, I think I will fail miserably at my quest. Right? So if you're looking to build a grade institution, a thousand kids is also stretching it. like one of India's top business schools or I think all of India's top business schools I am Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata ISB are all sub 1,000 because they know that as soon as they cross 1,000 or more or beyond they will not be able to deliver the quality that they per batch total total total okay right because that's the amount of faculty you'll be able to get that's the amount of services you'll be able to give them etc etc however if you're trying to educate the masses right if your fee structure is low around four five lakh Right? And you're trying to educate the masses and you're not really going after the top 10 ranks, right? And a little bit more modest in your aspiration, then you can go up to 10,000 students also. But with 10,000 students to get into top 10 will be tough. It will take you a long period of time. It is achievable definitely, but it will take you a very long time. Right? Harvard business school which is the number one business school till today has less than a thousand kids in every batch. in every batch. In every batch. So in total they have maybe 2,000 students. Got it. Most other schools and that's probably the largest business school. Most other schools are smaller than that. However, if you look at now let's say and I'm sorry that I'm using the word grade B but I just mean more universities that target masses like Ohio State in the US or let's say like a um Amit or VIT in India that is targeting slightly a larger crowd there 10,000 20,000 30,000 and if you are building good processes systems SOPs software then you can even push to 40 45,000 the largest university in India in one campus would probably have 40 45,000 students perfect Right? So flywheel is very difficult to build but once you build it compounds for grade A college you should not go beyond 1,000. So the aim should be th000 which is significantly less but it's good considering the fact that it is at least insight and then if you want to build let's say a tier 2 college then you can aim for a scale of about 45. Tier 2 is not bad. Let's not use tier 2 in a negative sense. You know whenever we say tier 2 we say it's not tier one right but you also need tier 2 colleges because India as a country needs colleges that can also educate the masses right and so they are tier two not by design but by compulsion and even tier three or tier four and there's a space and market for tier one for tier two for tier three tier four and tier four is not necessarily bad as compared to tier one but most of them are bad bro you know they're solving a different problem look at India where solving a problem look at India look at where we are today If I can't if I can't afford a 30 lakh rupee tier 1 MBA, right? So does that mean that I don't even go for an MBA? If you go for an MBA and then you stay unemployed without any skill sets then I think that is wrong. Definitely I think that needs to be improved but still at least I should get the opportunity low ticket problem lowity problem low ticket lowquality high promises problem and most of them are low ticket low quality high promises. So if you do a if you're doing a wrong promise right that is obviously fraud right I will use the word fraud for it if you're promising the world and not delivering then that's fraud right that let's keep that aside for a second and we'll address that but if you're coming the right intent right and if you are promising what you're delivering then even tier 4 is adding a lot of value right it's not the best education it's not the highest quality education but by paying four lakhs am I at least able to enter the job market right I'm not going to become Bill Gates tomorrow I'm not going to be able to build a large company that's okay but at least can I raise my family yes right and there is space for that perfect now let's talk about the market and you mentioned this stat while I was speaking to you while doing the research for masters union that is x number of people graduate and here's the package that they get so there's a huge gap in the market so talk to me about that gap with updated numbers you know so the numbers have not changed much since then yeah yeah yeah probably much worse now because AI etc is really eating up a lot the jobs at the top. So in India we have as we mentioned earlier around 4 crore students who are enrolled in college. Okay. Right. And so you can assume that 1 cr are graduating every year. Take give or take. Right? 1 cr are graduating every year. Now out of these 1 cr who are graduating every year, how many are engineers? You mentioned 10 11 lakhs. Uh another 10 11 lakhs are doing BCOM, BBA, right? Another 10 11 lakhs are doing law plus design plus all the long tails. And almost 70 lakh people are doing BA and BSc. Correct. BA and BSE. Now which of these programs, which of these courses can really get you a job? You have to ask yourself that question. I think only engineering from what I maybe only engineering, maybe at some level some BBA, BCOM programs, right? SRCC, Dell University, etc., etc. Now my question to you right and I think I'd asked you this two years ago also is how many of these 1 cr graduates get a job that pays at least 40,000 rupees a month or almost 5 lakh rupees a year 75,000 no this was the number last time you No it was 12,000 it was 12,000 it was 12,000 that's it just 12,000 people get a job that pays more than 5 lakh rupees now I I'll give you some anecdotal data as well. If you look at the top colleges in India at the undergraduate level that are teaching BBA, BCOM, it's SRCC comes to mind. Hindu college, Hans Raj, St. Stephens, they teach economics, uh Loyola in Chennai, uh St. Xavier's in Bombay, St. Xavier's in Kolkata, right? These are the colleges that come to mind. Christ College, right? Most of these colleges if you take all the students not just the students who get placed but all the students and come up with the average package barring maybe two or three colleges in Delhi none of these colleges will have an average salary more than 5 lakh rupees and these are the top ones in India I'm talking about BBACOM right now in engineering it's different if you go to IITs and if you go to computer science departments or electrical engineering departments or sometimes IT departments there you'll find great salaries that 1 cr 2 cr package google picking up and you know all of those things uh but if you go to slightly less aspirational programs there you will not find the kind of salaries again right now is this because of the lack of availability of jobs or is it because of the over supply of students or is it because these students are not competent great question so first of all this is the data okay I'll give you another very interesting data this I've been trying to find I have approximations from various different um articles tell me how many new net new white collar jobs get created in India every year. I have no idea. That require a degree. Net new white collar jobs get created in India. I'm assuming if 1 cr people are graduating and assuming let's say bro I have no idea bro. Okay. So 1 cr people are graduating with a degree hoping to do a white collar job. They're all hoping to do a white collar job. That's why they went for a degree otherwise they could have gone for a vocational program. Now by some measure by some measure only 15 to 20 lakh new white collar jobs get created every year. Wow. Which means there's a deficit of 80 lakh. Which means there's a deficit of 80 lakhs every year. Every year. And I'm being very liberal with my data. I'm saying net new. Right? So these 15 20 lakhs don't have to all get filled by freshers only. They can also get filled by people who are slightly higher up with more experience. I'm saying net new white collar jobs overall for senior levels, middle levels and junior levels is 15 20 lakhs. So people not finding jobs is actually not their own fault or even the colleg's fault. It's just that the the economy of India is such that we have too many people and our economy while it's growing very very fast is just not fast enough for the kind of population that we have. That's just our misfortune. Right? However, let me ask you another question. Tell me how many chemist shops are there in India? My random guess would be a million. Around 2 million. Okay. How many gold retailers are there in India? 4 million. Slightly less. I think it's 1 million or something. 1 million in that zip code. Right. Okay. How many kirana stores are there in India? 10 million almost. I think 20 between 10 to 20 million. 1 to 22 crores. Right. How many tapri are there in India? Tapis. Tapri. Yeah. small uh unorganized restaurant essentially right where the food is being cooked in real time 30 million I know I think it's again between 10 to 20 million so you're right you're right in the magnitude right so I'm what I'm trying to say is that this is true India true India is running chemist stores is running tapri is running restaurants is running kirana stores this is where the employment actually is right and a lot of people they're not choosing to go into the corporate sector which is very small. They're choosing to work with their parents, their fathers, their grandfathers, their uncles, their tawis, their chachas in these kind of stores. That's where true India's employed. Now the question we have to ask ourselves is that to work in my dad's chemist shop. Do I really need an MBA? Correct. You don't. Those are the questions we have to ask. And I think the mistake that we have made as a country is that we have glorified education or sorry let me put it a different way. we have glorified college education that only if you have an MBA right no matter what job you do are you the true son of the soil you know like we have attached these um these privileges with these stamps which they don't deserve right and which India doesn't even need um and I wonder why that has happened and I'll ask you the question like why do you think we as Indians worry so much or or find so much excitement in these tags MBA V tech because of validation by you speak to any parent who's enrolling their children into education into engineering ask them why are you getting a child to choose civil engineering standard job what the hell how the hell does that make any sense and I think uh one of the reasons why my generation at least feels a lot of baggage is because we're often treated as trophies in front of neighbors and relatives for our parents to say social valid and because I got selected into a very terrible college my parents did not have that badge so there my load went away that I my parents accepted that he's not he's not the child whom they can um he's not the child who got into IIT. So he's not the child with a stamp there. My baggage went away from where I actually started my real growth. So I think this happens primarily because parents often treat their children as trophies as they are certificates and they often burden their children with their unfulfilled dreams that I couldn't become an engineer so I'll turn my son into an engineer. But very few of them think because I couldn't become an entrepreneur, I will turn my son into an entrepreneur because risk the worst. Yeah. And you know there's a very simple anecdote that um when it comes to running a business um you know we read these stats saying that you know only 1% businesses actually succeed this and that and all that crap. But what most people don't realize is that when you're at a job not a lot of things are in your control unless you're working for a great organization. In fact, in my organization over here, a lot of my editors, my writers, in fact, every single person because I run a very small organization, everybody has their work in their control. In fact, yesterday we held this meeting to understand what does each person want, what does everybody want to do. We spoke to our editors, each one of them to ask them. It's like a debt that you have to pay to the market that you do some of the work and then you get to do some of the work that you like even if it does not make any business sense. Um so unless you're in a great organization that is liberal enough not a lot of things are under your control but most of the organizations are places like I don't want to name IT companies but most of these IT companies where you do not have any choice to hack your growth but look at your dada's mid high store he had the growth in his own hands where he could go from selling chai to biscuits to then sweets the destiny is in your control the destiny is your in your control and your ability Ability to think on your feet is what always helps you. And most businesses that go out of business and I've learned that with experience after I've grown up. I've seen a lot of my friends also fail is that they just don't read enough and they don't strategize enough to take business under their control. But our parents never looked into any one of these things. If you tell them that I want to go abroad and you have to take up a debt of 60 lakh rupees to pay for my college, they would happily say yes. They would bet their life savings for you to go to a different country which they have no idea about in a market which they have no idea about and bet their life savings. But if you tell your father if you if if any middle- class child tells his or if any middle class child tells his or her father they would say how does that make any logical sense? employee. In fact, my boss told me entrepreneurs are the best employees. Yeah. In fact, my boss told me when I was working at Reliance, he's the only boss that I had and I would consider him to be the best. Now he's almost like my brother. He told me back then that you know I had this I I was very I was very scared of going to the market transactions and those lessons are such intangible invaluable lessons that no school or no college can teach you. So you can come back to this organization and wherever I am, I will hire you because I know for a fact that you've gone to the market, you've learned lessons the hard way and then you're coming back. One more thing I'll add to that. I think we also overestimated risk, right? I think we, you know, in the startup sphere where you're going for large companies, you want to build a large startup, you want to go public there, the risk is very high of failure, right? Because success means going public. Anything that's not going public is failure. And there the success rate is truly 1%. I'm with you on that. But if I'm going to open a chemist store, if I want to become a small entrepreneur, I want to sell plants, I want to sell furniture, there's a very high chance, probably more than 50%. Probably closer to 70, 80, 90% that you will be successful, right? And I think we have to start looking at those kinds of businesses as well. It's just that in media, we only make movies on Mark Zuckerberg. Correct. Right. So we look at that as the idea of entrepreneurship and not opening a tapri on the side. Right. I think that can make for a great business. True. as well. In fact, this is what bothers me a lot that when it comes to parents, what they don't realize is that they're burdening children with even higher risk because they did not step back and study the data only for the child to realize six seven years later that I did not want to be in Canada. I did not want to be in US. I did not want to be in US. I just wanted to go back home and do what I wanted. In fact, over there you first have to clear your debt. then hope that you know the administration that is governing the country does not push you off then you are still treated as a secondass citizen racism okay so if if that if the same child is given opportunity over here for our country in our country the market that the child understands there's a much higher chance of success and this is what I think is wrong with our system which is where our parents do not study data and they treat children as trophies of validation in the society in the race of which they end up killing their dreams and the real dream to say that you know my child bought me this Ferrari or this house is something that they're compromising to say that you know my child went to an IIT so that I think is a big big problem yeah absolutely know I think so you I think we've clearly identified the market opportunity I think there's also something we should address which is the market gap right and you asked me this earlier which is why are these colleges not able to do a good job right and I gave you this answer that hey you know let's blame the government let's blame all of these but but I think it's you know education in India is not all that different from education abroad also really yeah like we think that some Harvard is doing something crazy or Oxford is doing something crazy I think maybe the top five are but after the top five top 10 I think the books that are being prescribed are essentially the same books that a college in India, a tier four college in India is prescribing. Right? The teachers who are teaching are probably just as good or just as bad as a tier 2, tier three, tier four college in India. I really think that we have glorified western education for the reason that they have those top 10. We think the top 100, the top 200 are also as good. They are not, right? Let's be very honest there. Uh and the reason is the same thing, right? that in the industrial revolution time uh this K12 system this 4-year college system got created where it was almost like an assembly line where you said that hey we need people who can work in the factories 9 to5 so let's make college also 9 to5 let's give them one break in the middle for lunch right uh make sure that they don't ask too many questions and just listen and then take an exam at the end make sure they all have role numbers right so they can be easily identified and their individuality is taken away from them and make sure they have uniforms right so that they don't think of themselves as individuals make sure they don't ask critical questions make sure they don't have creativity in fact you know uh there's a king the Prussian king is very popularly known to have said that if my people start to think who will fight in all the wars that I have to fight oh damn right and by the way this is the same guy who invented the modern K12 college system he invented it because he lost a war to Napoleon because his people were not disciplined So he created this entire education system to discipline his people to indoctrinate his people right that you sit in class you sit quietly don't talk however you know and this was good enough for the industrial revolution time as well and this is pre the the invention of cars this is pre the invention of internet there is this is pre-relativity this is the education system that was invented however today we still use that same education system from that relic right when the world has completely changed and that's why the education system needs to change it cannot be so for example today in the workplace collaboration is required right but in our colleges collaboration is almost looked at like cheating cheating collaborate right in the real world you are required to think independently autonomously but in colleges in schools we are required to follow the syllabus right and not go beyond the syllabus. What are we required to do? We required to go through the past exams. We are gaming the exams by doing the past exams which is so stupid. In the real life there is a past exam, right? So whatever we are doing in school is completely antithetical to what is required in college. This is K12 college, MBA, PhD everywhere. Yeah. And that's why the market gap is that we need to think about a new education system that goes beyond exams, lectures, grades, slides, attendance books. This is a relic of the past. We need to start thinking about what to do in the future. With AI coming in, this need is even more grave now. Yeah. Which is to think critically. To think critically, to think innovatively. Those are the exact skills we do not teach. In a college system, students are required to not speak and listen to the teacher. In the real world, you're only asked to speak. Correct? You're rewarded if you speak and if you rebel and if you have new ideas, right? Those are the people who are doing well. But we are we are actually incentivizing the complete opposite in school and in colleges. And that's why I'm so passionate about thinking at least um about how can we rethink the classroom experience. Got it. Pratam talk to me about um the financial opportunity over here because I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and he told me that like if you want to provide world class education because all of these people require a lot of money to be spent either as remineration or um for their uh for their stay and accommodation as Well, it requires a huge amount of money especially if you're going to have practitioners come into your college very very often especially to deliver a lecture like if I were to get a lecture delivered by somebody of the stature of Sanjep Chandani I have to make everything worth his time right so there are a lot of constraints that say that like you mentioned education is not a scalable business if you want to do something worldass okay but here's where the venture capitalist in my head says that uh if it's not scalable, if it's not going to make a lot of money, why do you do it? Whereas the patriot in me says that it doesn't really matter how much money it makes, I want to leave a legacy for India. But I know for a fact that you know after having studied a few charts that you sent me, I understood that there's a huge opportunity in terms of profits also in this business provided you fall out of the system and create an impact. So talk to me about the financial opportunity when it comes to building a B school in India. So I'll talk about building a college engineering business school doesn't matter right uh if you let's say have 10,000 students and you charge a fees of 1 lakh rupees per year right that's a 100 crore revenue okay you can probably hit 20 30% margin there 20 30% 20 30%. That means gross or net? Net. Net. Net. Yeah, gross is much higher. Uh net is much lower. So 20% net. Now that 20 crores that you've just surplused, you can't take it in your bank account. By the way, that's the Indian government does not allow that. Right? So you can take that 20 cr and create space for a new campus, an expanded campus. You can take that 20 cr and buy an electron microscope. So now you can do more research, right? and you can keep plowing it back and that's how you build a much larger u university. Now your your point was very valid that you cannot create a scalable good quality institution 100 crores to 1,000 crores. I mean if you do really well you'll reach a,000 maybe you'll reach 50,000 students maybe you can charge 2 lakh rupees you'll reach 2,000 crores 1,000 crores in revenue. That's where the system finishes. But like you said the quality will dilute right as we have more and more students. Um the quality will definitely dilute as you have more and more students but the student is going to be still happy because the student is getting commensurate value right he's paying 2 lakh rupees he's getting a job or he's paid 2 lakh rupees per year for four years that means he's paid 8 lakh rupees he's getting a job that pays 8 10 lakh rupees he's happy the quality of education is yes less than the quality of education in a college where there are only 100 students of course goes without saying but at least the student is able to get that value somewhere so the possibility of world class at a 10,000 student scale is not possible. It will take 100 years. Harvard takes how many undergraduate students in a year? Maybe 2,000, right? Penn where I went, my entire class was just 2,200 students. It's a two 300 year old university. There's a reason they have not gone beyond that, right? Is because they know that as soon as they go beyond that, they will not be able to deliver value. Got it. It's not for exclusivity. It's not for exclusivity. Most people think it's for exclusivity. They don't they've not designed it that way. They I mean if you go to Penn's campus it's full like all the classrooms are always full all the hostels are always full that's the amount of people they can accommodate right and if they start to build more and more and more they know the systems will start breaking right it will not scale so education will scale uh conservatively 10 to 20 crores if you're running a small college all the way to th000 to thousand crores if you're running a very successful large college with great placements. Got it? Right. That's really the uh the the purview of the financials. But you know you can have interesting models for the future right why do you have to depend on full-time faculty only like you mentioned you can have practitioners interestingly practitioners cost a lot less than full-time faculty because full-time faculty you have to pay them you have to pay for their rent you have to pay for everything you have to pay for their car you have to pay for their travel and research etc with visiting faculty or with practitioners you don't have that overhead for them it's mostly charity many of them even do it for you mentioned Sanjiv G he came to our campus right for a couple of and he gave some great lessons to our students. Uh Nathan Nithan Kamat gave some great lessons to our students. I can't afford them correct as faculty but they came because they feel for it right. So you know you can create these new models which can make the education cost actually come down quite significantly. For example, most colleges today require or most colleges are designed in a way that they own the land and building okay that they're built on. Right? Right. So you have to spend 20 crores to buy the land. Then you have to spend 60 crores to build the building on top of it. This is for a capacity of this is for a capacity of a,000 to 2,000 students. Okay. Right now that's a huge capex requirement and then automatically brings down your bottom line and it creates a huge barrier to entry. But what we have done at Masters Union is something different. We said boss we don't have to own our own land and building. let's just do this where we rent it from the best builder in the country. So we went to DF, we went to their campus where they already have Bane, BCG, Bank of America, Expedia, Gartner, WPP and we asked them sir the ground floor is empty. Can you please give that to us? We want to run a college there. Now suddenly that 100 crores that had to be spent is zero for me. Right? This is a new model. Correct. So you can now think about changing the education system even from a financial perspective, from an investment perspective. And that opens many new doors for both new entrepreneurs to come into education. Now you don't need 100 crores. You can just do it literally for zero. We started masters union with a total investment total investment of less than 1 cr rupees. Right? If you add like let's say even my time etc. it would go up to maybe 1 and a half 2 crore rupees. My team's time etc. You know some of the founders etc. That's it. And today we have almost a thousand students right with almost zero investment. Most of the investment we made was after we made the revenue and we made some profit and then we plowed that back in. Understood. So if I were to summarize this, what you're essentially saying is that education is a high ticket high outcome business which results into a flywheel which can help you build a large business. Um considering the fact that there is a disclaimer, you can't take this money out because in India you can't make money out of education. Then you mentioned that this results into a flywheel which is very very interesting and you can plow it back and then turn them into large institutions with very high impact. And then you mentioned the gap in terms of the requirement that there are 4 cr graduates out of them only 12,000 get a job paying 40 to 50,000 rupees which means there's a huge gap in terms of three things. One is we need more jobs which is something that the government has to do and the large businesses have to do. We have no role to play over there. Number two, there is a lack of skill set which is where people like you and I come in. And number three, you mentioned that we need to decrease the barrier to entry in such a way that we can charge. There are two models you mentioned. The first model is you charge less but you have more inflow which is like a VIT where you have 10,000 students or V is also very expensive but yes you go niche and then you build a high RPOU low scale business like Harvard which can then help you build leaders for tomorrow and then when we spoke about the margins the financial opportunity what you mentioned is that if you build a 100 crew business you can get 20 to 30% net which is super healthy like for most of the FMCG It's less than 10%. So it's absolutely fantastic. And then you mentioned that there are two barriers to entries that you can actually get rid of. Number one is when it comes to faculty, there's a very counterintuitive thing that most people don't know that is the likes of Sanjiv Chandani and the rest they will not charge you to come and teach. They would just do it for um for for they they would just do it for gratification. They would just do it because simply they would simply do it because they want to give back. So it gives you the insane ability of being existing in modern India where there are practitioners who would want to give back to the society and they would also dedicate time for it. The second thing that you mentioned is the land and building cost. A 20 cr cost with a 60 cr building cost would result into 80 crores of initial capex which then if taken as debt would last for probably three decades and that would practically kill your bottom line. But now that's not necessarily the case because if you can lease not buy it would bring down the barrier to entry by a large extent just like you did with DF where you leased a place instead of buying it and and one thing I will add you know you mentioned scale I alone at mast's union cannot achieve scale it's not possible right and I've told my team that don't expect huge companies like it's not going to happen however we have created a model this asset light model this practitionerdriven model this hands-on experiential model And we have open sourced it completely. All of our curriculums, all of our SOPs, all of our policies, all of our handbooks are completely available to anyone who wants to set up a college. Yes, completely. Where, bro? On your website. On our website, on our YouTube, everything is public. All of my courses that happen inside the classroom, they are beamed live on the LMS and anybody can go and check it out. Wow. I did not know this. Absolutely. Absolutely. Not a lot of people do, right? But everything that we do is completely open source. Oh, wow. Did you know this? So like for example, we had we have this one course that is taught by uh on creators and uncreated economy by Tanmai. It's on our YouTube. Anybody can go and see it. It does great content marketing for us as well. But at the same time, whatever is happening inside the classroom, we have put it out in the open. Bro, you should speak about this more often. You don't? Uhhuh. No, I haven't. Yeah, this is insane. I never knew this. Everything is public. Like on our website if you go you will find the details of the drop shipping the creator challenge of all of the briefs that we do it's all there it's all there the venture nitization program all the content that we have created is completely out there for public to consume now because of that there are many new colleges that have been created that completely mimic the mast's union model there's a college in Bangalore in Bombay in siliguri there's a college and I'm so proud of them of that and proud of them right for thinking and taking this ahead. Harvard gave us a model. UPUPEN gave us a model that spawned thousands of other universities across the world. Oxford Cambridge gave us the model, right? IIT's IM gave us the model. But I think it's time for us to bring a new model and that's what I'm trying to do. My impact is not going to come from masters union. My impact is going to come from the hopefully thousands of other colleges that will use the learnings that we have had. So your real achievement would be the masters union model that eventually serves India and not just masters union as a business. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know think about it a Harvard is Harvard and when it became Harvard the Harvard business case studies now get used in every college. Correct. Right. One of the reasons I want to be top 10 is because if we can get to top 10 with this experiential practitionerdriven asset light hands-on model then perhaps other colleges will be like right and I know for a fact that that would give better outcomes to the students eventually. Bro you mentioned Harvard and Harvard business case study that is an inspiration for us. You remember I told you that we want to make case studies so good so entertaining that uh people should say that you know what this is more interesting than Harvard. This is giving us more knowledge than Harvard. Now that's a very big bar, but you're trying to but we're trying to get there with each passing video. So like you mentioned like if Harvard Business Review never existed, Think School's case studies wouldn't exist. And because now we've started with this case study. In fact, uh 2021 we were one of the two three YouTubers who are making content on business case study. Now everybody is now everybody is including us. Yeah. Absolutely. And that makes us so happy. Inspired by you. Thank you so much. In that sense, right? Like absolutely we always say that hey you know this is a great model of education that thinks school is working on let's let's copy it let's copy it if someone's doing a good job let's copy it why not it will help the country at the end of the day I mean it's so and that's why you know I never and some you know you mentioned the hate that we get sometimes is when we get compared that we are going to kill IITs or we going to kill IM right or someone makes a claim that master's unit is the next Harvard none of that is true none of that is true we want to be compared to anybody. We are here because of them. Right? We want to present an alternate strategy. That's about it. And the world will decide whether it's good enough or not for us to really unseat them. But the goal is not necessarily to unseat them, right? The goal is to present an alternate model that is good enough, right? That people feel compelled enough. So I'll give you an very interesting example. The earliest universities were Nalanda and Tuxila. You know, we have those ruins and we have heard those stories. Then came Oxford and Cambridge. But these were only available to very few people like maybe less than 0.01% of the population at that time could attend universities like these. In the 1700s, something very interesting happened. The education model changed. The rich people uh or the second tier to rich like not the princes but maybe like the ministers, sons, etc. Uh the rich people across the world, right? So, Maharaja's kids in India, their minister's kids, then the Ming dynasty in China was going on, their kids um and even the princes, etc. in the in the British uh lineage. What they would do is they would send their kids on a 4-year tour of Europe starting in Rome. They will end up in Rome. They will meet the Michelangelo of the time, etc. And they will actually learn those skills from them, the masters. From there, they'll go to Florence. They learn about art and architecture there. From there they'll go to Venice. They'll learn about civil engineering and structures there. From there they'll go to Manchester to learn about textile engineering. So them going to college, their right of passage was essentially them traveling through Europe. This was called the grand tour. And this is what college was. How long did this last? I mean this lasted almost I think good 150 years. No, I mean the course four years. Four years. Four years. And I have a very interesting question. There's a company that you know of and most of your audience knows of that actually used to run these stores. Perhaps the first college if you will. What is the name of the company? I can think of the company that does what? That started doing these grand tours of taking students across Europe and making them learn these skills. Okay. In all of these centers. Is it Thomas Cook? Yes. How do you know? Because you told me we've had this conversation before. Okay. Okay, it's Thomas Cook. You heard this. Okay, you cheated a little bit, but it's okay. It's Thomas Cook, right? And that is an education model that we have totally forgotten about that education through travel, right? And I really feel that in the future there'll be many more education models like this with AI coming in. We're not too far from a chat GBD like interface with a bunch of teachers who at our pace, you know, keeping our personality in mind, the accents that we understand and the examples that we appreciate will be teaching us. I think it's one or two years away. In fact, uh, you know, what you mentioned is already happening, bro. Um, we were just looking at u one of our physics textbooks. It's called Ido. One of the toughest physics books you will ever come across. Okay. back then. answer. But today we have the luxury of an IOTO question and its solution so well because in IO you first have to understand the question that's the first challenge and then you can go to the answer and I had a lot of doubts and I kept asking kept asking kept taxing like you said at my pace with the examples that I appreciate and I was just mind blown at that possibility because back then when it comes to physics teachers in IIT classes But more or less to a large extent and you can keep asking questions and it keeps giving you answers. They're so accurate with such good explanation which means today a kid in 12th standard can look at an IO understand the solution understand the concepts and then solve IO whereas back then we were struggling with Etsy. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That is such a beautiful thing. Call your friends you know you didn't have the answer. I didn't have the answer. Now you have the answer handy. You have the cheat sheet always with you which is so interesting and how remarkably the capability has changed over just six years. But one thing I will say just to this you know this chat GPT and AI solves the problem of content being easily available to us in whatever format we understand right however it still doesn't solve for one thing which is the motivation to learn right I if I am seeking an answer I will find the answer but am I seeking the answer that's a bigger question right true and so what we also have to figure out is how do we motivate intrinsically our students to seek out answers to questions. Yeah. Right. We're not doing a good job of that yet. That is something that's uh that is proactiveness, bro. I I think uh beyond 25, what I've seen is that people when they are very young at 14, 16, 18, you can still instill that proactiveness very easily. But as they turn 25 and above, it gets slightly difficult. And as they turn 40 and above, it almost becomes in schools. If we can trigger that curiosity, we can trigger that proactiveness in students. And I think a good teacher who asks the right questions, a good teacher who can inspire the students or instill that love for that subject you know and then the students doesn't then the student doesn't need to be taught anything. Yeah. Once the student is awake, he will seek she will seek the answers whether that's through Chad GBD or through Etsy BMA or through Udo right I think I think if we can instill that love for learning I think then we would have fundamentally changed learning also correct then maybe we would have even removed like the issue of content right like right now we have so many mukes right today if you want to learn something and if you have a phone you can learn it correct but has that made everybody learn it not yet right so like I always say this one thing that We consider that a student is an empty glass and we have to fill our jug of syllabus in it. The other way to look at it is that a student is actually a candle. If you light the candle, it will automatically give light, right? Another way to look at it is just like I think every student is a sponge. If you put the sponge on water, it will just float. You have to really squeeze it and then it'll absorb everything, right? Like how we do that. I think I think your case studies when you ask and when you frame those questions at the end of your case studies or through the case studies they inspire that curiosity after every time I've watched your case study I have gone into further depth to do my own research on whatever the topic is that you made that case study on because you awakened that interest in me right and now I'm motivated to go and find answers you know why we do that that is because my mom used to do that with me and you know one of the best books that I've come from for you yes and one of the best books that I've gotten is Seven habits of highly effective people, right? And one of the first things that it talks about is proactiveness starting from the end in mind. And uh once you begin to understand those attributes like you mentioned that a candle, right? Lighting that candle I think to me was getting that book seven habits of highly effective people. But seven habits if I can understand the meaning of it and I can inculcate all of that in my life that would be great. So and my mom also told me something very interesting. He said um and this also this is also something that Ken Robinson said in his TED talk which is one of the most watched TED talks in history. He said that the beauty of human mind is that it doesn't need to be taught. It just needs to have a conducive atmosphere and it will learn by itself which to me was the book and when we present our case studies we always make sure that we present the facts and make people think. In fact, all of our podcasts get um get turned into notes, bro, which is so interesting, which then become 40 50 pages of notes. And that is what excites me a lot, which is people are learning and they're putting it out there for other people to learn from it. And that I think is the true impact of education. You know, since uh we we're living in this world today, we have to talk about Elon Musk a little bit. Okay, Elon Musk has this saying and this real is very viral and I'm sure you would have seen it that current education system teaches to the tool and not to the problem. Correct? Right. So it will teach you how to use a screwdriver. It will teach you what is a heat equation. It will teach you calculus. Right? But will not teach you the problem to solve with that tool. Correct? Right. And so you know he he talks about heat transfer equations. He said, "Dude, if I want to teach you refrigeration as a concept or how a refrigerator works, there are two ways I can do it. One is I start with the screwdriver and the heat transfer equation or I give you a refrigerator." I say, "Boss, this refrigerator is broken. Please fix it." Right now, you have made it into a game. It's like a video game for that student. He wants to fix that broken refrigerator. And in the pursuit of that fixing, he will have to learn how to use a screwdriver. But it'll come from within. Correct. It will not be part of syllabus. He will have to learn those heat transfer equations. It will come from within. And that I think is like really like the epitome of what the education system should be. Essentially make it a game. Yeah. Exam based education versus challenge based education. Yeah. That's a great way to put it, right? Challenge inquiry based education. Uh this exams really instill this fear, right? And you don't want to learn something out of fear of something. Fear of failing of you know what f we say f is feedback we say f is fail but f should be feedback right we have to remove this fear no one no one thrives in fear correct now let's talk about your businesses mast's union and tettor okay now what I'm trying to uncover are the models behind both these businesses so that like you mentioned these models could be replicated and what I want to understand are the most important attributes of these models which can then be replicated by somebody else and turn that into a profitable business schools and uh consider this as a conversation between me and you where I am trying to start a business school of my own where we are trying to reduce the barrier to entry and hit profitability as soon as possible with the assumption that I'm not raising any capital right and you want to have impact and we want to have impact okay let's start with step number one which is how to identify a gap in the business education market considering the fact that we already know that it could be profitable there's a skill gap and there are too many employers looking for highly capable people. Okay, how do we identify a gap in the market? Like one of your students, he's building a sales school, right? Let's talk about the gaps in the market in business education specifically. Um, so let's go for one second, let's step back and even talk about education in general, right? So there are 1 cr students who enter into higher education every year. That includes undergrad, postgrad, engineering, medicine, business, law, everything. 1 cr every year. Okay? Though that's your market essentially. If you start a new school or a new college today, that's the market you're targeting. Now 10 lakh 10 to 12 lakhs are engineering students. 10 to 12 lakh are your BBA, BCOM students. Uh 10 lakh are your medicine plus law plus design that long tail. And around 70 lakh is BSc plus BA. Okay. Now that 70 lakh which is BSc and BA there the fees is incredibly low like sub 50,000 rupees a year which is most of India, right? I'm guessing that's probably not where you would like to start right you would probably want to start in the pre-professional education which is either engineering business or one of these law design etc etc right so you have to start where you feel most comfortable we were talking about Nitan Gor my student who starting a sales school he felt most comfortable with sales that was his passion that was his calling he thought let me build a sales school right for me it was business so I started mast's union right for you again it could be business it could be a specific kind of business could be marketing if that's something or content or you know one of those kind of fields finance you're in Bombay. So you figure out where you have passion and where you have a right to win. There is demand everywhere. There is demand for good education in every department in every discipline, right? Whether it's law, medicine, everywhere. So if you are a good educator, people will come to you for sure. Okay. So you have to start with where you are. So your right to win, let's say, is in content. And you say Pradam, I'm going to build a content business school where I'm going to teach people how to create this content, how to create content for others. uh how to really win on YouTube, how to win on Instagram, how to get um partnerships, how to get brand sponsorships, how to get deals, all of that, right? I'm going to create a one-year course on that. Um and then the second part would be, okay, now we know that this is the school that you want to build. You'll ask yourself, does your audience care about a degree? Okay, if you're going for the post-graduate audience for a master's program, there the audience does not care too much about the degree because they care about the job that comes after it. But you're if you're going after the undergrad market, which is a much larger market, right? The postgrad market would be 1% of the undergrad market. Huh? So there you'll have to give a degree, right? And so you'll have to figure out a partner university that will work with you to grant the degree and you'll have to give them some revenue share, right? So let's say you go to Mumbai University or you go to Delhi University or you go to Manipal. um you tell them hey listen you know I want to run this school whatever your curricular needs are that I will accomplish don't worry and my students will take your exams also at the end of the day and if they pass your exams then great right uh and let's say they say yes and now you have finished with your step two which is you have a degree partner step three is that you go find a space right now traditionally speaking all colleges needed huge land huge buildings 100 crores of capex as we discussed earlier But now with this new model which is asset light you can just go to a building owner a building that is in a location where um the ecosystem is very enabling for you. So let's say I don't know where all the creators in Bombay live right let's say they live in west in Adi west. Okay. So you want to build a campus here because you want to be around your ecosystem. So you'll go to a guy and say okay you know um I want to build a school in the first year. I'm going to probably have 100 students right per student you need approximately 100 square feet. That's the rule of thumb. Okay, if you have 100 students that means you'll need 10,000 ft². That's the amount of space you need. I know in Bombay that sounds a lot but in Delhi it's okay. So maybe 8,000 or 7,000 will also do in Bombay. Okay. You close that lease, right? And then you start building a website and you start doing your marketing. The website you make sure that all of your key messages are delivered. You can do it better than anybody else. Um and then of course I think for you it's very easy to market yourself and the new school. uh you just announce that hey you know I'm building this and these are the key messages and these are the key differentiators um these are the kind of recruiters I'll have these are the kind of opportunities you'll probably have these are the kind of faculty I have of course I'll be teaching etc etc etc um and thereafter you go live right and then thereafter whatever promises you've made over the next 2 three four years you have to deliver on the promises and more right give students what they didn't even expect so that the word of mouth is strong and thereafter the word of mouth will start your flywheel and you'll have a legacy that you'll be sitting on. Right? This is assuming you do everything right. Uh of course there'll be hiccups in the middle. Uh of course there'll be naysayers many many many naysayers especially people coming from the older mindset the older generation. Uh you'll have to fight with the parents. Uh you'll have to fight it with the chachas and the tawis and the grandparents but eventually you'll win. Got it? So if I were to summarize this the first step is to find a gap in the market. And this gap is not the gap that is existing in the market only. It is a gap that you are very well capable of addressing which is your right to win and your job is to capitalize on that because in the business education space there are multiple gaps that you can capitalize on. For example, one of your students build a sales school only which is where he felt there is a right to win. Then if you're building for UG versus PG the differentiator is that when it comes to PG because it's the students themselves who are making the decision. this this output could be something tangible to them but may not necessarily be tangible to their parents for example anything other than a degree a placement a founders's office role and stuff like that but when it comes to UG because parents are bound to make the decision you do this in partnership with the university and the reason why you would do that is because it helps you get the degree but u because you're complying with the regulations of the university but you're running the school by yourself. You don't get entangled in that mess of acredition, affiliation and all sorts of stuff like that as much. Yeah. Which will kill your innovation altogether. There will still be some hindrance but that hindrance will give you the degree which will then justify the hassle that you're and over a period of time as your brand gets built 5 years 10 years down the line you can either go for a university status yourself. You can go to the government and say hill listen I've been running this successfully look at my students look at my alums give me and my school a university status you can go for that right then you will come under UCIC that's okay we'll deal with it right uh they're also very very open to new ideas now finally you know the under the new government under you know especially since co all these organizations have become very open-minded about getting new ideas like you would have heard that recently they allowed faculty who do not have PhD PhDs to also get professor roles. Oh wow. Right. So especially if I've been in the industry for 20 years running marketing and I'm a marketing expert, I have the right to now go and teach even if I don't have a PhD. So these things are happening. So now let's come to your story that there is a flywheel that you need to break once you in fact there is a ceiling that you need to break through in order to build that flywheel right and that flywheel is the flywheel of customer acquisition cost. A lot of these edtech companies have failed primarily because they treated customer acquisition cost as steroids. They thought let's invest in performance marketing. The customer acquisition cost might be slightly higher but we'll at least acquire the customers. Initially it used to cost them 500 rupees to acquire a customer who pays them 10,000 but eventually the gross margins went down but the CAC went up so high that eventually they encountered a loss. Okay. Now that is something that is an that is an even bigger hassle especially when it comes to high ticket products like yours but then you somehow ended up breaking through that ceiling and then you ended up into a virtue cycle where your customer acquisition cost keeps on going down. So first of all talk to me about this flywheel so that people get context and then let's talk about how did you break through that ceiling. Sure. So the flywheel is essentially this that let's say you have a cohort of 60 students right and they graduate and they get good outcomes whether that's them starting a company successfully it's whether it's them going to Shark Tank or whether that's them raising funds or whether it's them raising uh them getting a job right that they truly truly are very excited about. So once you have completed that loop of bringing students in and giving them a good outcome now they become your agents essentially right they essentially become your ambassadors and when they say good things about you right more people want to join right and then your CAG becomes lower then those 100 new students who come in they get great jobs they get great outcomes then they go tell another 100 people and so this pyramid this compounding keeps happening and when you hit year three, year four, you break that ceiling where your cost of acquisition because of this word of mouth becomes really really low, right? And eventually what starts to happen when you touch year five, year six of sustained um good word of mouth is that the cost of application you have to pay an application fee to apply right to a college that overtakes your cost of acquisition and hence by year five your cost of acquisition goes in the negative. Let's understand this with an example. Correct? So now at M's union in the very first cohort we had 60 students. Okay. They let's say paid on an average fees of maybe 2 to three lakh rupees when the fees was actually on the website 20 lak rupees right? So they almost got a 90% scholarship. Right? So it was easy for me to acquire students at such a hefty scholarship. I was able to get good students. I worked very hard on those students. I remember I used to teach myself, spend a lot of time with them, help them with their interviews, help them with their startups, whatever they were doing. And when they finally went into the market, they were happy. I released a placement report, an audited placement report where I spoke about each of those numbers, right? that what was the average salary, what was the highest salary, what was the mean salary, what was the median salary, what was the average salary in consulting, what were the recruiters in consulting, what were they all of that data in like almost like a 10-15 page report which was audited to add trust. It was audited by the same auditor that audits Amhabad's report right once that got into the market that sort of spread like wildfire. Right? That's there's some new college that has come that isn't really well in placements. Now students who are looking to go into good colleges they know that yeah I want to apply to all the top 10 or top 20. Once they see our placement report rivaling that of those current top 10 top 20 colleges we also become part of their target list. Got it. So for these first 60 students what exactly was your customer acquisition cost? For the first 60 students because it was basically a full scholarship that I was giving them. uh all I did was get a PR agency to release a PR piece I think that went into India today that went in in shorts etc etc where it spoke about how this new business school has been started uh these are the three or four faculty that will be teaching they are the founding faculty and there is going to be a full scholarship when in India you're offering a full scholarship automatically a lot of people will apply so I remember in the very first year I got after that PR release almost 600 applications oh wow Wow. And by the way, an applicant had to pay almost 2,500 rupees to even apply. So, we know that those 600 people are all serious. Out of the 600 people, I maybe interviewed 120. So, you're saying that the application fee is absolutely essential because I'll tell you how the public looks at it. Okay. The moment you say application fee, they think you're making money out of their application. But what they don't understand is that in fact I would love to do this for hiring as well where people just pay money just to apply because serious people will come. I'm telling you bro even when I speak to recruiters in fact I've in fact I've been facing this problem very often that you get so many trashy entries that you really don't know how many of them are serious only for you to go through this hassle of processing 10,000 applications and you pick 100 then you realize that those 100 may say 30 are not even serious. So you are losing out on so much energy. So if you just want to cut down the top of the funnel. Usually it is about increasing the top of the funnel. Right here you cut down the top of the funnel that small top of the funnel ends up generating revenue which then minimizes your customer acquisition cost. So you're able to do too many things. You're able to get the best students. You're able to generate revenue from day one which can then be spent into marketing. So it gets you that flywheel started. Exactly. Absolutely. Okay. So these people paid 2,500 rupees. Um 600 students paid for it and then you interviewed them. Then I interviewed approximately I don't remember exactly but I think 150 of them maybe I made offers to maybe 80 85 of them and then maybe 60 ended up joining also 25 people did not join because they had other offers in other colleges I was competing right um but those 60 mavericks took a chance on me got it now tell me something you know I've often heard that in fact I haven't heard that schools whe that's Harvard or IIT or I am what these colleges do they have this unfair advantage of getting the most brilliant minds and once you put 100 brilliant minds under a roof those 100 brilliant minds without having to teach them will end up doing brilliant things so that's where their flywheel starts okay but when it comes to you and I understand that you assume that every kid is capable of infinite potential by the way I'm not a believer of that okay um every kid is capable of infinite potential but you still have to get hold of quality entries right they have to be able to speak at least the basic bar they have to correct so what I'm trying to understand are the attributes that you saw in them to get them into mast's union considering the fact that you had no experience back then no great question yeah so in the beginning obviously I was not going to get the 99.99s today I do I'm in a different position but back then I did not right so I was looking for two three things the first thing I was looking for is is this person inherently curious Inherently curious. Inherently curious. How did you guess that? You know, we had this one question in the application. It's a very interesting question. The question was, why does my table creek? Okay. Doesn't mean anything, right? Yeah. It's a question. It was literally just there. Why does my table creek? And people have to answer that. Now, 99% people will get stumped by that question. What does this mean? Is this a typo? What is this? Right? But there are some people who understand what we are trying to do, right? They will get curious. is they will try to like search online what is this what is that and they'll come up with some interesting answer to that question they'll play the game with me right and that is a great way to find people the kind of people that I wanted right as in an open-ended question that makes people think critically critically yeah just makes them think critically they feel you know someone wants to take up that challenge to answer a you know curveball question that to me is saying a lot about that person right that this person is up for the challenge he's a little give me a few more examples of these kind of questions yeah a lot of questions Um, so this was one. Why does my table creek? Why does what what would happen if the sun rose in the west? Just answer that question. You can take a philosophical approach. You can take an astrological approach. You can take an astronomical approach. Take any approach. You can take all of them together. You can write a poem against it. So just throw these curveball questions. There's a game. So what we do this year, we've changed it slightly. We make them play literally a Mario game. Okay? A Mario style game. So when you apply to Masters Union, you have to play this game. Um same we do at tetar also and this game will test how you do when you have very little time. So we only give you I think 25 30 seconds to solve. This is almost like SSB. What is SSB? In SSB correct service board. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. So you you throw these kind of games like these kind of questions that most people who cannot think originally or critically will get stumped by. Right. You may not be the highest ranker in J. You may not be the highest ranker in your school, college, whatever. But you still might be able to play this game. Okay. Right. So this kind of game or this kind of question helps us get an insight into the person beyond their grades. Okay. Bro, a very curious question. Let's say I am an inherently curious person and this is a problem that I faced even during my college placements. I did not sit for placements but then while these group discussions were being done what if the sky is red? My obvious reaction to do my obvious reaction to it is when there are so many real issues to be discussed why the hell are we discussing about if the sky becomes red what will happen because a it's not going to happen b no no matter what we talk it's not going to change anybody's perspective c it's not resulting into anything okay so during those times because I am inherently a very logical person I'm a realist these abstract things sound like futile things to me because of which I might just decide not to answer that question in the first place but if you give me a question on let's say socialism versus capitalism versus communism I will be able to give you a very comprehensive answer based on real stats and data and case studies that here's where capitalism fails here's where socialism fails here's where communism fails so we ask those questions also okay right because I'm just trying to understand that if a person like me applies to something like why like what is this yeah what is this what is this no fair I mean see the thing is everyone's different and so we have one application we have an AI assessment and then we also of an interview. So there are three points of contacts and in each of those contacts we ask you a different kind of a question or we engage with you in a different way. In one of the years we even tried this thing where we made people finish a scavenger hunt in Gura, right? So we actually partnered them into teams. We called them to campus. We partnered them into teams and we gave them a list of things they have to finish in Gorga together as a team. So how does the scavenger hunt in Gura tell you about the student? No. So the way it's very interesting. So we don't judge the student then and the students judge each other. So when they come back from the scavenger hunt, we ask them to write a few lines about their team members and from those responses, we try to judge who we want in the cohort or not. Right. Got it. Can you walk me through a few examples of a bad apple and a good apple? You know, it's generally we sit there are five of us in the admissions committee. We sit down and all of us debate on each candidate, right? So you might say Pratam, no this is a great candidate. I might say this is not a great candidate, right? And then we'll go with the majority at the end. It's usually a debate and it's often a heated debate as to who we should take in the cohort, who we should not. Um, so you know, sometimes some people are very quiet, right? And in a scavenger hunt setting, they may not be able to truly be um very open, right? They may not be as extroverted in that and so they might be losing out. But when you're sitting the admissions committee and one of the feedback on one of the students is that the student was very quiet. Then we'll check other attributes of that student. What else has he done? like has he still gone above and beyond uh and try to help the cohort or his team in any other way right so these debates happen that really help us understand who the student is as a person beyond their grades right it's very easy to judge a student from their GMAT score from their SAT score from their J score we said let's not do that right let's try to really get to know the person in fact when we do the interview we ask the interviewer to ask answer a question after the interview will you like to have beer with this candidate it tonight. This is the zomato test, right? This is kind of like the zumato test. Exactly. We actually asked that question. And some people may say, "No, I would not like to have a beer with him." That does not mean that that student is rejected. That just means that we have one more data point to judge that student when we are discussing and debating his application in the group. Got it. Right? So, we just collect all of this data. What would you consider as a red flag to not take the student in? You know, if we find too many inconsistencies, right? Let's say in the essay, the student is saying, "I'm an extrovert." Right? But in his peerreview feedback, it's coming out that he's actually introverted. Uh then we know that right when things are not aligning, when he's saying that, you know, I'm very passionate about um quick commerce, but then we don't see any evidence to that effect in his CV, right? Or when he talks about, hey, you know, I read the newspaper, right? But then we see in his CV that he's not uh really updated his CV with some of the latest things that he should have, whatever. So we try you know whenever something like that happens then the red flag goes up right. So and and one more thing is that if someone is coming across as authentic and vulnerable across all of these exercises then we feel like this person deserves a chance right that this person will be curious he will listen to other people he will not be arrogant he'll be a sponge right more than a rock. So you're looking for a sponge for that sponge. Not the person who knows it all and may not absorb things but a person who is willing to admit that they don't know a lot of stuff which is why they're willing to learn more. Vulnerable. Yeah. Those those attributes make up for a great student for us. That's the Masters Union student. That's what we are looking for. He may have a 60% in cat. In fact, there was one video that went very viral that Mast's union has taken a 60%er. I like but the kid is amazing. Bro, you know what? Um I know you wouldn't say this but I should say this because these are the same people who will say bro just ignore All of that crap. Like I get that frust. I don't know how you don't get frustrated. Sometimes I do, you know, like there's this very interesting Bill Bill Gates. So no, not Bill Gates, Bill Clinton actually got a very bad SAT score. Scarlett Johansson actually got a very bad SAT score. Does that make them less successful in life? Not at all. Like SAT scores, J scores are horrible predictors of someone's success. Absolutely. Or potential. And so we we're trying to see beyond those numbers. And so that's how we got most of our students in the first over a period of time as our brand got built. We became spoiled for choice. You became spoiled for choice. Choice. Okay. Right. So earlier we used to have 600 applications. Now we are sitting on 3,000 4,000 5,000 applications. In total I think this year we'll get probably 10,000 applications across all of the programs. Right? And so now we are spoiled for choice. Now we are like hey you know let's optimize for diversity. Let's make sure we have two doctors also in the cohort. They'll add to the conversation in the classroom. Let's make sure we have some students from Nepal and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well. Let's make sure we have some students who did their undergrad abroad and now have come back to India. Let's get some students who also have some family business background. Let's get some students who also have a sporting background. Can we get someone from the army also in the cohort? Right. So now with that uh increased number of applications, we can play all of these interesting. Talk to me about the importance of diversity because I've seen this multiple times from foreign universities that we need a diverse cohort from Namibia to India to Europe. We need people from everywhere. Okay, we need people from diverse backgrounds. Now I don't really understand how does that connect to a great business school experience. So can you help me understand what is the thinking behind this diversification? You know uh I want to give you my personal example. Uh, one of my classmates when I was in college that I was partnered up with on a project was Lebanese. Lebanese. Okay. His name is Randy Re. He's my co-founder of my first company, Outgrow, right? The amount that I've learned from him, right, about his part of the world, it literally opened up my brain, right? Because until I met him, I had only be I had only been fed a certain narrative about the Middle East, for example. Like I mean, you know what I mean, right? With the Middle East. No, no, tell me. I mean I think we were always given this uh very western view of Middle East that you know it's terrorism and it's backward and it's you know a certain religion being completely extremist this that right when I met him right all of that balloon of mine that bubble of mine truly burst here's a guy who's incredibly smart who's telling me stories of how Lebanon came to be and what is a civil war going on over there and how the prime minister and the president and the vice president are always going to be from three different religions. and how that absolutely makes no sense. And how when he was a child in a school bus going to his school when he crossed over a landmine, the car behind him actually completely exploded and he just just about got saved. And about how in his in his community entrepreneurship is not looked at with any risk, right? They they don't think entrepreneurship is risky. You know why? Because they they saw missiles every day in the sky, right? So for them starting a company is not risky. So here's Randy who left an offer from Silver Lake which is one of the largest private equity funds to come and join me and help me build outgrow right my my view of Middle East completely changed I realized how entrepreneurial those people are just because of the kind of you know growth they have seen just so that's an example I think diversity that's why opens your brain right it makes your sponge more absorb with a higher absorption right yeah you know I understood how inclusive Middle East is when I went to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. There you go. Like the waiter over there is from um Jukos Slovakia. How do you pronounce it? Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia. Then the driver is from Pakistan and you go to the hotel there you see Indians. So it is so diverse. But from the outside if you I mean back then now Dubai and Abu Dhabi have managed to change their perspective. But then back then 10 years back had you asked somebody how is Dubai or Abu Dhabi? they would so they would say you know what it's quite exclusive they don't really include people but I would say that uh pe there are some states in India that everybody's aware of there we've gone there and we've felt like this is not our country because people have made us feel that way right because they always value a certain language over others and they often make you feel as if this is not your country and there is evident racism that's going out there right but now tell me how does this how now I I can I can share my experience with you but I want to know from you because you are actually seeing this happen on a daily basis as to how do these experiences shape the business acumen of a person. No, I think business at the end of the day is a product of your understanding of the world, right? Like for example, when I started Teta, we're looking at students from all over the world. Currently, we have students from 45 different countries. So, I have to understand the psyche of the people in those 45 countries. What kind of marketing message would sell in Japan versus China versus US versus Mexico? What are the kind of key messages that will maybe work in the UK but not in Germany? Right? So I think when you are exposed to people in a college setting from different backgrounds, I think your understanding of the world also becomes that much deeper. So when you are building a product, you build it for the world. Not just for Bombay or Maharashtra or India or Asia, but for the world. Right? In fact, when I was at Masters Union and only targeting India, I felt that I could do more, which is where the idea for Teta came in. Said, "Hey, listen, you know, we have a great product. Why not sell from India to the world?" And that's how the idea for Teta came in. And we successfully were able to market ourselves in 45 countries that 120 kids from 45 countries took a chance on an Indian college started by an Indian founder, right? When has that happened before? I think that could I could only do that because I had that exposure of all of those people. U when I was in college, I had friends from all of these countries. Do these cultural exposures also help you find opportunities in India? Because you understand that something is better abroad. Yeah, absolutely. So, I learned how to speak Chinese. Okay. Why? In college because you had to take a second language. And I was like, it's either Spanish or Chinese. Uh and to be very honest, I wanted to impress a Chinese girl who I really liked. Um so I learned Chinese, right? And as a part of my learning experience, I also got to go to China and spend 3 4 months living there, right? And I really understood why Alibaba is Alibaba, what is TA, what is T-Mol? And these were these large companies in China. This is pre Flipkart, pre Amazon coming to India. And so I really understood what the future of India may look like because I could see India from a lens of China. Give me a few examples. Exactly this right like when I was in China this was 20101 Flipkart and Amazon had not become a huge thing right Misho had not even been born and at that time I'm seeing in China all of these companies like Tao T- mall Alibaba really growing right I could see like the fintech revolution in China happening before it happened in India of course in India took over with UPI but I could literally see India's future in China's present. M bro you know what this is what reminds me of Jamshi Tata you know he was also a very passionate traveler and he understood the value of steel when he was attending a lecture where this lecturer said that the nation that understands the value of steel will reap its worth in gold eventually came back to start Tisco it's amazing understood so what you're saying is it gives you a perspective into the future when it comes to more developed countries like China and you know Saraka told me something very interesting about what happens when you go to less developed countries like Africa. Okay. Have you ever had any experiences of going to less developed countries? I also studied abroad in Ghana. Okay. In Ara. I spent three months there as well as part. Yeah. In Ghana. Okay. In Accra. So what did you learn from those experiences? I think there it's more about identifying opportunities. You know one thing I found in Ghana. Very interesting. They have a huge mosquito problem, right? But you know how in India we have electrics. I couldn't find electric allouts in all of Ghana in 2010 summer electric. Is that because they had a better solution or no solution? No, they had just learned to live with it, right? I was like, dude, why has no one come to Ghana to sell electric allouts? Wow. By the way, I was too young. I I should have done something about it. Maybe I would have built a large company there. But it had still stuck with me opportunity. I had seen something in India just like you could see the future of India from China. You could see the future of African countries being and see the solutions to the problems that they are facing if you are in India but you go there and you spot the problems and that's where the marriage of problem and solution happens eventually to result into a large company. Yeah. You know, uh my my granddad tells me this that back in the day there were no modes of transportation, right? You could only perhaps in your lifetime go 100 km in either direction. That's about it, right? Because maybe you had a bulock card. That's about it. But still at that time, very early days, you always had pilgrimages. And pilgrimages were made of course for religious reasons, but the true reason behind them was for you to really burst your bubbles. Yeah. Right. Right? So that you get out of your echo chamber and see the world beyond your understanding of the world. And I think that's when your perspective truly broadens. In fact, um I was never a very strong believer of rapido until I saw Indonesia. Yeah. And then I read this Ken article which spoke about how bike sharing had become a very big deal in Indonesia. Okay. But then how big a deal it was until I went to Bali and then saw what a big deal bike sharing was. And then that's where I understood that there were some similarities between Bali and Mumbai. You can offered a cab but if you go by cab then you'll get stuck in traffic. Two wheelers have a very huge market so there are a lot of people riding two wheelers and the income levels are quite similar. India 2 is very similar to that of Indonesia. And that's when I realized that this is basically India 2 capitalizing on an opportunity which is now being capitalized in India. But then I was just thinking that had I come over here 10 years ago. I would have seen the evolution of bike sharing only to realize that it is quite possible in spite of all skepticism in the world that bike sharing is a huge market provided you have small roads. um similar per capita income. People being in hurry and they always wanting to go somewhere where the average order value is quite less. For example, if you go to a mall with your friends and then you're willing to spend 10,000 rupees, then you would obviously take a cab. But what I've also understood is that if you want to go to a kirana store close by, right? So it is also based on the nature of the activity and the cost of that activity which also dictates which mode of transport you take and how much are you willing to spend on it no matter who you are. And this is what helped me understand. Oh my god. This is how you travel to different places, understand similarities like you said ghana mosquito repellent mosquito repent and then find a solution which is already existing and you just be a mediator to it trader which brings it to life which is so interesting. So interesting. Yeah. I know. Now when it comes to your students at Tetto now you felt it, I felt it. Um but that is because we understand the importance of travel right. All of this happened not by design but by chance and you're making this happen by design with tettor. What exactly are the experiences of your students that have brought in practical business lessons by spotting these gaps in different parts of the world now? So the teta curriculum only is super interesting. So they have to travel to a different country every term. So term one is in Dubai, term two is in India, term three is in Singapore, term four is in Ghana, term five is in Rio, term six is in New York, term seven is in Milan. So that's the circuit that the students are completing in four years. They're spending four and a half months in each of these countries. In each of these countries, they have to build a business on a specific theme. So in Dubai, they all have to build a e-commerce drop shipping business. When they come to India, they all have to build a D2C brand. They learn about branding, they learn about marketing. When they go to Singapore, they have to build a hardware product and pre-ell it on Kickstarter. Then they go to Ghana, they have to build an NGO. When they go to Rio, they have to build a sustainability green venture. When they go to New York, they have to build an AI rapper. And finally, in Milan, they have to build a YouTube channel. AI rapper, you said. Yeah. Essentially, an AI company uh leveraging existing AI tools, right? And lastly, lastly, in Milan, in Europe, they have to build a YouTube channel. YouTube channel. Absolutely. Bro, what is the logic behind each one of these subjects specifically being done in a particular country? Yeah, so basically when you're playing a video game, you go level one, level two, level three. Each level is increasing in the order of difficulty, right? So, drop shipping business that they do in term one is level one of difficulty. Okay, drop shipping requires basic trading. You have to be able to build a basic website. You have to get some products listed from a supplier and the supplier only will drop ship those products. So, you don't have to worry about the last mile delivery, etc., Right? It's a very basic form of business that gets you warmed up for term two where you have to build your own brand. Now, right in term three, not only do you have to build your brand while building a hardware product, but also understand the hardware science and the engineering of it. One level of difficulty above. So, trader, brand, product. First, term one is trading, learn trading. Term two is branding. Term three is you learn the product also. So on and so forth, right? So every term you have to build this 0ero to1 journey and in this journey you learn something about building a business right and your grades come from your revenue your margin your profit your NPS and your OS okay right but doesn't that really depend on the market that they choose and the product that they choose absolutely for example if I'm choosing a skincare brand whereas the other person is choosing something like let's say allout kis then the allout guy is obviously going to make more money than I right he's going to make more money than me correct but when it comes to my passion. My passion lies in skincare. As a result, I'm by default um I'm by default bound to trade with low AOV products. So how do these first of all if it's low AOV then you should compensate with higher volumes. Okay. Let's say you have low AOV and low volumes but you are passionate about the product then it will reflect in the NPS. So there'll be huh so there'll be some metric that will be going for you right and of course there's a more holistic judgment also. not only on revenue, right? But what we have found is that when you build a business, let's say in term one, you have to build this trading business. You'll need some knowledge of accounting because you have to maintain your books of accounts and file for taxes. You'll need some knowledge of digital marketing because you have to run those ads on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, everywhere. You need some understanding of legalities because you have to build and set up a company in Dubai which is very difficult to do in some ways for an international student to come in. Now we have all of these courses. Okay. Oh, got it. So, this is the Elon Musk way that you spoke about, correct? Which is refrigerator fix. In this case, there is a there is a business that you're supposed to build. In this case, it's let's say e-commerce. So, you're essentially a trader, which means website, legalities, registering the company, performance, marketing, all of it, you're supposed to understand. And also you have to understand which product to choose of course that's the main thing the market research you'll have to you also understand how to do good market research how to do surveys how to figure out how to uh negotiate with suppliers how to manage RTO return to origin because that happens like crazy when you're doing drop shipping so all of these are things that you learn as you're building the business and all of these workshops is the curriculum essentially do you provide them with initial capital for this so all of these eight businesses all of these eight businesses that we have identified if you think about it. They actually require almost zero capital because drop shipping does not require any capital because there is no moq involved. When you're building a D2C brand again you're using gorilla marketing Instagram creating content to sell your product again hardly anything required. When you're doing Kickstarter it completely depends on your design and your branding and your selling capabilities on Kickstarter. Right? So each of these businesses have been identified to not require a lot of capital and whatever little capital you need that we will give. Right? Right. So in term one, we need we understand that the students need some capital to get started when it comes to performance marketing. So we give them a $500 budget. Got it. Which also tells them that you can start with zero capital. Exactly. Got it. Frugality. Frugality. But the most important thing is that these are students who have never built a business before. And they've always been told in their lives that get a good job, get a good job. But now in term one only when they have made even $5,000 in revenue, there is a switch that turns on in their head. They become entrepreneurial. They realize that they can be paid for something that's not their time. Correct. Right. That they can build a business. That if they continue at it had they gotten the right team, had they gotten the marketing just right, they could have made not just 5,000 but 50,000 also. And the DNA changes. I have seen this DNA change every year for the last 5 years. Yeah. proven why is there an NGO over here? Um when we are in Ghana right we realize that um there's a great opportunity in Ghana to have a lot of impact because Ghana is really one step behind India in terms of growth right and we also want students to appreciate the social impact that businesses can create them to become hardcore capitalists as a college it's also our responsibility to give them a balance right so making them build an NGO raise funds for an NGO be really close to the people they are impacting. We feel that also is an incredibly important experience that college should provide right so that's why we chose NGO plus raising funds for an NGO is much harder right than raising funds for a business and so they should also learn that right uh we also want them to be sensitive we also want them to be uh empathetic individuals and I think this does a great job of it got it so this is empathy then let's come to sustainability startup is that correct yes so they have to build something which furthers the green agenda right trading India right but west Sweden Norway Germany even South America even US everyone's only speaking about ESG right and that's a very big part of every business every strategy explain ESG in two lines ESG is environment sustainability governance right so it's how do you make sure that whatever work that you're doing whether it's mining whether it's AI whether Whether it's building furniture, how that is sustainable, how that is green and how that's not negatively adversely impacting the environment which we live in, right? So all the energy businesses, you know, green energy businesses, renewable energy businesses fall in that category. All the carbon trading businesses, right? Where you're actually literally u like sewing forests and then offsetting carbon with that that comes into the picture. So that's a huge economy in the west with Tetto where we have students from all of these countries. We have to really be mindful about making sure that ESG is a very important part of the curriculum. And one more thing, you know, we were speaking about how to get top 10 ranks. Most rankings make ESG almost compulsory in your curriculum, right? So, if you don't have ESG in your curriculum, you can forget about rankings. All these global rankings, they really value both you being ESG compliant and you teaching ESG to students. And Rio is a great place to do it because you know you're in the middle of Amazon rainforest etc all of that a lot of very interesting carbon offset businesses can be created there wonderful or YouTube it's pretty obvious so now let's come back to the masters union model perspectives in fact that also comes back to masters union where you also give students diverse experiences but before that I want to understand the model in terms of teaching school professor to anywhere between 10 to 20 LPN package but this is again capex heavy and the problem with teachers is not the salary that they get but the experience that they have for example when it comes to YouTube YouTube is such a evolving space social media in general is such an evolving space that had you spoken to me 2 years ago in fact we did and I told you different things and today I'm telling you different things in fact when I speak to Ranir I hear about different things as to how a social media entrepreneur reneur can turn himself from a scrappy entrepreneur to a full-fledged organization. That's what I've learned from Reanir and that's only because he's one of the first people to do it. So when these industries are so quickly evolving and when it comes to DTC also 3 years ago everybody thought D2C is the next big thing. Today we've understood that D2C is only a marketing channel for you to go offline but the final destination is offline. Back then we thought that the likes of D2C will go on to beat the legends like HL. Now we've understood that these companies are companies that will scale and eventually get acquired by HL to become a part of the legacy brands. So our perspectives are evolving. So if a professor has 10 years of experience, I wouldn't call that professor the best professor. In fact, I would consider that 10 years of experience to be 10 years of redundant knowledge. Now my my dad says this thing that if a faculty comes and says that I have 10 years of teaching experience you don't have 10 years of teaching experience you have one year of teaching experience 10 times over correct that is exactly what I was about to say because that's 10 years of stagnation right because that's 10 years of you being away from the market and when it comes to YouTube also if you ask a YouTuber who existed back in 2014 to come and deliver a lecture on how to grow on YouTube it would not make sense at all. So how do you strike a balance between and but at the same time full-time professors are important because they are the ones who build a connect with the student right they're always there um but for example when I come to teach at masters union I don't have the luxury even though I want to I can't spend beyond a certain time with the students so how do you strike a balance between getting people who can teach the students the first principles the concepts the textbook stuff which are absolutely important like customer acquisition cost and lifetime value at the same time balance that with the latest knowledge of what's happening in the market and then marry them together to give the student the perfect balance of the the first principles of business and the most important principles of modern business. You know, you have actually answered my question. Uh you you've actually answered your own question. Okay. So, we have a 30 304 model. Okay. 30% 30% 40%. 30% of my faculty that's going to be teaching the students are my full-time faculty who are teaching core first principles business courses right like basics of accounting I do not need to bring in a McKenzie partner to teach basics of accounting I need a professor who can really be very rigorous making sure that right so for some basic fundamental courses I use 30% of my faculty full-time faculty they're resident they're on my full-time roles They're all faculty from IM's usually who come and teach right and usually some of them have some work experience as well but it does not matter because what they're teaching does not require as much work experience that's 30%. 30% of my faculty is visiting faculty from abroad. Right? These are usually professors from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Wharton. We request them to come to India for a few weeks at a time and teach our students unique and interesting principles that they are doing research on. Example like for example um we have uh we have someone whose name is Edward Rogers who is a former NASA chief knowledge officer, right? and he has done some amazing research on system studies right how to create large systems and how to do systems thinking right these systems are I mean he has studied them in the context of NASA and space shuttles and all of that but he's then come up with his own theories and frameworks that he teaches at business schools in the US right so every year at least twice he comes to India to teach at mast's union and he teaches these mental models and these systems thinking models that students absolutely love right now I could not have gotten that kind of input from my full-time faculty neither from a practitioner right so 30% of my faculty are people like this who visit mostly from the US teach people very specific things that we think are very important in a entrepreneurs journey but how do you think that when we started building our curriculum right we met with a lot of recruiters we met with a lot of practitioners CEOs MDs partners essentially our customers right these are the customers who are going to recruit our students in the future and we asked them what is it that you need right so and we made a list of all the skills that they find useful and then we worked backwards from those skills came up with learning outcomes and found the faculty that best could teach those learning outcomes. Right? So if like for example I remember when we had met um someone from BCG right and we share our campus with BCG they had told us very clearly that they really believe in mental models and they really believe in certain frameworks that everyone should know right so I literally I remember going on LinkedIn and searching for that mental model framework on LinkedIn and to see who are the trainers for that right and I found someone who eventually turned out to be Edward Rogers who we then invited and he came and he taught right so first 30% is full-time faculty second 30% % is this visiting faculty mostly from the US teaching very specific things then 40% of my faculty are practitioners these are CEOs MDs CXOs partners at various companies mostly are recruiters who come and teach skills that they actually hire for right so for example um you we you spoke about Jiraj earlier right he's a uh angel investor right he runs uh Indian Silicon Valley right and there is nobody better than H to teach angel investing, right? So we actually call him, he spends a lot of his time on campus teaching students angel investing, right? Or introduction to venture capital or introduction to 0 to1 journeys, right? Uh for content, right? I will obviously love to request you to come in more regularly and work with my students. But if I cannot get your time, I'll ask someone from your team to come in, right? And teach students, right? Guys, can you please come in? Yeah right for communications you have a great communications course right I would love to ask you boss if you can please take out some time and you might say pratam I can't come Monday through Friday because I'm really busy but Saturday I can give you four hours in fact there are five Saturdays I can give you four hours each so I'll be like okay done my students are will very much be available on Saturday you please give me four hours for five Saturdays that's 20our course deal done right so 40% of my faculty are practitioners like these there's a very popular course taught by Mr. Rajat Matur who's the MD of Morgan Stanley. He teaches people decisions. How do you make decisions of hiring, firing, promotions, increments, bonuses? It's a very important course if you think about it. Nobody ever teaches it. It wasn't a course at Watton, right? But the way he teaches it is through a simulation, right? He's drafted this very interesting simulation. People play with it. It's very hands-on, very experiential. Only he can teach that. No full-time faculty will be able to teach that. No visiting faculty from the US can teach that. at him who's run the entire people organization at Morgan Stanley is the best equipped to teach that course. Correct. Right. Now talk to me about the remuneration of each categories. Okay. Let's talk about the first segment which is the full-time faculty. Okay. Um I think hourly rates would be the best. No. So full-time faculty they're on your role. So you're paying them annually essentially. Okay. You have annual contract from for a fresh faculty who's just finished his PhD from a top IM maybe 30 to 40 lakhs. Okay. Right. And this can go up to 1 cr 2 crores 3 crores for a star faculty. Got it. When it comes to visiting faculties, you pay them for in 20our increments. 20our increments. What does that mean? So basically they are coming to India to teach your course which and each course is 20 hours usually, right? So you pay them for a 20our bracket. Okay. If they're teaching two cohorts, then that becomes 40 hours. They're teaching three cohorts, that becomes 60. The rule of thumb here is on an hourly basis, you're paying them $1,000. $1,000 per hour. That's $20,000. Does that include travel and stay? No. For travel and stay, we give them a $5,000 u, you know, like a uh allowance, and they can use that allowance however they want. If they want to travel business, they can travel business. They want to travel economy and save that money, they save that money. Got it. And for practitioners, it's mostly free, right? No, no, no. So, you know what we have realized is that if a practitioner comes and says, "I'll do it for free." We say, "No, we'll still pay you because we want to demand quality. If somebody's g doing you a favor and doing it for free, then you can't demand quality. You can't say sir, you're not teaching well." All right? So, we still give them money. Now, they may choose to donate that money, which most of them do. Okay? Right? Right. A Rajat Matur when we give him whatever we give him whatever little doesn't matter to him he would usually give it for charity is my guess right but at least I can keep him accountable marks right so that's there is still a cost attached to it there is still a cost attached to it what would be this cost this cost if someone is let's say a vice president who's teaching something very specific some vice president at Facebook who's teaching how to do marketing on Facebook uh maybe I'll pay $5,000 rupees an hour $100 an to someone of the level of Mr. Rajat Matur. Anything is less, but I think the highest we go is approximately $1,000 an hour. The average would be uh I think $500 to $550 an hour. Got it. Perfect. And we would also pay them in 20our increments. 20our increments. Okay. Um Pratam, here's one question that I always had. Okay. When it comes to a business school, the biggest problem and this is not a problem from the kids. This is a problem that I have seen as a point of skepticism from the parents that if they go to a business school, no matter it's a business, if they go to any college, no matter whether it's a business school or an engineering school, they often expect their kids to get placement. Yeah. Okay. As a result, no matter how desperately you want them to be entrepreneurs, you still somehow are accountable only in terms of the placement, right? As a result, like you mentioned, only after you show the placement report are the parents willing to pay money, which is fair from their side, but somehow I feel like it defeats the purpose of a business school because I'll tell you why. When a student gets in, unless that students parents are entrepreneurs, they will not understand the value of entrepreneurship. Okay, I'm talking about both students as well as parents because students understand the fascination behind entrepreneurship, the opportunities and freedom of entrepreneurship, the money of entrepreneurship but not the value of entrepreneurship. Similarly, when it comes to parents, their metric of success is always based on placement numbers because no matter how successful your business will be 10 years later in year one, you cannot do a great job, right? So, how do you tweak? I mean I know for a fact that you can't change this marker of success but as a person who's running a business school do you feel like do you feel compromised when people ask you for placement report instead of asking you how many businesses have started out of your batch you know there's always a plan A and a plan B when any student comes through mast's union his plan A is always I want to set up my own company right but they want the comfort of a plan B you know because it may be a risky endeavor to start a company in case I fail do I have this plan B where I can easily get a placement right and be employed and I can pay off my loan in a predictable manner right so when students come my first day the address that I give to them is that guys let's build your startups right are you all with me they all say yes we are with you fully committed and for the one year in the case of MBA and four years in the case of undergrad that they are with me they are pursuing that startup full force Right? But as they start seeing the results of their startups, right? They start, some of them realize that this is not for them. Some of them realize that entrepreneurship is for them but maybe not this market. Someone realize that yeah, I want to study. I want to work in this market only but maybe not this product. Right now it's very difficult for them to start again. And then they're like okay never mind. I tried my hand at startup. It did not work for whatever reason. Let me go back into the job market. I'll do this job for 2 3 5 10 years. But eventually I'll come back to being an entrepreneur. Right? So while students may want a job safety net in the first year, second year, I think that I have done a good job and masters union has done a good job that eventually all of those people who enter the job market also eventually want to start up. Right? And if over 10 years more than 50% of my students start up, I think I would have done a great job. So your goal is cultivating business acumen and not getting your students to build companies right after college. 20% should that is my personal goal. Yeah, that is my internal goal that 20% of my students should not even consider placements. It last year it was maybe 10%, this year it's 15%. And next cohort I'm sure it will touch 20%. What are you doing so deliberately to increase this percentage? What I do is very interesting. Okay, if your startup is going well but it's not broken away yet successful for the next one year after they graduate I give them free office space and I give them 40,000 rupees per month no questions asked oh wow we call it the founder fellowship if you don't sit in placements I will give you 40,000 out of my own pocket which will take care of your loan repayment and will also take care of your rent okay now that gives them some safety net number one number two I also give them the privilege of sitting in placements next year. So you get two chances at placements. This is one of the most brilliant things I've ever heard, man. I'll tell you why. My best friend, his father is an entrepreneur, okay? And he's a pretty legendary entrepreneur. This is exactly what he told him. And I was like, I just wish AJ uncle was my father because this is exactly what he said. He said, office. If you want, I'll also pay for your employees, one or two employees at max. It's not like you can just build an army of employees. But this will go on for the next one or two years until you understand whether you really want to do this or you want to change your path. And that gave him the audacity to say, you know what, let me just go ahead. Otherwise, we see two extremes. Either the father says just handle my business or the father says you know what I'm not going to give you anything just start from scratch but this safety net which you are doing delness this hardness yeah is just at the perfect it is at the it it balances risk as well as safety so perfectly that it gives the child a conducive atmosphere and a safety net so that they can take more risks I'll give you some success stories from this cohort Whoever is in Gorga right now, go to Zomato and search for Lexis sandwich. Cono sandwich. Lexis. L E Xi. Okay. L E Xi. These are four kids. Two from Pondicherry, brother sister, one from Amsterdam and one kid from Delhi. Egg Zomato. Four of them got together to build a cloud kitchen. They sell gourmet sandwiches in Gura on Zomato and Swiggy, right? Doing really well. Their chili burata is amazing. people must try right they got founded as part of the venture initiation program where we do these founder fellowships all four of them have put their savings as well as this 40,000 that we give them together so bootstrap and they don't have to fund raise from outside they don't have to dilute etc etc right and they can stay on campus use all the resources of the campus um and in fact couple months ago you were talking about I think uh Vikram right who runs viri by kilo vishal vishal Vishal and he was on campus and these kids were building the startup and I literally realized you know introducing them would be super great. So I just called four of them I said guys Vishal is here just talk to him right and he gave them some insight and so just being in that ecosystem really helped them. So I have so many of these examples. Yeah. I mean I can go on and on. There's another company called Play Super. Two kids again met at Masters Union. Actually they knew they knew each other from before and they are building this loyalty platform for gamers. So they realized that studios that produce games they have very little retention. So they created this thing where you play game on one platform you can earn points and actually redeem it on some other platform like a loyalty platform for gamers. Again like they've raised money. This is they're also beneficiaries of the founders fellowship. Uh there's another guy called u Aditya building a company called Blue Brew. They make jeans but that old re Lee Wrangler kind of those jeans faded with designs not like the simple ones that you and I wear but like and doing really well like uh Tiger Shro and Shadha Kapoor are wearing his clothes right now. What are you saying right now? Bluebrew.com you can go check out B L Ue B R E W Blue Brew. I don't know if it's.com orin one of those. And you can see Tiger Stro and um Shadha Kapoor and u uh one more I forget her name she's a daughter of like a very important actress they're wearing his clothes again he's a recipient of founders fellowship that is beautiful man and you also help students raise capital right so what we do is you know we were speaking about Vcominator the earlier and on the last day of the cohort on the last day which is h which happens in May all of our students who are doing these businesses they get to present present their ideas to 100 VCs on campus. Right? This is called the demo day, right? This is called the demo day. Yeah. Right. And you can actually see the demo day videos from the last few years on YouTube. They're all there. I've seen them. You've seen those. And all of our students get to present to 100 VCs. Now, we know that getting those 100 meetings with 100 VCs will take them two years. But if you can get those 100 VCs to the campus and expose them to the startups, those 100 VCs listening can at least lead to 10 to 20 VC meetings. Correct. And maybe one or two will convert. And if not that, if the VC sees a great presentation, even if the business model is not something that's investable, tomorrow like 6 months later when you drop him a cold email, that becomes a mom email. Exact. In fact, I'll give you an example of Dvita Saraf. She's an Ashoka University undergrad student doing masters at Masters Union. She was running an alcohol company. They were making wine for the Indian taste palette. Okay. Okay. Very interesting, right? And they were making wine by brewing tea. Okay. And she presented and for whatever reason the startup failed. However, she was presenting. This VC was in the audience. The the VC was so impressed that eventually he gave her an interview to join that VC fund as an investor. And now Dvida actually works there. Right? So essentially if you see you're solving for three of the most important things required for entrepreneurship which is access safety and knowledge access safety knowledge absolutely exposure is extraordinary for tettor but for mast's unit it happens through these visiting faculties visiting faculties and also the the activity that where you where these kids have to find something from the unorganized market and sell it it's in term one uh it's a very interesting uh game that we play right so in the morning students are given 10,000 rupees and they are told to go to the flea market. We call it the Barara market in in Gura and they have to procure unbranded stuff and then they get two hours to brand that stuff and then go into the high street area like CyberHub and then actually sell their products with a brand now for profit and whoever makes the most profit in those 12 hours wins right it's a great I mean that also gives them this sense of hustle and all of this is done to basically instill confidence correct that is the most important thing self-belief if you can create in they can do anything. Indians and especially Indian kids of that u you know that middle class upper middle class the biggest thing that they lack is self-belief and confidence correct by now let's come to the last segment and here's where we complete the flywheel to customer acquisition clear we also covered exposure and the importance of exposure we spoke about Curriculums. Curriculums and learning by doing. Yeah. We come to the final part of the flywheel which is placement. Regardless of how well you have done in the previous stages, unless you give out placement because of the way Indian society functions, you will not get the report card of a successful B school. Although that's quite um oxymoronic. Yeah, we have established that. Okay. Um so let's I just want to understand what is your approach to a doing the market research to understand which are the most relevant skills b after you understand which are the most relevant skills how do you then get rid of companies or placements to complete the flywhe got it great question see I think you have to first start with the students let's say I have 200 students in my program I ask them what are your dreams what do you want in life what kind of companies do you want to work with what kind of cultures do you Do you want to work in India? Do you want to work abroad? You want to work abroad? In which countries do you want to work? Right? So like this right in the beginning, we make a list of our target companies. Right? So we ask each student to give us three or four target companies. We write that list down and then through a sales effort by our sales team, we actually then go out into the market selling our students to these companies. It's a B2B sales process. I literally have a 40 person placement team whose job is to sell my students into the market right so we have a list of companies we are targeting we divide that list of companies amongst our 40 sales team and then it's everyone's incentive structure system process it's all structured so that they can go and close that company right so we know that let's say this is company A let's say Google right or let's say Talabad in Dubai we know that these are the six students who really wanted this company. So we'll go to that company, we'll meet the hiring manager, we'll meet the CEO, we'll pitch to them, we'll tell them what masters union is, we'll tell them who our students are and we'll tell them exactly what these six students can do for them. Do you also ask them what exactly are the skill sets that they are looking for? I think there's enough information online right on their website etc which we can easily fathom. Talabad is a quick commerce company in Dubai, right? So we understand they need program managers. They need program managers with ops background. We know they need e-commerce managers. We know they need category managers. And we know exactly what skills those category managers need, right? Because that much research even our team is doing. We are teaching those kind of courses also. The students are building those kind of companies also in VIP, right? In the ventureation program, they're doing drop shipping. So they have that experience. So we take all of the students CV or their proof of work, their portfolio. Then we go to the company and say, "Hey, listen. There are these five openings on your website. We want to pitch these five students for this one opening. We want to pitch these six students for this opening. Right. Give our students a chance. Got it. Right. This is very different from how placements happen in other colleges. Yeah. Placements usually happen in the way that they look at the biggest TAM. So if they understand that there is a huge market for business development, they will make sure that the students are trained for business development in such a way that they're able to apply for placements. The companies come up and they are these are mass recruiters, right? They just take out students in bulk and that's how we also get those. We also get those. But generally the way placements happen in you know these old business schools is that there's a day zero. They tell whoever wants to come to campus can come on this day zero and we'll give you a schedule and you can come recruit our students and go. That's how placements happen. Now what happens in that is that the student only gets one day to decide which company they want to go for. With in our case student gets enough time, they get enough uh interview chances. is they meet a lot of different companies over a period of one year. Placements don't happen in one day. They happen over six seven months. So our process is slightly different. Essentially it all boils down to considering each student a product, an individual product that we are going and selling to the highest bidder. Got it? Right. It's a very crude way of looking at it, but it's also the best way of doing B2B sales like it's B2B sales right understood. How Infosys, how TCS sell their contracts, B2B contracts. Similarly, we sell our students. But this way, the placement packages are not under your control, right? Are they? They're a little bit more in our control, right? So, because then we will only target roles that are commensurate with our students expectations and their abilities versus the other way around where a company's coming to campus, they already have a fixed salary that they will offer to every student. Good, bad, ugly, doesn't matter to them. Got it. Do you also design your syllabus on the basis of students expectation and how the market is functioning? Absolutely. Like every last three years, our syllabus has completely changed. Now what we were teaching 2 years ago they said we have to teach it very differently because of advent of AI. Correct? Right. Product management 2 years ago is very different from product management today. Finance 3 years ago is very different from fintech today. So we have to change that. And by the way we don't have to change it ourselves. When we bring the faculty from the companies they automatically teach what they're recruiting for what they're looking for. So that automatically gets uh you know baked in. Understood. This is the reason why you're able to get great placements. This is the reason because we are taking it as a sales process. Right? Now last year the market was really bad. Right? Uh it took us 3 months extra to place all of our students. Still we finished before the students were graduating. We still finished in November. The students were graduating in December and we just had our convocation in January where you were there. Uh but it took us 3 months more than it took us last year because the market was tough. So we had to do twice the number of sales. Right? If last year it took my student three offer three interviews to get an offer. This time it took him six interviews to get an offer. So while the other business schools were struggling and a lot of the students were left unpaced, in our case we just spend that much extra time. Got it? Right. And so that's usually how it works. And then of course, you know, you can pitch for in internships, you can say, "Hey, if you like my students doing internships, which is a low-risk way of testing the waters with Masters Union, and then if you can convert them in the future, that's also okay. If you want to give my students a consulting assignment and see how they do in the consulting assignment, that's also okay. If you want to give them a case study to analyze and they come back to you with a case study and you like them, then you can hire them. It doesn't have to be a one-izefits-all. So we we essentially craft the product and the offering for each company differently. Understood, bro. I think that completes the flywheel then. So what we've spent close to 4 hours talking about Masters Union, the business model, your grandfather, this has been amazing, man. Thank you so much. I'm taking back so much that uh like you just saw, I had to request a few extra papers just so that I could take down everything that you're saying. I I really hope that that you start a business school. You know, you'll be so inspiring as a business school founder. Not just a business school, as a university founder. You have so much to give. You're so nurturing in the way you approach things and the history that you've built, the brand that you've built with things school. I I I really envy uh you seriously boss and I really feel you'll be so successful and India needs it. Thank you so much. India needs it more than anything else from coming from you. That means the world to me man. Yeah. the genuiness that you will do it with I think is going to be above all. I look forward to seeing you in that avatar and then I'm going to ask you questions hopefully. But thank you so much V. This this really means a lot and um I am really thankful that I have somebody to look up to in terms of ambition and um I am I'm not even hoping. I know for a fact that you will be among the top 10 and when you're among the top 10 we will cut this out as real and put it out and tell people that we saw this coming long time back. If you if you every year come and teach the course on communications and content then I have no doubt 100% come to teach and you know what is the most fulfilling thing about masters union u when I come over there everybody's just so excited um that's not a that's not the case with a lot of colleges right they're just so excited all the time that I feel energized after delivering a lecture so I just came there last time I think I spent about an hour or so and then we had a meetup um and then we spent about 20 minutes over there that was incredible And after the meet up, I just thought of just going back and then there was some fight that was happening between the previous batch and the new batch saying why didn't I just come and teach with her? I said no I promise I'll come to teach. Great great problem to have. So that excitement is something that's quite infectious and um it's just amazing man. I look forward to coming and teaching there. No thank you so much for saying that. Means the world to us. Thank you bro. Thank you so much. [Music] [Music]
