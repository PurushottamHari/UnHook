1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,520
Bro, I studied from a private college.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,080
It was a terrible college and we were

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,639
associated with the Pune University BAR

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,519
and that's why the market gap is that we

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,359
need founder of masters union. I thought

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,320
what a crazy idea. I came to gather that

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,960
your object is to be one of the top 10

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
business schools. Why not? It will

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,720
happen sooner than you think. I know it.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,279
Harvard gave us a model. Upupen gave us

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,559
a model that spawned thousands of other

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
universities across the world. But I

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,280
think it's time for us to bring a new

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
model and that's what I'm trying to do.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
You know at Masters Union they're trying

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
to train all of you guys business by

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
getting you to do business and that's

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
really how you learn business. So your

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
goal is cultivating business acumen and

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
not getting your students to build

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
companies right after college. 20% of my

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
students should not even consider

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
placements. What are you doing so

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,960
deliberately to increase this

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
percentage? What I do is very

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,960
interesting. Okay. My question to you is

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,559
how many of these 1 cr graduates get a

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,960
job that pays at least 40,000 rupees a

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,720
month or almost 5 lakh rupees a year

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,119
75,000 no India requires 120 more

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,200
universities 1 1200 more 1200 more

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
universities to become a $30 trillion

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
economy my impact is not going to come

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,439
from mast's union my impact is going to

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,439
come from the

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
today. Hi brother, how are you? I'm

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
doing well. Thank you so much for having

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
me, bro. I'm so excited to talk to you,

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,480
and I'll tell you why. Um, I have seen

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
what you've built, but not a lot of

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,400
people have seen what you've built. What

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
people don't recognize about you, and

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm sure they'll recognize this in 10

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
years, I can give this to everybody in

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,920
writing that one day people will

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
recognize Masters Union as a revolution

81
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
in the Indian education system. And the

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
reason why I admire your work so much is

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,360
because I keep saying this very often, I

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,159
am a result of a failed education system

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,159
or

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
And you know we both believe this that

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,319
business and entrepreneurship is one of

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
the best way to empower somebody because

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,760
it turns them into leaders who then

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,840
create jobs who then push the fabric of

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,360
the Indian civilization further and

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
eventually they go on to become the

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,879
greatest contributors to the Indian

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,239
economy as free birds not as um confined

95
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,680
individuals. Um and I think it's an

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,799
audacious vision to to find a way there

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
right to not really beat them but to at

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,680
least present an alternative to them

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
from India right most importantly that's

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,239
a humble way of saying it master pratam

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
wants to beat them okay you know we

102
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
learn so much from them we are here

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,000
because of them I am a product of one of

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
those top 10 institutions right I was

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
very very lucky that I got to go to

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
University of Pennsylvania which is an

107
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
Ivy League school at that time it was

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
ranked two or three Right. And so I am a

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,720
product of that system. So I can't

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
really say I want to beat it, but I want

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,959
to learn from it and I want to evolve

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
it. Everything evolves. But I think our

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
education system has not evolved as much

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
as it should have. Our classrooms look

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
essentially the same as they did

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,440
hundreds 200 years ago, you know. Yeah.

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
And today uh the the agenda that I have

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
for the podcast is pretty clear like I'm

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
somebody who wants to build a business

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
school and I'm going to consider this as

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,479
a master class from a person who's done

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it to try and understand a what are the

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,759
opportunities that exist in the market

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
and I remember when we were sitting and

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,560
chatting at masters union you told me

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,040
that India requires 120 more

127
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,199
universities 1200 more 1200 more sorry

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
1200 more universities to become a $30

129
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,919
trillion economy so we have this vision

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,840
trillion economy but we do not have the

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,040
machinery to be able to get to that 30

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
trillion. Yeah. The infrastructure

133
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
required to get to that which also talks

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,919
about a very big opportunity and this is

135
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,759
something that I admire a lot about you.

136
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,960
Um and you are very giving in terms of

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,720
saying that you know what bro you should

138
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
go and build another university which is

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
quite interesting and that's not

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
something that a lot of founders say. So

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
today I want to decode all of this in

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
such a way we try and understand what

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
exactly are the biggest opportunities

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,720
that lie in the education space so that

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,039
out of this podcast if there is if there

146
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,440
is only a dozen of people who go out

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,520
there get inspired and try to tap into

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,520
that opportunity one of them may become

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
successful that could be me as well that

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
would be a great thing so that's the

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,840
agenda for this podcast if that's clear

152
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
shall we get let's get started okay

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Pratam let's talk about your background

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,400
first um from a family that has been

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
into business for two generations,

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
right? And you're the third generation.

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Third generation. Yeah. The risky one.

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
Third

159
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,120
generation. Third generation

160
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,720
entrepreneur. But I have seen a lot of

161
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
large businesses. I can name them right

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
now which are in the news who are

163
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
failing. I can't take names but people

164
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
understand what I'm talking about. So a

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,319
it's not very it's not very easy to be a

166
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
third generation entrepreneur and to

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,520
carry the weight of your parents

168
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
responsibilities. It's easier than being

169
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,080
a first generation entrepreneur. I would

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
say that but it has its own set of

171
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,639
challenges generation

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,479
entrepreneur. But I'll tell you why I

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
think it's more difficult. Okay, a you

174
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,960
have money that's fine but the other

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
thing that I have seen a lot of people

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
face in fact I was at the gym about a

177
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
week ago and I saw a guy who was a

178
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
second generation entrepreneur and he

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
was struggling bro when I asked him bro

180
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
why the hell are you struggling? like

181
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,240
you've got all the money in the world.

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
He told me one thing and that

183
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
is so

184
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
So first I want to talk about your

185
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
family. Tell me where did your

186
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
grandfather start? I know it's a

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
fascinating story. So go as deep as

188
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,680
possible. All right. Sounds good. My

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,599
grandfather actually moved from Mulan to

190
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
India to a place called Jalander in

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
Punjab. Mulan was in Pakistan. In

192
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
Pakistan. Right. So during partition or

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,960
just before partition he moved to India.

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,120
He essentially attached himself with the

195
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,360
local battalion the local army unit that

196
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,919
was stationed in Jalander cantonement at

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
the time and he essentially became for

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,879
lack of a better word a chaiwala for

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
that battalion. So every battalion used

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
to have people who would serve them

201
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,840
food, serve them tea, serve them

202
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,080
biscuits. He became that person, right?

203
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
And that's where his journey started. Uh

204
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
it was essentially a freelance gig if

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
you know what I mean, right? He wasn't

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,919
employed, but he was just helping the

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,759
army. And that freelance gig sort of

208
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,240
grew a little bit larger. He was able to

209
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,080
set up a small retail store for the army

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
for that unit. Again, serving a little

211
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,800
bit more now than just biscuits and tea.

212
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,759
Uh eventually he realized that the real

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,840
margin is in the sweets. Okay. Why in

214
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,599
Mitai? Because the thing is when you're

215
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800
selling a parli, you're buying it at a

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
certain price and you're selling it at

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,919
cost plus, right? You're making a 10% 5%

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,479
margin. But when you're selling sweets,

219
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
you're actually making them at

220
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,159
home yourself. So your gross margin on

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,080
that becomes much higher. Right. So he

222
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,599
realized that the highest margin in all

223
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
of the products he was selling were

224
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
sweets. Right. This is walk me through

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
this margin so that people understand

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
the value addition power. Sure. So I

227
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,320
mean he would literally just buy milk,

228
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,519
sugar, ghee, um all of the raw materials

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,320
that go into mitai, make that mai at

230
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,080
home with his wife and kids and the next

231
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
morning go to the store and sell it.

232
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Right? The margin on that will always be

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
more than if you ever were to purchase

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
let's say a parliy packet and then sell

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,920
it tomorrow at a slightly higher price.

236
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,680
Hence the gross margin the business

237
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,560
economics were much better. Right. From

238
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,360
5% to I would say close to 30 to 40%. No

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,519
it could even be 70 80%. Oh wow. Right.

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,200
Uh depending on the kind of product that

241
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
it is that you're selling and also

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
depending on the cost of the raw

243
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,800
material which keeps changing. Right. Uh

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,440
so he basically then decided or he

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,640
graduated to building his own sweet shop

246
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
right he's like let me forget about

247
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,040
parli and let me forget about coke

248
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,200
camper whatever products were coming at

249
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,680
that time and let me just focus on my

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,480
own products that I make at home with my

251
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,640
recipes with my wife with my kids right

252
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
and uh in one of those workshops is

253
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
where my dad was actually born right

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,360
with the entire family making sweets

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
rolling laddus flattening the buries um

256
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
and and I have some pictures from that

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,120
time I'll send them to

258
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,839
Uh but that's how he built a small mitai

259
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
dukan called lovely sweets. The reason

260
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,560
he called it lovely is also very

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,240
interesting actually he called it lovely

262
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,360
because that was perhaps the only

263
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,240
English word or an English adjective

264
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
that he knew. Okay. Right. The rest of

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
the sweet shops at that time if you you

266
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
know go back in that time were all

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,200
gassar or hiram or you know one of those

268
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
more traditional sounding Indian names.

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,279
He wanted to be ahead of his time.

270
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Aspirational. Aspirational. And so he

271
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,360
named it lovely. And and that sweet shop

272
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,480
became a hot favorite of the people

273
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,640
living in the 5 mile radius. Right. That

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,640
area was called Jalander Cantonement. By

275
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,480
the way, I still live there in that same

276
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
house. That shop that my grandfather

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
started still exists and we still go

278
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,519
there almost every day to go for some

279
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,680
mosas in the morning and rasala in the

280
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,040
evening. you know uh next time you come

281
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
to Jalanda I'm going to take you there

282
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,720
100%.

283
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,760
U and you know one shop led to another

284
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,320
shop, one brand led to another brand. Uh

285
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,880
and eventually his business grew, right?

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,040
He was able to start a much larger store

287
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,000
which again runs to this day. It's

288
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,480
almost a one lakh square foot store,

289
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,279
right? It's a one lakh square foot

290
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,120
candyland, right? It's beautiful. Um he

291
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,959
built it with his own two hands. My

292
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
father and his two elder brothers, they

293
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,000
all worked there as they were growing

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,279
up. Um and that's where I think

295
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,680
entrepreneurship was sort of instilled

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
in our family, right? Uh I remember even

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,720
as I was growing up and and you know my

298
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,680
dad used to uh be in that sweet shop uh

299
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,279
I used to sit on the counter counting

300
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
money right giving change to people and

301
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
I started learning I think business at

302
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
that age right at least starting to

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
understand the concept of profit and

304
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,720
mafa and all of that. Um so that's the

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
story of my grandfather. uh he passed

306
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
away just around the time when I was

307
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
about to go to high school and so I

308
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
didn't get a lot of time to speak to him

309
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,519
deeply about his business and about his

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
life but all the stories that I'm told

311
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,760
by my parents uh he was an awesome man

312
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,880
honestly like as a refugee to start from

313
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,200
scratch right right from Stelling Chai

314
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,279
to building a what I would call like at

315
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
least a mitai conglomerate at least in

316
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,320
that region a local conglomerate if I

317
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,959
can um and that gave wings to my dad uh

318
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,399
to the rest of my family to me. Um, and

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,160
that's why I'm stand sitting here with

320
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
you today. It's very easy for you to say

321
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,959
that, you know, that's how he built it.

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
Now, I want to go slightly deeper

323
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,720
because I know that there are more

324
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,399
stories to that man, right? Because

325
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
there are so many sweet stop there are

326
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
so many sweet shops out there. Pratam,

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
not all of those sweet shops become as

328
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
big as lovely sweets. So, can you please

329
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
take me a little deeper and talk to me

330
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,040
about three or four attributes of your

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,560
grandfather that turned him into who he

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,120
was? Because going from selling chai

333
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,920
biscuit then to sweets and then turning

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
that into a mitai conglomerate mitai

335
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,560
conglomerate conglomerate. Yeah, that

336
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
was tough for me

337
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,200
too. And this is something that gets and

338
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,680
I'll tell you why am I asking this

339
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,240
question because right now I know for a

340
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,079
fact that not a lot of parents can teach

341
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,680
people how to do business because they

342
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,800
don't come from a business background.

343
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
But the one thing that they can

344
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,959
inculcate are the values that get passed

345
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
on from one generation to the other that

346
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,720
make the next generation more

347
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
successful. So and your father is

348
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,720
incredibly successful. So talk to me

349
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,399
about what are those four or five values

350
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
that your grandfather has passed down

351
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,200
the generation which makes you guys such

352
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,160
incredible entrepreneurs. I think the

353
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,920
first thing is strategy, right? And this

354
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
is a story my dad tells me about one of

355
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,959
the early strategies that my granddad

356
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,760
deployed to bring in more customers into

357
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,800
the store. So what he would do is he

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,079
would sell samosas in the morning at a

359
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,079
huge loss loss. At a loss if the samosa

360
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,880
costed him let's say one rupee he would

361
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
sell it for 50 pesa. What that would do

362
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,480
is that would bring the customers inside

363
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,480
the store.

364
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,839
And if people get inside the store and

365
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,600
they look at the mitai and they smell

366
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,199
the aroma

367
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,440
automatically, right? And because of

368
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,199
that people people would come in to buy

369
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,760
the samosa, but they would buy maybe

370
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,160
three four other products which probably

371
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,760
were at a 50 60 70% gross margin. Wow.

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,600
So on the cart level, he made a profit.

373
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,440
And loss leader strategy. Correct. There

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,880
you go. Right. So he deployed that

375
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,279
without having an MBA very early on and

376
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,120
that really became the reason that that

377
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,760
first store became successful. It always

378
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
would have a line outside. Wow. Which is

379
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
so interesting. I'll give you another

380
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,519
strategy that he deployed. If you

381
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,120
remember even today when you go out into

382
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,680
the market and you look at a sweet shop,

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,320
it will always have

384
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,279
u no doors, right? The sweets will

385
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,160
literally be kept on the street, right?

386
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,399
And all the dust etc is all going onto

387
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,800
those laddus. We have all seen that and

388
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,560
that exists till today. At that time in

389
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,040
the 60s when he was building the store

390
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,040
he decided to build it as a closed store

391
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,519
right with proper doors right with

392
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,920
proper at that time perhaps fans inside

393
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,839
to make sure that the product remains

394
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,240
clean and away from the dust. Now it's a

395
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,240
very small thing but even till today

396
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,760
mitai wallas make that mistake of

397
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,320
keeping their mitai out in the open on

398
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
the street. Yeah. So that's so strategy

399
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
is something you know thinking beyond

400
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,399
his own time is something that was very

401
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,560
interesting about him. I think one very

402
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,959
core value that he instilled in my dad

403
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,360
passed down to me is frugality always do

404
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,360
more with less right. So if you have to

405
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
let's say create a counter for your

406
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,920
sweet shop right rather than buying it

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
from the market go to the carpenter

408
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,160
yourself and actually construct it in

409
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,560
front of you right so just pay for the

410
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
basic wood etc make it right there and

411
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,759
buy it rather than paying some retailer

412
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,120
who's taking a commission and then the

413
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,279
distributor is taking a commission all

414
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,240
of that um I think frugality is

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,720
something that has been at the core and

416
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,639
been a very important reason for our

417
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,360
success I think the third thing is

418
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,600
taking your team along, right? So the

419
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,759
people whom my granddad worked with in

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,160
the 60s, you wouldn't believe they still

421
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,480
work with us today, right? He has taken

422
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,839
care of them beyond work, right? He's

423
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
involved in their families. They are

424
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,000
involved in our families. We go to their

425
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,839
children's weddings and birthdays and

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,959
they come to our weddings and birthdays.

427
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,079
So taking the team along really creates

428
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,800
this this almost family-like attitude in

429
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,399
the team, right? So everyone is ready to

430
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,720
give their 100%. I remember when my

431
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,040
granddad passed away, right? There were

432
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
less family

433
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,759
members. There were more people that he

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
used to work with. His employees had

435
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,639
come and they were at the front and

436
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
center. They were the ones carrying the

437
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,440
ais. They were the ones leading the

438
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,800
charge, right? And and I think that

439
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,639
really changes the culture of the

440
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,839
organization at the end of the day

441
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,600
especially for an education institution

442
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,279
or even a mitigan which is a service

443
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,839
business. Uh people is what matters.

444
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,240
True. True. So you're saying strategy,

445
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
frugality and team and team taking the

446
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
team together like really making them

447
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,959
part of the business making them feel

448
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
like part of the business and no amount

449
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,959
of esops can do that right it's the

450
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,120
smaller things you do for your team and

451
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,559
for their family most importantly that

452
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,799
talk to me about these smaller things

453
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,559
pratam

454
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,480
because I know for a fact that if

455
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,000
somebody's treated like family because

456
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,919
in business there is a slight conflict

457
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
of interest you can either build a

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,959
family or you can build a sports team or

459
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,640
you can build a sports team and then

460
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
treat them like family but But if you do

461
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
the opposite, then it's going to be a

462
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
problem. If you treat people like family

463
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
and then you remove and add people on

464
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
the basis of merit, it becomes a

465
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,799
problem. But if you only have people on

466
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,320
the basis of merit and they're doing

467
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,080
insanely well and then you build that

468
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,960
family connection, it makes a huge

469
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,960
difference, right? Talk to me about how

470
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,039
do you do the small things to make sure

471
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,360
that your team stays together and how do

472
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,480
you do the hard things when things go

473
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,960
south? Yeah. No, I think merit is

474
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
important, right? But I think merit can

475
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,919
also be created. So like for example,

476
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll give you the story of my dad and

477
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,840
one of his team members. He was not

478
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,200
performing very well, right? He was a

479
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,480
CXO but not performing very well. Now as

480
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
per the going corporate theory, uh he

481
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,440
should be given feedback once or twice.

482
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,120
If he doesn't respond then he should be

483
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
asked to leave. Essentially that's what

484
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,840
most corporates would do. I think the

485
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,240
culture in our system is that give them

486
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,960
one chance, sit with them, give them

487
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,160
another chance, train them, still not

488
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,400
learning, send them for an executive MBA

489
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,320
program, invest in them, right? And

490
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
really speak to them, not at the

491
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,919
corporate level, but at an emotional

492
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,520
level. Say, "Bai, I want to work with

493
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,360
you. You have been a very important part

494
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
of this journey, but you're not growing

495
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,200
as fast as the organization is." Right?

496
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,000
So, you need to change these five things

497
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,000
about yourself. And if you do it then

498
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
I'll take you along otherwise I'll have

499
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
to leave you behind. Right? If you have

500
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
a conversation like

501
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,720
this, I think if you have a conversation

502
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
at that

503
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,679
level which maybe many MBAs also do not

504
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,360
teach, right, or recommend I think

505
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,520
something very beautiful can be created,

506
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,600
right? And it's a very interesting

507
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,520
assimilation, if I can use that word, of

508
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
a sports team, a family and a

509
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
meritocratic corporate system can all

510
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,559
come together. Why does it have to be

511
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
one or the other? Why can't it be all

512
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,919
three together? At the end of the day,

513
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
you know, if someone is connected to you

514
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,520
emotionally, that will add more value to

515
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,120
your organization than someone who's not

516
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,799
connected to you emotionally but is very

517
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,400
good at his job or her job, right?

518
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
Longevity is also super important. You

519
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
can be you like for example, I have some

520
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
team members who have been with me for

521
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,559
2, three, four years now. If I don't

522
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,440
treat them like family and if I don't

523
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,720
build that sports team also after three

524
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,240
four years if someone offers them a

525
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,200
better salary they will go right uh but

526
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
them staying with me compounds what they

527
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
can do for me over a period of time

528
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,080
right so the value of compounding is a

529
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,240
lot more than at times the value of

530
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,960
someone's merit in that moment does that

531
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,480
make sense that makes a lot of sense now

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,280
I want you to give out a message to

533
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,480
these people who are being treated like

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,919
family within in the organization

535
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,760
because you know I've seen I've spoken

536
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,600
to a few people again at the gym only

537
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,440
somehow happen to I happen to have these

538
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,280
conversations at the gym where people

539
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
say you know what um and this is

540
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,880
something that is largely coming because

541
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,880
of the IT culture what happens is

542
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,440
that growing very very fast you're

543
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
riding the wave right but the thing with

544
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,799
compounding is that for the first three

545
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,320
years it doesn't show up. It's only

546
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,559
after the fourth year or the fifth year,

547
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
after 10 years in fact, you see you you

548
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,480
start to see it and then after 10 years

549
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,559
the compounding is evident enough for

550
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
you to witness it, peel it and then

551
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,159
showcase it to other people in your

552
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,919
society as

553
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,080
well. But what I find very strange about

554
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,880
this generation particularly is that we

555
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,480
are a hop skip and jump generation. We

556
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
want to ride a boat and considering

557
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,720
there are so many startups out there. A

558
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
lot of these startups will tomorrow go

559
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,240
on to become legendary companies and

560
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
they're going to grow very very fast as

561
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,039
compared to the companies that their

562
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,320
fathers worked at. How would you ask a

563
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,559
young executive to look at that company

564
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,159
and assess this compounding and check if

565
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,720
this organization is going to compound

566
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,640
or not? If yes, I will stay with

567
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,039
persistence. If not, then I can hop,

568
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
skip and jump. Just look at the seniors

569
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,080
who are working in the organization.

570
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
People you're reporting into their job,

571
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,320
their bosses, their bosses, the CEO

572
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,880
himself and see how long they have been

573
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,720
working with that organization. If if

574
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,919
there's a culture of longlasting

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
relationships with that organization

576
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
where people stay for a long period of

577
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,520
time, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, then

578
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,000
you can feel comfortable with the fact

579
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,880
that this organization invests in people

580
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,200
and doesn't use people transactionally,

581
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
right? So just look at go to LinkedIn,

582
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,039
right, of that organization. see what

583
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,520
the average tenure of people is. If it's

584
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,120
1, two years and there's huge turnover,

585
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
then that organization still has some

586
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,799
distance to cover in terms of building

587
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,000
their culture. But if people have been

588
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,360
there for 10, 15, 20

589
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,360
years, then I think you can take comfort

590
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,760
in that. However, if the organization is

591
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
only 5 years old, if the organization is

592
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,039
only 2 years old, it's a startup, it

593
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,280
doesn't have any history, then I think

594
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,520
you have to really look into the eyes of

595
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,320
the promoter, the founder, the CEO, the

596
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,039
leadership team, and try to really read

597
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,520
their eyes to see whether this person

598
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,520
will invest in me or not, right? Whether

599
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
this person only needs me for what I can

600
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,159
provide him today or whether this person

601
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,120
looks at me as an asset that he can keep

602
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,640
investing in and growing and eventually

603
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
that person only will reap the benefits

604
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
of the compounding right and and there

605
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
has to be some amount of gut feeling

606
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
that you'll have to go with right there

607
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,880
is no science to it people can fake

608
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
these things also but I think if you can

609
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
just look into the eyes and even ask

610
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,559
this question in the interview that hey

611
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,000
um Ganesh like will you invest in me

612
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,159
what will you do to make sure that I

613
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
grow with you? Ask these kind of

614
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
questions in the interview and see

615
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,240
whether the founder is stumped or

616
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,360
whether he has a plan for

617
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,760
you. You'll have your answer. Now talk

618
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
to me about it from the founders's

619
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,720
perspective because as a founder when I

620
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,799
look at people there are some people

621
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
that I know for sure that these are the

622
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,159
people who are going to stick with me

623
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,400
for the next 5 years and these are the

624
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
people with whom I can build very large

625
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
businesses if not very large highly

626
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,280
impactful businesses. But then there are

627
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,480
some people who are underdogs who don't

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
seem like they're going to do something

629
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,840
really really extraordinary. And over

630
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,840
the years I realized that you know these

631
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,760
are insane people who can go on to do

632
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,600
something extraordinary. But as a

633
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,120
founder how how quickly can I identify

634
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
this? And I'll also tell you why am I

635
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,080
asking you this question. That is

636
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,520
because your grandfather has done it.

637
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,840
Your father has done it and I've seen

638
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,679
you do it with your team. So how do you

639
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
pick your battles? because there will

640
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,200
always be someone in the organization

641
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,679
and this is something that we don't want

642
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,000
it to be but there will always be some

643
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
people in the organization 50% of the

644
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
organization that I would consider who

645
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,799
are here to hop skip and jump only but

646
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,200
it's only that 10% who are people who

647
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,559
could be consistent compounders so how

648
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
do you identify these consistent

649
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,000
compounders in your team I have a

650
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
slightly different answer to this

651
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,039
question my Hindi teacher in my school

652
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,039
used to say this

653
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,240
and this is what I believe about teams

654
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,400
as well. I think if someone's joined

655
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,000
your company, they've not joined that

656
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,480
company to leave that company, right?

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
They've joined it maybe to hop, skip and

658
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
jump. But if they are able to build a

659
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
good career there, then they will not

660
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,880
hop, skip, and jump, right? So people

661
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,320
are coming in with good intention.

662
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
They're joining you with good intention,

663
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,080
right? They have the potential also

664
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
because you saw something in them. Now

665
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,480
it's up to the founder that what you do

666
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
with that kachimiti. If someone is

667
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,640
leaving in one two three years and not

668
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,640
staying long then founder has to look

669
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,080
into the company's culture and look

670
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,520
within himself to see right and whether

671
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,200
he's doing enough to invest in people or

672
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,919
not whether his temper is maybe pushing

673
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,240
people away whether you know the

674
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,000
policies are not good enough whether the

675
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,919
company is just not growing right

676
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,600
generally I don't think that you can

677
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,919
find a fault with a team

678
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,320
member I think the fault will always lie

679
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
in the person who has the role which is

680
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,400
the founder which is the leader right so

681
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
as founders and as leaders we have to

682
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
make sure that we are doing enough for

683
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,360
the team we are investing in them we're

684
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,840
giving the right culture that they stay

685
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,320
for long and if you make that culture

686
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,000
people will stay 5 10 15 20 30 years I

687
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,240
mean look at tatas look at beras right

688
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,760
like 30 40 year people have been working

689
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,679
right and and that's only when

690
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,159
compounding kicks in after 10 years so

691
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,000
founders also by the way you know it

692
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,640
happened with me also someone is not

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
performing for 6

694
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,279
months I've and paying this guy, he's

695
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,720
not performing, he's not growing. You

696
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,640
get frustrated, you start screaming at

697
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,120
him, you start shouting at them. I have

698
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,120
done this. I still do this. But that's a

699
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
recipe for disaster. I think you have to

700
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,600
sit back, understand where that person

701
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,159
is coming from. Why is he or she not

702
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,880
able to perform and then find that fix

703
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,039
with them, counsel them and then grow

704
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
with them. You will not be able to solve

705
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,559
10 on 10 times, but at least I think

706
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,400
your success rate will increase. people

707
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,799
will stay longer. Compounding will kick

708
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,320
in. Your business will experience a lot

709
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,080
of growth because of that compounding.

710
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,559
Right? So even if you have to have

711
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,000
patience for six, eight months and let

712
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
somebody grow through those six 8

713
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,840
months, have that patience. Don't be in

714
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
a hurry to just throw somebody out

715
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,120
because two quarters they were not able

716
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
to perform. Got it. But do you think

717
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,480
this also applies to large companies

718
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,240
like TCS where the job is boring? there

719
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,080
is no compounding and there is no

720
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,360
opportunity for everybody to compound

721
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,320
with the company because there is no

722
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,400
compounding growth as well. I think a

723
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,919
lot of times people stay in a company

724
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
not because they find the work very

725
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,080
interesting but sometimes they stay

726
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,919
there because they find the people very

727
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,799
interesting or the boss very inspiring

728
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
or the mission very inspiring right so

729
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,440
sometimes it's not about what you're

730
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
doing 9 to5 you are only in a job from 9

731
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,039
to5 right let's call a corporate job 9

732
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,400
to5 there is still 16 more hours in the

733
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,480
day and they're also dictating your

734
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
decisions right so let's say the job is

735
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
very boring you're sitting in front of a

736
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,880
computer doing the same again and again

737
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,559
and again and again. But let's say it

738
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,480
pays you really well. There's a reason

739
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,400
for you to stay, right? The job is

740
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,400
really bad, but the founder and the

741
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,760
mission of the founder is so inspiring

742
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,600
that you're ready to go through that

743
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
grind. You'll stay for that reason,

744
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,440
right? So there are a lot of reasons

745
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,400
beyond just the quality of work that

746
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,760
people stay

747
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,880
TC. So right like I think you know TCS,

748
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,159
Infosys, HCL, uh there's very high

749
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
turnover there, right? I understand that

750
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,640
that's also the nature of the job.

751
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,799
However, if you were to talk to the

752
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,799
founder, the CEO of TCS, they will tell

753
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,799
you, boss, we don't like this turnover.

754
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,400
You know, give us ideas on how we can

755
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,360
improve the working conditions, how we

756
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,440
can improve the incentives, how we can

757
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,240
improve the culture of the organization

758
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,159
that this reduces. Even they would love

759
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,600
for that to be the case. Um, I think in

760
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,120
TCS for example, I've been to their

761
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,799
campuses. They have the most beautiful

762
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,159
campuses. I went to Cognizant's office

763
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,960
in Chennai. I don't know if you've been

764
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,880
there, right? It's like I mean beyond

765
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,880
the office it's it's it's amazing. They

766
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,880
have like amazing dining rooms and uh

767
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
sporting infrastructure and like trees

768
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,919
and gardens and all of that and I would

769
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,399
love to just spend time there for that

770
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,320
reason. Um you also have to understand

771
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,039
one more thing right this what is my

772
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,520
best alternative what is my batner there

773
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,520
at the end of the day right if I as an

774
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,440
as a team member feel that okay TCS is

775
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,799
giving me this ladder it's giving me

776
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,080
this culture and I'm enjoying this

777
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,480
they're taking care of my family they're

778
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,640
giving me insurance um you know when

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,039
when my mother was not well my boss

780
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,799
actually came in uh and and helped me

781
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,279
through it gave me a shoulder to cry on

782
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,919
all of that I think people will stay so

783
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,440
you're saying it's the key is leadership

784
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,039
it's leadership ship culture. I think

785
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,360
all of those things sometimes matter

786
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,240
even more than the quality of work,

787
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,120
right? Like I mean people at TCS and

788
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,120
people at Google like their work is not

789
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,720
all that different. They are both

790
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,960
sitting in front of a computer. They're

791
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
both coding away on problems, right? But

792
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,080
it's the culture that is different,

793
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,000
right? It is the way the organization is

794
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
investing in you that is different. And

795
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
that is the reason people are staying

796
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,279
longer at Google and perhaps not so long

797
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,840
at TCS. Most people think Google is all

798
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,600
fancy work while it is not. you you'll

799
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
have to be there only only what two or

800
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
three lakh people would have worked in

801
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,880
Google so they have the right to say

802
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,559
that I haven't I don't know if you have

803
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
ever I've seen I have friends who work

804
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,679
at Google and they tell me that yeah

805
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,440
it's just like a normal job like you see

806
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,200
a lot of fancy stuff on YouTube but

807
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
that's reserved only for a certain

808
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,640
category of people otherwise even in

809
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,080
fact they also have to do boring work we

810
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
also have to do boring work but it's

811
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,399
that 10 20% that gets very very exciting

812
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,600
wonderful I have understood a few things

813
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,399
I would just like to summarize this

814
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,760
section quickly that is your grandfather

815
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,200
your grandfather father had a very

816
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
humble beginning where he went from

817
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,799
Mulan to Punjab and he became a

818
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,399
chaiwalla and from chivalala um he also

819
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,840
went on to sell biscuits and when he

820
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,520
sold both of them he realized that I'm

821
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,399
just a trader over here but I could make

822
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,399
a lot more money if I could if I could

823
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,440
use value addition to sell sweets that

824
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,440
is because the cost difference between

825
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,480
getting raw material for sweets and

826
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,080
selling them at the cost price sorry

827
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,840
getting raw material for sweets and then

828
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
selling them in the market results into

829
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,640
much higher gross margins as compared to

830
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,399
just selling chai and parli and the

831
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,320
margins as you mentioned go from

832
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,679
anywhere between from 5 to 10% while

833
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,360
selling chai and biscuits all the way up

834
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,360
to 70 80% in some cases for sweets and

835
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,240
then you spoke about the name lovely

836
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,000
sweets the lovely word which today's

837
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
sounds pretty strange but back then it

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,960
was used because back then all the other

839
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,760
businesses had names like gasita and

840
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,480
haldi ram and great names by the way he

841
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,080
decided to keep lovely because he saw

842
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,159
that lovely was the only English word

843
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,679
that he knew and he also felt like

844
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
because it's an English word people

845
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,960
would find it aspirational and you and

846
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,039
then you spoke about the loss leader

847
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,799
strategy that he deployed to sell

848
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,720
samosas at a loss eventually to make

849
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
money with sweets and then when we spoke

850
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
about your grandfather's greatest

851
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,080
attributes which turned him into such a

852
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,159
wonderful and successful entrepreneur

853
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
you mentioned three attributes strategy

854
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,399
frugality and team when it comes to

855
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,679
strategy like loss leader strategy he

856
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,880
would think ahead of the curve to

857
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,799
understand how can I do better to build

858
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,039
better systems, better strategies to

859
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,640
grow my business. Eventually, he became

860
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
successful. And this is something, by

861
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
the way, not a lot of people think. Um,

862
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,960
I see a lot of these sweet shops, they

863
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
function exactly the way other sweet

864
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,480
shops function. They function exactly

865
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,240
the way other sweet shops function. They

866
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,760
have a standard SOP and they're happy

867
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,559
wherever they are. Nothing wrong with

868
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,679
that. But that also says that if a

869
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,559
lovely sweets could go from a refugee to

870
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,600
becoming a very successful

871
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,760
entrepreneur so can every other sweet

872
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,440
shop especially in Mumbai. Then you

873
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,039
spoke about frugality. An example of

874
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,559
that would be instead of going to the

875
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,480
market and getting the furniture he

876
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,559
would just go to the carpenter sit down

877
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,240
with them make the furniture himself and

878
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,880
then get it because of which he can save

879
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,360
cost eventually resulting into same

880
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
output but at less cost. And then you

881
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,399
spoke about team where you mentioned

882
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,240
that if somebody's not performing well

883
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,320
first of all build a sports team and

884
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,399
treat them like a family and if they're

885
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,559
not performing well talk to them train

886
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,480
them educate them talk to them

887
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,919
emotionally to understand what exactly

888
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,519
is the problem because talk to them as a

889
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,000
human being talk to them as not as a

890
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,120
resource you know not as a resource so

891
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,880
that and so that people understand that

892
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,480
you really want to invest in them and

893
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
after you've given them all the chances

894
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,919
in the world then you can let them go if

895
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,799
they don't perform beyond that because

896
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,080
that's how businesses can evolve and

897
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,919
then you spoke about the three

898
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,279
attributes that can turn a work

899
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,799
environment into a healthy work

900
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,799
environment even if the job is boring

901
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,399
which is great leadership great culture

902
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,480
and a mission statement that can inspire

903
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,919
other people absolutely does that sum up

904
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,000
our first segment that's amazing thank

905
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,679
you great let's move on to the second

906
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
segment and here's where I want to talk

907
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,519
to you about your audacious vision of

908
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,600
masters

909
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,399
union I must tell you that dreaming big

910
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,240
is a very very big deal And I'm saying

911
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,240
this because every now and then I get

912
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,919
asked what what do I want to do 5 years

913
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,320
down the line, 10 years down the line.

914
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,440
Um, and I often have dreams that are

915
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,240
quite calculative and they're not so big

916
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,240
that they scare me. But then when I saw

917
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
you in fact Shashank told me this

918
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:39,120
that top 10 business school which is a

919
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,919
very big deal man. So I first want to

920
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,519
understand what exactly is this insane

921
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,360
driving force within you the

922
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,200
purpose as to why are you doing what are

923
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,200
you

924
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,480
doing? You know currently there are two

925
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,240
reasons right one is the fact that India

926
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,120
is home to 1.5 billion people right from

927
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,799
the world however we have absolutely no

928
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,399
universities absolutely no universities

929
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,359
in the top 10 top 50 and by some measure

930
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,520
even the top 100 right ranks across the

931
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,960
world the top 10 ranks are still

932
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,879
belonging to your Harvard Wharton

933
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,919
Stanford Yale Stern Sloan right those

934
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,520
same top 10 top 20 top have been ruling

935
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,679
the education world for the longest

936
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,800
time. India has not made its presence

937
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,320
felt and I really feel that I owe it to

938
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,240
India right and India deserves a top 10

939
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,480
position a top 20 position in the

940
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,480
education rankings why can't we be right

941
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,639
next to Harvard Wart and Stanford that's

942
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,480
really the main driving force that I

943
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,040
have at least to build masters union

944
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,879
right um and you know India deserves to

945
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,599
be in the top 10 because most of the

946
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,200
professors in the US not most many are

947
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,839
actually Indians themselves right they

948
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,159
are products of India so why not an

949
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,839
Indian university also in the top 10 and

950
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,280
I'll tell you why this is important

951
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,280
because we don't have universities in

952
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,760
top 10 top 20 a lot of our brightest

953
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,760
right who graduate from IITs etc they

954
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,000
actually end up going abroad right and

955
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,680
we lose them forever right because when

956
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,160
they go for their MBA abroad or MS

957
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,160
abroad to an MIT or a Stanford these are

958
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,000
India's best they eventually end up

959
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,680
finding jobs there get green cards there

960
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,040
and continue to live there of course

961
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,760
they send money back and that's great

962
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,599
for India but what would have been the

963
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
case had they just stayed in India had

964
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,280
India had its own top 10 ranked

965
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
institution that they could have

966
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
actually honed their skills there as

967
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,400
well right so I really feel that from

968
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,280
the perspective of keeping our talent in

969
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,200
India we need to have a top 10 top 20

970
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,520
institution from India does that make

971
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,119
sense that makes a lot of sense but tell

972
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,640
me something what exactly is preventing

973
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,640
the existing universities from becoming

974
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
the best they have the infrastructure

975
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,320
they have all the money in the world and

976
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,040
yet they're not becoming the best I so

977
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
in India if you see most of our top

978
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,200
universities that have all the money are

979
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
all public right they're run by the

980
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,079
government they're run by the

981
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,320
bureaucracy they're run by the system

982
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,880
right and not by a private individual or

983
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,240
private individuals or by a private

984
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,680
board as soon as you have a university

985
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,280
that's run by a private board you see

986
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,440
something like Bits Pilani coming up and

987
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,880
really growing uh you see like something

988
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,119
like Manipal coming up and really

989
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,720
growing right so if you have more

990
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,040
universities that are run privately

991
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,160
outside of the government system they

992
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,680
have their own funding they have their

993
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,839
own policies they have their own board

994
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,320
of governors and they don't have to wait

995
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,920
for approvals from the bureaucracy right

996
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,240
so in IIT today if you want to build a

997
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,000
lab right you first have to make a

998
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
proposal that will go to the department

999
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
the department will send it to the

1000
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,320
central team the central team will send

1001
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,000
it to the board the board will send it

1002
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,680
to the central IT council then central

1003
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
IT council will send it to the education

1004
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,640
ministry the education ministry will

1005
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,160
send it to the cabinet the cabinet will

1006
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
then approve it then if it's a larger

1007
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,640
one then you'll have to wait for the

1008
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
budget to come in and then the budget

1009
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
will get passed past you know how much

1010
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,400
time it may take just to get the budget

1011
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,640
passed for a lab 1 year 2 years 3 years

1012
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,720
4 years a long period of time but when

1013
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,160
you have a private body right and I'm

1014
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,240
not saying for-profit I'm saying a

1015
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,760
private body a private trust running an

1016
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,119
institution something like a bitsani or

1017
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,560
a manipal dare I say mast's

1018
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,240
union I think things will become a lot

1019
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,079
easier for these innovations to come in

1020
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,359
if you look at the US the top 10 let's

1021
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,040
count Harvard private MIT private

1022
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,920
Stanford private university of

1023
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,599
Pennsylvania private Dartmouth private

1024
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,520
right they're all privately run there's

1025
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,119
a reason for that in fact the highest

1026
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,200
ranked governmentr run university in the

1027
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
US is probably ranked 21st which is

1028
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,320
University of California Berkeley right

1029
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,160
so the top 20 are all private so in

1030
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,040
India we need more private universities

1031
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,359
to come in have the right intent right

1032
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,240
be run completely not for profofit and

1033
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,760
then you'll start seeing some Indian

1034
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,839
universities starting to get into the

1035
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,359
top 10 top 20 right so the biggest

1036
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,640
reason is most of our universities are

1037
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,720
run by the

1038
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,800
And just by nature of the government, it

1039
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,440
takes time for budgets to get passed,

1040
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,400
for innovations to be delivered. Bro, I

1041
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,160
studied from a private college. It was a

1042
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,960
terrible college. Teachers were

1043
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,560
incompetent. They couldn't teach

1044
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,760
properly. Textbooks were outdated and we

1045
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,480
were associated with the Pune

1046
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,480
University. Yeah. You were affiliated

1047
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,480
college university.

1048
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,200
Why?

1049
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Because they had to follow certain norms

1050
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,920
of the university. In fact, I also spoke

1051
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,400
to a school in Delhi and they also said

1052
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:34,480
that I'm KPI

1053
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,480
match 75% attendance

1054
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,359
college

1055
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,359
again I'll have to confirm.

1056
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,359
But you need a

1057
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,359
PhD. PhD in India is useless. Most

1058
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,880
people know that only a handful of PhDs

1059
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
are somebody who actually end up doing

1060
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,920
something really crazy. PhD is just a

1061
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
stamp in India. PhD is just a bloody

1062
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,480
stamp and there also there is so much

1063
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,720
politics that your guide may steal your

1064
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,040
idea. Yeah, we have all heard those

1065
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,200
stories. And publish it and your hard

1066
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,440
work goes to the drain. Sometimes you

1067
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,280
could be a brilliant student of PhD and

1068
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
your guide may not approve it simply

1069
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,440
because that person does not like you.

1070
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,280
In this kind of a system if you're

1071
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
producing PhDs and then we're putting

1072
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,960
these PhDs as professors in these

1073
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,440
private colleges who are then affiliated

1074
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,480
to the university, it becomes a messed

1075
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
up system. Um so my question is now this

1076
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,160
is still fine. Now I know the reason

1077
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,400
behind why private universities why

1078
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,160
private um colleges working under

1079
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
universities do not function properly.

1080
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,960
That's because of the university norms.

1081
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,640
Because the university norms, the

1082
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,720
syllabus is decided by the university.

1083
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,119
The structure, the system, the policies

1084
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,800
are all decided by the university. The

1085
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,160
college is just a physical location

1086
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,560
where those services are delivered.

1087
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,960
Correct. The college promoters have

1088
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,320
absolutely no autonomy. Yeah. And then

1089
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,200
we come to private colleges who are not

1090
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,040
affiliated to a university. These are in

1091
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,400
deemed unities. These are called state

1092
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,640
private universities or deemed

1093
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,240
universities. Deemed universities which

1094
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,800
are very few. They're only 400 in India.

1095
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,320
400 to 500. These 400 universities do

1096
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,480
not produce the best talent in the

1097
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,320
world. But why is that? Is that because

1098
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,920
they optimize for profit? Because profit

1099
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,280
is still fine. Like I was just looking

1100
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,880
at the AIAS is 30 to 50%. They should be

1101
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,280
able to produce great talent, right? Why

1102
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,440
don't they produce great talent? So the

1103
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,320
thing is that it starts with a few

1104
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,160
things. Number one, availability of

1105
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,880
professors. You know how many Indians

1106
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,880
complete their PhD every year? No idea,

1107
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,040
bro. Just throw a guess. 10,000. It's a

1108
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,520
little bit more. It's around 20 25,000

1109
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,920
right of them who are actually doing it

1110
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,440
with proper research with proper intent

1111
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,800
probably 20% of that 3 4,000 right you

1112
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,560
know how many students are there in

1113
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,319
Indian colleges enrolled at any one

1114
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,400
point in time um I would speak for

1115
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,960
engineering somewhere around 10 to 13

1116
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,640
lakhs that's every year so that times

1117
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,200
four would be 40 45 lakhs but

1118
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,960
engineering is only 10% of the Indian

1119
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,960
students right so the total number of

1120
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,400
students enrolled in all colleges in

1121
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,640
India and all universities in India is

1122
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,960
approximately 4 crores 4 crores 40

1123
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,800
million 40 million it's 44 million I

1124
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,520
think almost now the data hasn't come in

1125
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,160
for this year

1126
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,720
now 20,000 or 30,000 new PhDs coming

1127
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,800
into the market for 4 cr people the

1128
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,560
total number of PhDs in India let's say

1129
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,960
you count that you know 20,000 people

1130
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,160
have graduated for the last 40 years

1131
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,880
that's what 8 lakh that's 8 lakh PhDs

1132
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,359
that means 8 lakh PhDs are teaching four

1133
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
cr students four cr students what's the

1134
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,560
ratio there the ratio is almost 1 is to

1135
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,800
5 50 is it a lot more doesn't make any

1136
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,800
sense 1 is to 50 yeah 1 is to 50 1 is to

1137
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,359
50 so when the student toteer ratio is

1138
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
only 1 is to 50 right what can you

1139
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,400
expect from the education system every

1140
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
teacher to every student that that to

1141
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,040
every teacher to every student and some

1142
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,560
of these teachers will not be good yeah

1143
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,839
competent or incompetent doesn't matter

1144
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,599
and we're assuming that all the teachers

1145
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,599
are still teaching right there are lots

1146
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,880
of assumptions there and we are assuming

1147
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,119
that they're teaching every term every

1148
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,000
semester that's also probably not true

1149
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,720
right they're probably teaching just

1150
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,800
once in a year so because of that I We

1151
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,760
don't have at the top enough teachers

1152
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,119
only to teach the kind of scale of

1153
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,359
students that we have in India. So

1154
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,240
that's problem number one. Right? Even

1155
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,000
if I as a college promoter have the

1156
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,319
right intent, I want to teach when I go

1157
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,480
into the market to get faculty, it is

1158
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,640
incredibly hard. That's number one.

1159
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
Number two, when I do get the faculty,

1160
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,200
the faculty is also product of a

1161
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,960
somewhat flawed system, right? And

1162
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,680
they're going to teach in the same way

1163
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,800
that they were taught, right? And the

1164
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,520
current UGC, AICT, Knack, NIRF. These

1165
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,920
are all bodies that govern universities

1166
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,079
today. There are almost if you can count

1167
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,800
almost 18 different bodies that have

1168
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,319
created policies that dictate how how a

1169
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,240
university will function. Why the hell

1170
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,079
do we have these boards? I mean over a

1171
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,160
period of time, India has had what 70 75

1172
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,920
years of independence and over this

1173
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,839
period of time every government with the

1174
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,400
right intent has come in with some new

1175
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,000
policies, right? and have it to to get

1176
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,480
those policies enforced. They've created

1177
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
new agencies and new bodies, right? Bro,

1178
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,839
I'll tell you what. These are all

1179
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,680
revenue streams. I'll tell you why. I've

1180
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,079
seen this practically, okay? And will

1181
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,079
confirm this.

1182
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,040
RT mission and vision of

1183
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,319
college mission or

1184
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,440
vision and I was the student who was a

1185
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,160
rebel right so they would say you know

1186
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,760
what you can take a leave sit at home

1187
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,839
get out of the college but just don't

1188
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,839
stay here when the knack team comes in

1189
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,599
So I think you know there is

1190
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,839
this understanding in the Indian

1191
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,599
population and it may be right also that

1192
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,079
colleges make a lot of money right and

1193
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,040
These promoters are only enriching

1194
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,040
themselves. And I'll tell you from the

1195
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,520
other side of the table that all

1196
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,440
colleges in India, all universities in

1197
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,359
India have to be not for-p profofit and

1198
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,359
they're audited almost as much as a

1199
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:36,720
public company is. Okay. Right. There is

1200
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,720
so much auditing that happens from all

1201
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,119
of these bodies that it's very hard for

1202
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,920
someone to steal money to steal students

1203
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,839
money. Right? Uh you know I think some

1204
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,200
movies or some instances or obviously

1205
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,079
students maybe have their reasons to

1206
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,160
believe that I'm sure.

1207
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,880
Yeah, that used to happen, right? The

1208
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,640
concept of donation today is very small

1209
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,400
and in very few colleges and that also

1210
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,880
is going very very fast, right? So for

1211
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,839
example, uh earlier if you needed an

1212
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,079
MBBS seat, you can easily donate your

1213
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,839
way into getting a seat, right? And

1214
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,119
there was so much corruption. But since

1215
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,000
this neat exam has come in, all of that

1216
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,480
has really reduced quite a bit quite

1217
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,800
it's not fully gone, right? maybe 5 10

1218
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,560
15% is still there but it's going very

1219
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,640
very fast and you know there's a very

1220
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,400
interesting story even that at Harvard

1221
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,160
and Watton and at all of these large

1222
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,319
universities in the US some of this

1223
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
gapla has happened yeah yeah there is a

1224
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,480
Netflix documentary on this by the way

1225
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,720
where some rich parents were able to get

1226
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,720
their kids into Harvard and Stanford

1227
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,599
through the sports teams route right

1228
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,760
so India but I think it's blown out of

1229
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,040
proportion a little

1230
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,480
bit all universities colleges are

1231
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,000
audited ed very very

1232
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,079
strictly and they're all technically not

1233
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,680
for profofits. Got it. So you're saying

1234
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,680
that the three reasons why this entire

1235
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
system is broken is because of lack of

1236
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,119
teachers. Lack of teachers. Um this

1237
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
university affiliation which brings in

1238
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,800
norms that do not dictate the quality of

1239
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,040
education but what is being taught and

1240
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,880
all the unnecessary specifications which

1241
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,520
which kind of paralyze the the and the

1242
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,760
which kind of paralyze the trustees or

1243
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,040
the management I would say. uh which

1244
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,880
prevents them from giving out great

1245
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,000
education and thirdly like you mentioned

1246
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,440
there is so much of auditing that

1247
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
happens about the smallest of things

1248
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,400
that it becomes quite difficult for them

1249
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,040
to focus on the real stuff which is

1250
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,800
great education. Great. Now tell me

1251
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,480
amidst all of this you are building a

1252
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,000
college. So first let's talk about the

1253
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,680
opportunity in the education space and

1254
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,240
then let's talk about masters union as a

1255
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,079
business because I know for a fact that

1256
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,680
education is still easier to give but

1257
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,280
then quality education with profit is

1258
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,960
something that's very difficult and

1259
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,359
you've over the period of time built a

1260
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,839
sustainable economic engine which is

1261
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,640
tapping onto this huge opportunity of

1262
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,040
education in India and you're revenue

1263
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,640
positive um and you are and you're able

1264
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,319
to make a profit out of it which is

1265
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,319
great which means that you can then

1266
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,880
reinvest that capital further and turn

1267
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,640
this into a large organization which

1268
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,240
gives out world-class education very

1269
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,720
very quickly which can then rank into

1270
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,640
hopefully a top 10 that's the so I'm

1271
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,119
trying to understand the economic engine

1272
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,280
that you're building through the lens of

1273
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,640
a

1274
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,400
capitalist and I want to start with the

1275
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,599
market opportunity let's start with the

1276
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,680
market opportunity of education in India

1277
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,000
um to be more specific the higher

1278
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,640
education space business education space

1279
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
yeah go let's start so first of all I'll

1280
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,240
start by saying that if you're looking

1281
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,319
to build a public company if you're

1282
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,520
looking to become a billionaire right

1283
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,680
and if you want to earn a lot of money

1284
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,920
and buy a jet education is not the right

1285
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,400
space for you acha okay it's not going

1286
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,280
to happen right because you have to run

1287
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,440
your institution as a not forprofit okay

1288
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,440
so that's at the base of the argument

1289
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,720
that if you want to become a billionaire

1290
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,480
I think there are many other industries

1291
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,680
that you should target in education you

1292
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,359
will not be able to become a billionaire

1293
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,240
you can't go public right that's number

1294
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,280
one however you can definitely create a

1295
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,079
longlasting evergreen green timeless

1296
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,040
institution that will survive centuries

1297
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,560
okay and self-sustaining completely now

1298
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,040
your question is what is the opportunity

1299
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,280
right in

1300
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,839
India people have no problem paying for

1301
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,640
an expensive educational program if that

1302
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,000
program gives the right

1303
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:22,920
outcomes right and if that program has

1304
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,839
the right quality okay and that is a

1305
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,599
huge opportunity for people so if you

1306
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,440
can create a good institution Even if

1307
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,920
you were to charge 10 lakhs, 20 lakhs,

1308
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,000
30 lakhs, 40 lakhs in fees and you're

1309
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,599
able to give commensurate value, you

1310
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
will be successful, right? Because India

1311
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,680
is an aspiring society. People want

1312
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,680
better than what they have today. People

1313
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,440
want growth and education is the only

1314
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,280
way to deliver that growth to people.

1315
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,559
Right? So people are ready to pay if

1316
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,880
you're able to give commensurate

1317
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,040
service. It is like saying that if you

1318
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,880
go to Agra and if there's a hotel there

1319
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,640
that is charging even 10 lakh rupees a

1320
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,200
night there will be takers for it

1321
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,640
because Agra is able to give that

1322
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,680
commensurate value to the people right

1323
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,200
or that hotel is able to give that

1324
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,400
commensurate value just to put it into

1325
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,319
numbers in terms of the return on

1326
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,880
investment if somebody puts in four lakh

1327
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,280
rupees into engineering they can

1328
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,599
literally graduate with a 4 lakh LPA

1329
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,520
package which gives them sustainably 4

1330
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,559
lakh rupees every single year similarly

1331
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,079
when it comes to business school you

1332
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,839
invest 30 lakh rupees the reason why it

1333
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,520
sounds very lucrative is because you can

1334
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,559
actually graduate with a 20 30 lakh

1335
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,400
rupee package. So you invest 30 lakh

1336
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,640
once and you keep getting 30 lakh again

1337
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
and again. So the equation becomes very

1338
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,000
lucrative for somebody to invest which

1339
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,599
is you know exactly. So it's like buying

1340
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,520
a house like you can't afford the house

1341
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,880
today but you can keep paying off your

1342
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,800
mortgage with the earnings over a period

1343
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
of time. So similarly with an education

1344
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,559
program with an MBA program for example

1345
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,319
you don't mind paying 30 lakhs by taking

1346
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,760
a loan because you know right that

1347
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,079
you'll be able to pay off that loan with

1348
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,000
the rent you receive from the job that

1349
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,680
you do over a period of time. However I

1350
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,119
will say one thing here that we should

1351
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,839
not look at education in just this ROI

1352
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,920
format. Okay. Right. Going to an

1353
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,319
institution adds a lot more value to you

1354
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,920
as an individual than just the job that

1355
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,760
it gets you at the end of the four

1356
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,559
years. I think that is very important to

1357
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,720
understand. Like for example, I met some

1358
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,280
of my best friends for life in college.

1359
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,760
There is no value to that, right? I

1360
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,200
became from a boy to a man in college.

1361
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,400
There is no value to that. There's no

1362
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,680
price to that. There's no price to that.

1363
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,200
Sorry. There's a lot of value to that.

1364
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:25,599
It's priceless, right? Um I in fact

1365
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,440
found my godfather in a swimming pool in

1366
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,119
my college. Right. Who's that godfather?

1367
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,200
Uh his name is Peter Blair. He's a

1368
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,800
professor at Harvard who I became

1369
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,359
friends with. He was a PhD student when

1370
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,040
I was in undergrad and he's from Bahamas

1371
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,200
and we just happened to be on the same

1372
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,800
end of the swimming pool at one time and

1373
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,040
we started a conversation about cricket

1374
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,800
about West Indies versus India and that

1375
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,200
conversation became a lifelong

1376
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,880
friendship and today you know I don't

1377
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,240
take any major decision in my life

1378
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,680
without talking to him and consulting

1379
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,760
with him right very priceless so you

1380
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,839
know college and those four years or

1381
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,400
those two years of MBA add a lot more

1382
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,079
value than just that job that it gets

1383
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,040
you a lot of people that start their

1384
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,160
companies while in college, right? And I

1385
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,400
mean, imagine the ROI if Mark Zuckerberg

1386
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,720
goes to calculate it, right? Like, okay,

1387
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,480
I gave Harvard

1388
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,800
$100,000 and now I've made what? 1

1389
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,480
trillion, right? There's no there's so

1390
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
sometimes you can't value it like that,

1391
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,520
but for most people, I understand that's

1392
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,640
how they think. So, let's go with that.

1393
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,040
Got it. So, the first point of

1394
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,960
opportunity is that it's a high ticket

1395
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,079
business which results into very high

1396
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,680
outcome. not so with the with with not a

1397
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,440
lot of difficulty you put four lakh

1398
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,920
rupees in for engineering it's not very

1399
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,680
difficult to get you a four lakh LPA job

1400
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,680
so that's the first opportunity which is

1401
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,480
high ticket high outcome resulting into

1402
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,160
high revenue high revenues now at with

1403
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,800
any like any other business at small

1404
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,640
scale you will not make any aida you

1405
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,760
will not make any margin but as you

1406
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,920
start hitting 1,000 2,000 10,000 40,000

1407
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,240
students that's when you'll start making

1408
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,640
some surplus which you can then start

1409
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,400
investing in more capital, more research

1410
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,480
equipment, more buildings, more sports

1411
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,800
infrastructure, etc., etc., right? And

1412
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,319
that's how the flywheel starts to run,

1413
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,640
that's how the business starts to sort

1414
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,119
of run by itself, right? Once you hit a

1415
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,880
certain amount of scale, so you'll see

1416
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,319
colleges in India that have achieved

1417
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,160
some scale, let's say a manipal, let's

1418
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,440
say a VIT, let's say an SRM, let's say

1419
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,000
an amity, right? We've heard all of

1420
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,839
these names. um they have achieved some

1421
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,920
scale of tens of thousands of students

1422
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,400
and they've reached a stage where every

1423
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,079
year they are able to plow back that

1424
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,280
profit into building new campuses and

1425
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,599
serving the nation even more and more

1426
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,480
and more. Got it. So it's a flywheel.

1427
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,160
It's a it's a flywheel driven by scale,

1428
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,680
right? Which compounds which compounds

1429
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,760
like anything, right? What would you

1430
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,680
define as a healthy scale? Like for a

1431
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,520
school I would say thousand students is

1432
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,280
a good skill where the flywheel can

1433
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,640
actually start for a college. What do

1434
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,240
you think is a good scale? because I'm

1435
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,400
I'm thinking about it from the lens of

1436
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,400
an entrepreneur who today wants to start

1437
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,559
a college. For example, if I'm thinking

1438
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,640
about starting a business school, what

1439
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,400
kind of scale should I aim to achieve in

1440
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,000
the next 5 years for the flywheel to get

1441
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,760
started? You know, u there's a very

1442
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,839
crude way of looking at this and I'll be

1443
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,640
a little capitalist about this. If

1444
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,520
you're trying to build a gradea

1445
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,920
institution, if you're trying to build

1446
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,359
an institution for the most aspirational

1447
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,800
of class, right? If you're trying to

1448
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,720
compete with Harvard, Watton, Stanford,

1449
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,880
if you want to build the top 10, you

1450
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,480
cannot build it at a very large scale.

1451
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,920
Right? I don't think I can run masters

1452
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,160
union. If masters union had more than a

1453
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,200
thousand students, I think I will fail

1454
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,680
miserably at my quest. Right? So if

1455
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,960
you're looking to build a grade

1456
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,880
institution, a thousand kids is also

1457
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,240
stretching it. like one of India's top

1458
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,599
business schools or I think all of

1459
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,520
India's top business schools I am

1460
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,000
Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata ISB are

1461
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,240
all sub 1,000 because they know that as

1462
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,240
soon as they cross 1,000 or more or

1463
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,720
beyond they will not be able to deliver

1464
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,880
the quality that they per batch total

1465
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,400
total total okay right because that's

1466
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,839
the amount of faculty you'll be able to

1467
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,160
get that's the amount of services you'll

1468
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,480
be able to give them etc etc however if

1469
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,480
you're trying to educate the masses

1470
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,240
right if your fee structure is low

1471
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,280
around four five lakh Right? And you're

1472
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,079
trying to educate the masses and you're

1473
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,920
not really going after the top 10 ranks,

1474
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,559
right? And a little bit more modest in

1475
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,000
your aspiration, then you can go up to

1476
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:18,160
10,000 students also. But with 10,000

1477
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,520
students to get into top 10 will be

1478
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,599
tough. It will take you a long period of

1479
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,000
time. It is achievable definitely, but

1480
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,400
it will take you a very long time.

1481
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Right? Harvard business school which is

1482
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,160
the number one business school till

1483
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,160
today has less than a thousand kids in

1484
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,680
every batch. in every batch. In every

1485
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,079
batch. So in total they have maybe 2,000

1486
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,440
students. Got it.

1487
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,720
Most other schools and that's probably

1488
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,480
the largest business school. Most other

1489
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,640
schools are smaller than that. However,

1490
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,319
if you look at now let's say and I'm

1491
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,079
sorry that I'm using the word grade B

1492
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,720
but I just mean more universities that

1493
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,400
target masses like Ohio State in the US

1494
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,000
or let's say like a um Amit or VIT in

1495
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,359
India that is targeting slightly a

1496
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,359
larger crowd there 10,000 20,000 30,000

1497
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,559
and if you are building good processes

1498
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,559
systems SOPs software then you can even

1499
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,559
push to 40 45,000 the largest university

1500
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,839
in India in one campus would probably

1501
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,400
have 40 45,000 students perfect Right?

1502
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,800
So flywheel is very difficult to build

1503
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,800
but once you build it compounds for

1504
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,880
grade A college you should not go beyond

1505
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,839
1,000. So the aim should be th000 which

1506
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,200
is significantly less but it's good

1507
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,200
considering the fact that it is at least

1508
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,119
insight and then if you want to build

1509
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,119
let's say a tier 2 college then you can

1510
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,640
aim for a scale of about 45. Tier 2 is

1511
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,160
not bad. Let's not use tier 2 in a

1512
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,160
negative sense. You know whenever we say

1513
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,680
tier 2 we say it's not tier one right

1514
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,760
but you also need tier 2 colleges

1515
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,920
because India as a country needs

1516
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,160
colleges that can also educate the

1517
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,119
masses right and so they are tier two

1518
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,040
not by design but by compulsion and even

1519
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,960
tier three or tier four and there's a

1520
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,799
space and market for tier one for tier

1521
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,359
two for tier three tier four and tier

1522
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:55,680
four is not necessarily bad as compared

1523
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,280
to tier one but most of them are bad bro

1524
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,960
you know they're solving a different

1525
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,400
problem look at India where solving a

1526
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,520
problem look at India look at where we

1527
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,160
are today

1528
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,640
If I can't if I can't afford a 30 lakh

1529
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,040
rupee tier 1 MBA, right? So does that

1530
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,319
mean that I don't even go for an MBA? If

1531
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,960
you go for an MBA and then you stay

1532
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,160
unemployed without any skill sets then I

1533
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,920
think that is wrong. Definitely I think

1534
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,400
that needs to be improved but still at

1535
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,799
least I should get the

1536
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,640
opportunity low ticket

1537
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:25,119
problem lowity problem low ticket

1538
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,640
lowquality high promises problem and

1539
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,400
most of them are low ticket low quality

1540
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,599
high promises. So if you do a if you're

1541
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,760
doing a wrong promise right that is

1542
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,440
obviously fraud right I will use the

1543
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,520
word fraud for it if you're promising

1544
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,960
the world and not delivering then that's

1545
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,640
fraud right that let's keep that aside

1546
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,400
for a second and we'll address that but

1547
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,000
if you're coming the right intent right

1548
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,319
and if you are promising what you're

1549
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
delivering then even tier 4 is adding a

1550
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,359
lot of value right it's not the best

1551
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,079
education it's not the highest quality

1552
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:54,720
education but by paying four lakhs am I

1553
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,480
at least able to enter the job market

1554
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,680
right I'm not going to become Bill Gates

1555
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,960
tomorrow I'm not going to be able to

1556
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,160
build a large company that's okay but at

1557
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,680
least can I raise my family yes

1558
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,640
right and there is space for that

1559
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,160
perfect now let's talk about the market

1560
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,440
and you mentioned this stat while I was

1561
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,200
speaking to you while doing the research

1562
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,280
for masters union that is x number of

1563
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,599
people graduate and here's the package

1564
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,319
that they get so there's a huge gap in

1565
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,079
the market so talk to me about that gap

1566
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:22,240
with updated numbers you know so the

1567
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,640
numbers have not changed much since then

1568
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,799
yeah yeah yeah probably much worse now

1569
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,000
because AI etc is really eating up a lot

1570
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,680
the jobs at the top. So in India we have

1571
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,280
as we mentioned earlier around 4 crore

1572
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,319
students who are enrolled in college.

1573
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,319
Okay. Right. And

1574
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:41,040
so you can assume that 1 cr are

1575
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,480
graduating every year. Take give or

1576
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,559
take. Right? 1 cr are graduating every

1577
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,680
year. Now out of these 1 cr who are

1578
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,480
graduating every year, how many are

1579
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,040
engineers? You mentioned 10 11 lakhs. Uh

1580
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,200
another 10 11 lakhs are doing BCOM, BBA,

1581
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,000
right? Another 10 11 lakhs are doing law

1582
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,319
plus design plus all the long tails. And

1583
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,319
almost 70 lakh people are doing BA and

1584
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,640
BSc. Correct. BA and BSE. Now which of

1585
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,799
these programs, which of these courses

1586
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,400
can really get you a job? You have to

1587
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,680
ask yourself that question. I think only

1588
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,520
engineering from what I maybe only

1589
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,400
engineering, maybe at some level some

1590
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,599
BBA, BCOM programs, right? SRCC, Dell

1591
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,680
University, etc., etc. Now my question

1592
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,079
to you right and I think I'd asked you

1593
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,079
this two years ago also is how many of

1594
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:29,200
these 1 cr graduates get a job that pays

1595
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,119
at least 40,000 rupees a month or almost

1596
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,400
5 lakh rupees a year 75,000

1597
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,720
no this was the number last time you No

1598
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,920
it was 12,000 it was 12,000 it was

1599
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:44,319
12,000 that's it just 12,000 people get

1600
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,000
a job that pays more than 5 lakh rupees

1601
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,920
now I I'll give you some anecdotal data

1602
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,359
as well. If you look at the top colleges

1603
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,319
in India at the undergraduate level that

1604
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:55,040
are teaching BBA, BCOM, it's SRCC comes

1605
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,200
to mind. Hindu college, Hans Raj, St.

1606
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,400
Stephens, they teach economics, uh

1607
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,559
Loyola in Chennai, uh St. Xavier's in

1608
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,520
Bombay, St. Xavier's in Kolkata, right?

1609
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,480
These are the colleges that come to

1610
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,480
mind. Christ College, right? Most of

1611
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,000
these colleges if you take all the

1612
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,680
students not just the students who get

1613
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,160
placed but all the students and come up

1614
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,160
with the average package barring maybe

1615
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,920
two or three colleges in Delhi none of

1616
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,799
these colleges will have an average

1617
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,240
salary more than 5 lakh rupees and these

1618
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,559
are the top ones in India I'm talking

1619
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,400
about BBACOM right now in engineering

1620
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,599
it's different if you go to IITs and if

1621
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,680
you go to computer science departments

1622
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,760
or electrical engineering departments or

1623
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,760
sometimes IT departments there you'll

1624
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,280
find great salaries that 1 cr 2 cr

1625
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,599
package google picking up and you know

1626
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,240
all of those things uh but if you go to

1627
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,079
slightly less aspirational programs

1628
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,000
there you will not find the kind of

1629
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,319
salaries again right now is this because

1630
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,400
of the lack of availability of jobs or

1631
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,839
is it because of the over supply of

1632
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,440
students or is it because these students

1633
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,280
are not competent great question so

1634
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,040
first of all this is the data okay I'll

1635
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,040
give you another very interesting data

1636
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,480
this I've been trying to find I have

1637
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,200
approximations from various different um

1638
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,200
articles tell me how many new net new

1639
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,359
white collar jobs get created in India

1640
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,599
every year. I have no idea. That require

1641
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,680
a degree.

1642
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,520
Net new white collar jobs get created in

1643
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,480
India. I'm assuming if 1 cr people are

1644
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,559
graduating and assuming let's say bro I

1645
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,720
have no idea bro. Okay. So 1 cr people

1646
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,799
are graduating with a degree hoping to

1647
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,000
do a white collar job. They're all

1648
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,599
hoping to do a white collar job. That's

1649
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,720
why they went for a degree otherwise

1650
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,240
they could have gone for a vocational

1651
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,440
program.

1652
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,880
Now by some measure by some measure only

1653
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,559
15 to 20 lakh new white collar jobs get

1654
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,400
created every year. Wow. Which means

1655
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,839
there's a deficit of 80 lakh. Which

1656
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,400
means there's a deficit of 80 lakhs

1657
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:44,359
every year. Every year. And I'm being

1658
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,799
very liberal with my

1659
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:49,200
data. I'm saying net new. Right? So

1660
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,359
these 15 20 lakhs don't have to all get

1661
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,040
filled by freshers only. They can also

1662
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,799
get filled by people who are slightly

1663
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,880
higher up with more experience. I'm

1664
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,400
saying net new white collar jobs overall

1665
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,160
for senior levels, middle levels and

1666
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,480
junior levels is 15 20

1667
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,319
lakhs. So people not finding jobs is

1668
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,200
actually not their own fault or even the

1669
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:11,040
colleg's fault. It's just that the the

1670
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,520
economy of India is such that we have

1671
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,680
too many people and our economy while

1672
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,440
it's growing very very fast is just not

1673
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,400
fast enough for the kind of population

1674
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,760
that we have. That's just our

1675
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,079
misfortune. Right? However, let me ask

1676
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,000
you another question. Tell me how many

1677
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,720
chemist shops are there in India? My

1678
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
random guess would be a million. Around

1679
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,480
2 million. Okay. How many gold retailers

1680
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,520
are there in India? 4 million. Slightly

1681
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,040
less. I think it's 1 million or

1682
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,280
something. 1 million in that zip code.

1683
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,200
Right. Okay. How many kirana stores are

1684
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,240
there in India?

1685
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,559
10 million almost. I think 20 between 10

1686
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,240
to 20 million. 1 to 22 crores. Right.

1687
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,920
How many tapri are there in India?

1688
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,680
Tapis. Tapri. Yeah. small uh unorganized

1689
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,680
restaurant essentially right where the

1690
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,680
food is being cooked in real time 30

1691
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,520
million I know I think it's again

1692
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,440
between 10 to 20 million so you're right

1693
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,079
you're right in the magnitude right so

1694
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,160
I'm what I'm trying to say is that this

1695
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,680
is true

1696
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,480
India true India is running chemist

1697
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,280
stores is running tapri is running

1698
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,079
restaurants is running kirana stores

1699
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,400
this is where the employment actually is

1700
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,960
right and a lot of people they're not

1701
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,720
choosing to go into the corporate sector

1702
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,880
which is very small. They're choosing to

1703
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,160
work with their parents, their fathers,

1704
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,319
their grandfathers, their uncles, their

1705
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,480
tawis, their chachas in these kind of

1706
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,000
stores. That's where true India's

1707
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,240
employed. Now the question we have to

1708
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,400
ask ourselves is that to work in my

1709
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,400
dad's chemist shop. Do I really need an

1710
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,760
MBA? Correct. You don't. Those are the

1711
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,280
questions we have to ask. And I think

1712
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,720
the mistake that we have made as a

1713
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,480
country is that we have glorified

1714
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,119
education or sorry let me put it a

1715
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,040
different way. we have glorified college

1716
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:53,440
education that only if you have an MBA

1717
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,839
right no matter what job you do are you

1718
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,480
the true son of the soil you know like

1719
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,640
we have attached these um these

1720
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,559
privileges with these stamps which they

1721
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,280
don't deserve right and which India

1722
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:07,200
doesn't even need um and I wonder why

1723
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,040
that has happened and I'll ask you the

1724
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:13,760
question like why do you think we as

1725
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:17,039
Indians worry so much or or find so much

1726
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,480
excitement in these tags MBA V tech

1727
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,480
because of validation

1728
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,480
by you speak to any parent who's

1729
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,440
enrolling their children into education

1730
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,039
into engineering ask them why are you

1731
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,240
getting a child to choose civil

1732
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:36,480
engineering standard

1733
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:39,039
job what the hell how the hell does that

1734
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,440
make any sense and I think uh one of the

1735
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,520
reasons

1736
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,119
why my generation at least feels a lot

1737
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,160
of baggage is because we're often

1738
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,720
treated as

1739
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,640
trophies in front of neighbors and

1740
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,799
relatives for our parents to

1741
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,319
say social

1742
01:03:55,799 --> 01:04:00,559
valid and because I got selected into a

1743
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,760
very terrible college my parents did not

1744
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,039
have that badge so there my load went

1745
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:11,359
away that

1746
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:14,480
I my parents accepted that he's not he's

1747
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,960
not the child whom they can um he's not

1748
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,160
the child who got into IIT. So he's not

1749
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:22,480
the child with a stamp there. My baggage

1750
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,039
went away from where I actually started

1751
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,119
my real growth. So I think this happens

1752
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,640
primarily because parents often treat

1753
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,079
their children as trophies as they are

1754
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,480
certificates and they often burden their

1755
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,079
children with their unfulfilled dreams

1756
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,319
that I couldn't become an engineer so

1757
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,839
I'll turn my son into an engineer. But

1758
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,520
very few of them think because I

1759
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:43,680
couldn't become an entrepreneur, I will

1760
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,359
turn my son into an entrepreneur because

1761
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,760
risk the worst. Yeah. And you know

1762
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:50,079
there's a very simple anecdote that um

1763
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,000
when it comes to running a business um

1764
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,920
you know we read these stats saying that

1765
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,240
you know only 1% businesses actually

1766
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,920
succeed this and that and all that crap.

1767
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,039
But what most people don't realize is

1768
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,599
that when you're at a job not a lot of

1769
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,200
things are in your control unless you're

1770
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,359
working for a great organization. In

1771
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,280
fact, in my organization over here, a

1772
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,640
lot of my editors, my writers, in fact,

1773
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,640
every single person because I run a very

1774
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,839
small organization, everybody has their

1775
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,039
work in their control. In fact,

1776
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:18,079
yesterday we held this meeting to

1777
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,079
understand what does each person want,

1778
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,680
what does everybody want to do. We spoke

1779
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,680
to our editors, each one of them to ask

1780
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,240
them. It's like a debt that you have to

1781
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,680
pay to the market that you do some of

1782
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,200
the work and then you get to do some of

1783
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,280
the work that you like even if it does

1784
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,680
not make any business sense.

1785
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,599
Um so unless you're in a great

1786
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,000
organization that is liberal enough not

1787
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:45,000
a lot of things are under your control

1788
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,359
but most of the organizations are places

1789
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,119
like I don't want to name IT companies

1790
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,599
but most of these IT companies where you

1791
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,799
do not have any choice to hack your

1792
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,119
growth but look at your dada's mid high

1793
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:59,440
store he had the growth in his own hands

1794
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,960
where he could go from selling chai to

1795
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,799
biscuits to then sweets the destiny is

1796
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,559
in your control the destiny is your in

1797
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,559
your control and your ability Ability to

1798
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,960
think on your feet is what always helps

1799
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,160
you. And most businesses that go out of

1800
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,839
business and I've learned that with

1801
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,760
experience after I've grown up. I've

1802
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,720
seen a lot of my friends also fail is

1803
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,640
that they just don't read enough and

1804
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,640
they don't strategize enough to take

1805
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,319
business under their control. But our

1806
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,000
parents never looked into any one of

1807
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,599
these things. If you tell them that I

1808
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,599
want to go abroad and you have to take

1809
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,760
up a debt of 60 lakh rupees to pay for

1810
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,000
my college, they would happily say yes.

1811
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,920
They would bet their life savings for

1812
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,760
you to go to a different country which

1813
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,000
they have no idea about in a market

1814
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,839
which they have no idea about and bet

1815
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,039
their life savings. But if you tell your

1816
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:45,280
father if you if if any middle- class

1817
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,200
child tells his or if any middle class

1818
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,039
child tells his or her

1819
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,720
father they would

1820
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:55,720
say how does that make any logical

1821
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,720
sense?

1822
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,319
employee. In fact, my boss told me

1823
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,920
entrepreneurs are the best employees.

1824
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,520
Yeah. In fact, my boss told me when I

1825
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,960
was working at Reliance, he's the only

1826
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,559
boss that I had and I would consider him

1827
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,960
to be the best. Now he's almost like my

1828
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:16,240
brother. He told me back then

1829
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:20,400
that you know I had this I I was very I

1830
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,400
was very scared of going to the

1831
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:31,359
market transactions and those lessons

1832
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
are such intangible invaluable lessons

1833
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,240
that no school or no college can teach

1834
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,839
you. So you can come back to this

1835
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,520
organization and wherever I am, I will

1836
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,880
hire you because I know for a fact that

1837
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,480
you've gone to the market, you've

1838
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,400
learned lessons the hard way and then

1839
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,440
you're coming back. One more thing I'll

1840
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,960
add to that. I think we also

1841
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,200
overestimated risk, right? I think we,

1842
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,200
you know, in the startup sphere where

1843
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,240
you're going for large companies, you

1844
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,000
want to build a large startup, you want

1845
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,920
to go public there, the risk is very

1846
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,280
high of failure, right? Because success

1847
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,039
means going public. Anything that's not

1848
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,760
going public is failure. And there the

1849
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,079
success rate is truly 1%. I'm with you

1850
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,640
on that. But if I'm going to open a

1851
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,319
chemist store, if I want to become a

1852
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,640
small entrepreneur, I want to sell

1853
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:13,359
plants, I want to sell furniture,

1854
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,760
there's a very high chance, probably

1855
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:18,400
more than 50%. Probably closer to 70,

1856
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,440
80, 90% that you will be successful,

1857
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,960
right? And I think we have to start

1858
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,480
looking at those kinds of businesses as

1859
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,560
well. It's just that in media, we only

1860
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,199
make movies on Mark Zuckerberg. Correct.

1861
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,880
Right. So we look at that as the idea of

1862
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:30,319
entrepreneurship and not opening a tapri

1863
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,920
on the side. Right. I think that can

1864
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,920
make for a great business. True. as

1865
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,679
well. In fact, this is what bothers me a

1866
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,960
lot that when it comes to parents, what

1867
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,799
they don't realize is that they're

1868
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,359
burdening children with even higher risk

1869
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,000
because they did not step back and study

1870
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,080
the data only for the child to realize

1871
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
six seven years later that I did not

1872
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,400
want to be in Canada. I did not want to

1873
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,400
be in US. I did not want to be in US. I

1874
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,480
just wanted to go back home and do what

1875
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,640
I wanted. In fact, over there you first

1876
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,560
have to clear your debt. then hope that

1877
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,000
you know the administration that is

1878
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,920
governing the country does not push you

1879
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,679
off then you are still treated as a

1880
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:11,120
secondass citizen

1881
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:13,359
racism okay so if if that if the same

1882
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,000
child is given opportunity over here for

1883
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,000
our country in our country the market

1884
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,920
that the child understands there's a

1885
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,520
much higher chance of success and this

1886
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,839
is what I think is wrong with our system

1887
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,400
which is where our parents do not study

1888
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:30,480
data and they treat children as trophies

1889
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,080
of validation in the society in the race

1890
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,279
of which they end up killing their

1891
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,920
dreams and the real dream to say that

1892
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,759
you know my child bought me this Ferrari

1893
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,359
or this house is something that they're

1894
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,679
compromising to say that you know my

1895
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,520
child went to an IIT so that I think is

1896
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,120
a big big problem yeah absolutely know I

1897
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,080
think so you I think we've clearly

1898
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,759
identified the market opportunity

1899
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,759
I think there's also something we should

1900
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,520
address which is the market gap right

1901
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:59,199
and you asked me this earlier which

1902
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,480
is why are these colleges not able to do

1903
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,000
a good job right and I gave you this

1904
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,080
answer that hey you know let's blame the

1905
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,480
government let's blame all of these but

1906
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,960
but I think it's you know education in

1907
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,600
India is not all that different from

1908
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,040
education abroad also really yeah like

1909
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,719
we think that some Harvard is doing

1910
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,800
something crazy or Oxford is doing

1911
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:20,480
something crazy I think maybe the top

1912
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,800
five are but after the top five top 10 I

1913
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,960
think the books that are being

1914
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,719
prescribed are essentially the same

1915
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,800
books that a college in India, a tier

1916
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,800
four college in India is prescribing.

1917
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,840
Right? The teachers who are teaching are

1918
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,360
probably just as good or just as bad as

1919
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,120
a tier 2, tier three, tier four college

1920
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,000
in India. I really think that we have

1921
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,520
glorified western education for the

1922
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,280
reason that they have those top 10. We

1923
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,440
think the top 100, the top 200 are also

1924
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,159
as good. They are not, right? Let's be

1925
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,640
very honest there. Uh and the reason is

1926
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:54,159
the same thing, right? that in the

1927
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,960
industrial revolution time uh this K12

1928
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:58,480
system this 4-year college system got

1929
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,880
created where it was almost like an

1930
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,920
assembly line where you said that hey we

1931
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,840
need people who can work in the

1932
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,760
factories 9 to5 so let's make college

1933
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,800
also 9 to5 let's give them one break in

1934
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,239
the middle for lunch right uh make sure

1935
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,560
that they don't ask too many questions

1936
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:14,080
and just listen and then take an exam at

1937
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,760
the end make sure they all have role

1938
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,199
numbers right so they can be easily

1939
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,880
identified and their individuality is

1940
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,880
taken away from them and make sure they

1941
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,719
have uniforms right so that they don't

1942
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,239
think of themselves as individuals make

1943
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,080
sure they don't ask critical questions

1944
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,159
make sure they don't have creativity in

1945
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,800
fact you know uh there's a king the

1946
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:33,719
Prussian king is very popularly known to

1947
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,080
have said that if my people start to

1948
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:39,440
think who will fight in all the wars

1949
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,199
that I have to fight oh damn right and

1950
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,719
by the way this is the same guy who

1951
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:46,320
invented the modern K12 college system

1952
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,840
he invented it because he lost a war to

1953
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,040
Napoleon because his people were not

1954
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,040
disciplined

1955
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,960
So he created this entire education

1956
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:56,000
system to discipline his people to

1957
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,480
indoctrinate his people right that you

1958
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,360
sit in class you sit quietly don't talk

1959
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,560
however you know and this was good

1960
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,199
enough for the industrial revolution

1961
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,040
time as well and this is pre the the

1962
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,000
invention of cars this is pre the

1963
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,960
invention of internet there is this is

1964
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,239
pre-relativity this is the education

1965
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,360
system that was invented however today

1966
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:20,480
we still use that same education system

1967
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,800
from that relic right when the world has

1968
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,199
completely changed and that's why the

1969
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,760
education system needs to change it

1970
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:30,679
cannot be so for example today in the

1971
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,800
workplace collaboration is

1972
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:35,040
required right but in our colleges

1973
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,120
collaboration is almost looked at like

1974
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,520
cheating

1975
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:41,920
cheating

1976
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,880
collaborate right in the real world you

1977
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,719
are required to think independently

1978
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,000
autonomously but in colleges in schools

1979
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:52,080
we are required to follow the syllabus

1980
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,440
right and not go beyond the syllabus.

1981
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,679
What are we required to do? We required

1982
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,239
to go through the past exams. We are

1983
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,440
gaming the exams by doing the past exams

1984
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:02,080
which is so stupid. In the real life

1985
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,199
there is a past exam, right? So whatever

1986
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,640
we are doing in school is completely

1987
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:09,120
antithetical to what is required in

1988
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,199
college. This is K12 college, MBA, PhD

1989
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,760
everywhere. Yeah. And that's why the

1990
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:15,520
market gap is that we need to think

1991
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,360
about a new education system that goes

1992
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,080
beyond exams, lectures, grades, slides,

1993
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,080
attendance books. This is a relic of the

1994
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,640
past. We need to start thinking about

1995
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:27,199
what to do in the future. With AI coming

1996
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,840
in, this need is even more grave now.

1997
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,440
Yeah. Which is to think critically. To

1998
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,880
think critically, to think innovatively.

1999
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,159
Those are the exact skills we do not

2000
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,920
teach. In a college system, students are

2001
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:40,400
required to not speak and listen to the

2002
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,320
teacher. In the real world, you're only

2003
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,159
asked to speak. Correct? You're rewarded

2004
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,159
if you speak and if you rebel and if you

2005
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:48,960
have new ideas, right? Those are the

2006
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,719
people who are doing well. But we are we

2007
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,679
are actually incentivizing the complete

2008
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,920
opposite in school and in colleges. And

2009
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,640
that's why I'm so passionate about

2010
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,040
thinking at least um about how can we

2011
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:04,239
rethink the classroom experience. Got

2012
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,400
it. Pratam talk to me about um the

2013
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,920
financial opportunity over here because

2014
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,719
I was having this conversation with a

2015
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,080
friend of mine and he told me

2016
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:16,719
that like if you want to provide world

2017
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,719
class

2018
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,920
education

2019
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,880
because all of these people require a

2020
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,400
lot of money to be spent either as

2021
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,159
remineration or um for their uh for

2022
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,360
their stay and accommodation as Well, it

2023
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,320
requires a huge amount of money

2024
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,920
especially if you're going to have

2025
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,080
practitioners come into your college

2026
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,400
very very often especially to deliver a

2027
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:43,360
lecture like if I were to get a lecture

2028
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:46,000
delivered by somebody of the stature of

2029
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:49,040
Sanjep Chandani I have to make

2030
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,440
everything worth his time right so there

2031
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,000
are a lot of constraints that say that

2032
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,679
like you mentioned education is not a

2033
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,239
scalable business if you want to do

2034
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,480
something worldass okay but here's where

2035
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:02,960
the venture capitalist in my head says

2036
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,880
that uh if it's not scalable, if it's

2037
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,640
not going to make a lot of money, why do

2038
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,320
you do it? Whereas the patriot in me

2039
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,320
says that it doesn't really matter how

2040
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,800
much money it makes, I want to leave a

2041
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,880
legacy for India. But I know for a fact

2042
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,239
that you know after having studied a few

2043
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,920
charts that you sent me, I understood

2044
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,920
that there's a huge opportunity in terms

2045
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,760
of profits also in this business

2046
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,920
provided you fall out of the system and

2047
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,000
create an impact. So talk to me about

2048
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,280
the financial opportunity when it comes

2049
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,199
to building a B school in India.

2050
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,480
So I'll talk about building a college

2051
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:36,120
engineering business school doesn't

2052
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,760
matter right uh if you let's say

2053
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,600
have 10,000

2054
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,840
students and you charge a fees of 1 lakh

2055
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,880
rupees per

2056
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:49,840
year right that's a 100 crore revenue

2057
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:53,120
okay you can probably hit 20 30% margin

2058
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,159
there 20 30% 20 30%.

2059
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:58,880
That means gross or net? Net. Net. Net.

2060
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:02,159
Yeah, gross is much higher. Uh net is

2061
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,800
much lower. So 20% net. Now that 20

2062
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,920
crores that you've just surplused, you

2063
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,880
can't take it in your bank account. By

2064
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,679
the way, that's the Indian government

2065
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,760
does not allow that. Right? So you can

2066
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:16,080
take that 20 cr and create space for a

2067
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,239
new campus, an expanded campus. You can

2068
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,120
take that 20 cr and buy an electron

2069
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:22,080
microscope. So now you can do more

2070
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,520
research, right? and you can keep

2071
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:28,960
plowing it back and that's how you build

2072
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:31,360
a much larger u university. Now your

2073
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,880
your point was very valid that you

2074
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,600
cannot create a scalable good quality

2075
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,800
institution 100 crores to 1,000 crores.

2076
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,880
I mean if you do really well you'll

2077
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,480
reach a,000 maybe you'll reach 50,000

2078
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,560
students maybe you can charge 2 lakh

2079
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,239
rupees you'll reach 2,000 crores 1,000

2080
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,920
crores in revenue. That's where the

2081
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,920
system finishes. But like you said the

2082
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,400
quality will dilute right as we have

2083
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,159
more and more students. Um the quality

2084
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,480
will definitely dilute as you have more

2085
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,840
and more students but the student is

2086
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,920
going to be still happy because the

2087
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,239
student is getting commensurate value

2088
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,320
right he's paying 2 lakh rupees he's

2089
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,440
getting a job or he's paid 2 lakh rupees

2090
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
per year for four years that means he's

2091
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,640
paid 8 lakh rupees he's getting a job

2092
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,560
that pays 8 10 lakh rupees he's happy

2093
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,159
the quality of education is yes less

2094
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,199
than the quality of education in a

2095
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,440
college where there are only 100

2096
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,960
students of course goes without saying

2097
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,719
but at least the student is able to get

2098
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,040
that value somewhere so the possibility

2099
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,880
of world class at a 10,000 student scale

2100
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,000
is not possible. It will take 100 years.

2101
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,120
Harvard takes how many undergraduate

2102
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,360
students in a year? Maybe

2103
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:34,000
2,000, right? Penn where I went, my

2104
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,159
entire class was just 2,200 students.

2105
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,600
It's a two 300 year old university.

2106
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,199
There's a reason they have not gone

2107
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,239
beyond that, right? Is because they know

2108
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,600
that as soon as they go beyond that,

2109
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,679
they will not be able to deliver value.

2110
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,199
Got it. It's not for exclusivity. It's

2111
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,120
not for exclusivity. Most people think

2112
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,040
it's for exclusivity. They don't they've

2113
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,880
not designed it that way. They I mean if

2114
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,320
you go to Penn's campus it's full like

2115
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,920
all the classrooms are always full all

2116
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,600
the hostels are always full that's the

2117
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,880
amount of people they can accommodate

2118
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,400
right and if they start to build more

2119
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,159
and more and more they know the systems

2120
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,480
will start breaking right it will not

2121
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:05,600
scale so education will scale uh

2122
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,520
conservatively 10 to 20 crores if you're

2123
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,640
running a small college all the way to

2124
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,080
th000 to thousand crores if you're

2125
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,560
running a very successful large college

2126
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,920
with great placements. Got it? Right.

2127
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,760
That's really the uh the the purview of

2128
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,199
the financials.

2129
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,600
But you know you can have interesting

2130
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:24,000
models for the future right why do you

2131
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,880
have to depend on full-time faculty only

2132
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,840
like you mentioned you can have

2133
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,360
practitioners interestingly

2134
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,880
practitioners cost a lot less than

2135
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,480
full-time faculty because full-time

2136
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,760
faculty you have to pay them you have to

2137
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,880
pay for their rent you have to pay for

2138
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,480
everything you have to pay for their car

2139
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,800
you have to pay for their travel and

2140
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,640
research etc with visiting faculty or

2141
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,600
with practitioners you don't have that

2142
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,640
overhead for them it's mostly charity

2143
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,360
many of them even do it for you

2144
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,199
mentioned Sanjiv G he came to our campus

2145
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,280
right for a couple of

2146
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:52,640
and he gave some great lessons to our

2147
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:54,000
students. Uh Nathan Nithan Kamat gave

2148
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,640
some great lessons to our students. I

2149
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,159
can't afford them correct as faculty but

2150
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,880
they came because they feel for it

2151
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:03,920
right. So you know you can create these

2152
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:06,080
new models which can make the education

2153
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,600
cost actually come down quite

2154
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,880
significantly. For example, most

2155
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,320
colleges today require or most colleges

2156
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,239
are designed in a way that they own the

2157
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,159
land and building okay that they're

2158
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:18,560
built on. Right? Right. So you have to

2159
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,480
spend 20 crores to buy the land. Then

2160
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,239
you have to spend 60 crores to build the

2161
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,159
building on top of it. This is for a

2162
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:27,360
capacity of this is for a capacity of

2163
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:30,320
a,000 to 2,000 students. Okay. Right now

2164
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,679
that's a huge capex requirement and then

2165
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,360
automatically brings down your bottom

2166
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,640
line and it creates a huge barrier to

2167
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,360
entry. But what we have done at Masters

2168
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,040
Union is something different. We said

2169
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,960
boss we don't have to own our own land

2170
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,280
and building. let's just do this where

2171
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,760
we rent it from the best builder in the

2172
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,360
country. So we went to DF, we went to

2173
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,760
their campus where they already have

2174
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,400
Bane, BCG, Bank of America, Expedia,

2175
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,560
Gartner, WPP and we asked them sir the

2176
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,760
ground floor is empty. Can you please

2177
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,600
give that to us? We want to run a

2178
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,600
college there. Now suddenly that 100

2179
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,360
crores that had to be spent is zero for

2180
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:07,280
me. Right? This is a new model. Correct.

2181
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,800
So you can now think about changing the

2182
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,080
education system even from a financial

2183
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,000
perspective, from an investment

2184
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,000
perspective. And that opens many new

2185
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,520
doors for both new entrepreneurs to come

2186
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,440
into education. Now you don't need 100

2187
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,960
crores. You can just do it literally for

2188
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,120
zero. We started masters union with a

2189
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,760
total investment total investment of

2190
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,080
less than 1 cr rupees. Right? If you add

2191
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,360
like let's say even my time etc. it

2192
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,199
would go up to maybe 1 and a half 2

2193
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,040
crore rupees. My team's time etc. You

2194
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:33,719
know some of the founders etc. That's

2195
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,679
it. And today we have almost a thousand

2196
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:36,960
students right with almost zero

2197
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,360
investment. Most of the investment we

2198
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,880
made was after we made the revenue and

2199
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,120
we made some profit and then we plowed

2200
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,400
that back in. Understood. So if I were

2201
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,719
to summarize this, what you're

2202
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,640
essentially saying is that education is

2203
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,800
a high ticket high outcome business

2204
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,280
which results into a flywheel which can

2205
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,960
help you build a large business. Um

2206
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,800
considering the fact that there is a

2207
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,400
disclaimer, you can't take this money

2208
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,560
out because in India you can't make

2209
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,920
money out of education. Then you

2210
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,000
mentioned that this results into a

2211
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,159
flywheel which is very very interesting

2212
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,800
and you can plow it back and then turn

2213
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:10,960
them into large institutions with very

2214
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,640
high impact. And then you mentioned the

2215
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,440
gap in terms of the requirement that

2216
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:19,840
there are 4 cr graduates out of them

2217
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,080
only 12,000 get a job paying 40 to

2218
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,600
50,000 rupees which means there's a huge

2219
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,199
gap in terms of three things. One is we

2220
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,199
need more jobs which is something that

2221
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,560
the government has to do and the large

2222
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,400
businesses have to do. We have no role

2223
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,239
to play over there. Number two, there is

2224
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,080
a lack of skill set which is where

2225
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,239
people like you and I come in. And

2226
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,920
number three, you mentioned that we need

2227
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:42,719
to decrease the barrier to entry in such

2228
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,400
a way that we can charge. There are two

2229
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,800
models you mentioned. The first model is

2230
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,040
you charge less but you have more inflow

2231
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,199
which is like a VIT where you have

2232
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,080
10,000 students or V is also very

2233
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:58,080
expensive but yes you go niche and then

2234
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:00,560
you build a high RPOU low scale business

2235
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,040
like Harvard which can then help you

2236
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,280
build leaders for tomorrow and then when

2237
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,800
we spoke about the margins the financial

2238
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,400
opportunity what you mentioned is that

2239
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,000
if you build a 100 crew business you can

2240
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,920
get 20 to 30% net which is super healthy

2241
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,360
like for most of the FMCG It's less than

2242
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,639
10%. So it's absolutely fantastic. And

2243
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,080
then you mentioned that there are two

2244
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,560
barriers to entries that you can

2245
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,760
actually get rid of. Number one is when

2246
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,199
it comes to faculty, there's a very

2247
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,120
counterintuitive thing that most people

2248
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:29,120
don't know that is the likes of Sanjiv

2249
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,400
Chandani and the rest they will not

2250
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,400
charge you to come and teach. They would

2251
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:36,480
just do it for um for for they they

2252
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,000
would just do it for gratification. They

2253
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,679
would just do it because simply they

2254
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,760
would simply do it because they want to

2255
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:43,360
give back. So it gives you the insane

2256
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,600
ability of being existing in modern

2257
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,040
India where there are practitioners who

2258
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,480
would want to give back to the society

2259
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,560
and they would also dedicate time for

2260
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,280
it. The second thing that you mentioned

2261
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,600
is the land and building cost. A 20 cr

2262
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,080
cost with a 60 cr building cost would

2263
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,199
result into 80 crores of initial capex

2264
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:03,840
which then if taken as debt would last

2265
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,840
for probably three decades and that

2266
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,600
would practically kill your bottom line.

2267
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,080
But now that's not necessarily the case

2268
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,440
because if you can lease not buy it

2269
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,679
would bring down the barrier to entry by

2270
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,840
a large extent just like you did with DF

2271
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,920
where you leased a place instead of

2272
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,920
buying it and and one thing I will add

2273
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,800
you know you mentioned scale I alone at

2274
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,560
mast's union cannot achieve scale it's

2275
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,120
not possible right and I've told my team

2276
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,440
that don't expect huge companies like

2277
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,920
it's not going to happen however we have

2278
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,440
created a model this asset light model

2279
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,760
this practitionerdriven model this

2280
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:37,679
hands-on experiential model And we have

2281
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,000
open sourced it completely. All of our

2282
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,400
curriculums, all of our SOPs, all of our

2283
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,480
policies, all of our handbooks are

2284
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,000
completely available to anyone who wants

2285
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,440
to set up a college. Yes, completely.

2286
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,280
Where, bro? On your website. On our

2287
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,840
website, on our YouTube, everything is

2288
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,920
public. All of my courses that happen

2289
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,080
inside the classroom, they are beamed

2290
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,840
live on the LMS and anybody can go and

2291
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,600
check it out. Wow. I did not know this.

2292
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,400
Absolutely. Absolutely. Not a lot of

2293
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,800
people do, right? But everything that we

2294
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,040
do is completely open source. Oh, wow.

2295
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,199
Did you know this? So like for example,

2296
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:12,080
we had we have this one course that is

2297
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:14,320
taught by uh on creators and uncreated

2298
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,320
economy by Tanmai. It's on our YouTube.

2299
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,320
Anybody can go and see it. It does great

2300
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,600
content marketing for us as well. But at

2301
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,880
the same time, whatever is happening

2302
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,239
inside the classroom, we have put it out

2303
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,159
in the open. Bro, you should speak about

2304
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,920
this more often. You don't? Uhhuh. No, I

2305
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,159
haven't. Yeah, this is insane. I never

2306
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,239
knew this. Everything is public. Like on

2307
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:32,880
our website if you go you will find the

2308
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:34,560
details of the drop shipping the creator

2309
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,320
challenge of all of the briefs that we

2310
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,159
do it's all there it's all there the

2311
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,760
venture nitization program all the

2312
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,280
content that we have created is

2313
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,159
completely out there for public to

2314
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,320
consume now because of that there are

2315
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:48,239
many new colleges that have been created

2316
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,159
that completely mimic the mast's union

2317
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:52,719
model there's a college in Bangalore in

2318
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:55,440
Bombay in siliguri there's a college and

2319
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:57,760
I'm so proud of them of that and proud

2320
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,560
of them right for thinking and taking

2321
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,040
this ahead. Harvard gave us a model.

2322
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,480
UPUPEN gave us a model that spawned

2323
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,239
thousands of other universities across

2324
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,040
the world. Oxford Cambridge gave us the

2325
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,800
model, right? IIT's IM gave us the

2326
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,239
model. But I think it's time for us to

2327
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,639
bring a new model and that's what I'm

2328
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:16,960
trying to do. My impact is not going to

2329
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,320
come from masters union. My impact is

2330
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,880
going to come from the hopefully

2331
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,880
thousands of other colleges that will

2332
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,639
use the learnings that we have had. So

2333
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,320
your real achievement would be the

2334
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,360
masters union model that eventually

2335
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:31,360
serves India and not just masters union

2336
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:34,040
as a business. Absolutely. Absolutely.

2337
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:36,639
And you know think about it a Harvard is

2338
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:38,320
Harvard and when it became Harvard the

2339
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,639
Harvard business case studies now get

2340
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,639
used in every college. Correct. Right.

2341
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,400
One of the reasons I want to be top 10

2342
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,840
is because if we can get to top 10 with

2343
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,920
this experiential practitionerdriven

2344
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,719
asset light hands-on model then perhaps

2345
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,080
other colleges will be

2346
01:25:49,719 --> 01:25:54,080
like right and I know for a fact that

2347
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,840
that would give better outcomes to the

2348
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,840
students eventually. Bro you mentioned

2349
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,600
Harvard and Harvard business case study

2350
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,760
that is an inspiration for us. You

2351
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,560
remember I told you that we want to make

2352
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:06,480
case studies so good so entertaining

2353
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,840
that uh people should say that you know

2354
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,360
what this is more interesting than

2355
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,040
Harvard. This is giving us more

2356
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,960
knowledge than Harvard. Now that's a

2357
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,480
very big bar, but you're trying to but

2358
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,480
we're trying to get there with each

2359
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,120
passing video. So like you mentioned

2360
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,400
like if Harvard Business Review never

2361
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,800
existed, Think School's case studies

2362
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,719
wouldn't exist. And because now we've

2363
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,679
started with this case study. In fact,

2364
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:29,760
uh 2021 we were one of the two three

2365
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:31,120
YouTubers who are making content on

2366
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,800
business case study. Now everybody is

2367
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,400
now everybody is including us. Yeah.

2368
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,760
Absolutely. And that makes us so happy.

2369
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,120
Inspired by you. Thank you so much. In

2370
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,480
that sense, right? Like absolutely we

2371
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,239
always say that hey you know this is a

2372
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:43,360
great model of education that thinks

2373
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:44,880
school is working on let's let's copy it

2374
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,280
let's copy it if someone's doing a good

2375
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,600
job let's copy it why not it will help

2376
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:52,800
the country at the end of the day I mean

2377
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,239
it's so and that's why you know I never

2378
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,840
and some you know you mentioned the hate

2379
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:58,400
that we get sometimes is when we get

2380
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,560
compared that we are going to kill IITs

2381
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,080
or we going to kill IM right or someone

2382
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,440
makes a claim that master's unit is the

2383
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,800
next Harvard none of that is true none

2384
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:10,159
of that is true we want to be compared

2385
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,159
to anybody. We are here because of them.

2386
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:14,480
Right? We want to present an alternate

2387
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:16,080
strategy. That's about it. And the world

2388
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,880
will decide whether it's good enough or

2389
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,400
not for us to really unseat them. But

2390
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,320
the goal is not necessarily to unseat

2391
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,719
them, right? The goal is to present an

2392
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:26,800
alternate model that is good enough,

2393
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,480
right? That people feel compelled

2394
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,480
enough. So I'll give you an very

2395
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,800
interesting example. The earliest

2396
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,159
universities were Nalanda and Tuxila.

2397
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,679
You know, we have those ruins and we

2398
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:37,760
have heard those stories. Then came

2399
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,679
Oxford and Cambridge. But these were

2400
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,920
only available to very few people like

2401
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,760
maybe less than 0.01% of the population

2402
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,440
at that time could attend universities

2403
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,679
like

2404
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,679
these. In the 1700s, something very

2405
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:53,920
interesting happened. The education

2406
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:55,679
model changed. The rich people uh or the

2407
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,960
second tier to rich like not the princes

2408
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,719
but maybe like the ministers, sons, etc.

2409
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,159
Uh the rich people across the world,

2410
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,159
right? So, Maharaja's kids in India,

2411
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:06,400
their minister's kids, then the Ming

2412
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:09,360
dynasty in China was going on, their

2413
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,080
kids um and even the princes, etc. in

2414
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,159
the in the British uh lineage. What they

2415
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:18,040
would do is they would send their kids

2416
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:20,880
on a 4-year tour of Europe starting in

2417
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,719
Rome. They will end up in Rome. They

2418
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,040
will meet the Michelangelo of the time,

2419
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,880
etc. And they will actually learn those

2420
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,400
skills from them, the masters. From

2421
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,920
there, they'll go to Florence. They

2422
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,600
learn about art and architecture there.

2423
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,960
From there they'll go to Venice. They'll

2424
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,639
learn about civil engineering and

2425
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,080
structures there. From there they'll go

2426
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,639
to Manchester to learn about textile

2427
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,560
engineering. So them going to college,

2428
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,800
their right of passage was essentially

2429
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,440
them traveling through Europe. This was

2430
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,000
called the grand tour. And this is what

2431
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:51,120
college was. How long did this last? I

2432
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,679
mean this lasted almost I think good 150

2433
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,360
years. No, I mean the course four years.

2434
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:57,199
Four years. Four years. And I have a

2435
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,639
very interesting question. There's a

2436
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,719
company that you know of and most of

2437
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:03,040
your audience knows of that actually

2438
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,440
used to run these stores. Perhaps the

2439
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:07,760
first college if you will. What is the

2440
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,159
name of the company?

2441
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,600
I can think of the company that does

2442
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:15,840
what? That started doing these grand

2443
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,520
tours of taking students across Europe

2444
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,000
and making them learn these skills.

2445
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,080
Okay. In all of these centers. Is it

2446
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,560
Thomas Cook? Yes. How do you know?

2447
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,239
Because you told me we've had this

2448
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,199
conversation before. Okay. Okay, it's

2449
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:30,400
Thomas

2450
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:32,320
Cook. You heard this. Okay, you cheated

2451
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,560
a little bit, but it's okay. It's Thomas

2452
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,000
Cook, right? And that is an education

2453
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,480
model that we have totally forgotten

2454
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,080
about that education through travel,

2455
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,600
right? And I really feel that in the

2456
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,440
future there'll be many more education

2457
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,280
models like this with AI coming in.

2458
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:49,600
We're not too far from a chat GBD like

2459
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:52,000
interface with a bunch of teachers who

2460
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,159
at our pace, you know, keeping our

2461
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,159
personality in mind, the accents that we

2462
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:58,719
understand and the examples that we

2463
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:00,480
appreciate will be teaching us. I think

2464
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,679
it's one or two years away. In fact, uh,

2465
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,600
you know, what you mentioned is already

2466
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:06,560
happening, bro. Um, we were just looking

2467
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,239
at u one of our physics textbooks. It's

2468
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,679
called

2469
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:12,560
Ido. One of the toughest physics books

2470
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:15,560
you will ever come across. Okay. back

2471
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,560
then.

2472
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,159
answer. But today we have the luxury

2473
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:45,520
of an IOTO question and its solution so

2474
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,639
well because in IO you first have to

2475
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,760
understand the question that's the first

2476
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,400
challenge and then you can go to the

2477
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,480
answer and I had a lot of doubts and I

2478
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,639
kept asking kept asking kept taxing like

2479
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,040
you said at my pace with the examples

2480
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,800
that I

2481
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:01,280
appreciate and I was just mind blown at

2482
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,120
that possibility because back then when

2483
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,120
it comes to physics teachers in IIT

2484
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,120
classes

2485
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,040
But more or less to a large extent and

2486
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,560
you can keep asking questions and it

2487
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,320
keeps giving you answers. They're so

2488
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,480
accurate with such good explanation

2489
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,120
which means today a kid in 12th standard

2490
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,960
can look at an IO understand the

2491
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,000
solution understand the concepts and

2492
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,000
then solve IO whereas back then we were

2493
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,120
struggling with Etsy. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

2494
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,360
That is such a beautiful thing. Call

2495
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,239
your

2496
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:35,679
friends you know you didn't have the

2497
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,040
answer. I didn't have the answer. Now

2498
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,960
you have the answer handy. You have the

2499
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,960
cheat sheet always with you which is so

2500
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,480
interesting and how remarkably the

2501
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,880
capability has changed over just six

2502
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:48,480
years. But one thing I will say just to

2503
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,560
this you know this chat GPT and AI

2504
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,480
solves the problem of content being

2505
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:55,360
easily available to us in whatever

2506
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,639
format we understand right however it

2507
01:31:55,360 --> 01:32:01,360
still doesn't solve for one thing which

2508
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:03,280
is the motivation to learn right I if I

2509
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,159
am seeking an answer I will find the

2510
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,320
answer but am I seeking the answer

2511
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,080
that's a bigger question right true and

2512
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:13,120
so what we also have to figure out is

2513
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,440
how do we motivate intrinsically our

2514
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,840
students to seek out answers to

2515
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,679
questions. Yeah. Right. We're not doing

2516
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,920
a good job of that yet. That is

2517
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,560
something that's uh that is

2518
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,480
proactiveness, bro. I I think uh beyond

2519
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,920
25, what I've seen is that people when

2520
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:31,199
they are very young at 14, 16, 18, you

2521
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,280
can still instill that proactiveness

2522
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,960
very easily. But as they turn 25 and

2523
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,400
above, it gets slightly difficult. And

2524
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,800
as they turn 40 and above, it almost

2525
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:40,800
becomes in schools. If we can trigger

2526
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,480
that curiosity, we can trigger that

2527
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,639
proactiveness in students. And I think a

2528
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,000
good teacher who asks the right

2529
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,239
questions, a good teacher who can

2530
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,719
inspire the students or instill that

2531
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:52,320
love for that subject you know and then

2532
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,600
the students doesn't then the student

2533
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,639
doesn't need to be taught anything.

2534
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:58,880
Yeah. Once the student is awake, he will

2535
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,560
seek she will seek the answers whether

2536
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,280
that's through Chad GBD or through Etsy

2537
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,760
BMA or through Udo right I think I think

2538
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,199
if we can instill that love for learning

2539
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,199
I think then we would have fundamentally

2540
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:11,600
changed learning also correct then maybe

2541
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:13,600
we would have even removed like the

2542
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,920
issue of content right like right now we

2543
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,960
have so many mukes right today if you

2544
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,040
want to learn something and if you have

2545
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,440
a phone you can learn it correct but has

2546
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,120
that made everybody learn it not yet

2547
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,520
right so like I always say this one

2548
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:28,400
thing that We consider that a student is

2549
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:30,880
an empty glass and we have to fill our

2550
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,800
jug of syllabus in it. The other way to

2551
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,440
look at it is that a student is actually

2552
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:37,520
a candle. If you light the candle, it

2553
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:40,239
will automatically give light, right?

2554
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,159
Another way to look at it is just like I

2555
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:44,920
think every student is a sponge. If you

2556
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:48,480
put the sponge on water, it will just

2557
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:49,920
float. You have to really squeeze it and

2558
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,639
then it'll absorb everything, right?

2559
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,159
Like how we do that. I think I think

2560
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,679
your case studies when you ask and when

2561
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:56,800
you frame those questions at the end of

2562
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,440
your case studies or through the case

2563
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,960
studies they inspire that curiosity

2564
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,840
after every time I've watched your case

2565
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,920
study I have gone into further depth to

2566
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,280
do my own research on whatever the topic

2567
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,000
is that you made that case study on

2568
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,840
because you awakened that interest in me

2569
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,600
right and now I'm motivated to go and

2570
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,040
find answers you know why we do that

2571
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,800
that is because my mom used to do that

2572
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,199
with me and you know one of the best

2573
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,560
books that I've come from for you yes

2574
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:22,320
and one of the best books that I've

2575
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,480
gotten is Seven habits of highly

2576
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,679
effective people, right? And one of the

2577
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,600
first things that it talks about is

2578
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,679
proactiveness starting from the end in

2579
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,040
mind. And uh once you begin to

2580
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,800
understand those attributes like you

2581
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,120
mentioned that a candle, right? Lighting

2582
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,480
that candle I think to me was getting

2583
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,719
that book seven habits of highly

2584
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:41,840
effective people. But seven

2585
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:43,440
habits if I can understand the meaning

2586
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,840
of it and I can inculcate all of that in

2587
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,960
my life that would be great. So and my

2588
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,600
mom also told me something very

2589
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,199
interesting. He said um and this also

2590
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,560
this is also something that Ken Robinson

2591
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,639
said in his TED talk which is one of the

2592
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,320
most watched TED talks in history. He

2593
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,840
said that the beauty of human mind is

2594
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,040
that it doesn't need to be taught. It

2595
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,520
just needs to have a conducive

2596
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:04,159
atmosphere and it will learn by itself

2597
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,679
which to me was the book and when we

2598
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:07,600
present our case studies we always make

2599
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,679
sure that we present the facts and make

2600
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,560
people think. In fact, all of our

2601
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:14,719
podcasts get um get turned into notes,

2602
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,800
bro, which is so interesting, which then

2603
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,120
become 40 50 pages of notes. And that is

2604
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,400
what excites me a lot, which is people

2605
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,320
are learning and they're putting it out

2606
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,239
there for other people to learn from it.

2607
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,360
And that I think is the true impact of

2608
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:28,560
education. You know, since uh we we're

2609
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,960
living in this world today, we have to

2610
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,960
talk about Elon Musk a little bit. Okay,

2611
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,560
Elon Musk has this saying and this real

2612
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,360
is very viral and I'm sure you would

2613
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:40,800
have seen it that current education

2614
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:43,120
system teaches to the tool and not to

2615
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,560
the problem. Correct? Right. So it will

2616
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,719
teach you how to use a screwdriver. It

2617
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:51,760
will teach you what is a heat equation.

2618
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:54,800
It will teach you calculus. Right? But

2619
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:57,440
will not teach you the problem to solve

2620
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,880
with that tool. Correct? Right. And so

2621
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,560
you know he he talks about heat transfer

2622
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,560
equations. He said, "Dude, if I want to

2623
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,760
teach you refrigeration as a concept or

2624
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,600
how a refrigerator works, there are two

2625
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,960
ways I can do it. One is I start with

2626
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,239
the screwdriver and the heat transfer

2627
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,920
equation or I give you a refrigerator."

2628
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,880
I say, "Boss, this refrigerator is

2629
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,239
broken. Please fix it." Right now, you

2630
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,480
have made it into a game. It's like a

2631
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:22,239
video game for that student. He wants to

2632
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:25,199
fix that broken refrigerator. And in the

2633
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:27,280
pursuit of that fixing, he will have to

2634
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:29,040
learn how to use a screwdriver. But

2635
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:31,199
it'll come from within. Correct. It will

2636
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,560
not be part of syllabus. He will have to

2637
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:34,800
learn those heat transfer equations. It

2638
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,679
will come from within. And that I think

2639
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,600
is like really like the epitome of what

2640
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,000
the education system should be.

2641
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,600
Essentially make it a game. Yeah. Exam

2642
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,440
based education versus challenge based

2643
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,639
education. Yeah. That's a great way to

2644
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,639
put it, right? Challenge inquiry based

2645
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:52,960
education. Uh this exams really instill

2646
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:54,159
this fear, right? And you don't want to

2647
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,000
learn something out of fear of

2648
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:59,040
something. Fear of failing of you know

2649
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:02,560
what f we say f is feedback we say f is

2650
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:04,760
fail but f should be feedback right we

2651
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:08,239
have to remove this fear no one no one

2652
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:10,560
thrives in fear correct now let's talk

2653
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:12,560
about your businesses mast's union and

2654
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,880
tettor okay now what I'm trying to

2655
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,560
uncover are the models behind both these

2656
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,320
businesses so that like you mentioned

2657
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,480
these models could be replicated and

2658
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,920
what I want to understand are the most

2659
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,440
important attributes of these models

2660
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,679
which can then be replicated by somebody

2661
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:28,800
else and turn that into a profitable

2662
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:30,400
business schools and uh consider this as

2663
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,000
a conversation between me and you where

2664
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,920
I am trying to start a business school

2665
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,040
of my own where we are trying to reduce

2666
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,880
the barrier to entry and hit

2667
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,639
profitability as soon as possible with

2668
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,840
the assumption that I'm not raising any

2669
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:42,480
capital right and you want to have

2670
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,320
impact and we want to have impact okay

2671
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:47,199
let's start with step number one which

2672
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:49,440
is how to identify a gap in the business

2673
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,440
education market considering the fact

2674
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:53,920
that we already know that it could be

2675
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,600
profitable there's a skill gap and there

2676
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,239
are too many employers looking for

2677
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,760
highly capable people. Okay, how do we

2678
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,520
identify a gap in the market? Like one

2679
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,679
of your students, he's building a sales

2680
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,440
school, right? Let's talk about the gaps

2681
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,520
in the market in business education

2682
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,360
specifically. Um, so let's go for one

2683
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,960
second, let's step back and even talk

2684
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,840
about education in general, right? So

2685
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,119
there are 1 cr students who enter into

2686
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,400
higher education every year. That

2687
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,159
includes undergrad, postgrad,

2688
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,880
engineering, medicine, business, law,

2689
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:22,880
everything. 1 cr every year. Okay?

2690
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,400
Though that's your market essentially.

2691
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,840
If you start a new school or a new

2692
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,320
college today, that's the market you're

2693
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,719
targeting. Now 10 lakh 10 to 12 lakhs

2694
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:33,679
are engineering students. 10 to 12 lakh

2695
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:36,000
are your BBA, BCOM students. Uh 10 lakh

2696
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:38,560
are your medicine plus law plus design

2697
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,239
that long tail. And around 70 lakh is

2698
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,960
BSc plus BA. Okay. Now that 70 lakh

2699
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:47,119
which is BSc and BA there the fees is

2700
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:50,320
incredibly low like sub 50,000 rupees a

2701
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:51,760
year which is most of India, right? I'm

2702
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,280
guessing that's probably not where you

2703
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,159
would like to start right you would

2704
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,679
probably want to start in the

2705
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:57,360
pre-professional education which is

2706
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:00,159
either engineering business or one of

2707
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:01,600
these law design etc etc right so you

2708
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,280
have to start where you feel most

2709
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,719
comfortable we were talking about Nitan

2710
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,639
Gor my student who starting a sales

2711
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,159
school he felt most comfortable with

2712
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,679
sales that was his passion that was his

2713
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:12,159
calling he thought let me build a sales

2714
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:14,159
school right for me it was business so I

2715
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:15,280
started mast's union right for you again

2716
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,400
it could be business it could be a

2717
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,639
specific kind of business could be

2718
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,639
marketing if that's something or content

2719
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,719
or you know one of those kind of fields

2720
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:25,280
finance you're in Bombay. So you figure

2721
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:26,600
out where you have passion and where you

2722
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:29,679
have a right to

2723
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:32,080
win. There is demand everywhere. There

2724
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,920
is demand for good education in every

2725
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,679
department in every discipline, right?

2726
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,840
Whether it's law, medicine, everywhere.

2727
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:40,080
So if you are a good educator, people

2728
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,679
will come to you for sure. Okay. So you

2729
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,040
have to start with where you are. So

2730
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,719
your right to win, let's say, is in

2731
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,800
content. And you say Pradam, I'm going

2732
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:49,040
to build a content business school where

2733
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,800
I'm going to teach people how to create

2734
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,280
this content, how to create content for

2735
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:57,119
others. uh how to really win on YouTube,

2736
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,560
how to win on Instagram, how to get um

2737
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,000
partnerships, how to get brand

2738
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,880
sponsorships, how to get deals, all of

2739
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,600
that, right? I'm going to create a

2740
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:05,520
one-year course on that. Um and then the

2741
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,639
second part would be, okay, now we know

2742
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,520
that this is the school that you want to

2743
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:12,960
build. You'll ask yourself, does your

2744
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,639
audience care about a degree? Okay, if

2745
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,440
you're going for the post-graduate

2746
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:18,800
audience for a master's program, there

2747
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,080
the audience does not care too much

2748
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,800
about the degree because they care about

2749
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,159
the job that comes after it. But you're

2750
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,320
if you're going after the undergrad

2751
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,920
market, which is a much larger market,

2752
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,320
right? The postgrad market would be 1%

2753
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,560
of the undergrad market. Huh? So there

2754
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,159
you'll have to give a degree, right? And

2755
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,719
so you'll have to figure out a partner

2756
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:38,960
university that will work with you to

2757
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:41,119
grant the degree and you'll have to give

2758
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,560
them some revenue share, right? So let's

2759
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,760
say you go to Mumbai University or you

2760
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,639
go to Delhi University or you go to

2761
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,880
Manipal. um you tell them hey listen you

2762
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,199
know I want to run this school whatever

2763
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,280
your curricular needs are that I will

2764
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,800
accomplish don't worry and my students

2765
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,639
will take your exams also at the end of

2766
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,880
the day and if they pass your exams then

2767
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,040
great right uh and let's say they say

2768
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,000
yes and now you have finished with your

2769
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:05,600
step two which is you have a degree

2770
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,960
partner step three is that you go find a

2771
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:11,040
space right now traditionally speaking

2772
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:13,119
all colleges needed huge land huge

2773
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,679
buildings 100 crores of capex as we

2774
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:17,040
discussed earlier But now with this new

2775
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,119
model which is asset light you can just

2776
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:22,080
go to a building owner a building that

2777
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:24,480
is in a location where um the ecosystem

2778
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,520
is very enabling for you. So let's say I

2779
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,119
don't know where all the creators in

2780
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,040
Bombay live right let's say they live in

2781
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:30,159
west in Adi west. Okay. So you want to

2782
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,920
build a campus here because you want to

2783
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:34,480
be around your ecosystem. So you'll go

2784
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,840
to a guy and say okay you know um I want

2785
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,440
to build a school in the first year. I'm

2786
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,000
going to probably have 100 students

2787
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,600
right per student you need approximately

2788
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,440
100 square feet. That's the rule of

2789
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,280
thumb.

2790
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,719
Okay, if you have 100 students that

2791
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,760
means you'll need 10,000

2792
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:51,760
ft². That's the amount of space you

2793
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,760
need. I know in Bombay that sounds a lot

2794
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,480
but in Delhi it's okay. So maybe 8,000

2795
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,480
or 7,000 will also do in Bombay. Okay.

2796
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,560
You close that lease, right? And then

2797
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:02,719
you start building a website and you

2798
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,840
start doing your marketing. The website

2799
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,040
you make sure that all of your key

2800
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,360
messages are delivered. You can do it

2801
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:08,719
better than anybody else. Um and then of

2802
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,719
course I think for you it's very easy to

2803
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,639
market yourself and the new school. uh

2804
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,159
you just announce that hey you know I'm

2805
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,360
building this and these are the key

2806
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,520
messages and these are the key

2807
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,800
differentiators um these are the kind of

2808
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,400
recruiters I'll have these are the kind

2809
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,920
of opportunities you'll probably have

2810
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,639
these are the kind of faculty I have of

2811
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,119
course I'll be teaching etc etc etc um

2812
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,400
and thereafter you go live

2813
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:30,320
right and then thereafter whatever

2814
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,480
promises you've made over the next 2

2815
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:35,440
three four years you have to deliver on

2816
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:37,119
the promises and more right give

2817
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,280
students what they didn't even expect so

2818
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:41,280
that the word of mouth is strong and

2819
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,760
thereafter the word of mouth will start

2820
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,840
your flywheel and you'll have a legacy

2821
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,920
that you'll be sitting on. Right? This

2822
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,280
is assuming you do everything right. Uh

2823
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,360
of course there'll be hiccups in the

2824
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:54,080
middle. Uh of course there'll be

2825
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:55,600
naysayers many many many naysayers

2826
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,679
especially people coming from the older

2827
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:59,360
mindset the older generation. Uh you'll

2828
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,800
have to fight with the parents. Uh

2829
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,040
you'll have to fight it with the chachas

2830
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,520
and the tawis and the grandparents but

2831
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,960
eventually you'll win. Got it? So if I

2832
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,119
were to summarize this the first step is

2833
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:11,600
to find a gap in the market. And this

2834
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:13,760
gap is not the gap that is existing in

2835
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,840
the market only. It is a gap that you

2836
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,760
are very well capable of addressing

2837
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,280
which is your right to win and your job

2838
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,639
is to capitalize on that because in the

2839
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:22,159
business education space there are

2840
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:24,159
multiple gaps that you can capitalize

2841
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:27,119
on. For example, one of your students

2842
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:29,600
build a sales school only which is where

2843
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:32,480
he felt there is a right to win. Then if

2844
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,920
you're building for UG versus PG the

2845
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,480
differentiator is that when it comes to

2846
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:39,280
PG because it's the students themselves

2847
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,119
who are making the decision. this this

2848
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:44,000
output could be something tangible to

2849
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:45,920
them but may not necessarily be tangible

2850
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,600
to their parents for example anything

2851
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,320
other than a degree a placement a

2852
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,400
founders's office role and stuff like

2853
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:54,719
that but when it comes to UG because

2854
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,800
parents are bound to make the decision

2855
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:59,119
you do this in partnership with the

2856
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:01,920
university and the reason why you would

2857
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:04,480
do that is because it helps you get the

2858
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,880
degree but u because you're complying

2859
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,080
with the regulations of the university

2860
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,320
but you're running the school by

2861
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:12,880
yourself. You don't get entangled in

2862
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:14,320
that mess of acredition, affiliation and

2863
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,400
all sorts of stuff like that as much.

2864
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:18,159
Yeah. Which will kill your innovation

2865
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,760
altogether. There will still be some

2866
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,360
hindrance but that hindrance will give

2867
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,280
you the degree which will then justify

2868
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:26,159
the hassle that you're and over a period

2869
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:28,560
of time as your brand gets built 5 years

2870
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:30,480
10 years down the line you can either go

2871
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,600
for a university status yourself. You

2872
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,480
can go to the government and say hill

2873
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,159
listen I've been running this

2874
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,719
successfully look at my students look at

2875
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:39,360
my alums give me and my school a

2876
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:41,760
university status you can go for that

2877
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:44,239
right then you will come under UCIC

2878
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:46,159
that's okay we'll deal with it right uh

2879
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:47,840
they're also very very open to new ideas

2880
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:50,239
now finally you know the under the new

2881
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,639
government under you know especially

2882
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:54,639
since co all these organizations have

2883
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,080
become very open-minded about getting

2884
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:59,520
new ideas like you would have heard that

2885
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:01,840
recently they allowed faculty who do not

2886
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,080
have PhD PhDs to also get professor

2887
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,920
roles. Oh wow. Right. So especially if

2888
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,520
I've been in the industry for 20 years

2889
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,440
running marketing and I'm a marketing

2890
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,600
expert, I have the right to now go and

2891
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:14,400
teach even if I don't have a PhD. So

2892
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,040
these things are happening. So now let's

2893
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,320
come to your

2894
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:21,040
story that there is a flywheel that you

2895
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,880
need to break once you in fact there is

2896
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,400
a ceiling that you need to break through

2897
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,840
in order to build that flywheel right

2898
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,760
and that flywheel is the flywheel of

2899
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,760
customer acquisition cost. A lot of

2900
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:32,080
these edtech companies have failed

2901
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,239
primarily because they treated customer

2902
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,679
acquisition cost as steroids. They

2903
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,679
thought let's invest in performance

2904
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:39,040
marketing. The customer acquisition cost

2905
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,040
might be slightly higher but we'll at

2906
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,400
least acquire the customers. Initially

2907
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,320
it used to cost them 500 rupees to

2908
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,719
acquire a customer who pays them 10,000

2909
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,560
but eventually the gross margins went

2910
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,400
down but the CAC went up so high that

2911
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:53,280
eventually they encountered a loss.

2912
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:55,520
Okay. Now that is something that is an

2913
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:57,440
that is an even bigger hassle especially

2914
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,520
when it comes to high ticket products

2915
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,880
like

2916
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:02,639
yours but then you somehow ended up

2917
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,639
breaking through that ceiling and then

2918
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:06,400
you ended up into a virtue cycle where

2919
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,400
your customer acquisition cost keeps on

2920
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,679
going down. So first of all talk to me

2921
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,199
about this flywheel so that people get

2922
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,480
context and then let's talk about how

2923
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,400
did you break through that ceiling.

2924
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:16,800
Sure. So the flywheel is essentially

2925
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:20,000
this that let's say you have a cohort of

2926
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,600
60 students right and they graduate and

2927
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,199
they get good outcomes whether that's

2928
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,480
them starting a company successfully

2929
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:26,560
it's whether it's them going to Shark

2930
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:28,880
Tank or whether that's them raising

2931
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,639
funds or whether it's them raising uh

2932
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,560
them getting a job right that they truly

2933
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,639
truly are very excited about. So once

2934
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,280
you have completed that loop of bringing

2935
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:39,760
students in and giving them a good

2936
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:41,040
outcome now they become your agents

2937
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,119
essentially right they essentially

2938
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,920
become your ambassadors and when they

2939
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:48,639
say good things about you right more

2940
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:51,600
people want to join right and then your

2941
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,000
CAG becomes lower then those 100 new

2942
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,239
students who come in they get great jobs

2943
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,480
they get great outcomes then they go

2944
01:46:56,239 --> 01:47:01,199
tell another 100 people and so this

2945
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:03,920
pyramid this compounding keeps happening

2946
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:05,920
and when you hit year three, year four,

2947
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,600
you break that ceiling where your cost

2948
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,400
of acquisition because of this word of

2949
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,000
mouth becomes really really low, right?

2950
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:13,840
And eventually what starts to happen

2951
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
when you touch year five, year six of

2952
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:20,239
sustained um good word of mouth is that

2953
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,760
the cost of application you have to pay

2954
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:25,239
an application fee to apply right to a

2955
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:28,480
college that overtakes your cost of

2956
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:30,080
acquisition and hence by year five your

2957
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:33,320
cost of acquisition goes in the

2958
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:36,880
negative. Let's understand this with an

2959
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:38,440
example. Correct? So now at M's union in

2960
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:41,199
the very first cohort we had 60

2961
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:43,360
students. Okay. They let's say paid on

2962
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:46,960
an average fees of maybe 2 to three lakh

2963
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:49,119
rupees when the fees was actually on the

2964
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,679
website 20 lak rupees right? So they

2965
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:53,280
almost got a 90% scholarship. Right? So

2966
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,040
it was easy for me to acquire students

2967
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,199
at such a hefty scholarship. I was able

2968
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,639
to get good students. I worked very hard

2969
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:00,320
on those students. I remember I used to

2970
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,080
teach myself, spend a lot of time with

2971
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,360
them, help them with their interviews,

2972
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,199
help them with their startups, whatever

2973
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,960
they were doing. And when they finally

2974
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:09,600
went into the market, they were happy. I

2975
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,600
released a placement report, an audited

2976
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,360
placement report where I spoke about

2977
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,280
each of those numbers, right? that what

2978
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,639
was the average salary, what was the

2979
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,480
highest salary, what was the mean

2980
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:20,159
salary, what was the median salary, what

2981
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,000
was the average salary in consulting,

2982
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:24,239
what were the recruiters in consulting,

2983
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,320
what were they all of that data in like

2984
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:28,880
almost like a 10-15 page report which

2985
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:30,719
was audited to add trust. It was audited

2986
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,440
by the same auditor that audits

2987
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:35,520
Amhabad's report right once that got

2988
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,360
into the market that sort of spread like

2989
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,719
wildfire. Right? That's there's some new

2990
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:40,719
college that has come that isn't really

2991
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,239
well in placements. Now students who are

2992
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:44,719
looking to go into good colleges they

2993
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:47,360
know that yeah I want to apply to all

2994
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:49,440
the top 10 or top 20. Once they see our

2995
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:51,840
placement report rivaling that of those

2996
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,760
current top 10 top 20 colleges we also

2997
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,159
become part of their target list. Got

2998
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,520
it. So for these first 60 students what

2999
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,840
exactly was your customer acquisition

3000
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,360
cost? For the first 60 students because

3001
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,639
it was basically a full scholarship that

3002
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:08,639
I was giving them. uh all I did was get

3003
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:10,080
a PR agency to release a PR piece I

3004
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,560
think that went into India today that

3005
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,920
went in in shorts etc etc where it spoke

3006
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,840
about how this new business school has

3007
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,199
been started uh these are the three or

3008
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:19,199
four faculty that will be teaching they

3009
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:21,040
are the founding faculty and there is

3010
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:23,000
going to be a full scholarship when in

3011
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:25,840
India you're offering a full scholarship

3012
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,560
automatically a lot of people will apply

3013
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:31,199
so I remember in the very first year I

3014
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,360
got after that PR release almost 600

3015
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:35,760
applications oh wow Wow. And by the way,

3016
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,600
an applicant had to pay almost 2,500

3017
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,400
rupees to even apply. So, we know that

3018
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:43,679
those 600 people are all serious. Out of

3019
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:45,440
the 600 people, I maybe interviewed 120.

3020
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,920
So, you're saying that the application

3021
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:49,360
fee is absolutely essential because I'll

3022
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,199
tell you how the public looks at it.

3023
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,960
Okay. The moment you say application

3024
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:54,800
fee, they think you're making money out

3025
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,040
of their application. But what they

3026
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,960
don't understand is that in fact I would

3027
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,119
love to do this for hiring as well where

3028
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,960
people just pay money just to apply

3029
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:04,400
because serious people will come. I'm

3030
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,480
telling you bro even when I speak to

3031
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,239
recruiters in fact I've in fact I've

3032
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:10,159
been facing this problem very often that

3033
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,199
you get so many trashy entries that you

3034
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:13,199
really don't know how many of them are

3035
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:15,360
serious only for you to go through this

3036
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,199
hassle of processing 10,000 applications

3037
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,360
and you pick 100 then you realize that

3038
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:21,280
those 100 may say 30 are not even

3039
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,280
serious. So you are losing out on so

3040
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,719
much energy. So if you just want to cut

3041
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,920
down the top of the funnel. Usually it

3042
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,520
is about increasing the top of the

3043
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:29,840
funnel. Right here you cut down the top

3044
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:32,159
of the funnel that small top of the

3045
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,600
funnel ends up generating revenue which

3046
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,800
then minimizes your customer acquisition

3047
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,760
cost. So you're able to do too many

3048
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,119
things. You're able to get the best

3049
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,960
students. You're able to generate

3050
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:40,320
revenue from day one which can then be

3051
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,480
spent into marketing. So it gets you

3052
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:44,880
that flywheel started. Exactly.

3053
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:48,560
Absolutely. Okay. So these people paid

3054
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:50,400
2,500 rupees. Um 600 students paid for

3055
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,760
it and then you interviewed them. Then I

3056
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,600
interviewed approximately I don't

3057
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,159
remember exactly but I think 150 of them

3058
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:59,040
maybe I made offers to maybe 80 85 of

3059
01:50:56,159 --> 01:51:00,960
them and then maybe 60 ended up joining

3060
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:02,480
also 25 people did not join because they

3061
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,800
had other offers in other colleges I was

3062
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,199
competing right um but those 60

3063
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,440
mavericks took a chance on me got it now

3064
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:12,760
tell me something you know I've often

3065
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:15,000
heard that in fact I haven't

3066
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:18,639
heard

3067
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:22,880
that schools whe that's Harvard or IIT

3068
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:24,719
or I am what these colleges do they have

3069
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,440
this unfair advantage of getting the

3070
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:30,400
most brilliant minds and once you put

3071
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:32,159
100 brilliant minds under a roof those

3072
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,760
100 brilliant minds without having to

3073
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,080
teach them will end up doing brilliant

3074
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:39,760
things so that's where their flywheel

3075
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:41,840
starts okay but when it comes to you and

3076
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,480
I understand that you assume that every

3077
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:47,040
kid is capable of infinite potential by

3078
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:48,960
the way I'm not a believer of that okay

3079
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:51,280
um every kid is capable of infinite

3080
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,520
potential but you still have to get hold

3081
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,960
of quality entries right they have to be

3082
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,480
able to speak at least the basic bar

3083
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,400
they have to correct so what I'm trying

3084
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:01,440
to understand are the attributes that

3085
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:02,800
you saw in them to get them into mast's

3086
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,080
union considering the fact that you had

3087
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,440
no experience back then no great

3088
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,080
question yeah so in the beginning

3089
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,199
obviously I was not going to get the

3090
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:11,679
99.99s today I do I'm in a different

3091
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:14,000
position but back then I did not right

3092
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:15,760
so I was looking for two three things

3093
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
the first thing I was looking for is is

3094
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,920
this person inherently curious

3095
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,480
Inherently curious. Inherently curious.

3096
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,119
How did you guess that? You know, we had

3097
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,480
this one question in the application.

3098
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:29,520
It's a very interesting question. The

3099
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:31,760
question was, why does my table creek?

3100
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,360
Okay. Doesn't mean anything, right?

3101
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:35,599
Yeah. It's a question. It was literally

3102
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:37,520
just there. Why does my table creek? And

3103
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:38,800
people have to answer that. Now, 99%

3104
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,800
people will get stumped by that

3105
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,560
question. What does this mean? Is this a

3106
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,000
typo? What is this? Right? But there are

3107
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,400
some people who understand what we are

3108
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,679
trying to do, right? They will get

3109
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,199
curious. is they will try to like search

3110
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:50,400
online what is this what is that and

3111
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:52,320
they'll come up with some interesting

3112
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,800
answer to that question they'll play the

3113
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:57,440
game with me right and that is a great

3114
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,920
way to find people the kind of people

3115
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:01,199
that I wanted right as in an open-ended

3116
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,040
question that makes people think

3117
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:05,360
critically critically yeah just makes

3118
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,639
them think critically they feel you know

3119
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,280
someone wants to take up that challenge

3120
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,880
to answer a you know curveball question

3121
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:12,800
that to me is saying a lot about that

3122
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:14,239
person right that this person is up for

3123
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,360
the challenge he's a little give me a

3124
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:16,800
few more examples of these kind of

3125
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,119
questions yeah a lot of questions

3126
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,520
Um, so this was one. Why does my table

3127
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:24,960
creek? Why does what what would happen

3128
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:26,080
if the sun rose in the west? Just answer

3129
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,440
that question. You can take a

3130
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,800
philosophical approach. You can take an

3131
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:30,719
astrological approach. You can take an

3132
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,760
astronomical approach. Take any

3133
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,119
approach. You can take all of them

3134
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,040
together. You can write a poem against

3135
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,880
it. So just throw these curveball

3136
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,719
questions. There's a game. So what we do

3137
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:41,199
this year, we've changed it slightly. We

3138
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:43,360
make them play literally a Mario game.

3139
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,960
Okay? A Mario style game. So when you

3140
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:48,000
apply to Masters Union, you have to play

3141
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:51,840
this game. Um same we do at tetar also

3142
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,280
and this game will test how you do when

3143
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,360
you have very little time. So we only

3144
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,840
give you I think 25 30 seconds to solve.

3145
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:59,760
This is almost like SSB. What is SSB? In

3146
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:01,280
SSB correct service board. Yeah. Yeah.

3147
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,560
Of course. So you you throw these kind

3148
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,639
of games like these kind of questions

3149
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,920
that most people who cannot think

3150
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:08,719
originally or critically will get

3151
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:11,840
stumped by. Right. You may not be the

3152
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:14,159
highest ranker in J. You may not be the

3153
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,679
highest ranker in your school, college,

3154
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:18,000
whatever. But you still might be able to

3155
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,400
play this game. Okay. Right. So this

3156
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,480
kind of game or this kind of question

3157
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:25,119
helps us get an insight into the person

3158
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:27,599
beyond their grades. Okay. Bro, a very

3159
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:29,440
curious question. Let's say I am an

3160
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,960
inherently curious person and this is a

3161
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,320
problem that I faced even during my

3162
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,560
college placements. I did not sit for

3163
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:36,280
placements but then while these group

3164
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:40,159
discussions were being

3165
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:42,400
done what if the sky is red? My obvious

3166
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:44,320
reaction to do my obvious reaction to it

3167
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,679
is when there are so many real issues to

3168
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:47,440
be discussed why the hell are we

3169
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:48,639
discussing about if the sky becomes red

3170
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,239
what will happen because a it's not

3171
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:51,760
going to happen b no no matter what we

3172
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:53,679
talk it's not going to change anybody's

3173
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,159
perspective c it's not resulting into

3174
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:58,080
anything okay so during those times

3175
01:54:56,159 --> 01:55:01,199
because I am inherently a very logical

3176
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:03,599
person I'm a realist these abstract

3177
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:05,520
things sound like futile things to me

3178
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:06,679
because of which I might just decide not

3179
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:09,679
to answer that question in the first

3180
01:55:06,679 --> 01:55:11,760
place but if you give me a question on

3181
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,320
let's say socialism versus capitalism

3182
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:16,560
versus communism I will be able to give

3183
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:19,119
you a very comprehensive answer based on

3184
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:21,119
real stats and data and case studies

3185
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:22,800
that here's where capitalism fails

3186
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:24,480
here's where socialism fails here's

3187
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,560
where communism fails so we ask those

3188
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,840
questions also okay right because I'm

3189
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,360
just trying to understand that if a

3190
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,199
person like me applies to something like

3191
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:32,800
why like what is this yeah what is this

3192
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:35,360
what is this no fair I mean see the

3193
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,520
thing is everyone's different and so we

3194
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,040
have one application we have an AI

3195
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,480
assessment and then we also of an

3196
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:42,639
interview. So there are three points of

3197
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,920
contacts and in each of those contacts

3198
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,280
we ask you a different kind of a

3199
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,719
question or we engage with you in a

3200
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,080
different way. In one of the years we

3201
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:51,599
even tried this thing where we made

3202
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:52,960
people finish a scavenger hunt in Gura,

3203
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,400
right? So we actually partnered them

3204
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,920
into teams. We called them to campus. We

3205
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,880
partnered them into teams and we gave

3206
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,880
them a list of things they have to

3207
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,520
finish in Gorga together as a team. So

3208
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,920
how does the scavenger hunt in Gura tell

3209
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,280
you about the student? No. So the way

3210
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:06,639
it's very interesting. So we don't judge

3211
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,000
the student then and the students judge

3212
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:10,080
each other. So when they come back from

3213
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,639
the scavenger hunt, we ask them to write

3214
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:14,400
a few lines about their team members and

3215
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:15,920
from those responses, we try to judge

3216
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,199
who we want in the cohort or not. Right.

3217
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,119
Got it. Can you walk me through a few

3218
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:22,880
examples of a bad apple and a good

3219
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:24,080
apple? You know, it's generally we sit

3220
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,719
there are five of us in the admissions

3221
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,199
committee. We sit down and all of us

3222
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:30,480
debate on each candidate, right? So you

3223
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,679
might say Pratam, no this is a great

3224
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,880
candidate. I might say this is not a

3225
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,480
great candidate, right? And then we'll

3226
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,480
go with the majority at the end. It's

3227
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,000
usually a debate and it's often a heated

3228
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:41,040
debate as to who we should take in the

3229
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,880
cohort, who we should not. Um, so you

3230
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:45,119
know, sometimes some people are very

3231
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,599
quiet, right? And in a scavenger hunt

3232
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:50,639
setting, they may not be able to truly

3233
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:53,280
be um very open, right? They may not be

3234
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,520
as extroverted in that and so they might

3235
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:57,679
be losing out. But when you're sitting

3236
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,960
the admissions committee and one of the

3237
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,880
feedback on one of the students is that

3238
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,400
the student was very quiet. Then we'll

3239
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,800
check other attributes of that student.

3240
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:07,599
What else has he done? like has he still

3241
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:09,679
gone above and beyond uh and try to help

3242
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:11,360
the cohort or his team in any other way

3243
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:13,360
right so these debates happen that

3244
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,960
really help us understand who the

3245
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,880
student is as a person beyond their

3246
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,320
grades right it's very easy to judge a

3247
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,719
student from their GMAT score from their

3248
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:22,800
SAT score from their J score we said

3249
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,880
let's not do that right let's try to

3250
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,800
really get to know the person in fact

3251
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,280
when we do the interview we ask the

3252
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:31,520
interviewer to ask answer a question

3253
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,760
after the interview will you like to

3254
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:36,560
have beer with this candidate it

3255
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,760
tonight. This is the zomato test, right?

3256
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,960
This is kind of like the zumato test.

3257
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:41,840
Exactly. We actually asked that

3258
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,040
question. And some people may say, "No,

3259
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,920
I would not like to have a beer with

3260
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,840
him." That does not mean that that

3261
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,440
student is rejected. That just means

3262
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,480
that we have one more data point to

3263
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:50,239
judge that student when we are

3264
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,920
discussing and debating his application

3265
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:53,440
in the group. Got it. Right? So, we just

3266
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,360
collect all of this data. What would you

3267
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,040
consider as a red flag to not take the

3268
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:59,280
student in? You know, if we find too

3269
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:00,320
many inconsistencies, right? Let's say

3270
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,960
in the essay, the student is saying,

3271
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:04,639
"I'm an extrovert." Right? But in his

3272
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:07,119
peerreview feedback, it's coming out

3273
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:08,840
that he's actually introverted. Uh then

3274
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:11,280
we know

3275
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,239
that right when things are not aligning,

3276
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:15,760
when he's saying that, you know, I'm

3277
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:17,599
very passionate about um quick commerce,

3278
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:20,000
but then we don't see any evidence to

3279
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:21,360
that effect in his CV, right? Or when he

3280
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,199
talks about, hey, you know, I read the

3281
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:26,000
newspaper, right? But then we see in his

3282
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:27,119
CV that he's not uh really updated his

3283
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,960
CV with some of the latest things that

3284
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:30,000
he should have, whatever. So we try you

3285
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,880
know whenever something like that

3286
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,840
happens then the red flag goes up right.

3287
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,520
So and and one more thing is that if

3288
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,280
someone is coming across as authentic

3289
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,280
and vulnerable across all of these

3290
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,800
exercises then we feel like this person

3291
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,159
deserves a chance right that this person

3292
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,840
will be curious he will listen to other

3293
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:48,159
people he will not be arrogant he'll be

3294
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,920
a sponge right more than a rock. So

3295
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:51,679
you're looking for a sponge for that

3296
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,840
sponge. Not the person who knows it all

3297
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:56,560
and may not absorb things but a person

3298
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,920
who is willing to admit that they don't

3299
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,679
know a lot of stuff which is why they're

3300
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:01,679
willing to learn more. Vulnerable. Yeah.

3301
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:03,599
Those those attributes make up for a

3302
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:05,280
great student for us. That's the Masters

3303
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:08,239
Union student. That's what we are

3304
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:09,679
looking for. He may have a 60% in cat.

3305
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:12,040
In fact, there was one video that went

3306
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:15,360
very viral that Mast's union has taken a

3307
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:18,320
60%er. I like but the kid is amazing.

3308
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:20,159
Bro, you know what? Um I know you

3309
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:22,560
wouldn't say this but I should say this

3310
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:24,719
because these are the same people who

3311
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,719
will

3312
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,480
say bro just ignore All of that crap.

3313
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:50,000
Like I get that frust. I don't know how

3314
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,920
you don't get frustrated. Sometimes I

3315
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,880
do, you know, like there's this very

3316
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:57,199
interesting Bill Bill Gates. So no, not

3317
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:00,159
Bill Gates, Bill Clinton actually got a

3318
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:02,560
very bad SAT score. Scarlett Johansson

3319
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:04,320
actually got a very bad SAT score. Does

3320
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:07,440
that make them less successful in life?

3321
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:09,440
Not at all. Like SAT scores, J scores

3322
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:11,760
are horrible predictors of someone's

3323
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:13,199
success. Absolutely. Or potential. And

3324
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:15,040
so we we're trying to see beyond those

3325
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:16,719
numbers. And so that's how we got most

3326
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:19,440
of our students in the first over a

3327
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,520
period of time as our brand got built.

3328
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:23,119
We became spoiled for choice. You became

3329
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,880
spoiled for choice. Choice. Okay. Right.

3330
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:26,000
So earlier we used to have 600

3331
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,560
applications. Now we are sitting on

3332
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,679
3,000 4,000 5,000 applications. In total

3333
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,360
I think this year we'll get probably

3334
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,840
10,000 applications across all of the

3335
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,119
programs. Right? And so now we are

3336
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,040
spoiled for choice. Now we are like hey

3337
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:38,480
you know let's optimize for diversity.

3338
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:40,080
Let's make sure we have two doctors also

3339
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,840
in the cohort. They'll add to the

3340
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,960
conversation in the classroom. Let's

3341
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,480
make sure we have some students from

3342
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,840
Nepal and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as

3343
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,199
well. Let's make sure we have some

3344
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,960
students who did their undergrad abroad

3345
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:50,159
and now have come back to India. Let's

3346
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,760
get some students who also have some

3347
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:53,040
family business background. Let's get

3348
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,480
some students who also have a sporting

3349
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,560
background. Can we get someone from the

3350
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,040
army also in the cohort? Right. So now

3351
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,719
with that uh increased number of

3352
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,639
applications, we can play all of these

3353
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:04,159
interesting. Talk to me about the

3354
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,159
importance of diversity because I've

3355
02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:08,239
seen this multiple times from foreign

3356
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:11,280
universities that we need a diverse

3357
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:14,239
cohort from Namibia to India to Europe.

3358
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:17,119
We need people from everywhere. Okay, we

3359
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:18,960
need people from diverse backgrounds.

3360
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:20,800
Now I don't really understand how does

3361
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,480
that connect to a great business school

3362
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:24,159
experience. So can you help me

3363
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:26,080
understand what is the thinking behind

3364
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:28,080
this diversification?

3365
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:31,119
You know uh I want to give you my

3366
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:33,119
personal example. Uh, one of my

3367
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:34,639
classmates when I was in college that I

3368
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:36,800
was partnered up with on a project was

3369
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:39,199
Lebanese. Lebanese. Okay. His name is

3370
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:42,000
Randy Re. He's my co-founder of my first

3371
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:44,960
company, Outgrow, right? The amount that

3372
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,599
I've learned from him, right, about his

3373
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,440
part of the world, it literally opened

3374
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:52,159
up my brain, right? Because until I met

3375
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:53,760
him, I had only be I had only been fed a

3376
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:55,760
certain narrative about the Middle East,

3377
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:57,119
for example. Like I mean, you know what

3378
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,280
I mean, right? With the Middle East. No,

3379
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:01,679
no, tell me. I mean I think we were

3380
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:02,880
always given this uh very western view

3381
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,760
of Middle East that you know it's

3382
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,760
terrorism and it's backward and it's you

3383
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:10,880
know a certain religion being completely

3384
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:13,199
extremist this that right when I met him

3385
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,760
right all of that balloon of mine that

3386
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:18,320
bubble of mine truly burst here's a guy

3387
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:20,800
who's incredibly smart who's telling me

3388
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,880
stories of how Lebanon came to be and

3389
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,639
what is a civil war going on over there

3390
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:26,159
and how the prime minister and the

3391
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:27,360
president and the vice president are

3392
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:28,960
always going to be from three different

3393
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,199
religions. and how that absolutely makes

3394
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,599
no sense. And how when he was a child in

3395
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:35,840
a school bus going to his school when he

3396
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:38,239
crossed over a landmine, the car behind

3397
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:41,199
him actually completely exploded and he

3398
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:44,239
just just about got saved. And about how

3399
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:47,199
in his in his community entrepreneurship

3400
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:48,719
is not looked at with any risk, right?

3401
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:50,400
They they don't think entrepreneurship

3402
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,880
is risky. You know why? Because they

3403
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:54,320
they saw missiles every day in the sky,

3404
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,880
right? So for them starting a company is

3405
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:58,239
not risky. So here's Randy who left an

3406
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,480
offer from Silver Lake which is one of

3407
02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:03,280
the largest private equity funds to come

3408
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:05,920
and join me and help me build outgrow

3409
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,679
right my my view of Middle East

3410
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,599
completely changed I realized how

3411
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:11,040
entrepreneurial those people are just

3412
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:13,360
because of the kind of you know growth

3413
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:15,199
they have seen just so that's an example

3414
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:17,719
I think diversity that's why opens your

3415
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:20,880
brain right it makes your sponge more

3416
02:03:17,719 --> 02:03:24,159
absorb with a higher absorption right

3417
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:26,239
yeah you know I understood how inclusive

3418
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:28,719
Middle East is when I went to Abu Dhabi

3419
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:31,239
and Dubai. There you go. Like the waiter

3420
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:33,920
over there is from

3421
02:03:31,239 --> 02:03:36,719
um Jukos Slovakia. How do you pronounce

3422
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:39,119
it? Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia. Then

3423
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:41,360
the driver is from Pakistan and you go

3424
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:43,760
to the hotel there you see Indians. So

3425
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:45,760
it is so diverse. But from the outside

3426
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:47,119
if you I mean back then now Dubai and

3427
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,119
Abu Dhabi have managed to change their

3428
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:50,639
perspective. But then back then 10 years

3429
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:52,480
back had you asked somebody how is Dubai

3430
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,480
or Abu Dhabi? they would so they would

3431
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:56,560
say you know what it's quite exclusive

3432
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:58,320
they don't really include people but I

3433
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,000
would say that uh pe there are some

3434
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,239
states in India that everybody's aware

3435
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,520
of there we've gone there and we've felt

3436
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:05,679
like this is not our country because

3437
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,360
people have made us feel that way right

3438
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:09,679
because they always value a certain

3439
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:11,040
language over others and they often make

3440
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:12,880
you feel as if this is not your country

3441
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:14,199
and there is evident racism that's going

3442
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:17,440
out there

3443
02:04:14,199 --> 02:04:19,520
right but now tell me how does this how

3444
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:20,960
now I I can I can share my experience

3445
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,400
with you but I want to know from you

3446
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,280
because you are actually seeing this

3447
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:27,679
happen on a daily basis as to how do

3448
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:30,159
these experiences shape the business

3449
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:31,599
acumen of a person. No, I think business

3450
02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:33,760
at the end of the day is a product of

3451
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:35,920
your understanding of the world, right?

3452
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,360
Like for example, when I started Teta,

3453
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:38,480
we're looking at students from all over

3454
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:41,199
the world. Currently, we have students

3455
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:43,840
from 45 different countries. So, I have

3456
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:46,480
to understand the psyche of the people

3457
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:49,840
in those 45 countries. What kind of

3458
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:52,560
marketing message would sell in Japan

3459
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:54,000
versus China versus US versus Mexico?

3460
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,159
What are the kind of key messages that

3461
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,159
will maybe work in the UK but not in

3462
02:04:56,159 --> 02:05:01,360
Germany? Right? So I think when you are

3463
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:03,360
exposed to people in a college setting

3464
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,880
from different backgrounds, I think your

3465
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,480
understanding of the world also becomes

3466
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,719
that much deeper. So when you are

3467
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:10,560
building a product, you build it for the

3468
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:13,040
world. Not just for Bombay or

3469
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,960
Maharashtra or India or Asia, but for

3470
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:17,280
the world. Right? In fact, when I was at

3471
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:19,199
Masters Union and only targeting India,

3472
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:21,040
I felt that I could do more, which is

3473
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:22,719
where the idea for Teta came in. Said,

3474
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:25,360
"Hey, listen, you know, we have a great

3475
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:27,280
product. Why not sell from India to the

3476
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:28,719
world?" And that's how the idea for Teta

3477
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:32,159
came in. And we successfully were able

3478
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:34,080
to market ourselves in 45 countries that

3479
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:36,880
120 kids from 45 countries took a chance

3480
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:39,280
on an Indian college started by an

3481
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,199
Indian founder, right? When has that

3482
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,040
happened before? I think that could I

3483
02:05:41,199 --> 02:05:46,000
could only do that because I had that

3484
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:47,520
exposure of all of those people. U when

3485
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,960
I was in college, I had friends from all

3486
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:52,320
of these countries. Do these cultural

3487
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:55,280
exposures also help you find

3488
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,560
opportunities in India? Because you

3489
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:58,400
understand that something is better

3490
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:00,639
abroad. Yeah, absolutely. So, I learned

3491
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:02,320
how to speak Chinese. Okay. Why? In

3492
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:04,080
college because you had to take a second

3493
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:07,760
language. And I was like, it's either

3494
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:09,360
Spanish or Chinese. Uh and to be very

3495
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:11,239
honest, I wanted to impress a Chinese

3496
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:14,400
girl who I really

3497
02:06:11,239 --> 02:06:16,560
liked. Um so I learned Chinese, right?

3498
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:18,480
And as a part of my learning experience,

3499
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,719
I also got to go to China and spend 3 4

3500
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:23,119
months living there, right? And I really

3501
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:26,159
understood why Alibaba is Alibaba, what

3502
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:28,400
is TA, what is T-Mol? And these were

3503
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:30,480
these large companies in China. This is

3504
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:32,960
pre Flipkart, pre Amazon coming to

3505
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:34,320
India. And so I really understood what

3506
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,239
the future of India may look like

3507
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:38,400
because I could see India from a lens of

3508
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:40,079
China. Give me a few examples. Exactly

3509
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:42,719
this right like when I was in China this

3510
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:44,320
was 20101 Flipkart and Amazon had not

3511
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,320
become a huge thing right Misho had not

3512
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:47,679
even been born and at that time I'm

3513
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:50,719
seeing in China all of these companies

3514
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:52,000
like Tao T- mall Alibaba really growing

3515
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:53,360
right I could see like the fintech

3516
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,560
revolution in China happening before it

3517
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:57,360
happened in India of course in India

3518
02:06:54,560 --> 02:07:01,360
took over with UPI but I could literally

3519
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:02,719
see India's future in China's present. M

3520
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:05,199
bro you know what this is what reminds

3521
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:07,520
me of Jamshi Tata you know he was also a

3522
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:09,280
very passionate traveler and he

3523
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,159
understood the value of steel when he

3524
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:14,000
was attending a lecture where this

3525
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:16,560
lecturer said that the nation that

3526
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,320
understands the value of steel will reap

3527
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,560
its worth in gold eventually came back

3528
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:22,320
to start Tisco it's amazing understood

3529
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:24,639
so what you're saying is it gives you a

3530
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,440
perspective into the future when it

3531
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:29,599
comes to more developed countries like

3532
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:31,199
China and you know Saraka told me

3533
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:34,239
something very interesting about what

3534
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:36,719
happens when you go to less developed

3535
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:38,639
countries like Africa. Okay. Have you

3536
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,239
ever had any experiences of going to

3537
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:42,159
less developed countries? I also studied

3538
02:07:40,239 --> 02:07:43,679
abroad in Ghana. Okay. In Ara. I spent

3539
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:45,920
three months there as well as part.

3540
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,400
Yeah. In Ghana. Okay. In Accra. So what

3541
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,320
did you learn from those experiences? I

3542
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:51,599
think there it's more about identifying

3543
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,320
opportunities. You know one thing I

3544
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:57,040
found in Ghana. Very interesting. They

3545
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:59,920
have a huge mosquito problem, right? But

3546
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:03,199
you know how in India we have electrics.

3547
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:07,040
I couldn't find electric allouts in all

3548
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:07,040
of Ghana in 2010

3549
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:14,239
summer

3550
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:16,159
electric. Is that because they had a

3551
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:18,719
better solution or no solution? No, they

3552
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:21,599
had just learned to live with it, right?

3553
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:25,440
I was like, dude, why has no one come to

3554
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:26,719
Ghana to sell electric allouts? Wow.

3555
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,760
By the way, I was too young. I I should

3556
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:29,920
have done something about it. Maybe I

3557
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,440
would have built a large company there.

3558
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:36,199
But it had still stuck with me

3559
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:39,280
opportunity. I had seen something in

3560
02:08:36,199 --> 02:08:41,760
India just like you could see the future

3561
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:43,840
of India from China. You could see the

3562
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,599
future of African countries being and

3563
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:48,800
see the solutions to the problems that

3564
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,320
they are facing if you are in India but

3565
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,079
you go there and you spot the problems

3566
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:53,679
and that's where the marriage of problem

3567
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:55,840
and solution happens eventually to

3568
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:58,960
result into a large company. Yeah. You

3569
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:01,840
know, uh my my granddad tells me this

3570
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:03,760
that back in the day there were no modes

3571
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:07,599
of transportation, right? You could only

3572
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:09,360
perhaps in your lifetime go 100 km in

3573
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:10,719
either direction. That's about it,

3574
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:13,280
right? Because maybe you had a bulock

3575
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:15,960
card. That's about it. But still at that

3576
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:18,719
time, very early days, you always had

3577
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:20,320
pilgrimages. And pilgrimages were made

3578
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:22,320
of course for religious reasons, but the

3579
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:24,079
true reason behind them was for you to

3580
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,280
really burst your bubbles. Yeah. Right.

3581
02:09:24,079 --> 02:09:27,520
Right? So that you get out of your echo

3582
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:29,360
chamber and see the world beyond your

3583
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:31,599
understanding of the world. And I think

3584
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:34,079
that's when your perspective truly

3585
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:37,520
broadens. In fact, um I was never a very

3586
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:40,400
strong believer of rapido until I saw

3587
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:43,679
Indonesia. Yeah. And then I read this

3588
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:46,199
Ken article which spoke about how bike

3589
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:50,119
sharing had become a very big deal in

3590
02:09:46,199 --> 02:09:53,440
Indonesia. Okay. But

3591
02:09:50,119 --> 02:09:56,239
then how big a deal it was until I went

3592
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:58,960
to Bali and then saw what a big deal

3593
02:09:56,239 --> 02:10:00,400
bike sharing was. And then that's where

3594
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,880
I understood that there were some

3595
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:06,800
similarities between Bali and

3596
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:08,599
Mumbai. You can offered a cab but if you

3597
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:11,920
go by cab then you'll get stuck in

3598
02:10:08,599 --> 02:10:14,000
traffic. Two wheelers have a very huge

3599
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,840
market so there are a lot of people

3600
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,480
riding two wheelers and the income

3601
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:21,119
levels are quite similar. India 2 is

3602
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:23,280
very similar to that of Indonesia. And

3603
02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:25,920
that's when I realized that this is

3604
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:27,440
basically India 2 capitalizing on an

3605
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:30,400
opportunity which is now being

3606
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:32,239
capitalized in India. But then I was

3607
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:34,880
just thinking that had I come over here

3608
02:10:32,239 --> 02:10:37,199
10 years ago. I would have seen the

3609
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:39,119
evolution of bike sharing only to

3610
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:40,639
realize that it is quite possible in

3611
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:43,440
spite of all skepticism in the world

3612
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:47,440
that bike sharing is a huge market

3613
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:50,159
provided you have small roads. um

3614
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:52,800
similar per capita income. People being

3615
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:54,440
in hurry and they always wanting to go

3616
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,800
somewhere

3617
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:59,119
where the average order value is quite

3618
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:01,360
less. For example, if you go to a mall

3619
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:03,760
with your friends and then you're

3620
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:05,360
willing to spend 10,000 rupees, then you

3621
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,639
would obviously take a cab. But what

3622
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:10,000
I've also understood is that if you want

3623
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:10,000
to go to a kirana store close

3624
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:17,280
by, right? So it is also based on the

3625
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:20,239
nature of the activity and the cost of

3626
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:22,719
that activity which also dictates which

3627
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:24,320
mode of transport you take and how much

3628
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:26,960
are you willing to spend on it no matter

3629
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:29,360
who you are. And this is what helped me

3630
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,840
understand. Oh my god. This is how you

3631
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:34,920
travel to different places, understand

3632
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:38,560
similarities like you said ghana

3633
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:40,400
mosquito repellent mosquito repent and

3634
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,400
then find a solution which is already

3635
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,400
existing and you just be a mediator to

3636
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:46,000
it trader which brings it to life which

3637
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:47,520
is so interesting. So interesting. Yeah.

3638
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,159
I know. Now when it comes to your

3639
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:52,719
students at Tetto now you felt it, I

3640
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:54,079
felt it. Um but that is because we

3641
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:56,079
understand the importance of travel

3642
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:58,800
right. All of this happened not by

3643
02:11:56,079 --> 02:12:02,239
design but by chance and you're making

3644
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,280
this happen by design with tettor. What

3645
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:06,960
exactly are the experiences of your

3646
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:09,520
students that have brought in practical

3647
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:11,280
business lessons by spotting these gaps

3648
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,800
in different parts of the world now? So

3649
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,880
the teta curriculum only is super

3650
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:16,639
interesting. So they have to travel to a

3651
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,719
different country every term. So term

3652
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:20,480
one is in Dubai, term two is in India,

3653
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:23,440
term three is in Singapore, term four is

3654
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:25,840
in Ghana, term five is in Rio, term six

3655
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:27,520
is in New York, term seven is in Milan.

3656
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,639
So that's the circuit that the students

3657
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,840
are completing in four years. They're

3658
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:31,599
spending four and a half months in each

3659
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:33,040
of these countries. In each of these

3660
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:35,679
countries, they have to build a business

3661
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:37,920
on a specific theme. So in Dubai, they

3662
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:39,679
all have to build a e-commerce drop

3663
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:41,280
shipping business. When they come to

3664
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:42,800
India, they all have to build a D2C

3665
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:44,560
brand. They learn about branding, they

3666
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:46,800
learn about marketing. When they go to

3667
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:50,960
Singapore, they have to build a hardware

3668
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:52,719
product and pre-ell it on Kickstarter.

3669
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,719
Then they go to Ghana, they have to

3670
02:12:52,719 --> 02:12:56,000
build an NGO. When they go to Rio, they

3671
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:57,599
have to build a sustainability green

3672
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,520
venture. When they go to New York, they

3673
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:01,440
have to build an AI rapper. And finally,

3674
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:03,199
in Milan, they have to build a YouTube

3675
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,599
channel. AI rapper, you said. Yeah.

3676
02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:08,079
Essentially, an AI company uh leveraging

3677
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:10,079
existing AI tools, right? And lastly,

3678
02:13:08,079 --> 02:13:11,520
lastly, in Milan, in Europe, they have

3679
02:13:10,079 --> 02:13:13,040
to build a YouTube channel. YouTube

3680
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,599
channel. Absolutely. Bro, what is the

3681
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:17,440
logic behind each one of these subjects

3682
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:20,400
specifically being done in a particular

3683
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:22,400
country? Yeah, so basically when you're

3684
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:24,480
playing a video game, you go level one,

3685
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:26,560
level two, level three. Each level is

3686
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:28,320
increasing in the order of difficulty,

3687
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:29,760
right? So, drop shipping business that

3688
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,679
they do in term one is level one of

3689
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:33,360
difficulty. Okay, drop shipping requires

3690
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:35,199
basic trading. You have to be able to

3691
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:37,280
build a basic website. You have to get

3692
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:38,800
some products listed from a supplier and

3693
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,760
the supplier only will drop ship those

3694
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:42,000
products. So, you don't have to worry

3695
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,679
about the last mile delivery, etc.,

3696
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,560
Right? It's a very basic form of

3697
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:48,400
business that gets you warmed up for

3698
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:52,239
term two where you have to build your

3699
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:53,360
own brand. Now, right in term three, not

3700
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:55,280
only do you have to build your brand

3701
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:57,040
while building a hardware product, but

3702
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:59,040
also understand the hardware science and

3703
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:01,280
the engineering of it. One level of

3704
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:03,760
difficulty above. So, trader, brand,

3705
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:06,239
product. First, term one is trading,

3706
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,679
learn trading. Term two is branding.

3707
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:09,520
Term three is you learn the product

3708
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:11,599
also. So on and so forth, right? So

3709
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:13,760
every term you have to build this 0ero

3710
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:15,320
to1 journey and in this journey you

3711
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,760
learn something about building a

3712
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:19,280
business right and your grades come from

3713
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,840
your revenue your margin your profit

3714
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:23,840
your NPS and your OS okay right but

3715
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,040
doesn't that really depend on the market

3716
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:26,560
that they choose and the product that

3717
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:28,480
they choose absolutely for example if

3718
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:30,000
I'm choosing a skincare brand whereas

3719
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:32,639
the other person is choosing something

3720
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,920
like let's say allout kis then the

3721
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:36,480
allout guy is obviously going to make

3722
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:38,239
more money than I right he's going to

3723
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,639
make more money than me correct but when

3724
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:43,840
it comes to my passion. My passion lies

3725
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:47,040
in skincare. As a result, I'm by default

3726
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:49,920
um I'm by default bound to trade with

3727
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:51,920
low AOV products. So how do these first

3728
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:53,920
of all if it's low AOV then you should

3729
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,400
compensate with higher volumes. Okay.

3730
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:58,079
Let's say you have low AOV and low

3731
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:00,159
volumes but you are passionate about the

3732
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:02,239
product then it will reflect in the NPS.

3733
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:04,719
So there'll be huh so there'll be some

3734
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:06,000
metric that will be going for you right

3735
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:08,560
and of course there's a more holistic

3736
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,400
judgment also. not only on revenue,

3737
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:12,239
right? But what we have found is that

3738
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:13,440
when you build a business, let's say in

3739
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:15,840
term one, you have to build this trading

3740
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:17,040
business. You'll need some knowledge of

3741
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,639
accounting because you have to maintain

3742
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:20,400
your books of accounts and file for

3743
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:21,599
taxes. You'll need some knowledge of

3744
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,960
digital marketing because you have to

3745
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:24,800
run those ads on Facebook, Instagram,

3746
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,119
LinkedIn, everywhere. You need some

3747
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:28,560
understanding of legalities because you

3748
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:30,400
have to build and set up a company in

3749
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,760
Dubai which is very difficult to do in

3750
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:34,239
some ways for an international student

3751
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:38,079
to come in. Now we have all of these

3752
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:39,840
courses. Okay. Oh, got it. So, this is

3753
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:41,800
the Elon Musk way that you spoke about,

3754
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,800
correct? Which is

3755
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,800
refrigerator

3756
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:53,119
fix. In this case, there is a there is a

3757
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:55,199
business that you're supposed to build.

3758
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:56,719
In this case, it's let's say e-commerce.

3759
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:59,520
So, you're essentially a trader, which

3760
02:15:56,719 --> 02:16:01,920
means website, legalities, registering

3761
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:03,679
the company, performance, marketing, all

3762
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,440
of it, you're supposed to understand.

3763
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:06,880
And also you have to understand which

3764
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:08,079
product to choose of course that's the

3765
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,199
main thing the market research you'll

3766
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:11,119
have to you also understand how to do

3767
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:13,119
good market research how to do surveys

3768
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:16,159
how to figure out how to uh negotiate

3769
02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:17,599
with suppliers how to manage RTO return

3770
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:19,599
to origin because that happens like

3771
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:22,239
crazy when you're doing drop shipping so

3772
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,440
all of these are things that you learn

3773
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:25,360
as you're building the business and all

3774
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:26,480
of these workshops is the curriculum

3775
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,800
essentially do you provide them with

3776
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:29,560
initial capital for this so all of these

3777
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,599
eight

3778
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:33,359
businesses all of these eight businesses

3779
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:35,200
that we have identified if you think

3780
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:37,760
about it. They actually require almost

3781
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,960
zero capital because drop shipping does

3782
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:40,719
not require any capital because there is

3783
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:43,040
no moq involved. When you're building a

3784
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:44,719
D2C brand again you're using gorilla

3785
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:46,479
marketing Instagram creating content to

3786
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:48,639
sell your product again hardly anything

3787
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:50,160
required. When you're doing Kickstarter

3788
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:51,599
it completely depends on your design and

3789
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:54,160
your branding and your selling

3790
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:55,359
capabilities on Kickstarter. Right? So

3791
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,960
each of these businesses have been

3792
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:58,800
identified to not require a lot of

3793
02:16:56,960 --> 02:17:00,479
capital and whatever little capital you

3794
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:02,319
need that we will give. Right? Right. So

3795
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:03,679
in term one, we need we understand that

3796
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:04,960
the students need some capital to get

3797
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:06,800
started when it comes to performance

3798
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:08,479
marketing. So we give them a $500

3799
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:10,080
budget. Got it. Which also tells them

3800
02:17:08,479 --> 02:17:12,000
that you can start with zero capital.

3801
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:14,399
Exactly. Got it. Frugality. Frugality.

3802
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,319
But the most important thing is that

3803
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:18,800
these are students who have never built

3804
02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:20,800
a business before. And they've always

3805
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:23,679
been told in their lives that get a good

3806
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:25,880
job, get a good job. But now in term one

3807
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:29,040
only when they have made even $5,000 in

3808
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:30,639
revenue, there is a switch that turns on

3809
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,559
in their head. They become

3810
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:34,479
entrepreneurial. They realize that they

3811
02:17:32,559 --> 02:17:36,800
can be paid for something that's not

3812
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:38,319
their time. Correct. Right. That they

3813
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:40,240
can build a business. That if they

3814
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:41,760
continue at it had they gotten the right

3815
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:43,040
team, had they gotten the marketing just

3816
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:45,760
right, they could have made not just

3817
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:47,760
5,000 but 50,000 also. And the DNA

3818
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,080
changes. I have seen this DNA change

3819
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:52,960
every year for the last 5 years. Yeah.

3820
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:55,280
proven why is there an NGO over here? Um

3821
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:58,160
when we are in Ghana right we realize

3822
02:17:55,280 --> 02:18:00,160
that um there's a great opportunity in

3823
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:02,319
Ghana to have a lot of impact because

3824
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:05,040
Ghana is really one step behind India in

3825
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:07,840
terms of growth right and we also want

3826
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:10,319
students to appreciate the social impact

3827
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,559
that businesses can create them to

3828
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:13,920
become hardcore capitalists as a college

3829
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:17,519
it's also our responsibility to give

3830
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:20,719
them a balance right so making them

3831
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:22,000
build an NGO raise funds for an NGO be

3832
02:18:20,719 --> 02:18:24,240
really close to the people they are

3833
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,519
impacting. We feel that also is an

3834
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:27,840
incredibly important experience that

3835
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:29,679
college should provide right so that's

3836
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:32,639
why we chose NGO plus raising funds for

3837
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:34,719
an NGO is much harder right than raising

3838
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:36,639
funds for a business and so they should

3839
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:37,920
also learn that right uh we also want

3840
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:40,319
them to be sensitive we also want them

3841
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:42,000
to be uh empathetic individuals and I

3842
02:18:40,319 --> 02:18:44,559
think this does a great job of it got it

3843
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,240
so this is empathy then let's come to

3844
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:48,479
sustainability startup is that correct

3845
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:51,840
yes so they have to build something

3846
02:18:48,479 --> 02:18:54,319
which furthers the green agenda right

3847
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:54,319
trading

3848
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:05,120
India right but west Sweden Norway

3849
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:08,000
Germany even South America even US

3850
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:09,439
everyone's only speaking about ESG right

3851
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,080
and that's a very big part of every

3852
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:14,359
business every strategy explain ESG in

3853
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:16,960
two lines ESG is environment

3854
02:19:14,359 --> 02:19:18,479
sustainability governance right so it's

3855
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:20,319
how do you make sure that whatever work

3856
02:19:18,479 --> 02:19:22,639
that you're doing whether it's mining

3857
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:24,399
whether it's AI whether Whether it's

3858
02:19:22,639 --> 02:19:26,240
building furniture, how that is

3859
02:19:24,399 --> 02:19:28,080
sustainable, how that is green and how

3860
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:29,920
that's not negatively adversely

3861
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:32,080
impacting the environment which we live

3862
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,280
in, right? So all the energy businesses,

3863
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:34,719
you know, green energy businesses,

3864
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,479
renewable energy businesses fall in that

3865
02:19:34,719 --> 02:19:38,240
category. All the carbon trading

3866
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:42,479
businesses, right? Where you're actually

3867
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:44,160
literally u like sewing forests and then

3868
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:46,000
offsetting carbon with that that comes

3869
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:47,920
into the picture. So that's a huge

3870
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,880
economy in the west with Tetto where we

3871
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:51,200
have students from all of these

3872
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:52,880
countries. We have to really be mindful

3873
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:55,040
about making sure that ESG is a very

3874
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:56,080
important part of the curriculum. And

3875
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,640
one more thing, you know, we were

3876
02:19:56,080 --> 02:20:03,479
speaking about how to get top 10 ranks.

3877
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:05,920
Most rankings make ESG almost

3878
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:07,280
compulsory in your curriculum, right?

3879
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:08,600
So, if you don't have ESG in your

3880
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,720
curriculum, you can forget about

3881
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:13,120
rankings. All these global rankings,

3882
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:15,040
they really value both you being ESG

3883
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,960
compliant and you teaching ESG to

3884
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:18,640
students.

3885
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,600
And Rio is a great place to do it

3886
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:22,080
because you know you're in the middle of

3887
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,359
Amazon rainforest etc all of that a lot

3888
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:25,720
of very interesting carbon offset

3889
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:28,399
businesses can be created there

3890
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:30,160
wonderful or YouTube it's pretty obvious

3891
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:32,479
so now let's come back to the masters

3892
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:32,479
union

3893
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:37,680
model perspectives in fact that also

3894
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,319
comes back to masters union where you

3895
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,319
also give students diverse experiences

3896
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:45,280
but before that I want to understand the

3897
02:20:42,319 --> 02:20:45,280
model in terms of

3898
02:20:45,319 --> 02:20:51,399
teaching school professor to anywhere

3899
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:54,720
between 10 to 20 LPN

3900
02:20:51,399 --> 02:20:56,479
package but this is again capex heavy

3901
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:58,399
and the problem with teachers is not the

3902
02:20:56,479 --> 02:21:00,399
salary that they get but the experience

3903
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:03,760
that they have for example when it comes

3904
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:05,520
to YouTube YouTube is such a evolving

3905
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:07,280
space social media in general is such an

3906
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:09,280
evolving space that had you spoken to me

3907
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,560
2 years ago in fact we did and I told

3908
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,680
you different things and today I'm

3909
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:13,439
telling you different things in fact

3910
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,359
when I speak to Ranir I hear about

3911
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:17,280
different things as to how a social

3912
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:20,160
media entrepreneur reneur can turn

3913
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,680
himself from a scrappy entrepreneur to a

3914
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:23,040
full-fledged organization. That's what

3915
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:24,399
I've learned from Reanir and that's only

3916
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:27,200
because he's one of the first people to

3917
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:29,120
do it. So when these industries are so

3918
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:31,920
quickly evolving and when it comes to

3919
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:34,080
DTC also 3 years ago everybody thought

3920
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:36,000
D2C is the next big thing. Today we've

3921
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,920
understood that D2C is only a marketing

3922
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,319
channel for you to go offline but the

3923
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:44,319
final destination is offline. Back then

3924
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:46,319
we thought that the likes of D2C will go

3925
02:21:44,319 --> 02:21:49,359
on to beat the legends like HL. Now

3926
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:51,120
we've understood that these companies

3927
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:52,960
are companies that will scale and

3928
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:55,439
eventually get acquired by HL to become

3929
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:57,760
a part of the legacy brands. So our

3930
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:00,080
perspectives are evolving. So if a

3931
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,600
professor has 10 years of experience, I

3932
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:03,120
wouldn't call that professor the best

3933
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:05,120
professor. In fact, I would consider

3934
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:07,760
that 10 years of experience to be 10

3935
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:09,760
years of redundant knowledge. Now my my

3936
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:11,359
dad says this thing that if a faculty

3937
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:12,640
comes and says that I have 10 years of

3938
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:14,399
teaching experience you don't have 10

3939
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:16,240
years of teaching experience you have

3940
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:18,479
one year of teaching experience 10 times

3941
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:20,800
over correct that is exactly what I was

3942
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:22,800
about to say because that's 10 years of

3943
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:25,120
stagnation right because that's 10 years

3944
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:26,880
of you being away from the market and

3945
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:29,920
when it comes to YouTube also if you ask

3946
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:31,280
a YouTuber who existed back in 2014 to

3947
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:32,880
come and deliver a lecture on how to

3948
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,760
grow on YouTube it would not make sense

3949
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:37,200
at all. So how do you strike a balance

3950
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,479
between and but at the same time

3951
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:40,160
full-time professors are important

3952
02:22:38,479 --> 02:22:41,439
because they are the ones who build a

3953
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:44,000
connect with the student right they're

3954
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:45,680
always there um but for example when I

3955
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,680
come to teach at masters union I don't

3956
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:49,840
have the luxury even though I want to I

3957
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,600
can't spend beyond a certain time with

3958
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:54,160
the students so how do you strike a

3959
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:56,000
balance between getting people who can

3960
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:57,840
teach the students the first principles

3961
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,200
the concepts the textbook stuff which

3962
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:01,439
are absolutely important like customer

3963
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:04,160
acquisition cost and lifetime value at

3964
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:06,960
the same time balance that with the

3965
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:09,439
latest knowledge of what's happening in

3966
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:11,960
the market and then marry them together

3967
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:14,960
to give the student the perfect balance

3968
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:17,120
of the the first principles of business

3969
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:18,640
and the most important principles of

3970
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,319
modern business. You know, you have

3971
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:21,760
actually answered my question. Uh you

3972
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:24,160
you've actually answered your own

3973
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:27,359
question. Okay. So, we have a 30 304

3974
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:29,760
model. Okay. 30% 30% 40%.

3975
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:31,760
30% of my faculty that's going to be

3976
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,160
teaching the students are my full-time

3977
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:36,720
faculty who are teaching core first

3978
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:39,120
principles business courses right like

3979
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:41,600
basics of accounting I do not need to

3980
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:44,160
bring in a McKenzie partner to teach

3981
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:46,000
basics of accounting I need a professor

3982
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:48,319
who can really be very rigorous making

3983
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,640
sure that

3984
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:53,359
right so for some basic fundamental

3985
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:54,960
courses I use 30% of my faculty

3986
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:56,720
full-time faculty they're resident

3987
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,800
they're on my full-time roles They're

3988
02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:00,479
all faculty from IM's usually who come

3989
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:02,479
and teach right and usually some of them

3990
02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:04,160
have some work experience as well but it

3991
02:24:02,479 --> 02:24:06,160
does not matter because what they're

3992
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:09,920
teaching does not require as much work

3993
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:12,640
experience that's 30%. 30% of my faculty

3994
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:13,920
is visiting faculty from abroad. Right?

3995
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:16,399
These are usually professors from

3996
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:19,200
Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Wharton. We

3997
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:22,000
request them to come to India for a few

3998
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:24,080
weeks at a time and teach our students

3999
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,479
unique and interesting principles that

4000
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:31,040
they are doing research on. Example like

4001
02:24:26,479 --> 02:24:32,960
for example um we have uh we have

4002
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:35,200
someone whose name is Edward Rogers who

4003
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:37,840
is a former NASA chief knowledge

4004
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:40,000
officer, right? and he has done some

4005
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,760
amazing research on system studies right

4006
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,920
how to create large systems and how to

4007
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,160
do systems thinking right these systems

4008
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:48,080
are I mean he has studied them in the

4009
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:49,680
context of NASA and space shuttles and

4010
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:51,120
all of that but he's then come up with

4011
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:52,800
his own theories and frameworks that he

4012
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:55,280
teaches at business schools in the US

4013
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:57,760
right so every year at least twice he

4014
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,520
comes to India to teach at mast's union

4015
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:01,120
and he teaches these mental models and

4016
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,280
these systems thinking models that

4017
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:05,120
students absolutely love right now I

4018
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:06,800
could not have gotten that kind of input

4019
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:09,280
from my full-time faculty

4020
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:11,840
neither from a practitioner right so 30%

4021
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:14,240
of my faculty are people like this who

4022
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:16,720
visit mostly from the US teach people

4023
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:18,560
very specific things that we think are

4024
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:20,800
very important in a entrepreneurs

4025
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:22,560
journey but how do you think that when

4026
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:25,359
we started building our curriculum right

4027
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:27,439
we met with a lot of recruiters we met

4028
02:25:25,359 --> 02:25:29,439
with a lot of practitioners CEOs MDs

4029
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:30,399
partners essentially our customers right

4030
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:32,160
these are the customers who are going to

4031
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:33,840
recruit our students in the future and

4032
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:36,160
we asked them what is it that you need

4033
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,319
right so and we made a list of all the

4034
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:39,760
skills that they find useful and then we

4035
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:41,520
worked backwards from those skills came

4036
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:43,439
up with learning outcomes and found the

4037
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,680
faculty that best could teach those

4038
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:48,800
learning outcomes. Right? So if like for

4039
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:51,280
example I remember when we had met um

4040
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:53,359
someone from BCG right and we share our

4041
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:55,040
campus with BCG they had told us very

4042
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:56,479
clearly that they really believe in

4043
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,920
mental models and they really believe in

4044
02:25:56,479 --> 02:26:00,000
certain frameworks that everyone should

4045
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,920
know right so I literally I remember

4046
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,920
going on LinkedIn and searching for that

4047
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,920
mental model framework on LinkedIn and

4048
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:07,439
to see who are the trainers for that

4049
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:08,800
right and I found someone who eventually

4050
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:10,640
turned out to be Edward Rogers who we

4051
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,760
then invited and he came and he taught

4052
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:15,920
right so first 30% is full-time faculty

4053
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:17,359
second 30% % is this visiting faculty

4054
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:21,120
mostly from the US teaching very

4055
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:23,840
specific things then 40% of my faculty

4056
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:26,399
are practitioners these are CEOs MDs

4057
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:29,280
CXOs partners at various companies

4058
02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:32,240
mostly are recruiters who come and teach

4059
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:35,200
skills that they actually hire for right

4060
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:38,319
so for example um you we you spoke about

4061
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:40,880
Jiraj earlier right he's a uh angel

4062
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:43,120
investor right he runs uh Indian Silicon

4063
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:45,640
Valley right and there is nobody better

4064
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:47,840
than H to teach angel

4065
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:49,439
investing, right? So we actually call

4066
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:51,760
him, he spends a lot of his time on

4067
02:26:49,439 --> 02:26:53,520

4090
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:39,680
20our course deal done right so 40% of

4091
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,600
my faculty are practitioners like these

4092
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:43,479
there's a very popular course taught by

4093
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:46,000
Mr. Rajat Matur who's the MD of Morgan

4094
02:27:43,479 --> 02:27:47,520
Stanley. He teaches people decisions.

4095
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,319
How do you make decisions of hiring,

4096
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:51,600
firing, promotions, increments, bonuses?

4097
02:27:50,319 --> 02:27:53,040
It's a very important course if you

4098
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:55,600
think about it. Nobody ever teaches it.

4099
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:56,880
It wasn't a course at Watton, right? But

4100
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:58,319
the way he teaches it is through a

4101
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:59,760
simulation, right? He's drafted this

4102
02:27:58,319 --> 02:28:01,439
very interesting simulation. People play

4103
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,000
with it. It's very hands-on, very

4104
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:05,200
experiential. Only he can teach that. No

4105
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,800
full-time faculty will be able to teach

4106
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:09,200
that. No visiting faculty from the US

4107
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:11,040
can teach that. at him who's run the

4108
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:13,200
entire people organization at Morgan

4109
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:15,200
Stanley is the best equipped to teach

4110
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:16,680
that course. Correct. Right. Now talk to

4111
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:20,160
me about

4112
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:22,640
the remuneration of each categories.

4113
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:26,000
Okay. Let's talk about the first segment

4114
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:28,399
which is the full-time faculty. Okay. Um

4115
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,920
I think hourly rates would be the best.

4116
02:28:28,399 --> 02:28:31,439
No. So full-time faculty they're on your

4117
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,720
role. So you're paying them annually

4118
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:35,920
essentially. Okay. You have annual

4119
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:38,960
contract from for a fresh faculty who's

4120
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:42,399
just finished his PhD from a top IM

4121
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:45,359
maybe 30 to 40 lakhs. Okay. Right. And

4122
02:28:42,399 --> 02:28:47,680
this can go up to 1 cr 2 crores 3 crores

4123
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:49,520
for a star faculty. Got it. When it

4124
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:52,319
comes to visiting faculties, you pay

4125
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:54,080
them for in 20our increments. 20our

4126
02:28:52,319 --> 02:28:55,520
increments. What does that mean? So

4127
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:57,120
basically they are coming to India to

4128
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:59,040
teach your course which and each course

4129
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:01,520
is 20 hours usually, right? So you pay

4130
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:03,040
them for a 20our bracket. Okay. If

4131
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:05,040
they're teaching two cohorts, then that

4132
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:07,680
becomes 40 hours. They're teaching three

4133
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:10,560
cohorts, that becomes 60. The rule of

4134
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:14,240
thumb here is on an hourly basis, you're

4135
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:16,560
paying them $1,000. $1,000 per hour.

4136
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:18,640
That's $20,000. Does that include travel

4137
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:20,840
and stay? No. For travel and stay, we

4138
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:24,319
give them a $5,000

4139
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:25,520
u, you know, like a uh allowance, and

4140
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:26,399
they can use that allowance however they

4141
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,520
want. If they want to travel business,

4142
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:29,200
they can travel business. They want to

4143
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:30,800
travel economy and save that money, they

4144
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:32,560
save that money. Got it. And for

4145
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:34,240
practitioners, it's mostly free, right?

4146
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:36,800
No, no, no. So, you know what we have

4147
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:39,120
realized is that if a practitioner comes

4148
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:40,800
and says, "I'll do it for free." We say,

4149
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:43,520
"No, we'll still pay you because we want

4150
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:44,880
to demand quality. If somebody's g doing

4151
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:46,640
you a favor and doing it for free, then

4152
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:48,160
you can't demand quality. You can't say

4153
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:49,760
sir, you're not teaching well." All

4154
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,359
right? So, we still give them money.

4155
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:53,040
Now, they may choose to donate that

4156
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:54,640
money, which most of them do. Okay?

4157
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:57,040
Right? Right. A Rajat Matur when we give

4158
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:59,040
him whatever we give him whatever little

4159
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:01,920
doesn't matter to him he would usually

4160
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:04,880
give it for charity is my guess right

4161
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:07,359
but at least I can keep him accountable

4162
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:08,880
marks

4163
02:30:07,359 --> 02:30:10,080
right so that's there is still a cost

4164
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,680
attached to it there is still a cost

4165
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:13,760
attached to it what would be this cost

4166
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:15,200
this cost if someone is let's say a vice

4167
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,200
president who's teaching something very

4168
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:18,720
specific some vice president at Facebook

4169
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:21,840
who's teaching how to do marketing on

4170
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:23,760
Facebook uh maybe I'll pay $5,000 rupees

4171
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:27,280
an hour $100 an

4172
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:29,280
to someone of the level of Mr. Rajat

4173
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:32,200
Matur. Anything is less, but I think the

4174
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:36,000
highest we go is approximately $1,000 an

4175
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:39,120
hour. The average would be uh I think

4176
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,720
$500 to $550 an hour. Got it. Perfect.

4177
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:43,080
And we would also pay them in 20our

4178
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:46,240
increments. 20our

4179
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:48,800
increments. Okay. Um Pratam, here's one

4180
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:50,399
question that I always had. Okay. When

4181
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:52,800
it comes to a business school, the

4182
02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:54,880
biggest problem and this is not a

4183
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:57,120
problem from the kids. This is a problem

4184
02:30:54,880 --> 02:31:00,080
that I have seen as a point of

4185
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:01,439
skepticism from the parents that if they

4186
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:03,600
go to a business school, no matter it's

4187
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:04,880
a business, if they go to any college,

4188
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,479
no matter whether it's a business school

4189
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:08,000
or an engineering school, they often

4190
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:11,280
expect their kids to get placement.

4191
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:13,080
Yeah. Okay. As a result, no matter how

4192
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:15,520
desperately you want them to be

4193
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:17,720
entrepreneurs, you still somehow are

4194
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,080
accountable only in terms of the

4195
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:22,000
placement, right? As a result, like you

4196
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:24,399
mentioned, only after you show the

4197
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,319
placement report are the parents willing

4198
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:28,720
to pay money, which is fair from their

4199
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:30,479
side, but somehow I feel like it defeats

4200
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:32,720
the purpose of a business school because

4201
02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:36,600
I'll tell you why. When a student gets

4202
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:39,200
in, unless that students parents are

4203
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:40,840
entrepreneurs, they will not understand

4204
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:43,280
the value of

4205
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:45,520
entrepreneurship. Okay, I'm talking

4206
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,880
about both students as well as parents

4207
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:49,439
because students understand the

4208
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:50,640
fascination behind entrepreneurship, the

4209
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:51,680
opportunities and freedom of

4210
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:53,240
entrepreneurship, the money of

4211
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:55,040
entrepreneurship but not the value of

4212
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:57,200
entrepreneurship. Similarly, when it

4213
02:31:55,040 --> 02:32:00,080
comes to parents, their metric of

4214
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:02,960
success is always based on placement

4215
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:05,760
numbers because no matter how successful

4216
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:08,720
your business will be 10 years later in

4217
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:11,840
year one, you cannot do a great job,

4218
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:12,960
right? So, how do you tweak? I mean I

4219
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:15,359
know for a fact that you can't change

4220
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:17,920
this marker of success but as a person

4221
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:20,720
who's running a business school do you

4222
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:22,240
feel like do you feel compromised when

4223
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,680
people ask you for placement report

4224
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:25,560
instead of asking you how many

4225
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:28,160
businesses have started out of your

4226
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:30,560
batch you know there's always a plan A

4227
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:33,600
and a plan B when any student comes

4228
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:36,160
through mast's union his plan A is

4229
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,240
always I want to set up my own company

4230
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:40,160
right but they want the comfort of a

4231
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:42,479
plan B you know because it may be a

4232
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:45,200
risky endeavor to start a company in

4233
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:47,680
case I fail do I have this plan B where

4234
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:50,399
I can easily get a placement right and

4235
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:53,359
be employed and I can pay off my loan in

4236
02:32:50,399 --> 02:32:55,680
a predictable manner right so when

4237
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:57,680
students come my first day the address

4238
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:00,160
that I give to them is that guys let's

4239
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:01,840
build your startups right are you all

4240
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:04,880
with me they all say yes we are with you

4241
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:06,319
fully committed and for the one year in

4242
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:08,000
the case of MBA and four years in the

4243
02:33:06,319 --> 02:33:09,760
case of undergrad that they are with me

4244
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,720
they are pursuing that startup full

4245
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:12,720
force

4246
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:14,399
Right? But as they start seeing the

4247
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:15,760
results of their startups, right? They

4248
02:33:14,399 --> 02:33:17,920
start, some of them realize that this is

4249
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:19,600
not for them. Some of them realize that

4250
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:21,439
entrepreneurship is for them but maybe

4251
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:22,880
not this market. Someone realize that

4252
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:24,240
yeah, I want to study. I want to work in

4253
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:27,280
this market only but maybe not this

4254
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:29,280
product. Right now it's very difficult

4255
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:31,680
for them to start again. And then

4256
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:33,200
they're like okay never mind. I tried my

4257
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:35,280
hand at startup. It did not work for

4258
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:38,720
whatever reason. Let me go back into the

4259
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:41,760
job market. I'll do this job for 2 3 5

4260
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:43,520
10 years. But eventually I'll come back

4261
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:46,520
to being an entrepreneur. Right? So

4262
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:50,240
while students may want a

4263
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:52,240
job safety net in the first year, second

4264
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:53,760
year, I think that I have done a good

4265
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:55,600
job and masters union has done a good

4266
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:57,840
job that eventually all of those people

4267
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:01,040
who enter the job market also eventually

4268
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:03,280
want to start up. Right? And if over 10

4269
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:05,439
years more than 50% of my students start

4270
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,280
up, I think I would have done a great

4271
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:09,520
job. So your goal is cultivating

4272
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,200
business acumen and not getting your

4273
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:13,920
students to build companies right after

4274
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:15,120
college. 20% should that is my personal

4275
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:17,280
goal. Yeah, that is my internal goal

4276
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:20,080
that 20% of my students should not even

4277
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:22,960
consider placements. It last year it was

4278
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:24,880
maybe 10%, this year it's 15%. And next

4279
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:26,319
cohort I'm sure it will touch 20%. What

4280
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:28,080
are you doing so deliberately to

4281
02:34:26,319 --> 02:34:30,000
increase this percentage? What I do is

4282
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:31,600
very interesting. Okay, if your startup

4283
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:35,840
is going well but it's not broken away

4284
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:37,760
yet successful for the next one year

4285
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:39,520
after they graduate I give them free

4286
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:41,920
office space and I give them 40,000

4287
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:43,760
rupees per month no questions asked oh

4288
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:45,200
wow we call it the founder fellowship if

4289
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:47,680
you don't sit in placements I will give

4290
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:49,359
you 40,000 out of my own pocket which

4291
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:51,439
will take care of your loan repayment

4292
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:54,800
and will also take care of your rent

4293
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:56,399
okay now that gives them some safety net

4294
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:58,319
number one number two I also give them

4295
02:34:56,399 --> 02:35:00,560
the privilege of sitting in placements

4296
02:34:58,319 --> 02:35:00,560
next

4297
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:10,399
year. So you get two chances at

4298
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:11,840
placements. This is one of the most

4299
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:14,319
brilliant things I've ever heard, man.

4300
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:16,160
I'll tell you why. My best friend, his

4301
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:18,240
father is an entrepreneur, okay? And

4302
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:20,080
he's a pretty legendary entrepreneur.

4303
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:23,479
This is exactly what he told him. And I

4304
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:25,760
was like, I just wish AJ uncle was my

4305
02:35:23,479 --> 02:35:29,200
father because this is exactly what he

4306
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:29,200
said. He said,

4307
02:35:34,439 --> 02:35:38,240
office. If you want, I'll also pay for

4308
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:40,240
your employees, one or two employees at

4309
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,720
max. It's not like you can just build an

4310
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:45,359
army of employees. But this will go on

4311
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:46,960
for the next one or two years until you

4312
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:49,800
understand whether you really want to do

4313
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:52,880
this or you want to change your

4314
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:54,479
path. And that gave him the audacity to

4315
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:56,720
say, you know what, let me just go

4316
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:58,399
ahead. Otherwise, we see two extremes.

4317
02:35:56,720 --> 02:36:00,319
Either the father says just handle my

4318
02:35:58,399 --> 02:36:01,600
business or the father says you know

4319
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:03,680
what I'm not going to give you anything

4320
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:06,319
just start from scratch but this safety

4321
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:09,640
net which you are doing delness this

4322
02:36:06,319 --> 02:36:12,680
hardness yeah is just at the

4323
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:15,520
perfect it is at the it it

4324
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:18,560
balances risk as well as safety so

4325
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:21,600
perfectly that it gives the child a

4326
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:23,600
conducive atmosphere and a safety net so

4327
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:25,520
that they can take more risks I'll give

4328
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:26,640
you some success stories from this

4329
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,880
cohort

4330
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:31,280
Whoever is in Gorga right now, go to

4331
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:34,560
Zomato and search for Lexis sandwich.

4332
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:36,880
Cono sandwich. Lexis. L E Xi. Okay. L E

4333
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,960
Xi. These are four kids. Two from

4334
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:41,120
Pondicherry, brother sister, one from

4335
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:43,920
Amsterdam and one kid from Delhi. Egg

4336
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:47,800
Zomato. Four of them got together to

4337
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:51,520
build a cloud kitchen. They sell gourmet

4338
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:53,359
sandwiches in Gura on Zomato and Swiggy,

4339
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:57,040
right? Doing really well. Their chili

4340
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:59,200
burata is amazing. people must try right

4341
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,960
they got founded as part of the venture

4342
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:03,040
initiation program where we do these

4343
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:04,720
founder fellowships all four of them

4344
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:08,720
have put their savings as well as this

4345
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:08,720
40,000 that we give them together

4346
02:37:09,560 --> 02:37:13,280
so bootstrap and they don't have to fund

4347
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:15,359
raise from outside they don't have to

4348
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:17,439
dilute etc etc right and they can stay

4349
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:19,840
on campus use all the resources of the

4350
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:21,760
campus um and in fact couple months ago

4351
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:23,760
you were talking about I think uh Vikram

4352
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:26,160
right who runs viri by kilo vishal

4353
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:27,760
vishal Vishal and he was on campus and

4354
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:29,200
these kids were building the startup and

4355
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:30,560
I literally realized you know

4356
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,840
introducing them would be super great.

4357
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,520
So I just called four of them I said

4358
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:35,439
guys Vishal is here just talk to him

4359
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:37,120
right and he gave them some insight and

4360
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:39,600
so just being in that ecosystem really

4361
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:40,960
helped them. So I have so many of these

4362
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:42,160
examples. Yeah. I mean I can go on and

4363
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:44,640
on. There's another company called Play

4364
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:46,399
Super. Two kids again met at Masters

4365
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:47,840
Union. Actually they knew they knew each

4366
02:37:46,399 --> 02:37:50,319
other from before and they are building

4367
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:52,000
this loyalty platform for gamers. So

4368
02:37:50,319 --> 02:37:53,520
they realized that studios that produce

4369
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,880
games they have very little retention.

4370
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,040
So they created this thing where you

4371
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:58,640
play game on one platform you can earn

4372
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:00,479
points and actually redeem it on some

4373
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:02,560
other platform like a loyalty platform

4374
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,920
for gamers. Again like they've raised

4375
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:04,880
money. This is they're also

4376
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:07,439
beneficiaries of the founders

4377
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:10,240
fellowship. Uh there's another guy

4378
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:12,960
called u Aditya building a company

4379
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:15,359
called Blue Brew. They make jeans but

4380
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:17,120
that old re Lee Wrangler kind of those

4381
02:38:15,359 --> 02:38:18,880
jeans faded with designs not like the

4382
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:21,200
simple ones that you and I wear but like

4383
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:22,640
and doing really well like uh Tiger Shro

4384
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:23,760

02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:45,520
daughter of like a very important

4393
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:46,880
actress they're wearing his clothes

4394
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:48,880
again he's a recipient of founders

4395
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:50,880
fellowship that is beautiful man and you

4396
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:52,399
also help students raise capital right

4397
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:54,479
so what we do is you know we were

4398
02:38:52,399 --> 02:38:56,560
speaking about Vcominator the earlier

4399
02:38:54,479 --> 02:38:59,120
and on the last day of the cohort on the

4400
02:38:56,560 --> 02:39:01,600
last day which is h which happens in May

4401
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,520
all of our students who are doing these

4402
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:07,359
businesses they get to present present

4403
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:08,319
their ideas to 100 VCs on campus. Right?

4404
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:09,600
This is called the demo day, right? This

4405
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:11,120
is called the demo day. Yeah. Right. And

4406
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,720
you can actually see the demo day videos

4407
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:13,920
from the last few years on YouTube.

4408
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:15,840
They're all there. I've seen them.

4409
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:17,600
You've seen those. And all of our

4410
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:20,080
students get to present to 100 VCs. Now,

4411
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:23,200
we know that getting those 100 meetings

4412
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:25,800
with 100 VCs will take them two years.

4413
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:28,720
But if you can get those 100 VCs to the

4414
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:31,120
campus and expose them to the startups,

4415
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:33,359
those 100 VCs listening can at least

4416
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:35,840
lead to 10 to 20 VC meetings. Correct.

4417
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:38,560
And maybe one or two will convert. And

4418
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:40,160
if not that, if the VC sees a great

4419
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:41,680
presentation,

4420
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:44,240
even if the business model is not

4421
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:46,399
something that's investable, tomorrow

4422
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:49,040
like 6 months later when you drop him a

4423
02:39:46,399 --> 02:39:51,280
cold email, that becomes a mom email.

4424
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:54,000
Exact. In fact, I'll give you an example

4425
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:55,280
of Dvita Saraf. She's an Ashoka

4426
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,280
University undergrad student doing

4427
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:59,280
masters at Masters Union. She was

4428
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:01,200
running an alcohol company. They were

4429
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:03,520
making wine for the Indian taste

4430
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:04,720
palette. Okay. Okay. Very interesting,

4431
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:08,319
right? And they were making wine by

4432
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:10,399
brewing tea. Okay. And she presented and

4433
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:12,800
for whatever reason the startup failed.

4434
02:40:10,399 --> 02:40:15,720
However, she was presenting. This VC was

4435
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:18,800
in the audience. The the VC was so

4436
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:21,359
impressed that eventually he gave her an

4437
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:23,080
interview to join that VC fund as an

4438
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:25,760
investor. And now Dvida actually works

4439
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:27,120
there. Right? So essentially if you see

4440
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,160
you're solving for three of the most

4441
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:30,800
important things required for

4442
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:32,880
entrepreneurship which is access safety

4443
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:35,520
and knowledge

4444
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:38,479
access safety knowledge absolutely

4445
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:40,080
exposure is extraordinary for tettor but

4446
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:41,840
for mast's unit it happens through these

4447
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:44,080
visiting faculties visiting faculties

4448
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:46,000
and also the the activity that where you

4449
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:48,160
where these kids have to find something

4450
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,080
from the unorganized market and sell it

4451
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:52,160
it's in term one uh it's a very

4452
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:53,920
interesting uh game that we play right

4453
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:55,680
so in the morning students are given

4454
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,120
10,000 rupees and they are told to go to

4455
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:59,439
the flea market. We call it the Barara

4456
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:01,680
market in in Gura and they have to

4457
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:04,720
procure unbranded stuff and then they

4458
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:06,960
get two hours to brand that stuff and

4459
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:08,640
then go into the high street area like

4460
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:11,359
CyberHub and then actually sell their

4461
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:12,880
products with a brand now for profit and

4462
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:15,920
whoever makes the most profit in those

4463
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:17,439
12 hours wins right it's a great I mean

4464
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:19,600
that also gives them this sense of

4465
02:41:17,439 --> 02:41:22,319
hustle and all of this is done to

4466
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:23,520
basically instill confidence correct

4467
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:25,840
that is the most important thing

4468
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:28,640
self-belief if you can create in

4469
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:33,120
they can do anything. Indians and

4470
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:34,479
especially Indian kids of that u you

4471
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:37,040
know that middle class upper middle

4472
02:41:34,479 --> 02:41:39,120
class the biggest thing that they lack

4473
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:40,880
is self-belief and confidence correct by

4474
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:43,520
now let's come to the last segment and

4475
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:46,399
here's where we complete the flywheel to

4476
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:46,399
customer acquisition

4477
02:41:49,479 --> 02:41:55,280
clear we also covered exposure and the

4478
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,840
importance of exposure we spoke about

4479
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:59,120
Curriculums. Curriculums and learning by

4480
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:01,920
doing. Yeah. We come to the final part

4481
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:04,000
of the flywheel which is placement.

4482
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:06,479
Regardless of how well you have done in

4483
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,880
the previous stages, unless you give out

4484
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:10,880
placement because of the way Indian

4485
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:12,960
society functions, you will not get the

4486
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:15,520
report card of a successful B school.

4487
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:17,760
Although that's quite um oxymoronic.

4488
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:20,080
Yeah, we have established that. Okay. Um

4489
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:22,720
so let's I just want to understand what

4490
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:23,920
is your approach to a doing the market

4491
02:42:22,720 --> 02:42:26,160
research to understand which are the

4492
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:27,600
most relevant skills b after you

4493
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:30,000
understand which are the most relevant

4494
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:32,280
skills how do you then get rid of

4495
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:35,760
companies or placements to complete the

4496
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:36,720
flywhe got it great question see I think

4497
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,319
you have to first start with the

4498
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:41,240
students let's say I have 200 students

4499
02:42:38,319 --> 02:42:44,000
in my program I ask them what are your

4500
02:42:41,240 --> 02:42:45,760
dreams what do you want in life what

4501
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:47,280
kind of companies do you want to work

4502
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:48,640
with what kind of cultures do you Do you

4503
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,920
want to work in India? Do you want to

4504
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:50,880
work abroad? You want to work abroad? In

4505
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:52,479
which countries do you want to work?

4506
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:54,439
Right? So like this right in the

4507
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:56,479
beginning, we make a list of our target

4508
02:42:54,439 --> 02:42:57,600
companies. Right? So we ask each student

4509
02:42:56,479 --> 02:43:00,319
to give us three or four target

4510
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:03,359
companies. We write that list down and

4511
02:43:00,319 --> 02:43:05,840
then through a sales effort by our sales

4512
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:08,960
team, we actually then go out into the

4513
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:11,520
market selling our students to these

4514
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:13,160
companies. It's a B2B sales process. I

4515
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:16,800
literally have a 40

4516
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:20,319
person placement team whose job is to

4517
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:21,920
sell my students into the market right

4518
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:23,520
so we have a list of companies we are

4519
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:27,439
targeting we divide that list of

4520
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:29,920
companies amongst our 40 sales team and

4521
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:32,080
then it's everyone's incentive structure

4522
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:34,560
system process it's all structured so

4523
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:36,080
that they can go and close that company

4524
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:37,920
right so we know that let's say this is

4525
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:40,080
company A let's say Google right or

4526
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:41,280
let's say Talabad in Dubai we know that

4527
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:42,880
these are the six students who really

4528
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:44,720
wanted this company. So we'll go to that

4529
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:46,399
company, we'll meet the hiring manager,

4530
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:48,080
we'll meet the CEO, we'll pitch to them,

4531
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:49,520
we'll tell them what masters union is,

4532
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:51,359
we'll tell them who our students are and

4533
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:53,439
we'll tell them exactly what these six

4534
02:43:51,359 --> 02:43:55,439
students can do for them. Do you also

4535
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:57,279
ask them what exactly are the skill sets

4536
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:59,279
that they are looking for? I think

4537
02:43:57,279 --> 02:44:03,200
there's enough information online right

4538
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:03,200
on their website etc which we can easily

4539
02:44:03,560 --> 02:44:07,840
fathom. Talabad is a quick commerce

4540
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:09,439
company in Dubai, right? So we

4541
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:10,880
understand they need program managers.

4542
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:12,560
They need program managers with ops

4543
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:14,000
background. We know they need e-commerce

4544
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:15,359
managers. We know they need category

4545
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,960
managers. And we know exactly what

4546
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:18,160
skills those category managers need,

4547
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:20,160
right? Because that much research even

4548
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:21,840
our team is doing. We are teaching those

4549
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:23,200
kind of courses also. The students are

4550
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,600
building those kind of companies also in

4551
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:26,800
VIP, right? In the ventureation program,

4552
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:28,640
they're doing drop shipping. So they

4553
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:30,960
have that experience. So we take all of

4554
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:32,640
the students CV or their proof of work,

4555
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:34,080
their portfolio. Then we go to the

4556
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:36,800
company and say, "Hey, listen. There are

4557
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:38,160
these five openings on your website. We

4558
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:39,439
want to pitch these five students for

4559
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:41,600
this one opening. We want to pitch these

4560
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:43,439
six students for this opening. Right.

4561
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:45,439
Give our students a chance. Got it.

4562
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:46,880
Right. This is very different from how

4563
02:44:45,439 --> 02:44:48,319
placements happen in other colleges.

4564
02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:50,880
Yeah. Placements usually happen in the

4565
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:52,720
way that they look at the biggest TAM.

4566
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:54,160
So if they understand that there is a

4567
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:55,359
huge market for business development,

4568
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:56,560
they will make sure that the students

4569
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:57,600
are trained for business development in

4570
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:59,359
such a way that they're able to apply

4571
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:01,840
for placements. The companies come up

4572
02:44:59,359 --> 02:45:03,439
and they are these are mass recruiters,

4573
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:05,520
right? They just take out students in

4574
02:45:03,439 --> 02:45:07,279
bulk and that's how we also get those.

4575
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:08,960
We also get those. But generally the way

4576
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:10,600
placements happen in you know these old

4577
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:13,120
business schools is that there's a day

4578
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:15,600
zero. They tell whoever wants to come to

4579
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:17,040
campus can come on this day zero and

4580
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:19,680
we'll give you a schedule and you can

4581
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:22,240
come recruit our students and go. That's

4582
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:23,520
how placements happen. Now what happens

4583
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:25,840
in that is that the student only gets

4584
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:28,960
one day to decide which company they

4585
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:30,800
want to go for. With in our case student

4586
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:32,240
gets enough time, they get enough uh

4587
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:33,600
interview chances. is they meet a lot of

4588
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:35,120
different companies over a period of one

4589
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:37,040
year. Placements don't happen in one

4590
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,640
day. They happen over six seven months.

4591
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:40,479
So our process is slightly different.

4592
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:42,240
Essentially it all boils down to

4593
02:45:40,479 --> 02:45:44,240
considering each student a product, an

4594
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:46,399
individual product that we are going and

4595
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:47,840
selling to the highest bidder. Got it?

4596
02:45:46,399 --> 02:45:49,520
Right. It's a very crude way of looking

4597
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:51,840
at it, but it's also the best way of

4598
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:54,319
doing B2B sales like it's B2B sales

4599
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:56,960
right understood. How Infosys, how TCS

4600
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:58,560
sell their contracts, B2B contracts.

4601
02:45:56,960 --> 02:46:00,160
Similarly, we sell our students. But

4602
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:01,840
this way, the placement packages are not

4603
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:02,880
under your control, right? Are they?

4604
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:04,479
They're a little bit more in our

4605
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:06,800
control, right? So, because then we will

4606
02:46:04,479 --> 02:46:08,560
only target roles that are commensurate

4607
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:10,319
with our students expectations and their

4608
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:12,080
abilities versus the other way around

4609
02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:13,359
where a company's coming to campus, they

4610
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:15,439
already have a fixed salary that they

4611
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:17,600
will offer to every student. Good, bad,

4612
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:18,960
ugly, doesn't matter to them. Got it. Do

4613
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:20,720
you also design your syllabus on the

4614
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:22,560
basis of students expectation and how

4615
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:24,160
the market is functioning? Absolutely.

4616
02:46:22,560 --> 02:46:26,399
Like every last three years, our

4617
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:28,479
syllabus has completely changed. Now

4618
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:29,439
what we were teaching 2 years ago they

4619
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:30,960
said we have to teach it very

4620
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:32,800
differently because of advent of AI.

4621
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:34,160
Correct? Right. Product management 2

4622
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:36,560
years ago is very different from product

4623
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:38,800
management today. Finance 3 years ago is

4624
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:40,240
very different from fintech today. So we

4625
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:41,600
have to change that. And by the way we

4626
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:43,600
don't have to change it ourselves. When

4627
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:45,120
we bring the faculty from the companies

4628
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:46,880
they automatically teach what they're

4629
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:48,800
recruiting for what they're looking for.

4630
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:50,479
So that automatically gets uh you know

4631
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:52,399
baked in. Understood. This is the reason

4632
02:46:50,479 --> 02:46:54,479
why you're able to get great placements.

4633
02:46:52,399 --> 02:46:56,640
This is the reason because we are taking

4634
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:59,040
it as a sales process. Right? Now last

4635
02:46:56,640 --> 02:47:00,960
year the market was really bad. Right?

4636
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:02,640
Uh it took us 3 months extra to place

4637
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:04,399
all of our students. Still we finished

4638
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:06,000
before the students were graduating. We

4639
02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:07,520
still finished in November. The students

4640
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,960
were graduating in December and we just

4641
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:11,600
had our convocation in January where you

4642
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:13,439
were there. Uh but it took us 3 months

4643
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:15,439
more than it took us last year because

4644
02:47:13,439 --> 02:47:17,520
the market was tough. So we had to do

4645
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:19,680
twice the number of sales. Right? If

4646
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:21,439
last year it took my student three offer

4647
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:22,800
three interviews to get an offer. This

4648
02:47:21,439 --> 02:47:24,640
time it took him six interviews to get

4649
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:26,080
an offer. So while the other business

4650
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:28,000
schools were struggling and a lot of the

4651
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:29,680
students were left unpaced, in our case

4652
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,399
we just spend that much extra time. Got

4653
02:47:29,680 --> 02:47:33,760
it? Right. And so that's usually how it

4654
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:36,160
works. And then of course, you know, you

4655
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:37,439
can pitch for in internships, you can

4656
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:39,120
say, "Hey, if you like my students doing

4657
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:41,200
internships, which is a low-risk way of

4658
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:42,479
testing the waters with Masters Union,

4659
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:44,080
and then if you can convert them in the

4660
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:45,760
future, that's also okay. If you want to

4661
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:47,200
give my students a consulting assignment

4662
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:48,880
and see how they do in the consulting

4663
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:50,000
assignment, that's also okay. If you

4664
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:51,680
want to give them a case study to

4665
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,359
analyze and they come back to you with a

4666
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:55,040
case study and you like them, then you

4667
02:47:53,359 --> 02:47:56,880
can hire them. It doesn't have to be a

4668
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:58,560
one-izefits-all. So we we essentially

4669
02:47:56,880 --> 02:48:01,600
craft the product and the offering for

4670
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:03,120
each company differently. Understood,

4671
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:04,960
bro. I think that completes the flywheel

4672
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:06,880
then. So what we've spent close to 4

4673
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:09,520
hours talking about Masters Union, the

4674
02:48:06,880 --> 02:48:10,960
business model, your grandfather, this

4675
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:13,359
has been amazing, man. Thank you so

4676
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:14,880
much. I'm taking back so much that uh

4677
02:48:13,359 --> 02:48:16,319
like you just saw, I had to request a

4678
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:17,279
few extra papers just so that I could

4679
02:48:16,319 --> 02:48:19,920
take down everything that you're saying.

4680
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:22,640
I I really hope that that you start a

4681
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:25,760
business school. You know, you'll be so

4682
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:26,800
inspiring as a business school founder.

4683
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:28,240
Not just a business school, as a

4684
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:30,319
university founder. You have so much to

4685
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:32,319
give. You're so nurturing in the way you

4686
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:33,680
approach things and the history that

4687
02:48:32,319 --> 02:48:36,160
you've built, the brand that you've

4688
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:39,120
built with things school. I I I really

4689
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:40,640
envy uh you seriously boss and I really

4690
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:42,560
feel you'll be so successful and India

4691
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:44,160
needs it. Thank you so much. India needs

4692
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,680
it more than anything else from coming

4693
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:47,120
from you. That means the world to me

4694
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:49,120
man. Yeah. the genuiness that you will

4695
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:51,040
do it with I think is going to be above

4696
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:52,399
all. I look forward to seeing you in

4697
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,720
that avatar and then I'm going to ask

4698
02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:56,880
you questions hopefully. But thank you

4699
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:59,439
so much V. This this really means a lot

4700
02:48:56,880 --> 02:49:00,840
and um I am really thankful that I have

4701
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:04,160
somebody to look up to in terms of

4702
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:06,800
ambition and um I am I'm not even

4703
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:08,640
hoping. I know for a fact that you will

4704
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:10,560
be among the top 10 and when you're

4705
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:12,800
among the top 10 we will cut this out as

4706
02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:14,800
real and put it out and tell people that

4707
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:16,880
we saw this coming long time back. If

4708
02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:18,479
you if you every year come and teach the

4709
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:20,560
course on communications and content

4710
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:21,920
then I have no doubt 100% come to teach

4711
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:24,399
and you know what is the most fulfilling

4712
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:26,800
thing about masters union u when I come

4713
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:28,319
over there everybody's just so excited

4714
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:30,399
um that's not a that's not the case with

4715
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:32,560
a lot of colleges right they're just so

4716
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:35,600
excited all the time that I feel

4717
02:49:32,560 --> 02:49:37,359
energized after delivering a lecture so

4718
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:39,760
I just came there last time I think I

4719
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:42,000
spent about an hour or so and then we

4720
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,840
had a meetup um and then we spent about

4721
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,160
20 minutes over there that was

4722
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:47,520
incredible And after the meet up, I just

4723
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:48,640
thought of just going back and then

4724
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:50,000
there was some fight that was happening

4725
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:51,520
between the previous batch and the new

4726
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,439
batch saying why didn't I just come and

4727
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:54,800
teach with her? I said no I promise I'll

4728
02:49:53,439 --> 02:49:57,120
come to teach. Great great problem to

4729
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:59,520
have. So that excitement is something

4730
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:01,040
that's quite infectious and um it's just

4731
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:02,880
amazing man. I look forward to coming

4732
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:04,479
and teaching there. No thank you so much

4733
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:08,380
for saying that. Means the world to us.

4734
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:11,510
Thank you bro. Thank you so much.
