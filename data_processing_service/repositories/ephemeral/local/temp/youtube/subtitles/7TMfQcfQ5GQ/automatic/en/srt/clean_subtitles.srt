I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So Pakistan has officially fallen at the feet of America. Well, there is nothing big in this but a dance has taken place here and Pakistan has officially announced that the Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded.  Donald Trump, we are with him.  Well, what does Donald Trump write?  Donald Trump writes that I would have received the Nobel Prize four times by now. Nobel Peace Prize and because they give Nobel Peace Prize only to liberals.  After that he writes that this is very good for Africa.  It's great for the world.  Donald Trump once wrote on his truth.  He told the Nobel Committee, look, I will not get the Nobel Prize for this.  I will not get the Nobel Peace Prize because I stopped the war between India and Pakistan. I will not get the Nobel Peace Prize because I stopped the war in Serbia and Kosova. I will not get the Nobel Prize because I brought peace to Egypt and Ethiopia. Peace was brought about in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ronda. So I am not going to get the Nobel Peace Prize. I can do anything.  So this is what Don Trump said.  Donald Trump is a total crazy man.  Look at the childhood of Donald Trump, if you analyze anyone's behavior.  Always remember, always remember.  If you want to be successful in life then you should recognize people.  You went to professionalism to get oil. All that was lost in the flood.  Every thing depends on human emotions.  Remember this.  For example, there is a roast world nowadays.   They are roasting.  It is known to be very good. But that person feels bad.  Because you cannot change emotions. Nature has given it to us.  So it is very important to understand human psychology.  He will work accordingly.  No matter how much you say.  Today Donald Trump is doing anything , saying anything because he has narcissistic personality disorder.  There are many more disorders.  So Donald Trump's childhood was such that he never got any love from his father.  He has never received any love. Earlier, people in hostels were living a very luxurious life.  He had everything.  After that suddenly he was sent to hostel and there was extreme strictness and none of his words were listened to.  So today he is actually a very timid person.  If you look from the inside, but in everything Don Trump keeps on bragging.  When India caught hold of this, it took those decisions to satisfy their ego, but remember, forget about Donald Trump's peace price.  He will go with the tag of worst President in the world and worst President of America. This is for sure.  And as long as this man is there, he can do anything. Ok?  And America brother, now see, they must be removed no matter what happens, the mid-term elections are in 2026.  Jump as much as you can now. After that, its power is going to decrease in the same way in 2026.  And friends, once Donald Trump is removed from the post of President, he will go to jail.  You will see that there will be a terrible impeachment on them.   It ca n't happen right now.  I can't do anything right now. But once he loses his presidency, the game is over.  And when Donald Trump came, I had said that he is a very dangerous man.  Friends, if we talk about identifying such people, then you can avail our combo of personality development and Chanakya Niti.

So Donald Trump is dying for the Nobel Peace Prize and Pakistan has nominated him.  Well, I told you there are no free lunches in this world. And if Donald Trump, let's say, has invited Asim Munir for lunch, then many of the issues that are currently going on with rare earth elements are the Balochistan Reserves in Pakistan.  We will take it and take control of it.  Then after that crypto is illegal in Pakistan. And we will create our national currency reserve in crypto. Pakistan, what do these strange crazy people say about such a country ?  Crypto is illegal.  Ok?  Then after that the Iran-Israel issue, well Pakistan is surrounded because of Iran.  Pakistan will be seen as a villain and the whole world will lose trust in it. After this incident, nobody is going to support Pakistan which it is doing with Iran because they had told Iran that they will support it and Iran ran away to Pakistan at the first opportunity. Ok?  I was cheated like this.  What happened after that is that Asim Mudin told Donald Trump that this will be a big problem for us. Jaish al Adl is active here.  Is it okay?  Sistan Baluchistan which is in Iran will attack us and if the war is not stopped then the Jihadists will come here and will create a huge problem, which they are going to do.  Is it okay? Iran will not forget, they do not forget. All these things are happening.  After that, our Defence Secretary said that this is a big embarrassment.  Ok?  The way Asim Munir has gone and worked for the entire world is very important. What can we say about this, Asim Munir's opinion would be that India should renew the Indus Water Treaty, America should put pressure on India and say Indus Water Treaty, well America has already said this to Donald Trump on the phone that we are not going to bow down, we will tolerate things up to a certain limit and after that no one will tolerate it, the entire world is troubled by Donald Trump right now, right? So, it is obvious that India has said this, brother, forget about the Indus Water Treaty, if Pakistan does anything, it will be considered a war, it will be considered a war, so you can forget this, so all these issues have been discussed between Donald Trump and Asim Munir. Now, let me tell you about Asim Munir, he is such a big person, the same Defence Secretary said that there is embarrassment also because Asim Munir is gone.  Asim Munir has gone to meet Donald Trump. Shabaz Sharif has not gone.  The barber has gone suspicious. Asim Munir keeps the civilian government at his mercy.  He said, come on, Asim Munir says that I am the best Field Marshal General.  Why? Because I am also tolerating dissent and I am acting according to democracy.   When Asim Munir went, slogans were raised against him.  A defeated general is having lunch. Why?  Because America is saying so.  Brother, look, it's a simple thing. Let me tell you one thing.  There is no connection between world order and order. You know the Iran Israel war is happening because of Barabanki.   I don't know who Rohilla Khomeini was, his grandfather Rohilla Khomeini, the same Royallah Khomeini who brought the revolution in 1979, his grandfather was from Barabanki.  Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi He had migrated.  So the war started from here in Barabanki, Lucknow, UP.  If he had not gone, Royal Khomeni would never have come and the revolution would never have happened.  Anyway, this is a big embarrassment because understand that everyone, I mean everybody, has fallen in love with him, bypassing all these people and Shahbaz Sharif, Asim Munir has been called.   This means one thing is certain that he is the supreme leader of Pakistan and no one else there has the support of the people.  And whatever they want will happen.  Imran Khan will remain in jail.  Civilian Government.  Now look at Shabaz Sharif, there is a very high possibility that there may be a coup this year itself.  But its possibility is less popular because Shahbaz Sharif is saying the same thing that Asim Munir is saying. Ok?  And America too would not want a coup to take place.  So let's see because Imran Khan will remain in jail because when Imran Khan went, he had alleged that I am being removed because of America, I am being kept in jail until there is proper evolution in Pakistan and the people of Pakistan are being fooled, so he will not do anything like this, disregarding the fact that more than half of the people of Pakistan are below the poverty line, so all these things are happening but for India definitely this is a matter of concern, India will have to look at its foreign policy and work on it again because we were very optimistic about Donald Trump. I was not there.  It was never about Donald Trump.  India made us do Howdy Trump and God knows what else. But nothing is happening.  Everything has gone upside down.  There is not a single step which is for India.  Donald Trump even threatened Apple to manufacture here.  Why are you going there? So this is the reality of this person and that is it. Now let's see what happens next.  What do you think, please tell me in the comment box. Rest you can avail our Chanakya Niti Plus Personality Development Course.
