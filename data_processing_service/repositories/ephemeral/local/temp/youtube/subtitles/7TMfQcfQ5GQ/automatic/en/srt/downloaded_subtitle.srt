1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,120
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,719
Pakistan has officially fallen at the feet of America.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,400
Well, there is nothing big in this

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,480
but a dance has taken place here and

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,199
Pakistan has officially announced that the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,439
Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded.  Donald

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,519
Trump, we are with him.  Well,

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
what does Donald Trump write?  Donald Trump writes

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,560
that I would have received the Nobel Prize four times by now.

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,559
Nobel Peace Prize and

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,440
because they give Nobel

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,760
Peace Prize only to liberals.  After that he writes that this is

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
very good for Africa.  It's

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,520
great for the world.  Donald Trump

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
once wrote on his truth.  He

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
told the Nobel Committee, look, I will

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
not get the Nobel Prize for this.  I will

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
not get the Nobel Peace Prize because

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,239
I stopped the war between India and Pakistan.

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
I will not get the Nobel Peace Prize

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
because I stopped the war in Serbia and Kosova.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
I will not get the Nobel Prize

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,879
because I brought peace to Egypt and Ethiopia.

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,519
Peace was brought about in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ronda.

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,880
So I am not going to get the Nobel Peace Prize.

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640
I can do anything.  So this is what Don

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Trump said.  Donald Trump is a

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,799
total crazy man.  Look at the

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,159
childhood of Donald Trump, if you

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,720
analyze anyone's behavior.  Always

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
remember, always remember.  If you want to be

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
successful in life then you should

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,799
recognize people.  You went to professionalism to get oil.

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,079
All that was lost in the flood.  Every thing

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,479
depends on human emotions.  Remember this.  For

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,159
example, there is a roast world nowadays.   They

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
are roasting.  It is known to be very good.

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
But that person

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
feels bad.  Because you cannot change emotions.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
Nature has given it to us.  So it is

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
very important to understand human psychology.  He

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,439
will work accordingly.  No matter how much you

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
say.  Today Donald Trump is doing anything

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,360
, saying anything because he has

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
narcissistic personality disorder.  There

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,240
are many more disorders.  So Donald

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
Trump's childhood was such that he

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,040
never got any love from his father.  He has never received any love.

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,960
Earlier, people in hostels were living a very luxurious

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
life.  He had everything.  After that

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,599
suddenly he was sent to hostel and there was

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,800
extreme strictness and none of his words were

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,640
listened to.  So today he is actually a

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
very timid person.  If you look from the inside,

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,000
but in everything Don Trump

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,480
keeps on bragging.  When India caught

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,760
hold of this, it

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,680
took those decisions to satisfy their ego,

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,680
but remember, forget about Donald Trump's peace

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
price.  He will go with the

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
tag of worst President in the world and worst President of America.

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,319
This is for sure.  And as long as this

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,879
man is there, he can do anything.

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,360
Ok?  And America brother, now see, they must be

68
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,400
removed no matter what happens, the mid-term

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
elections are in 2026.  Jump as much as you can now.

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
After that, its power is going to

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
decrease in the same way in 2026.  And

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
friends, once Donald Trump is

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,879
removed from the post of President, he will go to jail.  You will

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,120
see that there will be a terrible impeachment on them.   It ca

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,040
n't happen right now.  I can't do anything right now.

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,280
But once he loses his presidency, the

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
game is over.  And when Donald Trump

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,920
came, I had said that he is a very dangerous

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,920
man.  Friends, if we talk about identifying such people, then

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,080

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,000
you can avail our combo of personality development and Chanakya Niti.

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
We are running this offer for one day.  It

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,480
is only â‚¹500.  Then you will get a lot of

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
benefit.  Chanakya Niti complete

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
study and personality development

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
description is linked in the comment box.  So

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
Donald Trump is dying for the Nobel Peace Prize

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,720
and Pakistan has

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
nominated him.  Well, I told you there are no

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,120
free lunches in this world.

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,840
And if Donald Trump, let's say, has

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,159
invited Asim Munir for lunch, then

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
many of the issues that are currently going on with rare earth

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,799
elements are the

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,120
Balochistan Reserves in Pakistan.  We will take it and

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,280
take control of it.  Then after that

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
crypto is illegal in Pakistan.

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
And we will create our national currency reserve in crypto.

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
Pakistan, what do these strange crazy people

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,360
say about such a country

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,760
?  Crypto is illegal.  Ok?  Then

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,599
after that the Iran-Israel issue, well

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Pakistan is surrounded because of Iran.  Pakistan will be seen as a

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
villain and the whole world will

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,720
lose trust in it. After this incident, nobody is going to

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,720
support Pakistan which it is

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,239
doing with Iran because

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,560
they had told Iran that they will support it

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
and Iran ran away to Pakistan at the first opportunity.

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
Ok?  I was cheated like this.  What happened after that is

111
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,959
that Asim Mudin told Donald Trump that this will be a

112
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,960
big problem for us.

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,600
Jaish al Adl

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,800
is active here.  Is it okay?  Sistan Baluchistan

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
which is in Iran will attack us and

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,479
if the war is not stopped then the Jihadists will come here

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
and will create a huge problem, which they are going to

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
do.  Is it okay?

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Iran will not forget, they do not forget.

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,000
All these things are happening.  After that, our

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Defence Secretary said that

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,919
this is a big embarrassment.  Ok?  The

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,759
way Asim Munir has

124
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,320
gone and worked for the entire world is

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,639
very important. What can we say about this,

126
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,400
Asim Munir's opinion would be that India should renew the Indus Water

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,120
Treaty,

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
America should put pressure on India and say

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
Indus Water Treaty, well America has

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
already said this to Donald Trump on the phone

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
that we are not going to bow down,

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
we will tolerate things up to a certain limit and after that no one will

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,080
tolerate it, the entire world is

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
troubled by Donald Trump right now, right? So, it is

135
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
obvious that India has

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
said this, brother, forget about the Indus Water

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
Treaty, if Pakistan does anything,

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
it will be considered a war, it will be considered a war, so

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,280
you can forget this, so all these

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,000
issues have been discussed between Donald Trump and Asim Munir.

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,960
Now, let me

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
tell you about Asim Munir, he is such a big person, the same

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,600
Defence Secretary said that there is

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,800
embarrassment also because Asim

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,880
Munir is gone.  Asim Munir has gone to meet Donald Trump.

146
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Shabaz Sharif has not gone.  The barber has

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
gone suspicious.

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,199
Asim Munir keeps the civilian government at his mercy.  He said, come on,

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,360
Asim Munir says that I

150
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
am the best Field Marshal General.  Why?

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
Because I am also tolerating dissent and

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,520
I am acting according to democracy.   When

153
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,840
Asim Munir went, slogans were raised against him.  A

154
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
defeated general is having lunch.

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,240
Why?  Because America is saying so.  Brother,

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
look, it's a simple thing.

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
Let me tell you one thing.  There is no connection between world order and order.

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
You know the Iran

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,919
Israel war is happening because of Barabanki.   I

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,199
don't know who Rohilla Khomeini was, his grandfather

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,520
Rohilla Khomeini, the same Royallah Khomeini who

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,759
brought the revolution in 1979, his grandfather was

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,919
from Barabanki.  Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi He had

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,639
migrated.  So the

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,280
war started from here in Barabanki, Lucknow, UP.  If he had

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,240
not gone, Royal Khomeni would never have come

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,800
and the revolution would never have happened.  Anyway,

168
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,800
this is a big embarrassment because

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,280
understand that everyone, I mean everybody, has fallen in love with him,

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,440
bypassing all these people and Shahbaz Sharif,

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,520
Asim Munir has been called.   This

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,560
means one thing is certain that he

173
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,319
is the supreme leader of Pakistan and no one else there has the

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
support of the people.  And whatever they

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
want will happen.  Imran Khan will remain

176
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
in jail.  Civilian Government.  Now look at

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,039
Shabaz Sharif, there is a very high possibility that there may be a

178
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,720
coup this year itself.  But its

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,720
possibility is less popular because

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,800
Shahbaz Sharif is saying the same thing that Asim Munir is saying.

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
Ok?  And America too would

182
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
not want a coup to take place.  So let's see

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,199
because Imran Khan will remain in jail

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
because when Imran Khan went,

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
he had alleged that

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,160
I am being removed because of America, I am being kept in jail

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,919
until there is proper evolution

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
in Pakistan and the people of Pakistan are being

189
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,919
fooled,

190
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
so he will not do anything like this,

191
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,960
disregarding the fact that more than half of the people of Pakistan are

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,039
below the poverty line, so all these

193
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,120
things are happening but for India

194
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,360
definitely this is a matter of concern, India will have to

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
look at its foreign policy and

196
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
work on it again

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
because we were very optimistic about Donald Trump.

198
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
I was not there.  It

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
was never about Donald Trump.  India made us do

200
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
Howdy Trump and God knows what else.

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,639
But nothing is happening.  Everything has

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,960
gone upside down.  There is not a single step

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
which is for India.  Donald Trump even threatened Apple to

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,199

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,560
manufacture here.  Why are you going there?

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,160
So this is the reality of this person and that is it.

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
