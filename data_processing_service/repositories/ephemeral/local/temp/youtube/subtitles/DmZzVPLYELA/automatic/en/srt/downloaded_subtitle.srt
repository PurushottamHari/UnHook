1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,319
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,320
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,320
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,120
how is America preparing for war?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,440
Yes, let's talk.  So bunker

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,000
buster bombs and all these things.  Ok?  So,

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,600
we will go step by step.  So look,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
I had already given the updates in the previous lecture

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
about what all had happened.  Trump

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
approved the plan and

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,279
you already know all these things.  Now look at all this,

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,000
whatever Donald Trump says, do not believe him

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,800
that we have taken control of the sky.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,399
This war is good in information warfare.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,360
But it is absolutely true that brother, out of the

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
40 American jets that were parked in Qatar, only

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,760
three are seen empty.  In which

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,559
C130 Hercules is also gone.  The mid-

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,920
refueling aircraft have moved towards Europe.

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,960
And I have talked about readiness here.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
So the Pentagon has directly said that

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,760
we have sent additional fighter jets, refueling

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
tankers and warships.  Ok?

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
Both these warships, True Man and Coulson, as well as

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,280
aircraft carriers, have been

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,920
deployed at strategic locations.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
Ok?  So the most important thing to look at

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
in this is that you should look at Donald Trump that

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,200
Donald Trump has said that we want an end

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
and how will the end come when we will

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
destroy their nuclear program and to

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,119
destroy the nuclear program we have to

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,600
attack their nuclear sites.   The

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,400
whole war is about this.  So if

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,119
you want to destroy them at the nuclear sites then

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
you need such bombs

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,520
which can destroy their nuclear sites.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,159
Now we have said many times that For Two

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,799
Israel has not caused much damage.  So

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,759
that is why they will need

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,079
bigger bombs to protect them

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
because America's plan

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,240
can be long term.  Look America, there can be a civil war in Iran

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
too.  If this continues for long then

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
people will get disturbed there and then

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,479
they will fight among themselves and American

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,880
army might land there.  So ground invasion

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,280
is also eminent.  Currently, there are

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,280
around 40,000 US troops in the Gulf, which is

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
maintained by America.  Is it okay?

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
Obviously, help will be available from all over Europe also.

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,599
So that coalition will be brought about which

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,319
America does.  Step One in

54
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,400
America is to first enter

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
a country.  And step two is to

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
stay there.  Bring stability which they are

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
unable to bring and in step three they get out.

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,959
Because of stability they

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
destabilize the entire region.  So now

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,400
we see these same things being repeated here.  Is it

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,520
okay?  So it is told here

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,480
that till now no American

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,440
aircraft has entered Iranian space.

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,160
That means America is on the defensive.

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
Till now, look at any American aircraft,

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
Israeli aircraft are continuously flying.   They

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,640
are raining bombs.  Isn't it?  At their nuclear

68
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,640
site.  But no American aircraft were

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,560
seen.  But what is Iran doing?  The

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,480
hypersonic missile and

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
ballistic missile fired by Iran has

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
fallen on their stock exchange.  Is it okay?  She has

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,599
fallen at their hospital.  Civilians are being

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,159
attacked and Israel can leverage this.

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,720
Israel has said that we are

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,120
capable of defeating Iran alone.  But

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,280
if there is help from outside then it is welcome.

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
That means if any country wants to help,

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,599
we welcome it.  This means that there is a

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,480
message that we will not be able to defeat Iran alone.

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,599
So right now more than 12 F16s are

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,599
relocated to Saudi Arabia.  Is it okay?

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,080
Brother, mid refueling aircraft is very

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,239
important.  Now yesterday I told you

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,720
that America's Domes plane is also

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
going.  What you can see in this entire region,

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,120
in the Gulf region, there are

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,440
around 400 troops here, this is

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
your Iran.  So we will fly from here only.   Will come

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,319
back after dropping bombs.  Isn't it?  And

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,640
troops can also go here for limited operations.

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,120
This is also absolutely you know but

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,239
obvious.  And Israel is there too.

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,159
Now, their main point will be that these

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,959
B52 bombers that you see

96
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,760
in Diego Garcia, they are ready.  Now

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,159
these B52 bombers are very dangerous.

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
And these bunker buster bombs are

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,439
even more dangerous.  Now what do these B52 bombers,

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,840
these B2 stealth bombers,

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,319
do?  They carry the 300 pound bunker

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,040
buster bomb.

103
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,359
This is a very heavy bomb.  Very heavy.  No

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,000
ordinary plane can carry it.  So this is what a

105
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
B52 bomber is like.  It is exactly

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
like a spaceship.  And you see, this

107
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
bomber fits here,

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
these are bunker buster bombs.  Ok?  Now

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
friends, what happens is that this bomber that you are

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,759
seeing, the BLU 109, is

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,600
turned on by Israel right now.  This BLU 109

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,000
bomb is owned by Israel.  But the

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
problem is that Israel's bomb,

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
these four are the most important nuclear

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
sites.  This is in the mountains.

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
About 100 km from Tehran.  It is at a distance of.

117
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,880
Many tunnels have been built.  Protection:

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,400
S300 system is deployed here so that if anything comes,

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,720
it gets activated.  So you

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,080
can say that this is their brain.

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Iran has both heart and mind.  So now

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,800
this bomb that Israel has, it can only go down up to 10 meters.

123
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
That means it

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,080
will cause damage on the ground but not below.  But

125
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,320
this bomb that America has

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,039
can go down to 200 feet.  Friends, it can go

127
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,759
down to 500-600 meters and has

128
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,160
GPS installed in it.  Is it okay?  It is very heavy.

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
What can I say about this, it will drill

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
right down.  It is not like it will explode as soon as it collides.

131
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
It will drill down.

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,320
After that he will reach the location.  It will explode again.

133
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,479

134
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
America has made such a wonderful bomb.  And this is the bomb that

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,600
Israel needs.  That is why

136
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,280
America is saying to Israel, my brother

137
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,240
America, please come.  Please come.

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,560
We are folding our hands before you.  Is it okay

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,960
?  So now America is saying, okay

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
brother, we will come.  But when will he

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,759
come now?  then no.  No, because see,

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Donald Trump has approved the plan

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
now and see, everybody is telling

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
Donald Trump that you should not jump into this war.

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,560
America they are not very much

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,120
interested in this war, our war is

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,080
not like this.  This war is Iran

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,120
's war.  So America is not interested.

149
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,360
Iran is Israel's war.  But here

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
Israel is saying that you should come.  Now see

151
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,000
friends, what happens if America jumps.

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,919
Isn't it?  So their nuclear

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,520
site will be completely destroyed.  It will end.  There is no

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,840
doubt about this.  That means the

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,919
objectives will be achieved.  This is the main

156
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
objective, isn't it?  Firstly,

157
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,880
let's change the regime, that is the second objective.

158
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
Step one is to end Pelling's

159
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,160
nuclear program.  Then

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
what will America do after that?  Will

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,720
America enter?  Because look, this

162
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,800
will be a humiliating defeat for Iran.  Is

163
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
n't it?  But in this, Iran will emerge as a hero.

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
And Pakistan will benefit greatly from this.

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,000
You will ask why are people of the country kind to Pakistan

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,880
?  Location, location and location.

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,440
That's it.  Its location in Pakistan is

168
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,520
so strategic.  That every country

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,520
wants Pakistan.  Earlier this war was for Afghanistan because

170
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
every country wanted Afghanistan.

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
But Afghanistan is now out of our hands.   The

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
Taliban have arrived in Afghanistan.  So now

173
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,919
since Pakistan is a country for sale,

174
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,639
catch hold of it.  Leave this one, catch that one.  Is it okay?

175
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,280
So this is the thing.  Now

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,240
I have already told you about the bunker buster bomb.  So on this, what

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,560
they have is this B52 stealth

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
bomber that they carry.  They carry big planes.  It is

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
exactly like a spaceship.  These

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
triangular shapes are not as they

181
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
appear to you.  These are exactly like spaceships.

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
You will not see its wings.

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
And even radars cannot detect these.  They

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
go so fast.  Their

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,280
design is like this.  The coating on these is like this.

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
These absorb radio

187
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,080
waves.  Is it okay?  Meaning, in a way,

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,120
you will not be able to see this plane.

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,680
This is what is called invisible plane.  It will be in front of you but

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,160
still no one will be able to detect it.  This plane has to be

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
used.  Is it okay?  So this is step

192
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,440
by step, now to use this plane

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
you will also have to face Iran's military.

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,160
So now Iran's military and although

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Iran does not have any special air force.

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
They don't have that much air power.  Their

197
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,120
air force is very bad.  These are very old

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,440
planes and now for that you

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,919
need more fighter jets from America.  Ok

200
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,680
?  And those fighter jets will

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,840
fly along with these B2 bombers.  Right?  So this

202
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,000
is happening.  Now the troops are on readiness.

203
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,919
Now you will say, Sir, it is possible

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
that the American army may

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
land here on the ground.  But that doesn't mean anything,

206
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,280
friends.  One of the possibilities could also be

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,440
that Iran attacks first.  But then

208
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
this also comes up that America and

209
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Iran are talking through the back door.

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
America itself has confirmed that Steve

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
Whittak is talking to its foreign minister

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
Abbas Arachi.  So the

213
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,599
talks are going on.  Do you understand?  The rest of the

214
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
things are very good.  It is good if Donald Trump

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
also speaks very well.

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200
Public are amazing public speakers.  So if

217
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
you also want to learn public speaking,

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
you are afraid of public speaking,

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
NLP EFT, audience analysis, personal

220
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
branding, body language, story

221
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,160
language, how to do group discussion, then

222
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,000
brother, our course is for you only for ₹400.  Is it

223
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,760
okay?  No coupon code

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
needed.  It has been created by psychologist Dr. Mayurika

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,680
Das.

226
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,320
Its link is given in the description comment box.  Is it okay?

227
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,560
So now, as I told you, the

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,880
whole matter here is that

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440

230
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,440
when and when will America use this bomb?  Ok?  Donald Trump has

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
given two weeks' time.

232
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
They have taken two weeks' time and

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,360
we will think about it within two weeks.  But I

234
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,920
think this could also be some trick to

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
tell the truth.  This is this type of bomb.

236
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
GBU which is also called Massive Ordnance

237
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,080
Penetrator MOP.  This

238
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
type of bomb is very heavy, meaning it is a

239
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,360
bomb equal to a room.  This is not a small bomb, it

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,040
is a very big bomb.  Okay so now see after that

241
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,519
as we told you, in this you will

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,839
need mid refueling additional refueling also.

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,560
And the

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,519
refuellers of America's aircraft are already here in Europe,

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,880
England, Spain, Germany and Greece

246
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,720
and they are going as well.  I am going also.

247
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,320
Then friends, what is here is

248
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Iran's missiles.  Ok?

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,080
American warships are also deployed to stop it.  Is it

250
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,800
okay?  To stop that and Iran

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,880
's missiles, the American warships are

252
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,040
on the radar.  Then after that there is a

253
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,600
huge need for aircraft carriers as well.

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
So the two aircraft carriers are already

255
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,200
standing here, True Man and Wilson.

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,320
He has come here.  Ok?

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
Whatever is on the Red Sea, the Red Sea is under threat.

258
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
So there is always

259
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,000
one or the other aircraft carrier of America there.

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,880
Look, the recent attack that happened, when the war between Hamas and

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,200
Israel took place, the Houthis

262
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,680
caused a lot of destruction in the Red Sea, so all the

263
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
American aircraft and

264
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,240
ships that go out from there, they go with utmost caution.

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,800
And since Iran does

266
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,800
not have any choice, it will now say that

267
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,760
it is now a

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,519
question of fighting and dying with all the proxies.  It has become a do or die situation.

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,399
So in this, destroyers like

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,160
USS The Sullivans and USS Arg Burke will

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
play a direct role in

272
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
defending Israel. Israel lobbies

273
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
throughout Europe and in America. And USS

274
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,360
Car Wilson, this also the strike,

275
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,399
basically as you just saw

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,959
how our navy has made IAS Vikrant,

277
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,279
IAS Arihant, all of them, the entire

278
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,680
aircraft carrier carries

279
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,839
a complete fleet of war with it,

280
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,240
so it had positioned itself right in front of Karachi Port,

281
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,120
similarly they have

282
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,760
positioned themselves right on the Red Sea.

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,040
And USS limits, which limits,

284
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,360
it is also on the way.  So in a way,

285
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,360
America's aircraft carrier i.e.

286
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,440
this sea is also in danger.  The

287
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
ocean is in the greatest danger.  Because this is water

288
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
war.  What is there to stop here?  The

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,160
trade of the entire world has to be disrupted.  Iran

290
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,040
wants to put pressure on the whole world.  Iran will

291
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,880
say that Israel will destroy Iran's nuclear weapons

292
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,200
and Iran will destroy the whole world by

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
blocking the Red Sea.  By choking it

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
because there is a choke point of 33 km.  of

295
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,240
State of Hormos.  Is it okay?  So, it

296
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,920
is important to save this as well.  That's why this

297
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
is also a battle of the sea.  Let's see, this is how an

298
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,760
aircraft carrier is.  From here these

299
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,440
planes take off so smoothly and for this you

300
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,040
need very trained pilots

301
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
because they are too small to get scared.  Then

302
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,920
when it comes, we hold the plane here with a rope like this.

303
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,000
So, this is amazing technology

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,120
, amazing things, and the USS Zera

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Orford is also going to be deployed to the European theatre.

306
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,399
Right?  So all these

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
things are after Don Trump, after that the

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,560
ground forces, as I said, are

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
also on alert but they are in defensive position

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
right now.  Is it okay?  He's not on the offensive.

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,040
So, at present,

312
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,040
Iran does not face any such threat from Invaz.  Is it okay?  So

313
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,120
this is just a defensive move.  And their

314
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,800
third navy destroyer is also in the Eastern

315
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,800
Mediterranean Sea and one
