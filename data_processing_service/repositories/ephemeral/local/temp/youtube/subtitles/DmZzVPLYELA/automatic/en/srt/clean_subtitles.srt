I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So how is America preparing for war? Yes, let's talk.  So bunker buster bombs and all these things.  Ok?  So, we will go step by step.  So look, I had already given the updates in the previous lecture about what all had happened.  Trump approved the plan and you already know all these things.  Now look at all this, whatever Donald Trump says, do not believe him that we have taken control of the sky. This war is good in information warfare. But it is absolutely true that brother, out of the 40 American jets that were parked in Qatar, only three are seen empty.  In which C130 Hercules is also gone.  The mid- refueling aircraft have moved towards Europe. And I have talked about readiness here. So the Pentagon has directly said that we have sent additional fighter jets, refueling tankers and warships.  Ok? Both these warships, True Man and Coulson, as well as aircraft carriers, have been deployed at strategic locations. Ok?  So the most important thing to look at in this is that you should look at Donald Trump that Donald Trump has said that we want an end and how will the end come when we will destroy their nuclear program and to destroy the nuclear program we have to attack their nuclear sites.   The whole war is about this.  So if you want to destroy them at the nuclear sites then you need such bombs which can destroy their nuclear sites. Now we have said many times that For Two Israel has not caused much damage.  So that is why they will need bigger bombs to protect them because America's plan can be long term.  Look America, there can be a civil war in Iran too.  If this continues for long then people will get disturbed there and then they will fight among themselves and American army might land there.  So ground invasion is also eminent.  Currently, there are around 40,000 US troops in the Gulf, which is maintained by America.  Is it okay? Obviously, help will be available from all over Europe also. So that coalition will be brought about which America does.  Step One in America is to first enter a country.  And step two is to stay there.  Bring stability which they are unable to bring and in step three they get out. Because of stability they destabilize the entire region.  So now we see these same things being repeated here.  Is it okay?  So it is told here that till now no American aircraft has entered Iranian space. That means America is on the defensive. Till now, look at any American aircraft, Israeli aircraft are continuously flying.   They are raining bombs.  Isn't it?  At their nuclear site.  But no American aircraft were seen.  But what is Iran doing?  The hypersonic missile and ballistic missile fired by Iran has fallen on their stock exchange.  Is it okay?  She has fallen at their hospital.  Civilians are being attacked and Israel can leverage this. Israel has said that we are capable of defeating Iran alone.  But if there is help from outside then it is welcome. That means if any country wants to help, we welcome it.  This means that there is a message that we will not be able to defeat Iran alone. So right now more than 12 F16s are relocated to Saudi Arabia.  Is it okay? Brother, mid refueling aircraft is very important.  Now yesterday I told you that America's Domes plane is also going.  What you can see in this entire region, in the Gulf region, there are around 400 troops here, this is your Iran.  So we will fly from here only.   Will come back after dropping bombs.  Isn't it?  And troops can also go here for limited operations. This is also absolutely you know but obvious.  And Israel is there too. Now, their main point will be that these B52 bombers that you see in Diego Garcia, they are ready.  Now these B52 bombers are very dangerous. And these bunker buster bombs are even more dangerous.  Now what do these B52 bombers, these B2 stealth bombers, do?  They carry the 300 pound bunker buster bomb. This is a very heavy bomb.  Very heavy.  No ordinary plane can carry it.  So this is what a B52 bomber is like.  It is exactly like a spaceship.  And you see, this bomber fits here, these are bunker buster bombs.  Ok?  Now friends, what happens is that this bomber that you are seeing, the BLU 109, is turned on by Israel right now.  This BLU 109 bomb is owned by Israel.  But the problem is that Israel's bomb, these four are the most important nuclear sites.  This is in the mountains. About 100 km from Tehran.  It is at a distance of. Many tunnels have been built.  Protection: S300 system is deployed here so that if anything comes, it gets activated.  So you can say that this is their brain. Iran has both heart and mind.  So now this bomb that Israel has, it can only go down up to 10 meters. That means it will cause damage on the ground but not below.  But this bomb that America has can go down to 200 feet.  Friends, it can go down to 500-600 meters and has GPS installed in it.  Is it okay?  It is very heavy. What can I say about this, it will drill right down.  It is not like it will explode as soon as it collides. It will drill down. After that he will reach the location.  It will explode again. America has made such a wonderful bomb.  And this is the bomb that Israel needs.  That is why America is saying to Israel, my brother America, please come.  Please come. We are folding our hands before you.  Is it okay ?  So now America is saying, okay brother, we will come.  But when will he come now?  then no.  No, because see, Donald Trump has approved the plan now and see, everybody is telling Donald Trump that you should not jump into this war. America they are not very much interested in this war, our war is not like this.  This war is Iran 's war.  So America is not interested. Iran is Israel's war.  But here Israel is saying that you should come.  Now see friends, what happens if America jumps. Isn't it?  So their nuclear site will be completely destroyed.  It will end.  There is no doubt about this.  That means the objectives will be achieved.  This is the main objective, isn't it?  Firstly, let's change the regime, that is the second objective. Step one is to end Pelling's nuclear program.  Then what will America do after that?  Will America enter?  Because look, this will be a humiliating defeat for Iran.  Is n't it?  But in this, Iran will emerge as a hero. And Pakistan will benefit greatly from this. You will ask why are people of the country kind to Pakistan ?  Location, location and location. That's it.  Its location in Pakistan is so strategic.  That every country wants Pakistan.  Earlier this war was for Afghanistan because every country wanted Afghanistan. But Afghanistan is now out of our hands.   The Taliban have arrived in Afghanistan.  So now since Pakistan is a country for sale, catch hold of it.  Leave this one, catch that one.  Is it okay? So this is the thing.  Now I have already told you about the bunker buster bomb.  So on this, what they have is this B52 stealth bomber that they carry.  They carry big planes.  It is exactly like a spaceship.  These triangular shapes are not as they appear to you.  These are exactly like spaceships. You will not see its wings. And even radars cannot detect these.  They go so fast.  Their design is like this.  The coating on these is like this. These absorb radio waves.  Is it okay?  Meaning, in a way, you will not be able to see this plane. This is what is called invisible plane.  It will be in front of you but still no one will be able to detect it.  This plane has to be used.  Is it okay?  So this is step by step, now to use this plane you will also have to face Iran's military. So now Iran's military and although Iran does not have any special air force. They don't have that much air power.  Their air force is very bad.  These are very old planes and now for that you need more fighter jets from America.  Ok ?  And those fighter jets will fly along with these B2 bombers.  Right?  So this is happening.  Now the troops are on readiness. Now you will say, Sir, it is possible that the American army may land here on the ground.  But that doesn't mean anything, friends.  One of the possibilities could also be that Iran attacks first.  But then this also comes up that America and Iran are talking through the back door. America itself has confirmed that Steve Whittak is talking to its foreign minister Abbas Arachi.  So the talks are going on.  Do you understand?  The rest of the things are very good.  It is good if Donald Trump also speaks very well. Public are amazing public speakers.  So if you also want to learn public speaking, you are afraid of public speaking, NLP EFT, audience analysis, personal branding, body language, story language, how to do group discussion, then brother, our course is for you only for â‚¹400.  Is it okay?  No coupon code needed.  It has been created by psychologist Dr. Mayurika Das. Its link is given in the description comment box.  Is it okay? So now, as I told you, the whole matter here is that when and when will America use this bomb?  Ok?  Donald Trump has given two weeks' time. They have taken two weeks' time and we will think about it within two weeks.  But I think this could also be some trick to tell the truth.  This is this type of bomb. GBU which is also called Massive Ordnance Penetrator MOP.  This type of bomb is very heavy, meaning it is a bomb equal to a room.  This is not a small bomb, it is a very big bomb.  Okay so now see after that as we told you, in this you will need mid refueling additional refueling also. And the refuellers of America's aircraft are already here in Europe, England, Spain, Germany and Greece and they are going as well.  I am going also. Then friends, what is here is Iran's missiles.  Ok? American warships are also deployed to stop it.  Is it okay?  To stop that and Iran 's missiles, the American warships are on the radar.  Then after that there is a huge need for aircraft carriers as well. So the two aircraft carriers are already standing here, True Man and Wilson. He has come here.  Ok? Whatever is on the Red Sea, the Red Sea is under threat. So there is always one or the other aircraft carrier of America there. Look, the recent attack that happened, when the war between Hamas and Israel took place, the Houthis caused a lot of destruction in the Red Sea, so all the American aircraft and ships that go out from there, they go with utmost caution. And since Iran does not have any choice, it will now say that it is now a question of fighting and dying with all the proxies.  It has become a do or die situation. So in this, destroyers like USS The Sullivans and USS Arg Burke will play a direct role in defending Israel. Israel lobbies throughout Europe and in America. And USS Car Wilson, this also the strike, basically as you just saw how our navy has made IAS Vikrant, IAS Arihant, all of them, the entire aircraft carrier carries a complete fleet of war with it, so it had positioned itself right in front of Karachi Port, similarly they have positioned themselves right on the Red Sea. And USS limits, which limits, it is also on the way.  So in a way, America's aircraft carrier i.e. this sea is also in danger.  The ocean is in the greatest danger.  Because this is water war.  What is there to stop here?  The trade of the entire world has to be disrupted.  Iran wants to put pressure on the whole world.  Iran will say that Israel will destroy Iran's nuclear weapons and Iran will destroy the whole world by blocking the Red Sea.  By choking it because there is a choke point of 33 km.  of State of Hormos.  Is it okay?  So, it is important to save this as well.  That's why this is also a battle of the sea.  Let's see, this is how an aircraft carrier is.  From here these planes take off so smoothly and for this you need very trained pilots because they are too small to get scared.  Then when it comes, we hold the plane here with a rope like this. So, this is amazing technology , amazing things, and the USS Zera Orford is also going to be deployed to the European theatre. Right?  So all these things are after Don Trump, after that the ground forces, as I said, are also on alert but they are in defensive position right now.  Is it okay?  He's not on the offensive. So, at present, Iran does not face any such threat from Invaz.  Is it okay?  So this is just a defensive move.  And their third navy destroyer is also in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and one
