Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, recently a video has surfaced from USA and it has gone viral on social media where USA's Senator Linjigram is saying that you just saw the bunker buster bombs falling on Iran. You all would remember USA's B2 bomber went to Iran and dropped bunker buster bombs on three locations to stop Iran's nuclear program. How successful were they or not, we don't really know for sure, but Linji Graham is saying that the bomb that we have just dropped on Iran, this is a bunker buster. Now, it is an economic bunker buster, which you can call a sessions bill, the US is preparing, which it calls in its own words that it will be an economic bunker buster and this economic bunker buster will be against Russia, India and China. I want to show you this clip.  This is a clip of a few seconds. After that we will talk about how this economic bunker buster can really cause a lot of damage to India. And I hope that there is still enough wisdom in the Parliament of USA that they will not pass this economic bunker buster against India. Now first of all look at this. House This Effect 84 sponsors Russian Sun Economic Bakar Bust Against Chinastickly to get if you ask me, I find it very strange that many times when US senators talk about India, they talk in the same tone as if they are talking about Russia, China. Not yet, even two, I will repeat it again.  India and USA have signed many important pacts. Like LEMAA, COMCASA apart from that we are cooperating in various sectors very soon.  As you all know, a satellite named NSAR, which is the world's most expensive satellite till date, will be launched jointly by India and the US.  I mean India US Corporation is visible to you everywhere. Perhaps this is the golden era going on. Of India US Corporation.  But still, what I see in the majority of US centers, whose people vote for them, who go to the parliament of USA, for some more reason, always see India in comparison to China and Russia, whereas India has never even remotely taken any step to hurt the interests of US, as China and Russia have done.  And if here you are asking me to see the reason behind this, then only one logic is understood. Americans view any potential future superpower, or even a regional power, with suspicion. You might remember that a video went viral some time back. I had also uploaded a shot on it where a US journalist asks a top US economist that why do we always take action against Russia? Why do we never try to weaken India?  So in response to that, top economists say that when India rises a little more, then whatever we are doing with Russia, we will start doing that with India also in the future. India Sameer It's actually quite interesting now after watching this video I feel a little bit of pride that as an Indian we have now reached a level that Americans casually discuss among themselves as to when will they start the process of weakening India and see this is the law of nature.  When you are rising, the world will try to weaken you somewhere. And umpires have always done this.  I will not say here that what the US is doing is evil or anything.  This is what empires do. Historically, it was the British Empire or the Russian Empire.  Napoleon I mean this is state craft.  But at the same time I think we should be very careful.  And now they are talking about this economic bunker buster against Russia, India and China.  Well, here is where you need to understand.  First of all, this bill is stupid.  Doesn't even make any sense. I will tell you the reason.  It is written in this bill that any country that purchases uranium, natural gas, oil from Russia, the US will directly impose sweeping sanctions on them and will also impose trade barriers across the world.  Basically, it will severely punish any country that purchases any kind of oil, natural gas, uranium etc. from Russia. Interestingly, Pakistan also comes here because in recent times you might have seen that Pakistan has also purchased Russian natural gas. So although I do n't think that these people will punish Pakistan because today Pakistan has become a favorite country of Donald Trump. Because of Nobel Prize and Bitcoin Investments.  This is an economic bunker buster and it will definitely harm India and China. And if here you are saying , well, there is a solution to this, simply stop purchasing oil and natural gas from Russia. Well, here comes the answer, this is the worst time to pass this bill.  Because India has currently doubled its oil import from Russia. Why?  Because the Strait of Hermos is an important choke point from where 20% of the world's oil is exported.  There is a lot of confusion on whether this state will remain open or not. Iran's parliament has given instructions to their military to block this trade completely. We do not know whether Iran's military follows these instructions or not, but there is a possibility that Iran's navy will be able to block this Strait of Hermouse and Babel Mandev, I mean Babel Mandev, I do not know whether they will be able to block it or not, but Iran will try to block these two important choke points. Now India has recently said that whatever Iran does, whatever happens in the Strait of Hermouse, India is immune to it to a large extent. We have purchased a lot of oil and we are increasing our oil imports from other countries like, for example, Russia. So the US would be throwing this economic bunker buster at India at the worst possible time, asking it to purchase oil from Russia, which has choked the Strait of Hermes. We will put on sensations.  What will we do?  I don't see any option.  I mean the US can only say in turn that okay then purchase oil from us.  But I do n't think the US will be able to export oil on that scale. And another thing is that when we import oil from USA, it takes a lot of time. Russia is geographically much closer to India than to the US.  So the delivery time of the cargo will also be longer.  So this is a big problem for India.  And that is why I am saying that I hope that the majority senators in the US Parliament will have the wisdom to either make some exceptions in this bill that we will not target countries like India here or if this economic bunker buster is really to be used, then it will be used in this manner on India, China and Russia. I think the US will just push these three countries together forming a very strong group.  Russia has already spoken about RIC.  Russian Foreign Minister has said that there is a need to revive RIC Trioka and it remains to be seen in the coming times whether USA genuinely drops this bunker buster on India or not. One logic being given in USA is that India is not living up to the expectations they had from it. Like purchasing F35 and then we are not even nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel Prize like Pakistan.  So again Donald Trump's administration is also angry with India at this time. So we will have to see what happens here. Major updates related to this will come in the coming time and this will impact India a lot.  And finally a very important message for you all, India needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have seen that IITs of our country have also started offering certificate programs related to data science and the reason for this is very simple.  The global economy is now largely data driven.  Unless this company has the power of data, that company cannot progress further.  And that is why you must have noticed that almost every startup today wants a data scientist and you have the opportunity to make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a data scientist yourself as a data scientist the doors of the whole world are open for you, you can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American Express, Accenture because frankly you will find the requirement of data scientists everywhere and Career 247 brings to you our flagship Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative AI course.  We specifically included generative AI here because today there is no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and Machine Learning cannot be mastered and hence our online course will run for 6 months.  There are 260 hours of live classes here.  So see what happens normally. Most of the courses that are online today are Data Science courses that are being offered by Google.  Harv is giving it. Mostly you will get pre-recorded classes and their quality is also not so good. Where s when you get live classes. You can talk to the teacher openly yourself. Through a webcam or a microphone, you will be able to ask questions instantly as to when this topic will be taught in the syllabus? What tools do you need to learn ?
