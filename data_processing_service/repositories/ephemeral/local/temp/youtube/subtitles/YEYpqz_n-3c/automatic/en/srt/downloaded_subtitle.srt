00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,639
Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
Prashant Dhawan. Now, recently a

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,440
video has surfaced from USA and it has gone viral on social media

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,039
where USA's

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Senator Linjigram is saying that

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,720
you just saw the bunker buster bombs falling on Iran.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,119
You all would remember USA's B2

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,680
bomber went to Iran and

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
dropped bunker buster bombs on three locations to

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,320
stop Iran's nuclear program. How successful were they or not, we don't

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,680
really know for sure, but

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,559
Linji Graham is saying that the

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,160
bomb that we have just dropped on Iran, this is a

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,600
bunker buster. Now, it is an economic bunker buster, which

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,840
you can call a sessions bill, the

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,559
US is preparing, which it

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
calls in its own words that it will be an economic

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,280
bunker buster and this economic bunker buster will be against

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
Russia, India and China.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
I want to show you this clip.  This

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
is a clip of a few seconds.

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,799
After that we will talk about how this economic

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
bunker buster can really cause a lot of damage to India.

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,400
And I hope

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,119
that there is still enough wisdom

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,080
in the Parliament of USA that they will not pass this economic bunker

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,720
buster against India.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,880
Now first of all look at this.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,360
House This Effect

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:35,079
84 sponsors Russian Sun

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,079
Economic Bakar Bust Against Chinastickly

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
to get

34
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,159
if you ask me, I find it very strange that

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,200
many times when US senators

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,520
talk about India, they talk in the same tone

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
as if they are talking about Russia, China.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Not yet, even two,

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,680
I will repeat it again.  India and USA have

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,200
signed many important pacts.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,160
Like LEMAA, COMCASA apart from that

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
we are cooperating

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
in various sectors very soon.  As you all

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
know, a satellite named NSAR, which is the

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
world's most expensive satellite till date, will be

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,319
launched jointly by India and the US.  I mean

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
India US Corporation is visible to you everywhere.

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,519
Perhaps this is the golden era going on.

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,840
Of India US Corporation.  But still, what I

50
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,599
see in the majority of US centers, whose

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
people vote for them, who

52
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,519
go to the parliament of USA, for

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,160
some more reason, always see India in comparison to China and Russia,

54
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
whereas India has never

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,959

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,879
even remotely taken any step to hurt the interests of US, as

57
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
China and Russia have done.  And if here

58
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,720
you are asking me to see the reason behind this, then

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,720
only one logic is understood.

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,840
Americans view any potential future

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
superpower, or even a regional power, with suspicion.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
You might remember that

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
a video went viral some time back.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
I had also uploaded a shot on it where

65
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,879
a US journalist asks a top US economist

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,519
that why do we always

67
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,080
take action against Russia?

68
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000

69
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Why do we never try to weaken India?  So in response to that, top

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
economists say that when India rises a little more,

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,680
then whatever we are doing with Russia, we will

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,000

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,000
start doing that with India also in the future.

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,720
India

75
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,159
Sameer It's

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
actually quite interesting now after

77
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,400
watching this video I feel a little bit of pride

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,799
that as an Indian we have now

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,720
reached a level that Americans

80
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
casually discuss among themselves as to

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,840
when will they start the process of weakening India and

82
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,320
see this is the law of nature.  When you are

83
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,519
rising, the world will try to weaken you somewhere.

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,120
And umpires have

85
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
always done this.  I will not

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,479
say here that what the US is doing is evil or

87
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,639
anything.  This is what empires do.

88
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,759
Historically, it was the British Empire or the

89
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,479
Russian Empire.  Napoleon I mean this is

90
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
state craft.  But at the same time I think we should be very

91
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,520
careful.  And now they are

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
talking about this economic bunker buster

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,600
against Russia, India and China.  Well,

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,759
here is where you need to understand.  First of all, this bill is

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,560
stupid.  Doesn't even make any sense.

96
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,680
I will tell you the reason.  It is written in this bill

97
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,280
that any country that purchases

98
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
uranium,

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,400
natural gas, oil from Russia, the US will

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,479
directly impose sweeping sanctions on them

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,800
and will also impose trade barriers

102
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,840
across the world.  Basically, it will severely

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,240
punish any country that purchases any

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
kind of oil, natural gas,

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,880
uranium etc. from Russia.

106
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
Interestingly, Pakistan also comes here

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
because in recent times you might have seen that

108
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,240
Pakistan has also purchased Russian natural gas.

109
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,479
So although I do

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
n't think that these people will punish Pakistan

111
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,639
because today Pakistan has

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
become a favorite country of Donald Trump.

113
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,880
Because of Nobel Prize and Bitcoin

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Investments.  This is an economic bunker

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,759
buster and it will definitely harm India and China.

116
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
And if here you are saying

117
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
, well, there is a solution to this,

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
simply stop purchasing oil and natural gas from Russia.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,560
Well, here

120
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,880
comes the answer, this is the worst time to

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,440
pass this bill.  Because India has

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
currently doubled its oil import from Russia.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,000
Why?  Because the Strait

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,479
of Hermos is an important choke

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
point from where 20% of the world's oil is

126
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
exported.  There is

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
a lot of confusion on whether this state will remain open or not.

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
Iran's parliament has given instructions to

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,400
their military to block this trade

130
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,479
completely. We do not know whether Iran's military

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
follows these instructions or not,

132
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,759
but there is a possibility

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,400
that Iran's navy will be able to block this Strait of

134
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
Hermouse and Babel Mandev, I mean Babel Mandev,

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,319
I do not know whether they will be able to block it or not, but

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,199

137
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,759
Iran will try to block these two important choke points.

138
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
Now India has recently said

139
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,240
that whatever Iran does,

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,479
whatever happens in the Strait of Hermouse, India is immune to it to a large extent.

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
We have purchased a lot of oil

142
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,680
and we are increasing our oil imports from other countries like,

143
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,000
for example, Russia.

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,280
So the US would be

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,759

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,400
throwing this economic bunker buster at India at the worst possible time, asking it to

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,880
purchase oil from Russia, which has choked the Strait of Hermes.

148
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,960
We will put on sensations.  What will we

149
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
do?  I don't see any option.  I mean the

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
US can only say in turn that okay then

151
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
purchase oil from us.  But I do

152
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,919
n't think the US will be able to export oil on that scale.

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,080
And another thing is that when

154
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
we import oil from USA, it takes a lot of time.

155
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
Russia is geographically much

156
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,000
closer to India than to the US.  So the

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,319
delivery time of the cargo will also be

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
longer.  So this is a big problem

159
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,919
for India.  And that is why I am saying that I

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
hope that the majority senators in the US Parliament will have the

161
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,240

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,120
wisdom to either make some exceptions in this bill

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,960
that

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
we will not target countries like India here

165
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,880
or if this economic bunker

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,240
buster is really to be used, then it will be used in this manner on India, China and Russia.

167
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,120
I think the US will just push

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,080
these three countries together forming a very

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,919
strong group.  Russia has

170
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,039
already spoken about RIC.  Russian Foreign Minister has

171
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,759
said that there is a need to revive RIC Trioka

172
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,800
and it remains to be seen in the coming times

173
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,720
whether USA genuinely

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
drops this bunker buster on India or not.

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
One logic being given in USA is

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,599
that

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
India is not living up to the expectations they had from it.

178
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,280
Like purchasing F35 and then

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,680
we are

180
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,680
not even nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel Prize like Pakistan.  So

181
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
again Donald Trump's administration is

182
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
also angry with India at this time.

183
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,080
So we will have to see what happens here.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,039
Major updates related to this will come in the coming time

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,520
and this will impact India a

186
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,320
lot.  And finally a very important message for you all,

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,640
India needs

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,760
data scientists today.  That is why you must have seen that

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,680
IITs of our country have also started

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,839
offering certificate programs related to data science

191
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,200
and the reason for this is very

192
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,360
simple.  The global economy is now largely

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
data driven.  Unless this company has the

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,920
power of data, that

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,240
company cannot progress further.  And that is why

196
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,800
you must have noticed that almost every startup today

197
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,519
wants a data scientist and

198
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,320
you have the opportunity to

199
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,519
make a career for yourself in this important global economy

200
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,839
by becoming a data scientist yourself as a

201
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,560
data scientist the doors of the whole world are

202
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,200
open for you, you can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,279
Express, Accenture

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
because frankly

205
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,320
you will find the requirement of data scientists everywhere

206
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,519
and Career 247 brings to you our

207
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,160
flagship Data Science and Machine Learning with

208
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,000
Generative AI course.  We specifically

209
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,040
included generative AI here because today there is

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and

211
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,839
Machine Learning cannot be mastered

212
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,320
and hence our online course will run

213
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
for 6 months.  There are 260 hours of live

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
classes here.  So see what happens normally.

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,880
Most of the courses that are online today are

216
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
Data Science courses that are being offered by

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,560
Google.  Harv is giving it.

218
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Mostly you will get pre-recorded

219
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,959
classes and their quality is also not so good.

220
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,839
Where s when you get live classes.

221
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,240
You can talk to the teacher openly yourself.

222
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,800

223
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,040
Through a webcam or a microphone, you will be able to ask questions instantly as to

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,440
when this topic will be taught in the syllabus?

225
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,800
What tools do you need to learn

226
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,279
?  You will be able to understand Pandas, Amazon, Web Services, Jupiter

227
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,519
properly and then of

228
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,200
course, under this course, you will

229
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,120
also do projects with us, which will help you

230
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
