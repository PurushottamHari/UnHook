I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So friends, today we will talk again about the Iran- Israel war.  First, let me tell you about the updates. So the two big updates are that firstly Donald Trump has said that I will take two weeks.  I need two weeks time to think.  Now maybe this is just an empty statement that doesn't mean anything. Let us attack today itself.  And secondly, Steve Witkoff is a very big person who was appointed as the special envoy for Iran. The talks that are going on are regarding uranium. And on the other side, Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Harakshi, both of them are talking on the phone and are telling that they have been talking on the phone continuously since 13th June. Although now it is not known what is being discussed.  But the obvious thing here is that you should forget whatever Donald Trump says. Donald Trump is not running the government alone.  There are Republicans.  There are many representatives, senators, officers in it. So you must have seen that Donald Trump says anything.  He is a mad man, a narcissistic personality.  He wants happiness in a moment and will say anything. But decisions are not made like that.  Now however this decision completely depends on Don Trump. Ok?  When will you attack?  And a report says that Donald Trump has approved it.  But the final decision has not been taken yet.  This means that it is certain that America will now enter the war. Approval has been received.  But it is not yet certain when it will land.  Now Donald Trump is saying that we need two weeks time.  Now what are you asking for these two weeks for?  Are they waiting until Israel destroys Iran?  Because friends, the situation is that Iran has attacked there with a powerful ballistic missile.  And a very sad news has come that a hospital in Israel has been attacked.  There was a hospital with 1000 beds.  A ballistic missile has fallen there.  Iran is saying no no, there is a techno park there.  We have dropped bombs in Techno Park.  Ok?  And the stock exchange has attacked the Israel Stock Exchange. So now see, attacking a hospital is not a big deal brother?  But then Israel carried out similar attacks in Gaza too. You don’t even have to say this. It had also attacked such hospitals. Now the problem is that whatever it is, civilians are being killed, which is very wrong.  So this action of Iran is condemnable.  In a way.  Now Iran is saying that we have done it in Techno Park.  But friends, let me tell you one thing, you are in a hospital, all this is nonsense.  When the attack happens, it can fall anywhere, the missile does not come with a name saying that we will hit near you only.  If there is a Surok Hospital right next to Techno Park, then brother, if it is there, the impact will be felt nearby as well. Let us accept this. I just said that no, but they say that when you are on the ground and you see that the missiles are raining from above then the air gets tight that these can come and fall anywhere. Now what happened here is that Israel, Iran and America said that the entire airspace is ours.  Iran is claiming that Israel stole $90 million worth of crypto. Their Sparrow Pro Israeli group has taken responsibility for this and 90% of the internet has stopped working here.  So Iran is saying that Israel has hacked it.  In a way, efforts are also being made to incite rebellion inside Iran.  Ok? People should be made to stand against the regime. So such videos or pro Israeli, pro Iran against videos, because it got hacked, you can understand that.  But the internet is down, there is a complete blackout.   The information is not available at all.  So Iran is making these allegations against Israel. But the biggest update is that here, firstly Donald Trump said that now I need two weeks and after that, talks are going on between Iran and America.   It's not like that.  That means the diplomatic channels are open.  Now it is not known how long this war will continue.  Iran's Fado facility is the most important. However, they also attacked Arak. Nathansh, Ishaan, all of them have become old. But Four Two is the newest.  Approximately 100 Km.  It is at a distance of in Tehran and is right in the middle of the hill.  The zig-zag paths have only one exit point and are very far below.  Some say it is 300 meters below. Some say it is 800 meters below.   Do n't know.  And Iran and Israel also have bunker bombs.  Bunker buster bombs but they can cause destruction only up to a radius of 10 meters.  The bomb will penetrate very deep.  Now I will give another lecture on what preparations America has made, America has it and it is a very heavy bomb.  For a very heavy bomb you need a V2 bomber and oh ho ho ho what a plane has America made, it is such a beautiful UFO it seems as if a spaceship is going, you will see even the radar cannot touch it, what an amazing coating and its nose is such that it escapes the radar, that bomb can only be made by America, this is the calculation, now one more thing was being said that brother even in Israel the people are against the leader Nihayau but this did not happen in Israel, there were no protests anywhere, what can I tell you. One thing you should know about juices is that they will have a million differences among themselves.  But when the country's turn will come, everyone will unite because their history is like this.  The whole world is being run by Jews.  The whole world has missed the Islamic word here. Ok?  He did not do modernization.   The Jews did it.  What is Vladimir Putin saying?  Vladimir Putin is saying that look brother, if Iran had entered into a partnership with us then we would have made their defence system.  Now we have given the strategic defence system S300 but it could not save Iran.  So in the strategic defence system and the strategic partnership that we did in January, there is no mention of defence system.  This means that Russia has, in a way, left Iran alone but China has supported it.  And if China jumps into this, then America will definitely jump in and this could become the scenario of World War 3.  Then this will become a regional war.  Here Iran is saying that we will block the State of Hormos which will be very dangerous.  The petrol that you fill at the petrol pump is coming from there, so it will become expensive. Because now Iran has no choice. But friends, talks are still going on, so this is a good news, if we see, right, this is their enrichment plant, but Israel attacked here, the destruction was done on empty land, there was no destruction below, the centrifuges are completely intact, so that is why America's help is not needed, but if America jumps in now, like Tucker Casson or Steve Bernard, whoever wants to Make America Great Again, it will turn against Trump, Trump will have mid-term elections next year, because of Trump's work, I had told you yesterday itself that he will be branded as the worst President of America, and they have started this work, so nobody in America is supporting Donald Trump, saying that brother, if you go to war, it will be impossible to get out, and Israel alone cannot win this war. Ok?  Germany is also saying that brother, the whole world is saying restraint but in actual everyone will support Israel. We have to understand this and the day America went, see, no one has won that war.  You have to understand.  Please tell me even one war of America. It is absolutely true that when America jumps in, wars end quickly.  That world, that old time, was different.  194 America jumped into World War One in 1919.  The war was over in a year. Because America has that technology.  Americans are very good strategists.  Is it okay?  After that, again in 1941, within two years, in fact in just one year, you can assume that the Germans started retreating.  Ok?  And the Italian band played.  So this is true.  But friends, if you talk about modern times then Vietnam War is over.  He said the same thing in Iraq also. He had said the same thing in Iraq, that what they have in Iraq are weapons of mass destruction.  Nothing was found.  And the biggest thing, friends, the chief of Atomic Energy IAEA is saying that brother, we never said that Iran has an atomic bomb.  But friends, there is no atom bomb.  But yes, their nuclear program is at its most advanced stage at present.  It has reached the last stage.  This is absolutely true.  But Iran is ready to talk.  Look, there is no sympathy against the Iranian regime. I do not know that the way human rights violations happen there, women do not have any freedom there, it is not that it means but here one thing is that Israel is the aggressor and what should happen is that both the parties sit on the table as soon as possible, this will be the solution, but Israel will not do this, so it is the same thing, see public speaking, Donald Trump speaks very well, PM Modi speaks very well, for today we have brought an offer, it is a course of only ₹400, you do not have to use any coupon code, so if you want to learn public speaking, NLP, EFT, audience analysis, personal branding, body language, how to tell a story?  If you want to learn all these things then there is a link in the description comment box. Psychologist Dr. Barka Das has created the course. Ok friends, now this question is asked to Donald Trump that brother when will you attack? Because after so much analysis what did you come to know that it was certain that America would land.   Is it okay?  Don Trump wants to stop every war.  Just couldn't stop any war. No one named him.  So now he will jump into the war.  They have to satisfy their ego. But when they are asked that yes brother, we have held another meeting in another meeting room, another meeting of the situation war room, that prepare it brother, let us come and hold the meeting. But nothing happened in that too. Then after that he says, look, next week is going to be very big.  They all keep saying the same thing.  Ok?  I need two weeks time. Next week is going to be a big one. You didn't talk to me first.  Why are you talking now?  They always say that the next day will be very big.  The next hour is going to be a big one.  But nothing happens.  Nothing big comes out.  Is it okay?  So this is the accounting.  So now that there is talk of ceasefire with Donald Trump, friends, I believe that ceasefire will happen.  Ah, look, there are only two ways of doing this.  Either the regime will end, Iran will be destroyed, or there will be a ceasefire.  But pressure will be created here now.  Ok? For ceasefire because see, if the war gets prolonged then there is a lot of pressure on Iran and on Israel as well. Unless America jumps in, it is said, friends, America will win this war.  If we look at the America-Iran war, till now America had not fought a direct war.  Meaning they had invaded. This is war.  So if America enters Iran, this war will end but it will last for a long time, as they say, if you enter Iraq, you stay there for a long time.  You entered Afghanistan, you stayed for a long time and then came back.  This can happen with America.   Is it okay?  But for now, if America jumps in, then let's assume one more week.  But when is that okay?  Things are being talked about. So you are saying that we are not looking at ceasefire at this time.  We are looking at a total and complete victory.  So Donald Trump would have said something earlier and is saying something else now. And you know what the victory is, no nuclear weapon.  So he is telling me that brother, finish the game then.  Send in B2 Bomber whatever bunker buster bomb you have. Remove everything, friend.  Then what is the point in discussing whether victory is needed or not. This is just talk.  And on the other side, Iran, brother, fired a ballistic missile again yesterday.  A combination of 100 drones and ballistic missiles attacked Israel and Israel is suffering losses.  Friends, this Iron Dome cannot save you that much.  The Iron Dome is actually leaking and let us also tell you that their missile defence system can work only for 10 to 12 days. And Iran has been devastated, friends.  There is devastation in Iran. Around 700 people have died.  And people are fleeing Tehran because they have no defense system.  Brother, if Iran hits missiles then 90% of the missiles will be saved.  I will not go there.  90 to 95 but if Israel hits then all the missiles will hit.  This thing should not be forgotten.  So civilians are being killed in this.  But we all know that the regime and its leaders do not care about civilians.  If you die, then die, what difference does it make? So that is it.  Let's see what happens next, friends.  I would like to let you know whatever other updates there are.  I will keep telling you and this is a big thing that America is making its preparations in the Middle East.  No doubt.  America is making its full preparations. From aircraft carrier to its air fighter aircraft and mid-refueling aircraft, it has made complete preparations.   The ground groups are all ready.  So the Pentagon has said that brother, look, one thing can happen is that brother can be offensive and second thing is that Iran can attack American assets first.  Ok?  So, he is preparing for that too but his preparation is complete. And now you can see that so many casualties have happened.  We'll see whatever happens, I will let you know whatever update comes.  Rest you can avail our public speaking course. Description link is in the comment box. Thank you so much.
