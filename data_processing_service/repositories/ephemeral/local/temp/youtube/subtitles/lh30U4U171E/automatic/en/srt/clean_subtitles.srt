Hello friends, welcome all of you to Study Gloss.  Friends, recently there has been violence in West Bengal. And see, today West Bengal has become such a sensitive state. There we mostly see that there are clashes and violence between Hindus and Muslims. But we will have to rise above this and think about what is there.  Who really benefits from this fight between Hindus and Muslims ?  Political parties benefit from political parties. No matter which party it is, it strengthens its vote bank.  But if anyone's sacrifice is made, it is the common man.  You people see inside this that there is a person picking up this Tulsi plant.   He is picking up the Tulsi plant and a platform for Tulsi was being made there. Now Tulsi is worshipped by Hindus. Who will protest?  Muslims will do it.  But Muslims might also have done something which Hindus might have opposed.  So both of them were opposing each other and because of that this violence happened.  Now where has it happened, first let me show that to you so that you can understand the demography a little.  If we go to West Bengal in India, then 24 Parganas is located in the extreme south of West Bengal.  It is 24 Parganas district. There is a town within 24 Parganas which we call Rabindra Nagar and this incident took place inside Rabindra Nagar.  Ok? And this 24 pargana its population is 1 crore.   The population is around 1 crore and among the population of 1 crore, 73% are Hindus.  25% are Muslims and the rest are other religions. So you people can understand that both Hindus and Muslims dominate here. Look, if I tell you an actual practical thing, when both the religions balance each other, then such incidents are seen less there and where one religion dominates, whether Muslim dominates or Hindu dominates, such incidents take place mostly because the political parties try to take advantage of this. They think that there is a vote bank. He sees vote bank everywhere.  Let me explain it to you with an example. Suppose your shoe is torn and you are thinking of buying a shoe.  You have to buy the shoes.  What will happen to you now? How will your psychology change? What would you do?  We will search it on the net. When you go to the market you will not see shops.  But only the shop on top of which those shoes are kept will be visible.  You will look at people's feet to see who is wearing what shoes.  And the day you buy shoes, you will stop looking at people's feet. This is actually how psychology works.  You guys will see it yourself.  Similarly, what happens is that whoever sees vote bank, sees vote bank everywhere.  Even if common people lose their lives in it, he does n't care.  He doesn't care even if there is violence. He always wants to fulfil only his political benefits. So first let us see what has happened. Actually look, violence is happening in this way. All the shops there are being vandalized.  The buses are being burnt and this is an incident. Clash on the outskirts of a Kolkata leaves five cops injured.  That means five policemen have been injured in this.  Four were also arrested and one woman who is a police officer, okay?  There are police women, what has been done to them also ?  He got injured a lot in this and it caused a lot of damage to him.  Ok?  So you can look at the incident this way.  Now there are many shops inside the market.  There was a discussion going on regarding the illegal encroachment on those shops, that how come this shop is here ?  Hindus said that friend, here these are illegal shops of Muslims.  Ok?  Muslims are saying that Tulsi plant will not be planted here. As I told you, the Tulsi plant is being planted and gradually tension is created between the two regarding this matter and that tension gets converted into a fight. Before this you people saw what happened inside Murshidabad.  There was terrible violence here regarding the Muslim Buff Board. And the State Governor had even written to the Central Government that things are getting out of control here.  Why not impose presidential rule here?  So whenever democracy collapses in any state, presidential rule is imposed there. If I am asked what really should happen to West Bengal, then you can assume that after imposition of Presidential rule, all the conditions will be normalised and people should be told that your development should be economic development.  Unless you people understand, nothing will happen.   There are some places in West Bengal where there is a very dense population.  Dense population, for example, if you look at 24 Parganas, there are 1 crore people there, this is a big thing just in one district. Sex ratio of 24 Parganas is 942.   It is less than 1000.  So you can see how the demography there is balanced.  So, first of all, if we use Article 356 as per Constitution, then Presidential rule can be imposed there. If the Governor again writes a letter to the President.  The President will have to take permission from the Cabinet and as soon as the permission comes from there, it is on the recommendation of the Cabinet.  So as soon as it comes from there, then Presidential rule can be imposed in West Bengal.  Now some such situations are developing.  Now the thing is that here only two parties are talked about, TMC and BJP. One is Trinamool Congress and the other is BJP.  We will not talk about the party.  We will talk to them at the higher level as to who will ultimately suffer the loss?  Do you see any leader here?  The leaders disappear from there.  But common people suffer loss here. Like you guys look at this man.  This man is injured and he is the shopkeeper there.   He is a small shopkeeper.  You tell me, as soon as this person gets injured, who will open his shop?  Who will handle it?  And if the shop does not open then how much loss will his family suffer?  Nobody cares about him.  At that time the parties do not come forward.  They suffer a lot of losses at that time. So, they will have to understand this. Ok?  Actually, what happens is that these incidents happen every day in India. In some state or the other, West Bengal or some other state, today another incident has happened in India.  Well, it appears to be a technical fault. A plane has crashed.   The plane has crashed.  He was going to London and former CM Vijay Rupani was also there.  Isn't it? They too might have been involved in the accident because at the time I was recording the lecture, till then there was no such news but it is possible that there were 242 passengers in it, so these incidents that are happening in India, especially the plane crash is a technical fault, we will find out about it but these clashes etc. that happen, they cause harm to each other, due to this we come on the back foot somewhere or the other.  We, our economic growth, if you look at the incident of 2023, in 2023, there were many incidents that took place in 2024 as well, like the Sandesh Khali incident, which was a burning incident, a lot of people were injured and died in that, but the thing is that they could never be compensated for their families, how can this problem that is there today be solved, then the thing is that Presidential rule is the only way left, at that time Presidential rule should be imposed in West Bengal.  Now see, the thing is that it shares border with Bangladesh also. Today, wherever the border with Bangladesh is being shared, disturbances have gradually started getting created there. So, we have some Bangladeshi migrants who come to West Bengal. Isn't it?  Because Bangladesh itself is too many, they too will have to be wiped out first. See, what happens many times is that if any problem is going on inside your house, a neighbor gets a chance and makes it worse. He works like adding fuel to the fire. He gets a chance to say that partying is very common here. TMC, BJP, everything happens here.  So he is not a worker of any party. No, he is Bangladeshi and coming from somewhere else. Whatever he is, he forcibly calls himself a party worker and this is how it happens. This also happens many times.  So the neighbor gets a chance and this violence is created. So, we will have to understand from these incidents. Ok?  What kind of justice is this - setting police vehicles on fire, setting shops on fire ?  So, these kind of incidents, somewhere or the other, are causing harm to India.  Community violence etc., religious violence, all these things are hampered.  And see, people become enemies of each other.  Hindus and Muslims become enemies of each other. So, somewhere there is a need to think and understand these things a lot.
