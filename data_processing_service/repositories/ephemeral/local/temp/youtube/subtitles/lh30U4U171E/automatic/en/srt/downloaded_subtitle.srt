00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello friends, welcome all of you to

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Study Gloss.  Friends, recently there has been

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,120
violence in West Bengal.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,639
And see, today West Bengal has

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,400
become such a sensitive state.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,320
There we mostly see that there are

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,600
clashes and violence between Hindus and Muslims.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,119
But we will

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,359
have to rise above this and think about what is there.  Who really

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,519
benefits from this fight between Hindus and Muslims

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,599
?  Political parties

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
benefit from political parties.

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,520
No matter which party it is, it strengthens its vote

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,960
bank.  But if anyone's

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,200
sacrifice is made, it is the common man.  You people

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,480
see inside this that there is a person

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
picking up this Tulsi plant.   He is

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
picking up the Tulsi plant and

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520
a platform for Tulsi was being made there.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,760
Now Tulsi is worshipped by Hindus.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
Who will protest?  Muslims will do it.  But

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Muslims might also have done something which

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,079
Hindus might have opposed.  So both of them were

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,119
opposing each other and because of that this

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,720
violence happened.  Now

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,240
where has it happened, first let me show that to you

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
so that you can understand the demography a little.  If

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
we

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
go to West Bengal in India, then

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,799
24 Parganas is located in the extreme south of West Bengal.  It

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,240
is 24 Parganas district.

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,560
There is a town within 24 Parganas which

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,600
we call Rabindra Nagar and

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,840
this incident took place inside Rabindra Nagar.  Ok?

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,920
And this 24 pargana its population is 1 crore.   The

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,119
population is around 1 crore and

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,320
among the population of 1 crore, 73% are Hindus.  25%

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,360
are Muslims and the rest are other religions.

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,079
So you people can understand that

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
both Hindus and Muslims dominate here.

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,240
 

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,000
Look, if I tell you an actual practical

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,240
thing, when both the religions

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,960
balance each other, then such incidents are seen less there

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,640
and where one religion dominates,

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,439
whether Muslim dominates or

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
Hindu dominates, such incidents take place

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,879
mostly because the political

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
parties try to take advantage of this.

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,160
They think that there is a vote bank.

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
He sees vote bank everywhere.  Let me

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,120
explain it to you with an example.

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,040
Suppose your shoe is torn and you are

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
thinking of buying a shoe.  You have to

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
buy the shoes.  What will happen to you now?

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,239
How will your psychology change?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
What would you do?  We will search it on the net.

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,800
When you go to the market you will

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
not see shops.  But only the shop on

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,440
top of which those shoes are kept will be visible.  You will

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
look at people's feet to see

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,200
who is wearing what shoes.  And the day

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
you buy shoes, you will

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
stop looking at people's feet.

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
This is actually how psychology works.  You

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
guys will see it yourself.  Similarly, what happens is that

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,800
whoever sees vote bank,

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,120
sees vote bank everywhere.  Even if

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
common people lose their lives in it, he does

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,360
n't care.  He doesn't care even if there is violence.

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,840
He always wants to fulfil only his political

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,000
benefits.

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
So first let us see what has happened.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,200

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
Actually look, violence is happening in this way.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
All the shops there are being

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
vandalized.  The buses are being

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,720
burnt and this is an incident.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,959
Clash on the outskirts of a Kolkata leaves

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
five cops injured.  That means five policemen have been

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
injured in this.  Four were

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,799
also arrested and one woman who is a police officer,

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,560
okay?  There are police women, what has been done to them also

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
?  He got injured a lot in this and it caused a lot of

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
damage to him.  Ok?  So you

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
can look at the incident this way.  Now there are

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,920
many shops inside the market.  There was a

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,799

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,440
discussion going on regarding the illegal encroachment on those shops, that how come this shop is here

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,319
?  Hindus said that friend, here

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,120
these are illegal

93
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,200
shops of Muslims.  Ok?  Muslims are saying

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,439
that Tulsi plant will not be planted here.

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
As I told you, the Tulsi plant is being

96
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,920
planted and

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
gradually tension is created between the two regarding this matter

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,840
and that

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,840
tension gets converted into a fight.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Before this you people saw

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,680
what happened inside Murshidabad.  There was

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,840
terrible violence here regarding the Muslim Buff Board.

103
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,919
And the State

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
Governor had even written to the Central Government

105
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,919
that things are getting out of

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,759
control here.  Why not

107
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,720
impose presidential rule here?  So

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,400
whenever democracy collapses in any state,

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
presidential rule is imposed there.

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,600
If I am asked what really should happen to

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,840
West Bengal, then you can

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
assume that after imposition of Presidential rule,

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,160
all the conditions will be normalised

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,240
and people should be told that your

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,960
development should be economic

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,440
development.  Unless you people

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,600
understand, nothing will happen.   There are

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,960
 

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,160
some places in West Bengal where there is a

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,320
very dense population.  Dense

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,000
population, for example, if you look at 24 Parganas, there are 1

123
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
crore people there,

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,479
this is a big thing just in one district.

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,440
Sex ratio of 24 Parganas is 942.   It

126
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,520
is less than 1000.  So you can see

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
how the demography there is

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,240
balanced.  So, first of all, if

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,160
we use Article 356 as per

130
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
Constitution, then

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Presidential rule can be imposed there.

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,960
If the Governor again writes a letter

133
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,199
to the President.  The President will

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,280
have to take permission from the Cabinet and as soon as the

135
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,680
permission comes from there, it is on the recommendation

136
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,919
of the Cabinet.  So as soon as it comes from there,

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
then Presidential

138
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,440
rule can be imposed in West Bengal.  Now some such

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,600
situations are developing.  Now the thing is that

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,320
here only two parties are talked about, TMC and BJP.

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,560
One is Trinamool Congress

142
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,560
and the other is BJP.  We will

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
not talk about the party.  We will talk to them at the higher level

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,080
as to who will ultimately suffer the loss?  Do

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,120
you see any leader here?  The leaders

146
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
disappear from there.  But common

147
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,759
people suffer loss here.

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759
Like you guys look at this man.  This man is

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,080
injured and he is the shopkeeper there.   He

150
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,600
is a small shopkeeper.  You tell me,

151
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,479
as soon as this person gets injured,

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,120
who will open his shop?  Who will handle it?  And if the

153
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,840
shop does not open then

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,080
how much loss will his family suffer?  Nobody cares about him.  At that

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
time the parties do

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,800
not come forward.  They suffer a lot of losses at that time.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,919
So, they will have to understand this.

158
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Ok?  Actually, what happens is that

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,360
these incidents happen every day in India.

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,479
In some state or the other, West Bengal or

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
some other state, today another

162
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,639
incident has happened in India.  Well, it

163
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,440
appears to be a technical fault.

164
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
A plane has crashed.   The

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,599
plane has crashed.  He was going to London

166
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
and former CM Vijay

167
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
Rupani was also there.  Isn't it?

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
They too might have been involved in the accident because at the time I was

169
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
recording the lecture, till then there was no

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
such news but it is possible that there were

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,479
242 passengers in it, so

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,639
these incidents that are happening in India,

173
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,160
especially the plane crash is

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
a technical fault, we will find out about it

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
but these clashes etc. that happen, they

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,520
cause harm to each other, due to this we

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
come on the back foot somewhere or the other.  We,

178
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
our economic growth, if you

179
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,400
look at the incident of 2023,

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,199
in 2023, there were many incidents that took place in 2024 as well,

181
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,680
like the Sandesh

182
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
Khali incident, which was a burning incident,

183
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,000
a lot of people were injured and died in that,

184
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,840
but the thing is

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that they could never be compensated for their

186
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,680
families, how can this problem that is there today be

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,080
solved, then the thing is that

188
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
Presidential rule is the only way left, at

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,479
that time

190
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,280
Presidential rule should be imposed in West Bengal.  Now see, the

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,560
thing is that it shares border with Bangladesh also.

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,919
Today, wherever the

193
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,919
border with Bangladesh is being shared,

194
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,360
disturbances have gradually started getting created there.

195
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,280
So, we have some Bangladeshi

196
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
migrants who come to West Bengal.

197
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,840
Isn't it?  Because Bangladesh

198
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
itself is too many, they too will have to be wiped out first.

199
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,800
See, what happens many times is that

200
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,280
if

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,080
any problem is going on inside your house, a

202
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,399
neighbor gets a chance and makes it worse.

203
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,080
He works like adding fuel to the fire.

204
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
He gets a chance to say that

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
partying is very common here.

206
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,599
TMC, BJP, everything happens here.  So

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
he is not a worker of any party.

208
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,920
No, he is Bangladeshi and coming from somewhere else.

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
Whatever he is, he forcibly calls himself a party

210
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,080
worker and this is how it happens.

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,760
This also happens many times.  So the neighbor

212
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
gets a chance and this violence is created.

213
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,720
So, we will have to understand from these incidents.

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,399
Ok?  What kind of justice is this -

215
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,279
setting police vehicles on fire, setting shops on fire

216
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,440
?  So, these kind of

217
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
incidents, somewhere or the other, are causing

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,839
harm to India.  Community

219
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,760
violence etc., religious violence, all these things are

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
hampered.  And see, people

221
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
become enemies of each other.  Hindus and

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,920
Muslims become enemies of each other.

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,240
So, somewhere there is a

224
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,240
need to think and understand these things a lot.

225
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
