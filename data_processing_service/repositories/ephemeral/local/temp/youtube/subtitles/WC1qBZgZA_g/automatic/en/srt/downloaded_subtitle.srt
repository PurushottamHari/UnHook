Mission.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello Friends.  Friends, many of you might have

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,960
such a habit that while sitting in the room, you set the

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,160
temperature of the AC to very low.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,160
18°C, 16°C.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,039
But let me tell you that you will have to improve this habit now

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
because the government is going to

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,320
implement a very important rule very soon.

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,960
Now, whatever ACs will come

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,239
in the houses, the temperature there will be

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
minimum 20° Celsius only.  He

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,920
won't be able to go below that.  You can see this

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,320
news new air conditions to have 20° Celsius

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
as minimum temperature Power Minister.  Let us

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
understand this in a little detail,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what exactly is this?  Why is this being done?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
What was done before this?  You will

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
get to know everything.  Let's move on.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
But before that let me tell you that

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,079
those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026,

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
our new GS Foundation

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
batch is Pratigya batch, the most special thing about which is that

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,800
complete preparation is done for the prelims mains interview

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
and if you

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
crack the prelims also, then the entire

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,560
fee is also refunded to you.  This

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,040
batch has started.  To join use

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
given in the comment section.  Let's get started.

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,960
As I was telling you, this is the first of

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
its kind move because if you look at South Asia,

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
such a step has not been taken yet.  The

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,400
effort is to standardize air conditioning

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,560
across the sectors in the country where AC is

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
used

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
and the government is

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
soon going to make it mandatory that the

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,079
temperature of air conditioners should not

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,799
go below 20° Celsius

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
and should not go above 28° Celsius.

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
And let me tell you that this was

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,200

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
announced yesterday by Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Manohar Lal Khattar ji.  Well

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
let's look at a little background behind this.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
What is the current scenario right now?  Now at present

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,560
you will see in India that the temperature of all the ACs is

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,159
allowed,

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,200
their setting is from 16° Celsius to 30°

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,920
Celsius.  In some ACs the minimum is only up to 18°.

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,640
In some it is up to 16°.  Meaning,

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
you can set the temperature of the AC between 16 to 30

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,360

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
in the current scenario.  And there are many such users

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
who actually keep the temperature of the AC

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,720
between 18 to 22.

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
They probably don't even realize

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,920
how much the power consumption

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,160
increases because of this.  Meaning, generally the mindset is that

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,879
whether you keep it at 20 or

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,959
24 or 25, it is the same thing.  So people

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
deliberately keep it a little low

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
so that it becomes very cold.  It becomes like a habit.

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
So the demand for

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
cooling energy in India is rising very rapidly.  There

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,440
are many reasons for that.  Firstly,

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,599
urbanization is taking place.  Meaning,

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,519
because of the heat here, people are

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,120
using more AC.  Income

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,440
level is also rising.  So people who

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
used to use coolers earlier are now

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,000
moving towards AC.  So many heat waves are being

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
generated in the country that the

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,760
demand has also increased due to that.  And the

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
climate change induced temperature

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,920
extremes are suddenly very cold and

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,239
very hot.  So due to all these reasons, its

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,400
energy demand has increased significantly.

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,120
Well, the question is what does the new rule

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,920
say?  Here the government will basically

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,560
mandate that all AC units that are

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
sold in India should have a

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,959
pre-configured temperature

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,560
setting between 20° Celsius to 28

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
° Celsius.

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,799
Like what is it right now?  Is between 16 to 30.

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,879
So this should be removed and it should be made between 20 to 28.

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
Meaning neither

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,040
can you do less than this nor can you do more than this.

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
And the question that will come to the minds of many of you is

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,000
whether this is only happening in the ACs that are installed in homes or

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840
not or whether any type of AC is being installed anywhere in the country.   In

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
fact, even in your vehicle, yes, whether it is

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
your home, office, institutional or the

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,640
big ACs that come in your vehicle, or

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,519
even the AC running in your car, its

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,239
setting will not be able to go below 20.

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,640
So this is a kind of upgrade.

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,480
You might remember that last time, in the guidelines issued by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,959
in 2018,

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
it was said that whenever you

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,160
buy an AC, the default temperature in it is set to 24

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,400
degrees Celsius.  Ok?

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,479
After that, whatever you wish, it means you are being told in a way that

108
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,720
if you keep it at 24 degrees

109
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
Celsius then it will be fine.  There

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
is no need to go any lower than that.  But still people

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
keep lowering its temperature and

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,720
using it.  So in a way

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
this is being further upgraded from that rule.

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
Well, what is the objective behind this?   The

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
first and obvious thing is energy

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,680
efficiency.  This means reducing the cooling demand here

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
in a way so that the

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,800
power consumption in India

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
reduces significantly.  And let me tell you, it is being said

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,919
by the government that

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,639
within 3 years, the cost of one AC

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,800
can be saved up to Rs. 18,000 to 20,000

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,960
in the electricity bill.  Apart from this, there is

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
a lot of stress on the grid here,

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,000
especially during summers.  Because let

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
me tell you that whatever power you

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,440
consume in the summer, about

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
40% of it, just imagine, that means whatever power is

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
consumed during the summer, 40% of the

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
entire energy goes towards AC only.

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
So somewhere here, there is

132
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
so much load on the grid, due to which

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
issues arise many times.  So

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
it will be much better in grid load management also

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
if this is implemented.

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
Along with this, we will be able to work towards

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,479
climate change mitigation due to CO2 emission caused by lower energy consumption.

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,320
Apart from this, over cooling here will be

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,120
prevented.  Why so

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,360
much of it unnecessarily? You must have noticed many times that if

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
you are in a shop or even at home it

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
starts feeling very cold.

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
People will use AC and also keep blanket over it.

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,440
So this

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
is a wasteful expenditure.  So the government is

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,000
trying to control it in a way.  There is

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,639
also environmental and economic impact here.  Let

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
me tell you, by increasing the

150
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
temperature of AC by every degree Celsius, the

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,800
power consumption

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,280
decreases by 6%.  That means you can understand that if

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
your AC temperature is 23° Celsius.

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,840
If you increase this to 24, then

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,560
your power consumption here will reduce by 6%.  And if

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,520
you avoid settings like 16° Celsius

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,880
and keep the temperature of your AC between 24

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,479
and 26, then major power saving happens here.  There are

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
kilowatt hour savings.   In

160
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,960
fact, let me tell you friends that it is

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
hot today.  Earlier I was running 26.  It has become

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
a bit too hot right now.

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
I made it 25.  I don't go down

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
because I start feeling cold.

165
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,160
So here I also feel that

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,319
somewhere around 24-25 is optimal.  There

167
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
probably shouldn't be any need below this.  Well, whatever it

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
is, different persons have different

169
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
requirements and

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,520
you will also see criticism from their side that

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,199
I only want 19°-18° Celsius.  So

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
why is the government controlling?  Well, everyone

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
can have their own point.  But here it is

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
also being said that during summers,

175
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,840
as I told you, the

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,080
contribution of AC on the electricity load is up to 40 to 60%.

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
So due to this move,

178
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
India's peak electricity

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,960
demand may reduce by about 3 gigawatts.

180
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,759
And obviously, because of this,

181
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,319

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,880

183
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,199
your impact on greenhouse gas emission power due to cold based power plants will be reduced.  We will need it

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
less.  Here, we will be able to reach India's Nationally

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,039
Determined Contribution

186
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
under the Paris Agreement.

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,400
So a lot of things are going to happen here.

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Well, there will be challenges

189
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
in implementation also.  First of all, the consumers,

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
as I told you, there are many

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
users who have a habit of keeping it below 20°

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Celsius.  Now it has become their habit, their

193
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,360
body has got used to it that they will

194
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,599
not increase the temperature above 18° Celsius.

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,840
Otherwise they start to feel a strange sense that whatever it is, it is going to be a

196
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,440
lot of trouble for them

197
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,160
especially in humid

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
regions like near the sea

199
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,080
etc, there is so much humidity that

200
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
people turn it down completely so that the

201
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,560
room becomes a little dry otherwise they

202
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
start sweating a lot.  Well,

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,319
apart from this there will be many issues for the manufacturers also.

204
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,639
Manufacturers will say

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,879
that their entire redesign, i.e. the settings, will

206
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
have to be redesigned.  Filmware is done

207
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
, remote configuration is done.

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
Many things happen.  So doing it again in a way is a

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
big challenge in itself.  And

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
along with this, the government will implement it in case of imported

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
ACs here, that is to say, the ACs being manufactured in India.

212
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,599

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
What about the ACs that are being

214
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,199
made in different cities in America and London, it remains to be

215
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,039
seen how the government will implement them.

216
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720
And the old ACs which are running will

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
continue to run.  You will

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
not be able to make any changes in that.  And then see, the

219
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,279
government is also adopting many such complementary measures.  The

220
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,760
government is saying that we are doing

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
many things within the country to reduce power consumption.

222
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Especially,

223
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,279
we are increasing the power supply from renewable energy.

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
And what happens

225
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,760
in renewable energy is that it is important whether you have battery

226
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
storage or not.  So here the government has

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,200

228
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
brought viability gap funding of Rs 5,400 crore.  It has been announced so that 30 GWh of

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,680
battery energy storage can be

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,680
built so that we can save more renewable

231
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
energy and use it.  Apart from

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
this, you know that the

233
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,680
government has introduced the star rating system here

234
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
so that the consumers also know that the

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,399
more stars it has, the better it will be.

236
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,480
Their power consumption will be less.  The government has also introduced cool roofs

237
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,560
and green building guidelines

238
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,720
so that your requirement of AC is

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,880
reduced.  When the temperature of your house

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,160
itself remains normal, a little better, then

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,200
you will not take the AC up to 18°, nor will you take it up to 20°,

242
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,680
you will keep it up to 24 only, so

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
here if I tell you the international comparison,

244
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,600
for example, if you see in Japan, the

245
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
recommended default temperature

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
in summers is 28 degrees Celsius.  The

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Energy Star recommendation within the USA is

248
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
25.5.  The temperature in

249
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
important public buildings in China is

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
regulated and kept at 26°C

251
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,440
or above.

252
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
So mostly if you look around the world, the

253
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
regulations are limited upwards in a

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
way.  And in India, that is, in South Asia,

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,560
India will be the first country which will

256
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
regulate it to 228 degrees Celsius.

257
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,080
So the conclusion is that

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
this initiative by the government is probably

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,959
forward looking.  Is climate conscious.   It

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,959
is an economically sound policy and supports India's

261
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
energy security goals.  It

262
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,720

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
supports the international climate commitments we have made and

264
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
also tries to change consumer behaviour in a way.

265
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,560
Now see

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
when exactly will this be implemented?   The

267
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
minister did not say this but confirmed

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,079
that it will be implemented very soon.

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
Meaning, it has been

270
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,839
announced yesterday that this is going to be done

271
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
and it will be implemented very soon.

272
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,279
I hope you have

273
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
understood things well in detail here and

274
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
before leaving, a very interesting

275
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,560
question.  Can you tell

276
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,560
which of these gases come under the

277
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,480
List of Greenhouse Gases of the Coto Protocol

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,920
?  You all know the right answer to this, you will
