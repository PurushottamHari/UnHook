Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission. Hello Friends.  Friends, many of you might have such a habit that while sitting in the room, you set the temperature of the AC to very low. 18°C, 16°C. But let me tell you that you will have to improve this habit now because the government is going to implement a very important rule very soon. Now, whatever ACs will come in the houses, the temperature there will be minimum 20° Celsius only.  He won't be able to go below that.  You can see this news new air conditions to have 20° Celsius as minimum temperature Power Minister.  Let us understand this in a little detail, what exactly is this?  Why is this being done? What was done before this?  You will get to know everything.  Let's move on. But before that let me tell you that those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026, our new GS Foundation batch is Pratigya batch, the most special thing about which is that complete preparation is done for the prelims mains interview and if you crack the prelims also, then the entire fee is also refunded to you.  This batch has started.  To join use this code ankitlive so that you can get maximum discount and its link is given in the comment section.  Let's get started. As I was telling you, this is the first of its kind move because if you look at South Asia, such a step has not been taken yet.  The effort is to standardize air conditioning across the sectors in the country where AC is used and the government is soon going to make it mandatory that the temperature of air conditioners should not go below 20° Celsius and should not go above 28° Celsius. And let me tell you that this was announced yesterday by Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Manohar Lal Khattar ji.  Well let's look at a little background behind this. What is the current scenario right now?  Now at present you will see in India that the temperature of all the ACs is allowed, their setting is from 16° Celsius to 30° Celsius.  In some ACs the minimum is only up to 18°. In some it is up to 16°.  Meaning, you can set the temperature of the AC between 16 to 30 in the current scenario.  And there are many such users who actually keep the temperature of the AC between 18 to 22. They probably don't even realize how much the power consumption increases because of this.  Meaning, generally the mindset is that whether you keep it at 20 or 24 or 25, it is the same thing.  So people deliberately keep it a little low so that it becomes very cold.  It becomes like a habit. So the demand for cooling energy in India is rising very rapidly.  There are many reasons for that.  Firstly, urbanization is taking place.  Meaning, because of the heat here, people are using more AC.  Income level is also rising.  So people who used to use coolers earlier are now moving towards AC.  So many heat waves are being generated in the country that the demand has also increased due to that.  And the climate change induced temperature extremes are suddenly very cold and very hot.  So due to all these reasons, its energy demand has increased significantly. Well, the question is what does the new rule say?  Here the government will basically mandate that all AC units that are sold in India should have a pre-configured temperature setting between 20° Celsius to 28 ° Celsius. Like what is it right now?  Is between 16 to 30. So this should be removed and it should be made between 20 to 28. Meaning neither can you do less than this nor can you do more than this. And the question that will come to the minds of many of you is whether this is only happening in the ACs that are installed in homes or not or whether any type of AC is being installed anywhere in the country.   In fact, even in your vehicle, yes, whether it is your home, office, institutional or the big ACs that come in your vehicle, or even the AC running in your car, its setting will not be able to go below 20. So this is a kind of upgrade. You might remember that last time, in the guidelines issued by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in 2018, it was said that whenever you buy an AC, the default temperature in it is set to 24 degrees Celsius.  Ok? After that, whatever you wish, it means you are being told in a way that if you keep it at 24 degrees Celsius then it will be fine.  There is no need to go any lower than that.  But still people keep lowering its temperature and using it.  So in a way this is being further upgraded from that rule. Well, what is the objective behind this?   The first and obvious thing is energy efficiency.  This means reducing the cooling demand here in a way so that the power consumption in India reduces significantly.  And let me tell you, it is being said by the government that within 3 years, the cost of one AC can be saved up to Rs. 18,000 to 20,000 in the electricity bill.  Apart from this, there is a lot of stress on the grid here, especially during summers.  Because let me tell you that whatever power you consume in the summer, about 40% of it, just imagine, that means whatever power is consumed during the summer, 40% of the entire energy goes towards AC only. So somewhere here, there is so much load on the grid, due to which issues arise many times.  So it will be much better in grid load management also if this is implemented. Along with this, we will be able to work towards climate change mitigation due to CO2 emission caused by lower energy consumption. Apart from this, over cooling here will be prevented.  Why so much of it unnecessarily? You must have noticed many times that if you are in a shop or even at home it starts feeling very cold. People will use AC and also keep blanket over it. So this is a wasteful expenditure.  So the government is trying to control it in a way.  There is also environmental and economic impact here.  Let me tell you, by increasing the temperature of AC by every degree Celsius, the power consumption decreases by 6%.  That means you can understand that if your AC temperature is 23° Celsius. If you increase this to 24, then your power consumption here will reduce by 6%.  And if you avoid settings like 16° Celsius and keep the temperature of your AC between 24 and 26, then major power saving happens here.  There are kilowatt hour savings.   In fact, let me tell you friends that it is hot today.  Earlier I was running 26.  It has become a bit too hot right now. I made it 25.  I don't go down because I start feeling cold. So here I also feel that somewhere around 24-25 is optimal.  There probably shouldn't be any need below this.  Well, whatever it is, different persons have different requirements and you will also see criticism from their side that I only want 19°-18° Celsius.  So why is the government controlling?  Well, everyone can have their own point.  But here it is also being said that during summers, as I told you, the contribution of AC on the electricity load is up to 40 to 60%. So due to this move, India's peak electricity demand may reduce by about 3 gigawatts. And obviously, because of this, your impact on greenhouse gas emission power due to cold based power plants will be reduced.  We will need it less.  Here, we will be able to reach India's Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. So a lot of things are going to happen here. Well, there will be challenges in implementation also.  First of all, the consumers, as I told you, there are many users who have a habit of keeping it below 20° Celsius.  Now it has become their habit, their body has got used to it that they will not increase the temperature above 18° Celsius. Otherwise they start to feel a strange sense that whatever it is, it is going to be a lot of trouble for them especially in humid regions like near the sea etc, there is so much humidity that people turn it down completely so that the room becomes a little dry otherwise they start sweating a lot.  Well, apart from this there will be many issues for the manufacturers also. Manufacturers will say that their entire redesign, i.e. the settings, will have to be redesigned.  Filmware is done , remote configuration is done. Many things happen.  So doing it again in a way is a big challenge in itself.  And along with this, the government will implement it in case of imported ACs here, that is to say, the ACs being manufactured in India. What about the ACs that are being made in different cities in America and London, it remains to be seen how the government will implement them. And the old ACs which are running will continue to run.  You will not be able to make any changes in that.  And then see, the government is also adopting many such complementary measures.  The government is saying that we are doing many things within the country to reduce power consumption. Especially, we are increasing the power supply from renewable energy. And what happens in renewable energy is that it is important whether you have battery storage or not.  So here the government has brought viability gap funding of Rs 5,400 crore.  It has been announced so that 30 GWh of battery energy storage can be built so that we can save more renewable energy and use it.  Apart from this, you know that the government has introduced the star rating system here so that the consumers also know that the more stars it has, the better it will be. Their power consumption will be less.  The government has also introduced cool roofs and green building guidelines so that your requirement of AC is reduced.  When the temperature of your house itself remains normal, a little better, then you will not take the AC up to 18°, nor will you take it up to 20°, you will keep it up to 24 only, so here if I tell you the international comparison, for example, if you see in Japan, the recommended default temperature in summers is 28 degrees Celsius.  The Energy Star recommendation within the USA is 25.5.  The temperature in important public buildings in China is regulated and kept at 26°C or above. So mostly if you look around the world, the regulations are limited upwards in a way.  And in India, that is, in South Asia, India will be the first country which will regulate it to 228 degrees Celsius. So the conclusion is that this initiative by the government is probably forward looking.  Is climate conscious.   It is an economically sound policy and supports India's energy security goals.  It supports the international climate commitments we have made and also tries to change consumer behaviour in a way. Now see when exactly will this be implemented?   The minister did not say this but confirmed that it will be implemented very soon. Meaning, it has been announced yesterday that this is going to be done and it will be implemented very soon. I hope you have understood things well in detail here and before leaving, a very interesting question.
