1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,359
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,840
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,559
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,160
friends, we will talk about India.

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
What impact is it going to have on India?  If the State of

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
Harmony is blocked, then

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,160
look at everything carefully.  There are two routes.  Firstly

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
you will come to Asia.  Look, this is it, isn't it?

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
What is this canal?  There is a canal.  So, that’s where

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
everything goes from there.  The Panama Canal is done

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
, the Swiss Canal is done.  This is your

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
state of harmony.  I hope this

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
camera is clearing it up a little bit

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,520
because it is quite blurred here.  And this

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,120
is your red line.  This is the Asian route.  Is it okay

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
?  So it goes everywhere through the State of Malacca and

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,760
reaches China.  It goes here.

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,440
And here you have this non Asian route.  It

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
comes out complete.  Then here through the Swiss Canal

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,559
, through the Turkish State, through the Danish State.

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
All these are transit routes.  These are the choke

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,840
points that you are seeing.  If you

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
choke Panama then

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,920
oil will not be able to reach America.  Is it okay?  If you

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
choke the Danish state here, then the European side will

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,359
not be able to go up here.  There will be problems in Europe in Turkish and Danish states.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
It's the same thing in Swiss as well.  If you block Bal Al Mandeep and

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,799
State of Hormones, it will

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,760
not be able to come to Asia.  So basically

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,240
where will the problem be?  in Asia.  Is it okay?  I

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
hope you have understood this.  So now you see this.

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,200
We have talked about this many times.

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,040
Now people must have memorized it.  So it is 30%.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
Ok?  If we talk about global

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,720
then 20% is LNG.  30% of your global

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
oil goes from here and 20% of your

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,600
liquefied natural gas which is called LNG

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,320
goes from here.  Is it okay?  80% of LNG,

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
which means whatever goes, goes to Asia.

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
That is, what I told you, state

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
of hormone hair market is most

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,479
important in Asia.  So most of the LNG and oil

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,880
goes to Asia only, Guru.  Ok?

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
And let me tell you that you will go to a very nice place.

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,079
If you take a course on Chanakya Niti and

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
personality development then you

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
can do it.  You have the

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
link in the description comment box.  Combo coupon code.   The

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
course costs only ₹500.  So look, the

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,640
State of Hormos is so

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
important because India also buys oil

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,040
but India is not buying oil from Iran.

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,600
That's why there won't be much impact on India.

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
Well, why is China scared

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
?  You can see that China has even

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,039
said that it will jump into the war.

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
China is ready to give everything including weapons

59
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,520
because China has half (40%),

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
right?  Approximately 4 to 5 million barrels per

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
day is going to China.  Half of India is

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,280
leaving from here.  It is

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
coming to India also from the state of almost.  Ok?

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
40% of India's oil is also coming from here.  But

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,440
45% of China's entire oil is coming from Iran.

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,840
That's why Russia, Iran, China are

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
very good for Russia.  Brother, look at Russia, if

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
Iran does something wrong, if it blocks the State of

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,560
Farmers, then Russia will

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,720
say buy oil from us.  We also have

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,879
oil.  Remove the sensation from us.  So

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,640
Russia will have the China band playing.   Are

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,959
you understanding?  So this is the main route.  There are so many Gulf

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,280
countries or Baal Al Mandir but

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,000
again it is very long.  This comes close.

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
State of Formos is near here and

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
these two are in the Persian Gulf.  Some people

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
also call it Arabian Gulf.  It depends on

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,239
who you are supporting.

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
Basically it is the Persian Gulf.  So the Persian

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
Gulf or the Arabian Gulf, whatever you

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,879
want to call it.  So, this is State of Hormos

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,280
this little one.  Is it okay?  33 Km  This

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,840
is the width.  This small one.  Is it okay?  This and

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,319
this is your hair Almandeb Gulf of Aden.  From here

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,720
also but it is closer from here to Asia.  This

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,519
is far away.  This is fine for here.  So

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,720
that's why you understand and here also there is Yemen.  The

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
Houthis are sitting here.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
This is also a choke point of Iran in Yemen.  There are

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,519
Houthis sitting here.  And Iran is here

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,440
too.  Iran is already here.  So both are

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,560
controlled by Iran.  But see, America is

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,959
very clever.  He already has his

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,959
ships stationed here.  So if Iran does

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
n't have Iranian Navy that's [ __ ].  Iran has no

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,319
air force or navy.  They

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,560
have their IRGC which is there.  So that's why if something like this

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280
happens America will go in and come

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
back to Marmur.  And the Gulf countries will also

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,599
do the same.  Era and Europe will also do this because

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
it is a NATO country.  NATO America is NATO.

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,120
So all you Netas, come on brothers, form a line and

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,879
follow behind.  Come let's kill it.  Go half here, go half there.

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,040
So this is what impact will it have on India now

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
?  Both India and China are saying

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
that brother stop the war because

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
our band will be played.  But India does

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
not buy much oil from Iran, rather it

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
buys from Gulf countries, their oil also

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
comes from here.  So the good

112
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
thing is that India knew this.  Looking at

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
what has been happening in the last three-four years,

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
looking at Donald Trump, looking at Israel, somewhere

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,720
or the other, these plans are known to all.  So

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
India diversified it.  India

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
's oil imports and alternative

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,000
sources.  Now India buys everything from Russia.  Is it

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,160
okay?  Buys from Brazil

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,440
and also from America.  So now

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,360
when India bought oil from Russia, there was a big

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,680
problem because Iran was included in CAATSA.

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
So anyway India did not buy that oil at that time

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
and we are not buying much oil either.

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,320
So the entire economy of India is

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
running on oil.  It is an oil importing nation.

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
Third are oil importing nations.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
Because our population is so huge.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,199
So brother, that is why we India and China are the

130
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
biggest oil importing nations because

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
we do not have oil mines.  However, let me

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
give you some good news that a

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,240
huge oil reserve has been found in Andaman.

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,400
India can become self-reliant in the next 30, 50, 30, 40 years

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
and we can also

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,440
start importing and exporting oil as we have

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,080
found huge reserves of oil.  So this is the thing.  So

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,199
90% of our crude oil and

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,960
40% of it comes from the Middle East.  So, I

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,000
told you that 40% of India's imports are coming from the Strait of Harmost.

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,080
But the remaining 60% is

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,600
coming from elsewhere.  Very little oil is coming from Iran.

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,880
India imports 5.1 million barrels

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
of crude oil.  Is it okay

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,720
?  And after that they are converted into fuels.  There is

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
petrol and diesel

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
inside the refineries, right?  Crude oil

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,320
arrives.  Now friends, India buys Russian oil.  So

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,320
that is why India will be saved.  India does

150
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,039
not need to take so much tension.

151
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,000
If we think about ourselves.  So, Russia has to

152
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
extract its oil, that means

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
in June it is absolutely fine brother, extract it, extract it.

154
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
Russia is digging wells and brother, the

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
war is going on here, so

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
India

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,759
bought oil from Russia at discounted prices, on which there was a lot of uproar,

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,680
America and Europe raised a lot of questions on this,

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
right, now Joe Biden was not

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
saying anything, but Mr Trump is very strict.

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,240
Ok?  So what will happen now is that

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,400
supplies will come from the Middle East as well as here

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and everywhere else.

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
But do you know what the problem is?  I think

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Iran will not block the State of Pharmacy.

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,720
Its reason is China.  See,

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
India buys half the oil from China.

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
Iran sells all its oil to China.

169
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,039
More than half.  So Iran's economy depends on China.

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
If China blocks the State of

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,039
Harmost then where will you take it from

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680
?  How will you supply oil to China?  So the China

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,759
factor is there, although Iran's

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
Parliament has said that we will

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,720
block the state of form.  Now I don't

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
know what is going on in his mind.

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
But the China factor is going to be a big

178
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,080
factor.  Because of which, somewhere or the

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
other, his state of form may get affected and then

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,440
he might get attacked.  Ok?  America has

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,520

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,160

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,880
deployed its destroyers and aircraft carriers in all the seas it has.  So if we

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
talk about India, it is 2.1 to 2.2 million

185
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,000
barrels per day and China's is double of that.   It

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,639
is double.  Ok?  And we have maintained the Russian crude oils.

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,199
And Russia

188
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
's share is 35%.  Considering the total crude

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
market, it is a very good thing that we are

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,919
buying oil from Russia.  Is it okay?  Now if we

191
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
talk about Russia, you can see that it has been

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,599
published in 2023 that as this

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,000
oil comes, as soon as Russia has come, this

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,120
is the year 2020, then everything is going well.

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,960
But slowly you will see the graph going very high.  Is it

196
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
okay?  This

197
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,319
entire India is in the sea,

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,880
more than half of it, 51% of India, is out.

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
So that is why I am telling you that

200
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,880
other countries have closed it down.  America and

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,000
China have stopped taking it.  But

202
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,400
look at India.  Ok?  So we have a

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,039
lot of trust in Russia and we have

204
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,919
also kept a lot of oil in our reserves.  Ours will work right now.  The good will

205
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,080
last a long time.  This is

206
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
what you do in a war situation so that oil prices do not rise.

207
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
You must often be wondering that Sir, why have the oil prices

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,840
not increased?  It is good brother it does not increase.

209
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
Similarly, petrol is ₹100 per litre.  Rather it

210
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
became cheaper all over the world.

211
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,319
So many taxes have been imposed.  Actually,

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
oil should be available for ₹ 60 per litre.  But if it

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
increases more than this then it will

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,800
take away the oil from the government also.  You should understand this also.  So

215
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,759
New Delhi has

216
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
traditionally imported it from the Middle East and

217
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
before 2020, before 2019, we used to buy a lot of oil from Iran.

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
We had second and third buyers.  I

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
mean, second, third, this switch kept happening.

220
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
But after that we

221
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
started buying oil from Russia.   There

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
was also a lot of pressure from America that

223
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
you will not buy oil from Iran.  As soon as Donald Trump came to power,

224
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,599

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
America withdrew from JCPO and POA.  Is it okay?  So

226
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,120
Russian oil was

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,920
also available at discounted prices.  So brother, India has to

228
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
think about itself because our economy is

229
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
not developed like Europe and America.  Ok?

230
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
We are developing.  So this is the way we

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,640
look at it.  Ok?

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,360
That was followed by 1.96 million barrels per day in May.

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Ok?  So this is a lot brother,

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,320
we have earned a lot of money from America also.

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,040
We have also purchased oil from America in June at the rate of 4,39,000 barrels per day.

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,920
Ok?  And

238
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,920
we have also bought great oil from Russia.  Now

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,320
if you look at last month i.e. April,

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,920
we had purchased 280 barrels per day from America.  Brent

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,480
and Crude are Brent and Texas, neither are these two nor are they the

242
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,040
standards.  So basically this 439 has

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,040
doubled just in June and

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
we have done the same thing with Russia as well.

245
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,399
With Russia also we are continuously increasing our oil

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,839
imports.  Let's

247
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
talk about the Middle East.  Let's have a look at this as well.

248
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,519
See, this will be at 2 million barrels per day.

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
Yet this is still where we

250
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,760
take most of it.  We have Saudi, Qatar and

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Kuwait.  Whatever number there are.  Ok

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,680
?  So this is less anyway.  We buy more.

253
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,080
But if you look month on month then

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,240
you will see a slight fall in India.  As far as the

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,040
actual supply is concerned, there will

256
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,880
not be much impact.  Ok?  So

257
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,279

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
what happens after that from 69% to 40% is that Sumit Ritolia here

259
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,040
said that the empty

260
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
tankers are going towards the Gulf.

261
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,480
So, that means it can fall somewhere between 69 to 40.

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,519
So the Gulf of Oman

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,000
could be half of where ships go from.  This

264
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,079
means that in a way, ship owners

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
need to pay a little attention

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,200
because you have not yet been hit directly.

267
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,399
Ok?  So what I

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
mean to say here is that brother, as

269
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,079
long as it is not a direct hit and there is

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,959
no proper blocking on the state of hormones, it will

271
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,200
work.

272
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,959
We have not seen any such decision yet.  Then

273
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
after that if we talk about India,

274
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
what will be the impact on India?  So

275
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,720
I have told you that in simple words,

276
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
India will

277
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,079
not be affected that much at the moment.  But obviously there

278
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,600
are rising tensions.  A lot of tensions are increasing.

279
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,760
So this price can go up to 80 US dollars per barrel.

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,920
But India

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
has multiple options.  Can buy from Russia.

282
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,160
Australia, America, West

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,720
Africa, all these do not go through the State of Hormos.

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,720
Qatar's LNG Surprise Qatar is

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,279
currently our primary source of LNG.

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,120
Ok?  Besides this, India

287
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
also has strategic oil reserves.  It is

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
not the case that we ourselves do not have any oil at all.  There

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
is oil but it is very difficult to extract it.

290
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
So we have that as well.

291
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,800
So we easily have 9 to 10 days covered.

292
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,200
After that

293
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,600
we can also buy from America, Nigeria, Angola, Brazil.

294
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,720
As we're doubling up.  After that,

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,640
India

296
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,360
can also give price subsidy to control inflation.  Isn't it?

297
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,279
Inflation will increase, brother, so we, the Government of India, are

298
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,760
giving subsidy.  No problem.  we will

299
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
see.  We'll bear with the

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,680
hobby for now.  Ok?  Because if we increase it by ₹ 100 then there will be a

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,680
problem.  Inflation will increase

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
everywhere.  So our Hardeep Singh

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
Puri, Petroleum Minister,

304
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
said that the situation is completely under

305
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
control.  Energy prices

306
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,480
are under control.  So you do

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,320
n't need to be too scared.  Ok?  So these are all the things.

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Rest of the friends, whatever happens I will

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
tell you.  Updates regarding this are

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,640
coming continuously and that is it.  What do you

311
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
think, please tell me in the comment box.

312
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,200
Be happy, keep reading.  This Siddharth

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
Agnihotri signing off.
