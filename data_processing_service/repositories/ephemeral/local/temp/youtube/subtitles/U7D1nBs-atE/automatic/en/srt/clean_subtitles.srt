I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So friends, we will talk about India. What impact is it going to have on India?  If the State of Harmony is blocked, then look at everything carefully.  There are two routes.  Firstly you will come to Asia.  Look, this is it, isn't it? What is this canal?  There is a canal.  So, that’s where everything goes from there.  The Panama Canal is done , the Swiss Canal is done.  This is your state of harmony.  I hope this camera is clearing it up a little bit because it is quite blurred here.  And this is your red line.  This is the Asian route.  Is it okay ?  So it goes everywhere through the State of Malacca and reaches China.  It goes here. And here you have this non Asian route.  It comes out complete.  Then here through the Swiss Canal , through the Turkish State, through the Danish State. All these are transit routes.  These are the choke points that you are seeing.  If you choke Panama then oil will not be able to reach America.  Is it okay?  If you choke the Danish state here, then the European side will not be able to go up here.  There will be problems in Europe in Turkish and Danish states. It's the same thing in Swiss as well.  If you block Bal Al Mandeep and State of Hormones, it will not be able to come to Asia.  So basically where will the problem be?  in Asia.  Is it okay?  I hope you have understood this.  So now you see this. We have talked about this many times. Now people must have memorized it.  So it is 30%. Ok?  If we talk about global then 20% is LNG.  30% of your global oil goes from here and 20% of your liquefied natural gas which is called LNG goes from here.  Is it okay?  80% of LNG, which means whatever goes, goes to Asia. That is, what I told you, state of hormone hair market is most important in Asia.  So most of the LNG and oil goes to Asia only, Guru.  Ok? And let me tell you that you will go to a very nice place. If you take a course on Chanakya Niti and personality development then you can do it.  You have the link in the description comment box.  Combo coupon code.   The course costs only ₹500.  So look, the State of Hormos is so important because India also buys oil but India is not buying oil from Iran. That's why there won't be much impact on India. Well, why is China scared ?  You can see that China has even said that it will jump into the war. China is ready to give everything including weapons because China has half (40%), right?  Approximately 4 to 5 million barrels per day is going to China.  Half of India is leaving from here.  It is coming to India also from the state of almost.  Ok? 40% of India's oil is also coming from here.  But 45% of China's entire oil is coming from Iran. That's why Russia, Iran, China are very good for Russia.  Brother, look at Russia, if Iran does something wrong, if it blocks the State of Farmers, then Russia will say buy oil from us.  We also have oil.  Remove the sensation from us.  So Russia will have the China band playing.   Are you understanding?  So this is the main route.  There are so many Gulf countries or Baal Al Mandir but again it is very long.  This comes close. State of Formos is near here and these two are in the Persian Gulf.  Some people also call it Arabian Gulf.  It depends on who you are supporting. Basically it is the Persian Gulf.  So the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Gulf, whatever you want to call it.  So, this is State of Hormos this little one.  Is it okay?  33 Km  This is the width.  This small one.  Is it okay?  This and this is your hair Almandeb Gulf of Aden.  From here also but it is closer from here to Asia.  This is far away.  This is fine for here.  So that's why you understand and here also there is Yemen.  The Houthis are sitting here. This is also a choke point of Iran in Yemen.  There are Houthis sitting here.  And Iran is here too.  Iran is already here.  So both are controlled by Iran.  But see, America is very clever.  He already has his ships stationed here.  So if Iran does n't have Iranian Navy that's [ __ ].  Iran has no air force or navy.  They have their IRGC which is there.  So that's why if something like this happens America will go in and come back to Marmur.  And the Gulf countries will also do the same.  Era and Europe will also do this because it is a NATO country.  NATO America is NATO. So all you Netas, come on brothers, form a line and follow behind.  Come let's kill it.  Go half here, go half there. So this is what impact will it have on India now ?  Both India and China are saying that brother stop the war because our band will be played.  But India does not buy much oil from Iran, rather it buys from Gulf countries, their oil also comes from here.  So the good thing is that India knew this.  Looking at what has been happening in the last three-four years, looking at Donald Trump, looking at Israel, somewhere or the other, these plans are known to all.  So India diversified it.  India 's oil imports and alternative sources.  Now India buys everything from Russia.  Is it okay?  Buys from Brazil and also from America.  So now when India bought oil from Russia, there was a big problem because Iran was included in CAATSA. So anyway India did not buy that oil at that time and we are not buying much oil either. So the entire economy of India is running on oil.  It is an oil importing nation. Third are oil importing nations. Because our population is so huge. So brother, that is why we India and China are the biggest oil importing nations because we do not have oil mines.  However, let me give you some good news that a huge oil reserve has been found in Andaman. India can become self-reliant in the next 30, 50, 30, 40 years and we can also start importing and exporting oil as we have found huge reserves of oil.  So this is the thing.  So 90% of our crude oil and 40% of it comes from the Middle East.  So, I told you that 40% of India's imports are coming from the Strait of Harmost. But the remaining 60% is coming from elsewhere.  Very little oil is coming from Iran. India imports 5.1 million barrels of crude oil.  Is it okay ?  And after that they are converted into fuels.  There is petrol and diesel inside the refineries, right?  Crude oil arrives.  Now friends, India buys Russian oil.  So that is why India will be saved.  India does not need to take so much tension. If we think about ourselves.  So, Russia has to extract its oil, that means in June it is absolutely fine brother, extract it, extract it. Russia is digging wells and brother, the war is going on here, so India bought oil from Russia at discounted prices, on which there was a lot of uproar, America and Europe raised a lot of questions on this, right, now Joe Biden was not saying anything, but Mr Trump is very strict. Ok?  So what will happen now is that supplies will come from the Middle East as well as here from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and everywhere else. But do you know what the problem is?  I think Iran will not block the State of Pharmacy. Its reason is China.  See, India buys half the oil from China. Iran sells all its oil to China. More than half.  So Iran's economy depends on China. If China blocks the State of Harmost then where will you take it from ?  How will you supply oil to China?  So the China factor is there, although Iran's Parliament has said that we will block the state of form.  Now I don't know what is going on in his mind. But the China factor is going to be a big factor.  Because of which, somewhere or the other, his state of form may get affected and then he might get attacked.  Ok?  America has deployed its destroyers and aircraft carriers in all the seas it has.  So if we talk about India, it is 2.1 to 2.2 million barrels per day and China's is double of that.   It is double.  Ok?  And we have maintained the Russian crude oils. And Russia 's share is 35%.  Considering the total crude market, it is a very good thing that we are buying oil from Russia.  Is it okay?  Now if we talk about Russia, you can see that it has been published in 2023 that as this oil comes, as soon as Russia has come, this is the year 2020, then everything is going well. But slowly you will see the graph going very high.  Is it okay?  This entire India is in the sea, more than half of it, 51% of India, is out. So that is why I am telling you that other countries have closed it down.  America and China have stopped taking it.  But look at India.  Ok?  So we have a lot of trust in Russia and we have also kept a lot of oil in our reserves.  Ours will work right now.  The good will last a long time.  This is what you do in a war situation so that oil prices do not rise. You must often be wondering that Sir, why have the oil prices not increased?  It is good brother it does not increase. Similarly, petrol is ₹100 per litre.  Rather it became cheaper all over the world. So many taxes have been imposed.  Actually, oil should be available for ₹ 60 per litre.  But if it increases more than this then it will take away the oil from the government also.  You should understand this also.  So New Delhi has traditionally imported it from the Middle East and before 2020, before 2019, we used to buy a lot of oil from Iran. We had second and third buyers.  I mean, second, third, this switch kept happening. But after that we started buying oil from Russia.   There was also a lot of pressure from America that you will not buy oil from Iran.  As soon as Donald Trump came to power, America withdrew from JCPO and POA.  Is it okay?  So Russian oil was also available at discounted prices.  So brother, India has to think about itself because our economy is not developed like Europe and America.  Ok? We are developing.  So this is the way we look at it.  Ok? That was followed by 1.96 million barrels per day in May. Ok?  So this is a lot brother, we have earned a lot of money from America also. We have also purchased oil from America in June at the rate of 4,39,000 barrels per day. Ok?  And we have also bought great oil from Russia.  Now if you look at last month i.e. April, we had purchased 280 barrels per day from America.  Brent and Crude are Brent and Texas, neither are these two nor are they the standards.  So basically this 439 has doubled just in June and we have done the same thing with Russia as well. With Russia also we are continuously increasing our oil imports.  Let's talk about the Middle East.  Let's have a look at this as well. See, this will be at 2 million barrels per day. Yet this is still where we take most of it.  We have Saudi, Qatar and Kuwait.  Whatever number there are.  Ok ?  So this is less anyway.  We buy more. But if you look month on month then you will see a slight fall in India.  As far as the actual supply is concerned, there will not be much impact.  Ok?  So what happens after that from 69% to 40% is that Sumit Ritolia here said that the empty tankers are going towards the Gulf. So, that means it can fall somewhere between 69 to 40. So the Gulf of Oman could be half of where ships go from.  This means that in a way, ship owners need to pay a little attention because you have not yet been hit directly. Ok?  So what I mean to say here is that brother, as long as it is not a direct hit and there is no proper blocking on the state of hormones, it will work. We have not seen any such decision yet.  Then after that if we talk about India, what will be the impact on India?  So I have told you that in simple words, India will not be affected that much at the moment.  But obviously there are rising tensions.  A lot of tensions are increasing. So this price can go up to 80 US dollars per barrel. But India has multiple options.  Can buy from Russia. Australia, America, West Africa, all these do not go through the State of Hormos. Qatar's LNG Surprise Qatar is currently our primary source of LNG. Ok?  Besides this, India also has strategic oil reserves.  It is not the case that we ourselves do not have any oil at all.  There is oil but it is very difficult to extract it. So we have that as well. So we easily have 9 to 10 days covered. After that we can also buy from America, Nigeria, Angola, Brazil. As we're doubling up.  After that, India can also give price subsidy to control inflation.  Isn't it? Inflation will increase, brother, so we, the Government of India, are giving subsidy.  No problem.  we will see.  We'll bear with the hobby for now.  Ok?  Because if we increase it by ₹ 100 then there will be a problem.  Inflation will increase everywhere.  So our Hardeep Singh Puri, Petroleum Minister, said that the situation is completely under control.  Energy prices are under control.  So you do n't need to be too scared.  Ok?  So these are all the things. Rest of the friends, whatever happens I will tell you.  Updates regarding this are coming continuously and that is it.
