The first war between India and Pakistan took place just after independence in 1947-48. After that the next war took place in 1965.  But the war that happened after this in 1971, the war of 1971 lasted for 13 days, in this war, India had defeated Pakistan in just 13 days, Pakistan was badly defeated here, but this war of 71 was something different, it was different in many ways because here Pakistan had been divided into two parts, we gave birth to Bangladesh, Bangladesh was created by cutting East Pakistan of Pakistan, in this war India not only won, a huge victory over Pakistan but also on 16 December 1971, the day this war ended, the mere 13-day war had started on 3 December. When this war ended on December 16, 1971, more than 93,000 soldiers of the Pakistani army surrendered before the Indian Army. After about 7 months from this time, which was the year 1971, after 7 months, on 2 July 1972, a peace treaty was signed between the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India. A peace treaty was signed called the Shimla Agreement and under this these 93,000 soldiers were released to Pakistan. Basically we kept them as POWs, like prisoners of war. We have released them here.  India left them. But during this time no one paid any attention to those 54 Indian soldiers.  It did not focus on those officers who went missing in the 1971 war.  Who were declared missing in action and after seven years, were also declared killed in action.  No one paid any attention to them and hence till today they are called Missing 54 and Forgotten 54.  Basically what happened was that when this war ended, the Shimla Agreement was signed. After all these things, when there was no trace of these 54 Indian soldiers, no trace of them was found anywhere.  The government had officially declared him as MIA, i.e. Missing in Action and it is said that after 7 years he was declared as IA, i.e. Missing in Action. But the families of these soldiers were not ready to believe in this status change.   The families of these soldiers were not at all ready to believe that their brave sons had been killed.   He has attained martyrdom.  He thought that perhaps they were still alive somewhere in Pakistan.  He is alive and is being held captive.  The family appealed to the government of that time.  We went to the courts, went to government offices, knocked on the doors of the Human Rights Commission. But the family members were not getting any relief from anywhere. Any special help that was available was not received.  But almost 3 years after this war of 1971, exactly 3 years after this war, in December 1974, a letter comes to India from Karachi, Pakistan.  And that letter finally confirmed that these 54 soldiers are neither missing 54 nor killed in action, they are alive even today and are imprisoned in Pakistani jails.  Now to understand how it was known that he was alive and was still in Pakistan, listen to a case.  Major Ashok Suri This is the case of Major Ashok Suri.  Major Ashok Suri was the Battalion Quarter Master of the Fifth Assam Regiment in 1971. 2 December 1971, that is, this was the exact day, a day before the start of the 1971 war. Battalion Quarter Master Major Ashok Suri was present in Chamb sector a day earlier. Munav and Dara were present at the crossing of the Tawi River in the Chamb Sector and were carrying supplies for their company and battalion which included first aid supplies and ammunition.   He was bringing all these things.  Captain Giriraj Singh was with him at that time along with some of his other colleagues and some of his fellow soldiers. Captain Kalyan Singh Rathore.  Suddenly these people saw that the war had not started officially from Pakistan's side. Suddenly there is artillery shelling on these people. Heavy artillery shelling causes chaos.  The attack happened suddenly.  The remaining team of the Assam Fifth Regiment which was here, arrived later.  The battalion arrives. Pakistan's attack is answered. But after this attack, when things became normal, the situation came under control.  After this, it was seen that these were the soldiers who were injured or who had attained martyrdom.  There was no trace of these three soldiers. Neither was Major Ashok Suri in it.  Neither Captain Kalyan Singh Rathore or Captain Giriraj Singh were present there.  When all these things came to light, a list of dead and bound soldiers, that is, injured and dead soldiers, was made. He was evacuated.  The names of these three soldiers were not there in this list among all these people. After this, the army declared him dead and it is said that when Major Suri's father, Dr. R.S. Suri got the news that his son had attained martyrdom in this war, he could not believe it because the army had said that Major Suri had attained martyrdom in the shelling and his last rites were performed on the spot. His body was not sent home.  So Major Suri's father, Arya Suri, was not ready to believe that something like this could have happened.  He suspected that somewhere, his son was alive.  He is still alive today.  For this he started making many efforts. He went to all the military hospitals. Cut the records there.  Apart from this, 310 field hospitals reached the Joriyan sector in Jammu and Kashmir. He saw the records there.  No record was found there either.  When no record of Major Suri was found.  Not in the dead, not in the bound, not in the wounded, not even in the dead.  After this, his suspicion grew further.  Basically it is a standard practice that in war the autopsy and death certificate is issued by the service officers who are service doctors. But here no such certificate was found by R.S. Suri. Major Suri's father's suspicion was continuously increasing and in fact there were many such things in which he received four telegrams from time to time after some time of the war of 71 informing him that his son had died here, which was received by the wife.  Suddenly four separate telegrams arrive at his house.  The date on it was written incorrectly.  The date of death that was mentioned was written wrongly.  So his suspicion kept increasing. Dr. Suri continued searching for his son.  At this time, whatever were the other belongings of Major Suri, whatever were his belongings, when the belongings of every discharged soldier, our brave son, come back home, it is checked to see what all of his belongings were present there in the battalion.  So when this stuff of Major Suri's Ashok Suri came to his house, the first thing that his father noticed was a helmet.  He noticed that the helmet was not the size of his son's head. This is different.  The second thing, her engagement ring was also missing from there.  The engagement ring was also not present.  That means, if you have performed the last rites there on the spot, the ring and other items would have been taken out and kept in his belongings, but they were also not present there in that box. Because of this the suspicion grew even more and his suspicion became confirmed that his son is still alive and may be in Pakistan.  He continued his efforts and continued his search, but about 3 years passed from here.  There were around 54 such families who kept searching for their sons for 3 years. After 3 years, it was the day of 21st December 1974. A letter reaches Doctor Suri's house.  There was a hand written note. As it was written from Pakistan, it was sent from Karachi, it was dated 7 December 1972, which means you can see that it was sent 2 years ago, it was written basically on 7 December 1972 and when did it come? 21 December 1974. It was written on this letter that I am quite okay here, I am absolutely fine here. After this, in the very next year, on 13th August 1975, another note, another letter comes to Dr. R.S. Suri 's house in Faridabad and in that letter it was written clearly that it was dated 14 to 16 June 1975, which means it was written recently, within two months it had come to the house in Faridabad, from Karachi, from Pakistan. It was written by Major Suri, the same Major Suri who was declared missing in action, killed in action 3 years ago, but what was written by him that Major Suri and his Also, 20 officers are alive in Pakistani jails.  They are imprisoned there.  It is closed there. After these letters were found, they were shown to handwriting experts. He was consulted whether this writing matched with his old writing.  The writing matched. After the writing match was done, all these letters were shown to the Government of India and then the Government of India further used them as evidence that this soldier is still alive. We are talking about Ashok Suri and 202 soldiers here.  He is alive and finally his status which was missing in action at that time was changed to believed to be in captivity. This is changed to Believe to be believed to be in captivity. But when this thing was told to Pakistan that we have such type of soldiers in your country. We are recovering his letters. Pakistan refused to accept it.  He was not ready to accept it.  After approximately four years, further investigation was conducted. Many officers from India also investigated. Departments were involved in this.  The Ministry of Defence also worked.  After 4 years, in 1971, a list of 29 such Indian Army soldiers was given in the Lok Sabha and that list contained the names of those 29 soldiers who were currently in Pakistan jail and who were declared missing in action or killed in action. This list was presented by Samarendu Kundu of the then Ministry of External Affairs and it was mentioned in it that these soldiers of ours are currently in Pakistani jails.  But friends, Pakistan always denied this.  He denied the presence of these soldiers. When further investigation was done in the case of Major Suri, it came to light and in fact, in the reports which are there till now, it is told that what was done in the case of Major Suri, by Pakistan, by ISI, when he went missing on 2 December 1971, when his Assam Regiment, Fifth Assam Regiment, was shelled, when he was caught by the Pakistan Army at that time, he was not considered a Prisoner of War.  He was accused by Pakistan's Special Service Group of doing spinning here.  This was doing the spine. He was held as a security prisoner. Kept on security prisoner status. Why?  Because if they are kept on the status of Prisoner of War, then if any exchange takes place later, their name will appear in that list. These will have to be sent back.  For this reason, he was kept here as a security prisoner and was transferred to different jails of Pakistan every time.   They kept shifting them to detention centres and interrogation centres.  It is also said that all his names were changed.  In each jail he was kept with a different name, one Urdu name and one Pakistani name. So that if any investigation takes place in any list anywhere by any international organization and they investigate on it then no one will ever know about Major Suri. And it is also said that Pakistan did the same thing with every Indian soldier at that time.

Well, apart from this, many such evidences have come forth which make it clear that our soldiers are still imprisoned in Pakistani jails.  How did this happen?  Many Indian intelligence agents, spy agents were sent to Pakistan. He was once caught in Pakistan. Later they were called back through an agreement or through some other departmental deal. Returned to India from Pakistan. All these Indian spies also gave their statements, when they gave their deep briefings, then they had talked about these missing 54, about these 54 soldiers, in the facts of 71 war, they even said there are some soldiers of the 65 war who are still imprisoned in Pakistani jails, so they had told about all of them, you should be told about some concrete claims and facts, between 1988 to 2012, there were many Indian intelligence agents who went to Pakistan, after going to Pakistan, they worked for India, after that if they were caught there, then they were sent back to India. He told all about these missing 54. He said that Indian soldiers are kept in secret detention centres inside Pakistan. Their jails are changed separately. They are kept in remote military camps.  And the names of all these agents were Roshan Lal, Rooplal, Mukhtiyar Singh, Mohan Lal Bhaskar and Gopal Das.  All these are the agents who did a lot of spying for India in Pakistan and then came back to India.  All of them told and confirmed about many such soldiers among the missing 54, along with their names, they said Major Ashok Suri, Captain Ravindra Kora, Flight Lieutenant Babul Guha, who is from the 1965 war, Babul Guha is present there since then.  Flying Officer K L Malkani, Captain Kalyan Singh Rathore, who was Major Ashok Suri, who had gone with him, and Captain Giriraj Singh, all three of them disappeared together. We told you about this on 2 December 1971.  Please forgive all these court proceedings in jail.  The court is in Lakhpat jail.  He is in Bahawalpur jail and he is lodged in Multan jail.  From 1981 to 88, as far as these people knew.  Another Indian spy who returned from Pakistan was Mukhtiar Singh.  He says that when he came back in 1988, he also told that the jails of all these 54 missing soldiers are changed frequently so that no record of them remains and during that time, their names are also changed. Mohan Lal Bhaskar is a very famous spy of India who was an intelligence agent who lived in Pakistan. Stayed there for a long time. After coming from here, he wrote a book named I Was a Spy of India.  In this book, he wrote that during the one year period from 1974 to 1975, in the Court Lakhpath Jail in Lahore, he met Second Lieutenant Paras Ram Sharma and Second Lieutenant Sudhir Mohan Sabarwal.  He had met him.  And both these Indian soldiers were kept hidden by Pakistan like prisoners of war or security prisoners from the 71 war and both of them keep waiting to go back to India.  This thing came up here.  He also said that some Pakistan Army officers who were in Attock Fort in Pakistan had found themselves held captive. Mohan Lal Bhaskar also met him here. And it is said that these Pakistani officers were Colonel Shafi and Major Ayaz Sipra.  When Mohan Lal Bhaskar met these two in Attock Fort when they were prisoners in Pakistan, he told that in 1973 these two Pakistani officers had met a very senior officer of the Indian Air Force in Attock Fort itself, who was imprisoned there. After the 1971 war, they met Wing Commander HS Gill, who was also waiting to go back. Apart from this some other Indian spies Ghulam Hussain and Iqbal Hussain also told that Flying Officer Sudhir Tyagi, who was imprisoned in Shahi Kela Lahore in 1973.  Major KJS Sandhu, you will hear this name again and again here.  Major KJS Sadhu was in Lahore for three years from 1973 to 1976.  His point was made. It is also said about Major Sadhu that he was handicapped.  He had one hand at that time. He had lost him in the war. He was imprisoned here in Pakistan on spying charges.  By making them security prisoners because if they are made Prison of War then you all know the intentions of Pakistan, they will have to be put in the list, in the exchange list and then they will come to India.  So he did not want to leave them, Pakistan kept them there hidden from the world. Major KGS Sadhu was serving his life sentence there under spying charges. Apart from this, these spies also told about India's Subedar AS Singh that evidence of his being alive was found and this was found when between 1998 and 2001, when an Indian spy returned to India after 2001, then he told about Subedar AS Singh, about the 71 war itself, apart from this, a very important thing, you all must be knowing about this, you must also know the name of this officer, Mukhtiar Singh was a spy, in 2001, when he was imprisoned in the Multan jail, in the year 2001 itself, at that time, Ravindra Kaushik the Black Tiger, you all must be knowing about India's greatest spy Ravindra Kaushik, we have also done an episode in detail on him, you can see it, search and you will find it, then Mukhtiar Singh tells that in 2001, when he was imprisoned in the Multan jail, Ravindra Kaushik was also imprisoned there, at that time, Captain Giriraj Singh, the same Captain Giriraj Singh was with him.  Who disappeared along with media person Ashok Suri on 2 December 1971.  He was caught by Pakistan.  was taken prisoner.  So Captain Giriraj Singh was also here at that time in Multan jail. He remained here, inside the Multan jail, from 1989 to 2001 and whenever I met him, he used to talk about his native place in India from where he came.  He used to tell stories to his children as much as he remembered.  A very painful life.  Friends, if you all think about it, this is a sacrifice which is in return for which no soldier ever wants anything in return of that sacrifice, but there should have been a proper process for bringing them back. Well, he keeps telling stories of his children and stories of his place there.  But when Ravindra Kaushik ji died in 2001, he died in Pakistan jail. He was buried.  It is said that Captain Giriraj Singh also died there in 2001 and he was buried there along with Ravindra Kaushik.  So all these things come to light.  Apart from this, another spy from India, Amrik Singh, tells that in 1988, he had seen Major AK Ghosh in Court Lakhpat Jail.   I met him there.  And after coming to India, Amrik Singh also told that the mental state of Major Ghosh had become unstable due to the torture.  He has started behaving differently and strangely. You know about Major Ghosh, after the 1971 war, in 1971, Time magazine had published a photograph of the jails in Pakistan and Major Ghosh's brother in India had identified him after seeing the photograph in the Time magazine that the people whom you have declared missing in action or killed in action are alive, see their photograph, bring them back from the Pakistani jail, that was also used as a proof, there were all these stories but many such proofs have also been found, a very different proof comes before you here that there was a Bangladeshi naval officer.  After the 1971 war, he too was imprisoned in Court Lathpat Jail. He was also locked in there.  He said that Flight Lieutenant VV Tambe of the Indian Air Force was present in that cell and he saw that VV Tambe had become very old. The condition is bad.  I am writing my name on the wall.  He was writing his name on the wall of the prison cell where he was imprisoned. In 1984, when these naval officers were released from Bangladesh, they returned to India from Pakistan. After coming back to India, he specially came back here so that VV Tambe, who was locked up there and whom he had seen in this condition, could contact his family members.  After coming here the Bangladesh Naval Officer directly reaches the house of V Tambe.  After finding out the address and many things, they meet VV Tambe's wife Dayanti Tambe ji.  Let's meet him.  He asks her, “ I have probably seen your husband there,” and tells her his identity by saying that there is a mark, a scar, on his chin, right here on his symbol. When this identity is revealed, his wife recognizes that yes, he is my husband.  Absolutely, that means he is alive. Right now we were just wondering what happened to him.  He told that he is alive there.  After this, discussions started taking place in India at the home of Tambe who was Vivi Tambe. Discussion started about how to bring it back.   The government was informed.  But it is told that after about 5 years of this incident, in 84, this Bangladesh officer came and told him about his V copper. After 5 years in 1989, a relative of VB Tambe named Shri Jayant Ja. He went to Pakistan in 89 for a sports tournament. He went there and met the then Governor of Pakistan, General Tikka Singh after the sports tournament and during the meeting he made a request that I have come to know that my nephew Biwi Tambe is imprisoned in your jail here.  Let them see it once.  Let me meet him once.  It is then said that the facts came to light that Tikka Singh took them to a very remote area, about 20 to 25 km away from the city from where they were present.  There was a detention center there, a military detention center.  There he was shown the Viveni copper vessel from a distance. He saw that the entire appearance had changed.  The hair has grown very long.  The beard has grown too much.  The Bengali was doing something with the newspaper, wearing kurta pajama.   Was reading the newspaper.  But as soon as Jayant Jha approached his nephew to talk, he was stopped by Tikka Khan and told that no, you cannot talk to him, you are not allowed to do so at all.  So, these are all the things, friends, and what comes to light is the reality of how our missing 54 were kept there and till date, probably many of them are alive and are locked up there.  Pakistan's leaders themselves have also accepted this.  You see, Pakistan's double game which has always been going on, now there is no doubt about it.  The whole world knows.  This is evidenced by the misdeeds committed by General Zia-ul-Haq under Operation Fair Play in 1977.  The military did something and removed the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from his position. Bhutto was then imprisoned in the Cor Lakhpat Jail in Lahore.  It was put there.  When Bhutto lived here, he used to hear the screams of many prisoners at night.  At first, Bhutto thought that this was being done to scare him and keep him in fear so that he could be tortured.  Such things are being done to torture inside the jail.  This is being done to make them mentally unstable.  When these screaming sounds kept coming at night for several days, Bhutto later told her lawyer that I hear such things here and if these people are doing this to torture me then there is no need for this.  And I am not going to rebel or do anything wrong. But later the jailer of Court Lakhpat Jail met Bhutto.  He told that actually these sounds that you hear are not made by us or we do not make any such sound here.  These are Indian soldiers of the 1971 war whose mental condition has become like this because of the torture and they have become mentally unstable at night, due to which they shout and scream at night.  This here is a book by Bhutto.  It is written in that also.  Benazir Bhutto also mentioned this later.  Well, let me tell you basically how despite all the evidence, Pakistan has been denying it and how it has even violated the Geneva Convention. In the case of Missing 54, basically Pakistan kept Indian soldiers as security prisoners.  He was not made a Prisoner of War so that his name would not appear in the exchange list.  The rules of the Geneva Convention should not apply to them.  For this reason he was kept as a security prisoner. After this, the useless ISI, the intelligence agency of Pakistan, through its field investigation officers (Field Intelligence Officers) which are called FIUs, brutally tortured all these missing 50 forces.  After this they were shifted to different jails.  And these jail detention centres are called interrogation centres. in Sialkot, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Attock, Mardan, Bahawalpur, Sukhu, Sahwal and Kohat and in Kota.  All these places are different where they keep shifting at different times.  Why was this done so that there is no mention of them anywhere in the records. Well, in the records it is also mentioned that among the missing 54, there were many such soldiers who were forcibly made to accept Islam.  His name was changed.  In 1979, when the International Red Cross Organization left Pakistan. After this, all these prisoners, those Indian soldiers, were put in civil detention centers and civil jails. Earlier they were kept hidden in different places. Their identities were continuously concealed.  In the jail diaries, their names were written in Urdu with different changes.  The name used to change from one jail to another. All these things were done.  The name was twisted.  And even in 1983 and 2007, when the next of kin of NO, the close family members of these officers, when they went to visit the jail in Pakistan, they got the opportunity to visit in 1983 and 2007, at that time only civilian jails were shown.  These were the Security Military Procreation Security Military Detention Centers in which these people were kept.  These people were not taken there to show their families that your people are here, due to which their information was completely hidden and those who went from here to India to find their people, to find their soldiers, they were never able to find them.  A huge Oman connection comes to the fore here.  You see what kind of connection Pakistan has with Oman in which our Indian soldiers were sent to Oman as laborers and a strong evidence of this came to light around 2012.  It is said that in 2012, an Indian carpenter named Sukhdev had gone to Oman. Between 2008 and 2012, there is a military base on Masirah Island in Oman. He went there for some work. He was a carpenter and had to work in the kitchen. Sukhdev says that suddenly a Sardar came and stood next to him. A Sardar ji came and started telling about himself that in Punjab, India, he told that his village is in Pamor, in Fatehgarh Sahib district, India. He said that he was a Sepoy Jaspal Singh of the Punjab Regiment. He was captured from there on 4 December 1971 during the Hussainwala attack in the 1971 war. Pakistan had kept him hidden here since then. Later, Jaspal Singh, who was a Sepoy of the 15 Punjab Regiment, was a soldier of India and a brave son. He was kept in Pakistan as a Prisoner of War and a Security Prisoner.  He even told me that I have been sent to Oman as a labourer and Major KGS Sandhu has also been sent along with me.  Major SPS Baraich has also been sent.  So we were sent here to Oman in 78.  And you see, this is between 2008 and 2012. Since 1978, many of our soldiers were sent to Oman by Pakistan as labourers. When these things came to light, this carpenter Sukhdev ji came to India and informed the government. Specially went to Jaspal Singh ji's house in Pamor Fateh Fatehgarh Sahib District.  After going there, I met his family members and when they told me about this conversation, I gave the affidavit also.  When the Indian authorities talked to the Oman government on this issue, they denied it and said that we do not have any such deal with Pakistan or that your soldiers have not come here to us as laborers. But this was a complete violation of the Geneva Convention on the part of Pakistan and you would call this an international blunder, that is, this thing that was happening.  Well, at one point in 1988, it was felt that these missing 54, forward 54, could be brought back and they could come back. This happened because at that time you all would have known, you would have heard about Benazir Bhutto.  She was the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Now Zulfikar Ali Bhutto himself had also been in jail.  As we told you.  So Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had told Banji Bhutto many times about these things that he used to hear voices in the jail at night and he was a soldier of the Indian 1971 war.  So he was kept there, his mental condition is not good.  Sister Bhutto knew all these things. When she became the Prime Minister of Pakistan, at that time when she came to India, the Prime Minister of India at that time was Rajiv Gandhi. In 1989, Banerjee Bhutto met Rajiv Gandhi and assured him that we will do something about this issue.  I am absolutely the Prime Minister now.  So I will definitely do something about it. But at that time, the trust on Banerjee Bhutto also increased because of his democratic regime and second thing his humanitarian approach, India felt that Banerjee Bhutto would show it and there was hope that now our missing 54 will come back but after this, it was seen that Banerjee suddenly took a U-turn in 1991 and this U-turn was taken when the insurgency done by Pakistan in Kashmir was continuously sending militants and terrorists in 1991 when the Kashmir militancy and insurgency became violent.  Suddenly Benazir Bhutto changed her stand. From the then Prime Minister of India, P V Narasimha Rao ji. It was clearly stated by Bhutto through Benazir that there were no Indian POWs in Pakistan.  That means she is not a prisoner of war and she had retracted her earlier statement.  Well, after this the situation became worse as General Pervez Musharraf became the President of Pakistan through a coup on 12 October 1999.  Now, the personal hatred that Pervez Musharraf had for India was different.  She was exposed in front of everyone.  Because he had a military background, during the 1965 and 1971 wars, he was an SSG commando and had fought with India as a part of the Special Service Group of Pakistan.  In the 1965 and 71 war.  After the defeat in the war of 1971, we made them surrender.  Because of that, Pervez Musharraf was very irritated with India.  Later in 1999, we defeated Pakistan in the Kargil war.  So this thing about a disgruntled cat scratching the pillar, that thing was always with Pakistan and they used to vent all their anger on our missing 54.  Let us tell you about the year 2001 when Pervez Musharraf came to India and during the Agra Summit Atal Bihari Vajpayee asked him to raise the issue of Missing 54, then Pervez Musharraf, because it was a conference, a press conference, clearly denied in front of the media that we do not have any such POW, there is no Indian War Prince. Secondly, if there is anything like this then I will get a thorough investigation done.  But this was basically just a PR stunt by Musharraf.  There was one thing that they were showing here, of being a good person, because the reality was that during Musharraf's regime, when he became President, at that time the ISI not only kept these 54 missing soldiers of ours secretly hidden in different detention centers, but when their relatives went to Pakistan in 2007 to investigate and see those jails, during their jail visit they were shown only civil jails in Pakistan.  This happened during Musharraf's tenure. All the information was changed.  Names were written in Urdu.  Was converted to Islam.  All these things were done continuously at the same time during Musharraf's tenure.  Friends, today it has been 54 years.  It has been 54 years since the war of 71 and even today there is no trace of these 54 soldiers. Many among them, if they are alive, might have become old at this time.  He may have developed many diseases.  In this kind of condition. Due to mental torture his condition may have become worse.  All these things come to light.  Their identities were changed. Their names were changed.  Many were forcefully converted to religion. He got all these things right.  But even today his family is still in this hope.  There is a hope that somewhere the sons of his house will come back.  This is a sacrifice that cannot be forgotten.  And in fact it is India's duty.  It is the duty of the Indian Government even today that they should be brought back and if they cannot be brought back then at least their truth should be found out.  So that we can know about it. Today it was our effort to tell you as much information as is available till now about all these brave sons of India, about the Missing 54, and we told you this and if you have any more information related to them, if you know someone, someone's family member, that was in the Missing 54, the comment box is yours, do give information there, tell about them and what should the Indian Government do now and how should it take this forward, finding the Missing 54 or their truth, their story, so the reality should come out before the world as to how Pakistan kept the Missing 54, we left 93,000 soldiers of Pakistan who were made prisoners of war, but the entire world is aware of Pakistan's intentions.
