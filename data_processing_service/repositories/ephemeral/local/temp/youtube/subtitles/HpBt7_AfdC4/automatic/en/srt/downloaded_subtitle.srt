Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,519
and I am Varun Johri.  Hail

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
India.  You must have heard about the India-Pakistan war of 1971.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
How did India defeat Pakistan in this war?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,400
How more than 93,000 Pakistani

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279
soldiers were captured and forced to surrender.  You might have

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,039
heard this too.  You must have also

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
seen and heard about

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
what was the Shimla Agreement?

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
How these 93,000 soldiers were

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
released to Pakistan after the Shimla Agreement.  India had

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,239
left.  But have you heard

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,360
about the Forgotten 54 or the Missing 54

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,920
?  Those missing 54 who were Indian Army

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,719
soldiers.  Those 54 soldiers who are missing since the war of 1971.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,039

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
No trace of him was found.  Even after knowing about them,

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,360
why could they not be

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,320
brought back?  In a way, they remain a mystery even today.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,399
Even after 54 years, it has been 54 years since the war of 71.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,680

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
What happened to those 54 soldiers that even after 54 years

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,720
they could not be brought back to India

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,720
from Pakistan?  How he was declared missing in

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
action or killed in action

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,880
by the government.  But how,

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,920
three years after the 1971 war, a

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,320
letter arrives from Karachi and the things written in it

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,520
reveal the secret to the world

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,680
that these missing 54 are currently

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
imprisoned in different jails of Pakistan.   He

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
is still alive today.  Still alive.  Today we will

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
tell you about all those incidents and

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
what Pakistan did to them.

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,479
Why couldn't India bring them back?

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
Even after 54 years till today, all the incidents

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,200
where the Indian spies who were in Pakistan,

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,479
how they kept on meeting

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,560
these people, these 54 of our soldiers.

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,720

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
What did those spies say in their statements about their conditions after coming to India?

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
We will discuss everything today.  Apart from this,

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was imprisoned in Pakistan,

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
he used to

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,159
hear the screams of the prisoners at night. How did he come to know that

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,560
these prisoners were the same Indian soldiers of 1971, the

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
missing 54, about whom

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Pakistan has kept this thing hidden from the whole world.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Today we will also tell you

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,480
how Pakistan violated the Geneva Convention.

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
How many of these missing 54

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,200
soldiers were sent to Oman from Pakistan as laborers.

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,640
All the evidence, all the

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,239
things, all the facts are going to be known to you today in this video.  Please

bring them back even today or at least

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,280
as much information as possible should be provided about them because

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,319

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,959
Now let's start today's

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,120
episode.  So friends, the dispute

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
over Kashmir is

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
ongoing between India and Pakistan.  It has been going on till today.  The

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,319
first war between India and Pakistan

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,040
took place just after independence in 1947-48.

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,560
After that the next war took place in 1965.  But the

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,400
war that happened after this in 1971, the

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,319
war of 1971 lasted for 13 days, in this war, India had defeated Pakistan in just 13 days,

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,040
Pakistan was badly defeated here,

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
but this war of 71 was something different, it was

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
different in many ways because here

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Pakistan had been divided into two parts, we gave

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,959
birth to Bangladesh,

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
Bangladesh was created by cutting East Pakistan of Pakistan,

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,599
in this war India not only won, a

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,080
huge victory over Pakistan but also on

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,239
16 December 1971, the day this war ended, the

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,879
mere 13-day war had started on 3 December.

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,120
When this war ended on December 16,

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,120
1971,

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
more than 93,000 soldiers of the Pakistani army surrendered before the Indian Army.

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,159

98
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:10,159
After about 7 months from this time, which was the

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,840
year 1971, after 7 months, on 2 July 1972,

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,920

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,400

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,359

103
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,680
a peace treaty was signed between the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India.

104
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,919
A peace treaty was signed

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,199
called the Shimla Agreement

106
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,199
and under this these 93,000 soldiers were

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
released to Pakistan.

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,080
Basically we kept them as POWs, like prisoners of war.

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
We have released them

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,400
here.  India left them.

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,040
But during this time no one paid any

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,520
attention to those 54 Indian soldiers.  It did

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,639
not focus on those officers who went

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
missing in the 1971 war.  Who were declared missing

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
in action and after seven years, were

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,639
also declared killed in action.  No

117
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
one paid any attention to them and hence

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,440
till today they are called Missing 54 and

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,440
Forgotten 54.  Basically what happened was that when this

120
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
war ended, the Shimla Agreement was signed.

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
After all these things, when there was

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,639
no trace of these 54 Indian soldiers,

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,080
no trace of them was found anywhere.  The government had officially

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,960
declared him as MIA, i.e.

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960
Missing in Action and it is said that

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,680
after 7 years he was declared as IA, i.e. Missing in Action.

127
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,120
But the

128
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
families of these soldiers were

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,880
not ready to believe in this status change.   The

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,759
families of these soldiers were not at all

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,639
ready to believe that their

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,039
brave sons had been killed.   He has

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,039
attained martyrdom.  He thought

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,639
that perhaps they were still alive somewhere in Pakistan.  He is

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
alive and is being held

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,880
captive.  The family

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,479
appealed to the government of that time.  We

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
went to the courts,

139
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,600
went to government offices, knocked on the doors of the Human Rights Commission.

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,080
But the

141
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
family members were not getting any relief from anywhere.

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,520
Any special help that was available was

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,080
not received.  But

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,240
almost 3 years after this war of 1971, exactly 3

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,479
years after this war, in December 1974,

146
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,360
a letter comes to India from Karachi, Pakistan.  And that letter

147
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,479
finally confirmed that these

148
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,560
54 soldiers are neither missing 54

149
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,960
nor killed in action,

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,960
they are alive even today

151
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
and are imprisoned in Pakistani jails.  Now to understand

152
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,639
how it was known that he was alive and was still

153
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,639
in Pakistan,

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,560
listen to a case.  Major Ashok Suri This

155
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,120
is the case of Major Ashok Suri.  Major Ashok Suri was the

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Battalion Quarter Master of the Fifth Assam Regiment in 1971.

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,000
2 December 1971, that is, this

158
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,440
was the exact day, a day before the start of the 1971 war.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Battalion

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,919
Quarter Master Major Ashok Suri was

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,880
present in Chamb sector a day earlier.

162
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,160
Munav and

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Dara were present at the crossing of the Tawi River in the Chamb Sector and were carrying

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,599
supplies for their company and battalion which included

165
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,000
first aid supplies and ammunition.   He was

166
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
bringing all these things.  Captain Giriraj Singh was with him at that time along with some of his other

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
colleagues and some of his fellow

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,400
soldiers.

169
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,360
Captain Kalyan

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,280
Singh Rathore.  Suddenly these people saw

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
that the war had not started officially from Pakistan's side.

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,240
Suddenly there is artillery shelling on these people.

173
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Heavy artillery

174
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,240
shelling causes chaos.  The

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,400
attack happened suddenly.  The

176
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
remaining team of the Assam Fifth Regiment which was here,

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,560
arrived later.  The battalion arrives.

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Pakistan's attack is answered.

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,960
But after this attack, when things

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,319
became normal, the situation came under control.  After this, it was seen

181
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,479
that these were the soldiers who were injured or

182
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
who had attained martyrdom.  There was no

183
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,800
trace of these three soldiers.

184
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Neither was Major Ashok Suri in it.  Neither

185
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Captain Kalyan Singh Rathore or Captain

186
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,759
Giriraj Singh were present there.  When all these

187
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,400
things came to light, a list of dead and bound soldiers, that is,

188
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,199
injured and dead soldiers, was made.

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,919
He was evacuated.  The names of these three

190
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,120
soldiers were not there in this list among all these people.

191
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,440
After this, the army

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
declared him dead and it is said that when

193
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,039
Major Suri's father, Dr. R.S.

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,919
Suri got the news that his

195
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,000
son had attained martyrdom in this war,

196
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
he could not believe it

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,319
because the army had said that

198
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,960
Major Suri had attained martyrdom in the shelling and

199
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
his last rites were performed on the spot.

200
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,200
His body was not

201
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,039
sent home.  So Major

202
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Suri's father, Arya Suri, was not ready to believe

203
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,680
that something like this could have happened.  He suspected that

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
somewhere, his son was alive.  He

205
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,839
is still alive today.  For this

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
he started making many efforts.

207
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,760
He went to all the military hospitals.

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Cut the records there.  Apart from this, 310

209
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
field hospitals reached the Joriyan sector in

210
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Jammu and Kashmir.

211
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
He saw the records there.  No

212
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
record was found there either.  When no record of Major Suri was

213
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
found.  Not

214
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
in the dead, not in the bound, not in the wounded, not

215
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
even in the dead.  After this, his suspicion

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,320
grew further.  Basically it is a standard

217
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
practice that in war the autopsy

218
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
and death certificate is issued by the service

219
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
officers who are service doctors.

220
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,440
But here no such

221
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
certificate was found by

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
R.S. Suri. Major Suri's father's

223
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,640
suspicion was continuously increasing and in

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,959
fact there were many such things in which he received

225
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,440
four telegrams from time to time after some time of the

226
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,600
war of 71 informing him

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
that his son had died here,

228
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,360
which was received by the wife.  Suddenly four

229
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,640
separate telegrams

230
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,279
arrive at his house.  The date on it was written incorrectly.  The

231
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,200
date of death that was mentioned was

232
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,760
written wrongly.  So his suspicion kept increasing.

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,120
Dr. Suri continued searching for his son.  At

234
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,519
this time, whatever were the other belongings of Major Suri, whatever were

235
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,160
his belongings, when the belongings of every

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,240
discharged soldier, our brave son,

237
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
come back home, it is checked to see

238
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,519
what all of his belongings were

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
present there in the battalion.  So when this stuff of

240
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,640
Major Suri's Ashok Suri came to his house, the

241
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,120
first thing that

242
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
his father noticed was a helmet.  He noticed that the

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,399
helmet was not the size of his son's head.

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,120
This is different.  The second thing,

245
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,000
her engagement ring was also

246
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
missing from there.  The engagement ring was also not present.  That

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,800
means, if you have performed the last rites there

248
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,480
on the spot, the ring and other items would have been taken

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,079
out and kept in his belongings,

250
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,720
but they were also not present there in that box.

251
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,800
Because of this the suspicion

252
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
grew even more and his suspicion became

253
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
confirmed that his son is

254
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,880
still alive and may be

255
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
in Pakistan.  He continued his efforts and

256
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
continued his search, but

257
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
about 3 years passed from here.  There were

258
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,000
around 54 such families who kept

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,800
searching for their sons for 3 years.

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,680
After 3 years, it was the day of 21st December 1974.

261
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,399
A letter reaches Doctor Suri's house.  There was

262
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
a hand written note.

263
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,519
As it was written from Pakistan,

264
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,399
it was sent from Karachi, it was dated 7

265
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,560
December 1972, which means you can see that

266
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,320
it was sent 2 years ago, it was written

267
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,800
basically on 7 December 1972 and when did it come?

268
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,959
21 December 1974. It was written on this letter

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,200
that I am quite

270
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:32,000
okay here, I am absolutely fine here. After this, in the very next

271
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,880
year, on 13th August 1975, another note,

272
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
another letter comes to Dr. R.S. Suri

273
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,760
's house in Faridabad and in that letter it was written

274
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,920
clearly that it was dated

275
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,399
14 to 16 June 1975, which means it was

276
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
written recently, within two months

277
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,519
it had come to the house in Faridabad, from Karachi,

278
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,560
from Pakistan. It was written by Major Suri, the

279
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,920
same Major Suri who was

280
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
declared missing in

281
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,600
action, killed in action 3 years ago, but

282
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,720
what was written by him that Major Suri and his

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,360
Also, 20 officers are alive in Pakistani jails.  They

284
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,800
are imprisoned there.  It is closed there.

285
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,880
After these letters were found,

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,680
they were shown to handwriting experts.

287
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,360
He was consulted whether this

288
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
writing matched with his old writing.  The

289
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,079
writing matched.

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
After the writing match was done, all these letters were shown to the Government of India

291
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,120
and then the Government of India

292
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,040
further used them as evidence that

293
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,000
this soldier is still alive. We are

294
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,839

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,959
talking about Ashok Suri and 202 soldiers here.  He is alive and

296
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,560
finally his status which was missing in action at that time was

297
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,079
 

298
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,480
changed to believed to be in

299
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,800
captivity.

300
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240

301
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
This is changed to Believe to be believed to be in captivity.

302
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
But when this thing was told to Pakistan that

303
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,519
we have such type of soldiers in your country.

304
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,000
We are recovering his letters.

305
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,880
Pakistan refused to accept it.  He was

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,800
not ready to accept it.  After approximately four years,

307
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
further investigation was conducted.

308
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Many officers from India also investigated.

309
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,279
Departments were involved in this.  The Ministry of Defence

310
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,440
also worked.  After 4 years, in 1971, a

311
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,079

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,959

313
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,079
list of 29 such Indian Army soldiers was given in the Lok Sabha and that list contained the names of those 29

314
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,320
soldiers who were currently

315
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
in Pakistan jail and who were

316
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
declared missing in action or killed in action.

317
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,000
This list was presented by

318
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,519
Samarendu Kundu of the then Ministry of External Affairs

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
and it was

320
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
mentioned in it that these soldiers of ours are

321
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
currently in Pakistani jails.  But

322
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
friends, Pakistan always

323
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,320
denied this.  He denied the presence of these soldiers.

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
When further investigation was done in the case of Major Suri,

325
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
it came to light

326
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,240
and in fact, in the reports which are there till now, it is

327
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,920
told that what was done in the case of Major Suri, by

328
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,279
Pakistan,

329
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,000
by ISI, when he went missing on 2 December 1971,

330
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
when his Assam

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
Regiment, Fifth Assam Regiment, was shelled, when he was

332
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,079

333
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,880
caught by the Pakistan Army at that time, he was

334
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,560
not considered a Prisoner of War.  He was

335
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,760
accused by Pakistan's

336
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,680
Special Service Group of doing spinning

337
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,639
here.  This was doing the spine.

338
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,600
He was held as a security prisoner.

339
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,199
Kept on security prisoner status.

340
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
Why?  Because

341
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,720
if they are kept on the status of Prisoner of War, then if

342
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,959
any exchange takes place later, their name will appear in that list.

343
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
These will have to be sent back.  For this reason,

344
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,079

345
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,079
he was kept here as a security prisoner and was transferred to different jails of Pakistan

346
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,000
every time.   They kept

347
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,320

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
shifting them to detention centres and interrogation centres.  It is also said

349
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
that all his names were

350
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,160
changed.  In each jail he was kept with a different name, one

351
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,000
Urdu name and one Pakistani name.

352
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,279
So that if any

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,199

354
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,440
investigation takes place in any list anywhere by any international

355
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,199
organization and they investigate on it

356
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
then no one will ever know about Major Suri.

357
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,800
And it is also said that

358

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
our episode.  Well, apart from this, many such

384
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,199
evidences have come forth which make it clear

385
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,959
that our soldiers are still

386
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,759
imprisoned in Pakistani jails.  How did this

387
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,839
happen?  Many Indian intelligence agents,

388
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,639
spy agents were sent to Pakistan.

389
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,839
He was once caught in Pakistan.

390
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,120
Later they were called back through an agreement or through some other

391
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,519
departmental deal.

392
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,079
Returned to India from Pakistan.

393
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,079
All these Indian spies also gave their statements,

394
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,240
when they gave their deep briefings, then

395
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,639
they had talked about these missing 54,

396
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,399
about these 54 soldiers, in the facts of 71 war,

397
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,199
they even said there are

398
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,440
some soldiers of the 65 war who are

399
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,600
still imprisoned in Pakistani jails,

400
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,800
so they had told about all of them,

401
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,639
you should be told about some concrete claims and

402
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,399
facts,

403
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,399
between 1988 to 2012, there were many

404
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,160
Indian intelligence agents

405
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,839
who went to Pakistan, after

406
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
going to Pakistan, they worked for India,

407
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,519
after that if they were caught there, then

408
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
they were sent back to India.

409
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,880
He told all about these missing 54.

410
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
He said that Indian

411
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,720
soldiers are kept in

412
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,839
secret detention centres inside Pakistan.

413
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,320
Their jails are changed separately.

414
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,800

415
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,680
They are kept in remote military camps.  And the

416
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,919

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,959
Lal, Rooplal, Mukhtiyar Singh, Mohan Lal

418
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,480
Bhaskar and Gopal Das.  All these are the agents who did

419
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,280
a lot of spying for India in Pakistan and then

420
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,839
came back to India.  All of them

421
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,000
told and confirmed

422
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,799
about many such soldiers among the missing 54, along with their names,

423
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,880
they said Major Ashok Suri, Captain

424
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:28,240
Ravindra Kora, Flight Lieutenant Babul

425
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,320

426
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,760

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,600
Officer K L Malkani, Captain Kalyan Singh

428
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,120
Rathore, who was Major Ashok Suri, who had

429
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,799
gone with him, and Captain Giriraj Singh,

430
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,440
all three of them disappeared together.

431
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,840
We told you about this on 2 December 1971.  Please

432
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,760
forgive all these court proceedings in jail.  The court

433
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,360
is in Lakhpat jail.  He is in Bahawalpur jail and he is

434
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,080
lodged in Multan jail.  From 1981 to 88,

435
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,160
as far as these people knew.  Another

436
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
Indian spy who returned from Pakistan was

437
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,280
Mukhtiar Singh.  He says that

438
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,760
when he came back in 1988, he also

439
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,240
told that the

440
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
jails of all these 54 missing soldiers are

441
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
changed frequently

442
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,480
so that no record of them remains and

443
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,760
during that time, their names are also changed.

444
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,919
Mohan Lal Bhaskar is a

445
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,640

446
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,559
intelligence agent who lived in Pakistan.

Stayed there for a long time.

448
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,320
After coming from here, he wrote a book

449
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
named I Was a Spy of

450
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,480
India.  In this book, he wrote that

451
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,679

455
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,559
met Second Lieutenant Paras Ram Sharma and Second Lieutenant Sudhir Mohan Sabarwal.  He had met him.  And

456
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,720
both these Indian soldiers were kept hidden by Pakistan

457
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,640
like prisoners of war or security prisoners from the 71 war

458
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,760

459
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,160
and both of them

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,520
keep waiting to go back to India.  This thing

461
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
came up here.  He also said

462
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,840
that some Pakistan

463
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,760
Army officers who were in Attock Fort in

464
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,919
Pakistan had found themselves held captive.

465
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,440
Mohan Lal Bhaskar also met him here.

466
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
And it is said

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
that these Pakistani officers were Colonel Shafi and

468
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Major Ayaz Sipra.  When Mohan

469
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,880
Lal Bhaskar met these two in Attock Fort

470
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,600
when they were prisoners in Pakistan,

471
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,080
he told that in 1973 these two

472
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Pakistani officers had met

473
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
a very senior officer of the Indian Air Force in Attock Fort itself,

474
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,360
who was

475
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,520
imprisoned there. After the 1971 war, they

476
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,919

477
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,160
met Wing Commander HS Gill, who was also

478
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,000
waiting to go back. Apart from this

479
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,320
some other Indian spies Ghulam Hussain and

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,840
Iqbal Hussain also told that

481
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,960
Flying Officer Sudhir Tyagi, who was

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,600
imprisoned in Shahi Kela Lahore in 1973.  Major

483
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,520
KJS Sandhu, you will hear this name again and again

484
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,200
here.  Major KJS Sadhu was in

485
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,679

486
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,679
Lahore for three years from 1973 to 1976.  His point was made.

487
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,080
It is also said about Major Sadhu that he was

488
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,280
handicapped.  He had one hand at that time.

489
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,200
He had lost him in the war.

490
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,799

491
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
He was imprisoned here in Pakistan on spying charges.  By

492
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,720
making them security prisoners because if they are made Prison of War then

493
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,120
you all know the intentions of Pakistan, they will have to be

494
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
put in the list,

495
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
in the exchange list and then they will come to India.  So he did

496
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,640
not want to leave them, Pakistan kept them there hidden from the world.

497
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,120

498
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Major KGS Sadhu was

499
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,360
serving his life sentence there under spying charges.

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,039
Apart from this, these spies also told about India's Subedar AS

501
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,320
Singh that

502
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,280
evidence of his being alive was found and this was found when

503
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,520
between 1998 and 2001, when an Indian spy

504
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,280
returned to India after 2001,

505
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,919
then he

506
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,039
told about Subedar AS Singh, about the 71 war itself,

507
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,840
apart from this, a very important thing,

you all must be knowing about this, you must

509
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,000
also know the name of this officer, Mukhtiar

510
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,400
Singh was a spy, in 2001, when he was

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,039
imprisoned in the Multan jail, in the year 2001 itself, at

512
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,240

you all must be knowing about India's greatest spy Ravindra Kaushik,

515
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
we have also done an episode in detail on

516
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,880
him, you can see it, search and

517
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
you will find it, then Mukhtiar Singh

518
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
tells that in 2001, when he was

519
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,360
imprisoned in the Multan jail, Ravindra Kaushik

520
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,760
was also imprisoned there, at that time, Captain

521
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,240
Giriraj Singh, the same Captain Giriraj Singh was with him.  Who

522
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,240

523
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,880
disappeared along with media person Ashok Suri on 2 December 1971.  He was

524
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,520
caught by Pakistan.  was taken prisoner.  So

525
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,520
Captain Giriraj Singh was also here at that time

526
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,120
in Multan jail.

527
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,320
He remained here, inside the Multan jail, from 1989 to 2001

528
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,080
and whenever I met him, he used to

529
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760

530
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
talk about his native place in India from where he came.  He used to

531
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,240
tell stories to his children

532
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,280
as much as he remembered.  A very painful

533
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,200
life.  Friends, if you all think about it,

534
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,360
this is a sacrifice which is in

535
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
return for which no soldier ever wants anything in return of that sacrifice,

536
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,559

537
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:11,360
but there should have been a proper process for bringing them back.

538
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,600
Well, he

539
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,440

540
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,039
keeps telling stories of his children and stories of his place there.  But

541
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,679
when Ravindra Kaushik ji died in 2001,

542
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,880
he died in Pakistan jail.

543
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,240
He was buried.  It is said

544
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,400
that

545
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Captain Giriraj Singh also died there in 2001

546
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
and

547
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
he was buried there along with Ravindra Kaushik.  So

548
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,039
all these things come to light.  Apart from this,

549
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,799
another spy from India, Amrik Singh, tells that

550
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,720
in 1988, he had seen Major AK Ghosh

551
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,280
in Court Lakhpat Jail.   I

552
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
met him there.  And

553
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,200

554
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,520
after coming to India, Amrik Singh also told that the mental state of Major Ghosh had

555
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,320

556
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,480
become unstable due to the torture.  He has

557
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,120
started behaving differently and strangely.

558
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,360

559
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,120
You know about Major Ghosh, after the 1971 war, in 1971, Time

560
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,120
magazine had published a photograph

561
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,600
of the jails in Pakistan and

562
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,600
Major Ghosh's brother in India had identified him after

563
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,640
seeing the photograph in the Time magazine that the people whom

564
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,559
you have declared missing in action or killed in

565
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
action are alive,

566
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,400
see their photograph,

567
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,559
bring them back from the Pakistani jail, that was also

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,360
used as a proof, there were all these

569
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,240
stories but many such proofs have also been

570
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,480
found, a very different proof

571
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,080
comes before you here that there was a Bangladeshi naval

572
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,559
officer.  After the 1971 war, he

573
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,720
too was imprisoned in Court Lathpat Jail.

574
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,600
He was also locked in there.  He said

575
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,880
that

576
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,200
Flight Lieutenant VV Tambe of the Indian Air Force was

577
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,559
present in that cell and he saw that

578
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,440
VV Tambe had become very old.

579
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,480
The condition is bad.  I am writing my name on the wall.  He was

580
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,880

581
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,320
writing his name on the wall of the prison cell where he was imprisoned.

582
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,520
In 1984, when these naval officers were

583
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
released from Bangladesh, they returned to India from Pakistan.

584
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,679
After coming back to India, he

585
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
specially came back here so that VV

586
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,159
Tambe, who was locked up there and whom

587
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,240
he had seen in this condition,

588
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,640
could contact his family members.  After coming here the

589
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,279
Bangladesh Naval Officer directly

590
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,200
reaches the house of V Tambe.  After finding out the address and

591
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,880
many things, they meet VV Tambe's wife

592
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,720
Dayanti Tambe ji.  Let's

593
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
meet him.  He asks her, “

594
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,559
I have probably seen your husband there,” and

595
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,559
tells her his identity by saying that there is

596
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,679
a mark, a scar, on his chin, right here on his symbol.

597
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,440
When this identity is revealed,

598
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,520
his wife recognizes that yes, he is

599
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
my husband.  Absolutely, that means he is alive.

600
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,840
Right now we were just wondering what

601
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,600
happened to him.  He told that he

602
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,440
is alive there.  After this,

603
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,360
discussions started taking place in India at the home of Tambe who was Vivi Tambe.

604
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,520
Discussion started about how to bring it back.   The

605
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,880
government was informed.  But it is

606
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
told that after about 5 years of this

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
incident, in 84, this Bangladesh

608
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:07,440
officer came and told him about his V copper.

609
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,200
After 5 years in 1989,

610
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,240
a relative of VB Tambe named Shri

611
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,960
Jayant Ja.

612
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,440
He went to Pakistan in 89 for a sports tournament.

613
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,200
He went there and met the then

614
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,120
Governor of Pakistan,

615
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
General Tikka Singh after the sports tournament

616
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,200
and during the meeting he made a

617
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,799
request that I have come to know that

618
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,559
my nephew Biwi Tambe is

619
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,080
imprisoned in your jail here.  Let them see it once.  Let me

620
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,559
meet him once.  It is

621
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,679
then said that the facts came to light

622
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,840
that Tikka Singh took them

623
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,880
to a very remote area,

624
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,120
about 20 to 25 km

625
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,919
away from the city from where they were present.  There was a detention

626
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,320
center there, a military detention center.  There

627
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,080
he was shown the Viveni copper vessel from a distance.

628
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
He saw that the entire appearance had changed.  The

629
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,440
hair has grown very long.  The beard has

630
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,080
grown too much.  The Bengali was

631
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,880
doing something with the newspaper, wearing kurta pajama.   Was

632
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,039
reading the newspaper.  But as soon as

633
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,000
Jayant Jha approached his nephew to talk,

634
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,159
he was stopped by Tikka Khan and told

635
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
that no, you cannot talk to him,

636
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,240
you are not allowed to do so at all.  So, these are

637
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
all the things, friends, and what comes to light is the

638
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,200
reality of how

639
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,360
our missing 54 were kept there and

640
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,600
till date, probably many of them

641
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,760
are alive and are locked up there.  Pakistan's leaders

642
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,919
themselves have also accepted this.  You see, Pakistan's

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,400
double game which has always been going on, now there is no

644
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,559
doubt about it.  The whole world knows.  This is evidenced by the misdeeds

645
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,960

646
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:42,559

647
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,799
committed by General Zia-ul-Haq under Operation Fair Play in 1977.  The military did something and

648
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,799

649
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,360
removed the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from his position.

650
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,520
Bhutto was then imprisoned in the Cor Lakhpat Jail

651
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,159
in Lahore.  It was

652
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,039
put there.  When Bhutto lived here,

653
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,360
he used to hear the screams of many prisoners at night.  At

654
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,520

655
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,559
first, Bhutto thought that this was being done to

656
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320

657
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,320
scare him and keep him in fear so that he could be tortured.  Such

658
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,440

659
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,679
things are being done to torture inside the jail.  This is being done

660
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
to make them mentally unstable.  When

661
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,320
these screaming sounds kept coming at night for several days,

662
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Bhutto later

663
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,400
told her lawyer that I

664
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,840
hear such things here and

665
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,919
if these people are doing this to torture me then there is

666
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,720
no need for this.  And

667
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,440
I am not going to rebel or do anything wrong.

668
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,200
But later the

669
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,679
jailer of Court Lakhpat Jail

670
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
met Bhutto.  He told that

671
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,679
actually these sounds that you hear are

672
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,320
not made by us or

673
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,960
we do not make any such sound here.  These are

674
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Indian soldiers of the 1971 war whose

675
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,640
mental condition has become

676
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,480
like this because of the torture and they have become mentally unstable at night, due to which

677
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200

678
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,159
they shout and scream at night.  This

679
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,000
here is a book by Bhutto.  It

680
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,919
is written in that also.  Benazir Bhutto also

681
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,520
mentioned this later.  Well, let me

682
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,919
tell you basically how despite all the evidence,

683
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,399
Pakistan has been denying it and how

684
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,520
it has even violated the Geneva Convention.

685
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,679
In the

686
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,279
case of Missing 54, basically

687
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,520
Pakistan kept Indian soldiers as

688
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,960
security prisoners.  He was

689
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
not made a Prisoner of War so that

690
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,200
his name would not appear in the exchange list.  The rules of the Geneva Convention should

691
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,039
not apply to them.  For this reason

692
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,279
he was kept as a security prisoner.

693
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,440
After this, the useless ISI, the intelligence agency of Pakistan,

694
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,559

695
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,840
through its field investigation officers (Field

696
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,240
Intelligence Officers) which are called FIUs,

697
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,880
brutally tortured all these

698
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,640
missing 50 forces.  After this they were

699
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
shifted to different jails.  And these

700
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,880
jail detention centres are called interrogation centres.

701
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,320
in Sialkot, Lahore, Multan,

702
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,919
Peshawar, Attock, Mardan, Bahawalpur, Sukhu,

703
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,640
Sahwal and Kohat and in Kota.  All these

704
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,039
places are different where they keep shifting at different

705
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,440
times.  Why was this done so that there is

706
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,799
no mention of them anywhere in the records.

707
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
Well, in the records it is

708
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,039
also mentioned that

709
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,919
among the missing 54, there were many such soldiers who were

710
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,440
forcibly made to accept Islam.  His

711
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,279
name was changed.  In 1979, when the International

712
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,320
Red Cross Organization left Pakistan.

713
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,440
After this, all these

714
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,279
prisoners, those Indian soldiers, were

715
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,120
put in civil detention centers and civil jails.

716
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,679
Earlier they were kept hidden in different places.

717
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Their identities were continuously

718
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,919
concealed.  In the jail diaries, their names were

719
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,600
written in Urdu with different changes.  The

720
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
name used to change from one jail to another.

721
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,000
All these things were done.  The name was

722
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,159
twisted.  And even in 1983

723
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,399
and 2007, when the next of kin of NO, the

724
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,200

725
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,880
close family members of these officers, when they

726
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
went to visit the jail in Pakistan, they got the opportunity to

727
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
visit in 1983 and 2007, at that time

728
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,919
only civilian jails were shown.  These were the

729
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
Security Military Procreation Security

730
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,000
Military Detention Centers in which these

731
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
people were kept.  These

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,320
people were not taken there to

733
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,919
show their families that your people

734
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,000
are here, due to which their

735
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,760
information was completely hidden and those who

736
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,440
went from here to India to find their people, to

737
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,480
find their soldiers, they were

738
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
never able to find them.  A huge

739
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,000
Oman connection comes to the fore here.  You

740
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
see what kind of connection Pakistan has with Oman

741
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,320
in which our Indian

742
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,480
soldiers were sent to Oman as laborers

743
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,000
and a strong evidence of this came to light

744
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,039
around 2012.  It is said that

745
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,840
in 2012, an Indian carpenter named Sukhdev had gone to

746
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,520
Oman. Between 2008 and 2012, there is a

747
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,919
military base on Masirah Island in Oman. He went there for some

748
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,840
work. He was a

749
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,360
carpenter and had to

750
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,240
work in the kitchen.

751
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,480
Sukhdev

752
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,000
says that suddenly

753
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,039
a Sardar came and stood next to him. A Sardar

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,200
ji came and started telling about himself that in

755
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,520
Punjab,

756
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,159
India, he told that

757
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,320
his village is in Pamor, in Fatehgarh

758
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,919
Sahib district, India. He

759
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:20,559
said that he was a Sepoy Jaspal Singh of the

760
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:25,279
Punjab Regiment. He was captured from there on

761
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,880
4 December 1971 during the Hussainwala attack in the 1971 war.

762
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559

763
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,480
Pakistan had kept him hidden here since then.

764
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,960
Later,

765
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,240
Jaspal Singh, who was a Sepoy of the 15 Punjab Regiment, was a

766
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,399
soldier of India and a brave son.

767
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,559
He was kept in Pakistan as a Prisoner of War and a

768
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,360
Security Prisoner.  He

769
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,679
even told me that I have been sent to Oman

770
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,080
as a labourer and Major

771
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,600
KGS Sandhu has also been sent along with me.  Major

772
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,159
SPS Baraich has also been sent.  So we were

773
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,640
sent here to Oman in 78.  And

774
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,240
you see, this is between 2008 and 2012.

775
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,559
Since 1978, many of our soldiers were

776
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,840
sent to Oman by Pakistan as labourers.

777
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,200
When these things came to light, this carpenter

778
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,159
Sukhdev ji came to India and informed the government.

779
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,960
Specially went to Jaspal Singh ji's house

780
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,880

781
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,279
in Pamor Fateh Fatehgarh Sahib District.  After going there, I met his family members

782
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,919
and when they told me about this conversation, I gave the

783
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,679
affidavit also.  When the

784
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,880
Indian authorities

785
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
talked to the Oman government on this issue, they

786
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
denied it and said that we do

787
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,799
not have any such deal with Pakistan or that

788
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,640
your soldiers have not come here to us as laborers.

789
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,960
But

790
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,640
this was a complete violation of the Geneva Convention on the part of Pakistan

791
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,760
and you would call this an international blunder,

792
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,640
that is, this thing that was happening.  Well,

793
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,360
at one point in 1988, it was felt that these

794
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,799
missing 54, forward 54,

795
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,399
could be brought back and they could come back.

796
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,080
This happened because at that time you all would have

797
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,559
known,

798
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,519
you would have heard about Benazir Bhutto.  She was the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

799
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,440
Now Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

800
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,840
himself had also been in jail.  As we

801
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,240
told you.  So Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had

802
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,240
told Banji Bhutto many times

803
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,440
about these things that he used to hear voices in the jail

804
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,320
at night and he was a

805
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,399
soldier of the Indian 1971 war.  So he was kept there,

806
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,880
his mental condition is

807
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,360
not good.  Sister Bhutto knew all these things.

808
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,600
When she became the Prime Minister

809
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
of Pakistan, at that time

810
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,000
when she came to India, the Prime

811
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,480
Minister of India at that time was Rajiv Gandhi.

812
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,279
In 1989, Banerjee Bhutto met Rajiv Gandhi and

813
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
assured him that

814
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,399
we will do something about this issue.  I

815
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,480
am absolutely the Prime Minister now.  So I will

816
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,200
definitely do something about it.

817
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,640
But at that time, the trust on Banerjee Bhutto also

818
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,120
increased because of his

819
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,760
democratic regime and second thing his

820
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,559
humanitarian approach, India felt that

821
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,440
Banerjee Bhutto would show it and there was hope that now

822
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,000
our missing 54 will come back

823
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,279
but after this, it was

824
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,200
seen that Banerjee suddenly took a U-turn in 1991 and

825
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,320
this U-turn was taken when the

826
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,799
insurgency done by Pakistan in Kashmir was

827
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,159
continuously sending militants and terrorists

828
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,639
in 1991 when the Kashmir militancy and insurgency

829
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,119
became violent.  Suddenly Benazir Bhutto

830
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,440
changed her stand.

831
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,960
From the then Prime Minister of India, P V Narasimha Rao ji.

832
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,280
It was clearly stated

833
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,320
by Bhutto through Benazir that there were no

834
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,879
Indian POWs in Pakistan.  That means she

835
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,280
is not a prisoner of war and

836
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,119
she had retracted her earlier statement.  Well,

837
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,599
after this the situation became worse as

838
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,599
General Pervez Musharraf

839
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,760

840
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,800
became the President of Pakistan through a coup on 12 October 1999.  Now, the

841
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
personal hatred that Pervez Musharraf had for India was

842
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,119
different.  She was

843
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,079
exposed in front of everyone.  Because he had a

844
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,599
military background, during the 1965 and 1971

845
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,159
wars, he was an SSG commando and had

846
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,560

847
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,960
fought with India as a part of the Special Service Group of Pakistan.  In the 1965 and 71

848
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,720
war.  After the defeat in the war of 1971, we made

849
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,119
them surrender.  Because of that,

850
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,240
Pervez Musharraf was very irritated

851
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,320
with India.  Later in 1999,

852
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,520
we defeated Pakistan in the Kargil war.  So this thing about

853
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,839
a disgruntled cat scratching the pillar,

854
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,760
that thing was always

855
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,040
with Pakistan and they used to vent all their anger

856
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,800
on our missing 54.  Let us

857
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,200
tell you about the year 2001 when Pervez Musharraf

858
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,920
came to India and during the Agra Summit Atal

859
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,320
Bihari Vajpayee asked him to

860
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,839
raise the issue of Missing 54, then Pervez

861
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,839
Musharraf, because it was a conference, a

862
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,359
press conference, clearly denied in front of the media

863
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,560
that we do

864
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,760
not have any such POW, there is no Indian War Prince.

865
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,520
Secondly, if there is anything like this then

866
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,599
I will get a thorough investigation done.  But

867
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,880
this was basically just a PR stunt by

868
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,400
Musharraf.  There was one

869
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,720
thing that they were showing here, of being a good person, because the

870
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,599
reality was that during Musharraf's regime,

871
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,920
when he became President, at that time the ISI

872
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,280
not only kept these 54 missing soldiers of ours

873
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,960
secretly hidden in

874
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,400
different detention centers, but when

875
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,880
their relatives went to Pakistan in 2007 to investigate and

876
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,359
see those jails,

877
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,520
during their jail visit they were

878
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,760
shown only civil jails in Pakistan.  This

879
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,839
happened during Musharraf's tenure.

880
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,720
All the information was changed.  Names were written in Urdu.  Was

881
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,640
converted to Islam.  All these

882
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,960
things were done continuously at the same time

883
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,040
during Musharraf's tenure.  Friends, today it has been 54

884
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,160
years.  It has been 54 years since the

885
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,079
war of 71 and even today there is no trace of these 54 soldiers.

886
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Many among them,

887
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,800
if they are alive, might have

888
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,880
become old at this time.  He may have developed many

889
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,720
diseases.  In this kind of condition.

890
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,720
Due to mental torture his condition may have become

891
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,480
worse.  All these

892
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,000
things come to light.  Their identities were changed.

893
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,359
Their names were changed.  Many were

894
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,040
forcefully converted to religion.

895
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,119
He got all these things right.  But even today

896
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,880
his family is still in this hope.  There is a

897
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,640
hope that somewhere the sons of his house will

898
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,800
come back.  This is a

899
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,960
sacrifice that cannot be forgotten.  And in

900
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,760
fact it is India's duty.  It is the

901
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,240
duty of the Indian Government even today that they should be

902
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,320
brought back and if they cannot be brought back then

903
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,640
at least their truth should be found out.  So that we

904
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,040
can know about it.

905
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,599

919
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,839
