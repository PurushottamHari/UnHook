Hello Friends.  Friends, the way America has bombed Iran, you will see an atmosphere of panic not only in the Middle East but all over the world and that is why suddenly there is a lot of discussion about World War 3 here. Many articles are being written.  You can see here Welcome to World War Three Fear Erupts as US Bombs Three Iranian Nuclear Sites.  Here also you will be able to see Did Trump Start a World War.  In fact, just yesterday, many editorials in many newspapers here wrote, Make no mistake, a world war has begun.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail , there is a need to analyse what can happen from here.  Meaning, when we talk about World War Three, what does it mean and how can things escalate from here. I will tell you everything about how this can be stopped. See, what happens is that first of all when we talk about world war, world wars do not happen due to gun fire or a clash between militaries.  There is no headline anywhere in the newspaper or on television that World War Three has started.  It starts very silently.  Meaning it spreads gradually.  You will not even understand and suddenly you will come to know here that yes, almost many countries have got involved in the war. For example, if we talk about World War One , World War Two, as we say, World War One, World War Two, what was that?  That was actually a European war.  In a way it was a European war.  Then gradually many other countries got involved. Especially whenever America gets involved, things change.  And here America's allies win the world war.  Meaning, here in a way you should understand that America was powerful even at that time. Even today he is powerful and in a way, he plays a decisive role. So here you need to understand that World War does not start with just one word.  Things keep developing gradually and today you will see the same type of situation to a large extent.  In fact, as soon as Donald Trump told about the bombing, many people on social media started writing.  In fact, here you can see that it is written, Imagine dropping the world's biggest non-nuclear bomb. Because the bomb that has been dropped is the biggest non-nuclear bomb on Iran.  And here Donald Trump is saying now is the time for peace.  So that is why Donald Trump is being criticized a lot that after dropping the bomb, you are saying that now is the time for peace.  So here people believe that Trump lied.  Trump repeatedly said that we do not want war. want to grind.  So in a way they are doing just the opposite.  And this is why people say that World War 3 has begun.  So let's understand a little background here.  Why did the US ultimately bomb Iran?  The first thing you all know about JCBUA is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was a deal done with Iran during Obama's time. It was simply that the sanctions on Iran would be lifted and Iran would not enrich uranium beyond a particular level.  But when Donald Trump got elected in 2018, he broke this deal.  And if you see from then onwards, sanctions were imposed on Iran.  Iran has also started its uranium enrichment on a large scale.  And that is why the bells slowly started ringing all over the world. And if you look here, there is contempt Iran's repeated claim. Iran was repeatedly saying that our entire nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. But the reports coming from intelligence were saying that the missile program was being fully developed. Iran is making full preparations here underground to make nuclear weapons. And if you look at the immediate trigger of the way the strike was carried out, the US allegation is that Iran had almost made nuclear weapons and the enrichment was getting close to 90% purity. So the fear was that Iran could conduct an underground nuclear test at any time.  And that is why even before this the US did a bombing.  And you all know about bombing, this morning only I made a video in which you can see the three most important sites are Iftihan, Nathansh and Fardo and the most important of them is Fado, Fado if you see, it has been built right below the hill, very deep below the mountain and it cannot be destroyed by any normal weapon and that is why Israel needed America's help because America has the B-2 bomber and what this B-2 bomber does is it can carry and drop the bomb, the most powerful non-nuclear weapon GBU 57. Now this GBU 57, as soon as it is dropped, it does not blast directly.  It is released from a height of 12 km. With the attitude of gravity it gains very high speed.  And when it visits a site.  There is no blast there and it penetrates very deep. And there it blasts off. Because of which you can say that no matter how low one makes the side.  And this bomb breaks it easily. In this, it is precisely guided through GPS as to where to penetrate exactly. And this is exactly what Donald Trump did here, and especially he tried to do this at the Fado plant. Well now the question here is whether Donald Trump and America achieved their goal.  In the short term you can say that yes, this is a huge blow to Iran's entire nuclear program. Iran goes back many years.  But the question is, will everything be fine in the long term ?  It doesn't seem so, as instability would increase considerably. Now in the long term, Iran may have only one goal: to make nuclear weapons as soon as possible. But yes, Trump says that we will not let this happen.  But as soon as you see the bombing that was done by Don Trump, the US bombing on Iran, the response from Iran came in a clear cut saying that it is a declaration of war because the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khawaini had clearly said that if the US gets involved in this, we will hit the US and you can see that the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Al Qaeda forces have been put on high alert here, they have been mobilized, the missile units, UAV squadrons, all of them have been highlighted at this time. Iran has hinted that it may close the Strait of Hormuz. Due to which 20% of global oil shipment may stop.  So this is a possibility at this time.  This is the US position. Don Trump says that look, he has worked for global peace.  Iran would have made the bomb very soon.  We had to stop him. So in a way the Pentagon is saying we are defensive, not hostile.  We have targeted the facilities.  No civilians have been targeted.  But the question now is that how can this event that happened today, the bombing in Iran early in the morning, escalate into World War 3 ?  The first thing is how Iran will respond.  How will Iran retaliate?  Because Iran drew the line here.  The red line was drawn and the US has crossed that red line and it remains to be seen here whether Iran will strike the US with a ballistic missile. Now the US cannot directly strike the US because Iran does not have missiles of that range, so what can Iran do, US has bases in many places in Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, it can strike there.  In addition to this, through Hezbollah and various other proxies here, a continuous barrage of missiles can be launched.   Apart from this, the state of hormones can be blocked and terror attacks can be carried out through proxy sleeper cells globally.  This means that you may witness bombings at many places on the global level. So if Iran's response is like this and it attacks the US and the Gulf countries, then the war will expand from here.  Then if we assume that Israel enters more quickly because the war between Israel and Iran is already going on but suppose now Iran, because the news is coming, I was just making this video that Iran has again started retaliating against Israel, so we will have to see what kind of retaliation it is and how does Israel respond, so it is possible that Israel also enters this war in a full-fledged manner, though it has almost entered, but Israel attacks Iran in a more aggressive manner, meaning if attacks on civilians are started now, then this war will escalate more rapidly. Now see how things will escalate from here. Proxy wars turn into regional wars.  From here things lead to regional wars like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi in Yemen, the PMF group, and Syria-based militants in Iraq.  So these are all your Iran proxies.  So all of them can now join the entire war because they had not joined till now.  And many people were wondering how did this happen?  Earlier, whenever there was an attack on Iran, they all would come together and take revenge. But here you can see that these people can attack US embassies, tankers, bases and many places.  This means that multiple war fronts can open in West Asia.  Now how will things get further involved from here? From here, if we assume that if the war expands in this way in Russia and China, that is in West Asia, in the Middle East, then definitely the involvement of Russia and China can be seen because they are strategic partners of Iran.  In fact, let me tell you that the news came just yesterday.  Putin was asked how much danger of a world war he felt he faced. So he said, yes, it is quite disturbing the way the conflict is going on between Israel and Iran at present. Putin told this clearly to the media yesterday and today see what has happened. So here, if the US escalates further and Iran escalates the matter, then Russia can send its air defense system. Can deploy military advisors. China can also provide its logistical cyber support to Iran.  We will have to see, in a way it will be something like the Axis and alliance structure in World War 2, in the same way, US, Iran, Israel on one side, Iran, Russia, China alliance on the other side.  You may see some such things at this time.  Next how this war can convert into a full-fledged world war, you see what the NATO forces are, because in the NATO article there is Article 5 in the NATO Act under which if there is any kind of attack on the US, then it means that the rest of the NATO members will also have to be protected, they will also get involved, so for countries like France, UK, Germany, it is also possible that they deploy their naval assets in the Persian Gulf.   In fact, the news came just a few days ago. I had also made a video that the UK has started sending its war planes and assets to the Middle East.  This news had already come.  It means that in a way, war can start from here, if the matter reaches this point and UK, France and Germany get involved, then in a way the war front can move towards the Mediterranean, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. You may get to see this thing. But the question is whether this can also be stopped.  It can definitely be stopped. And the most important thing is back channel diplomacy for countries like India, Oman, Switzerland, Turkey, they can perhaps do the work of mediation here.  The cease fire here can be implemented for cooling off period.  Now Trump likes ceasefire a lot, you can see this these days.  So here, an effort can be made to have a cooling off period so that the escalation does not happen suddenly.   We could get some time here so that everyone's mind could cool down a bit because right now a lot of things are heated up and there could also be global pressure from all the parties.  Now look at something through the UN, I do n't know how much UNB will help.  Emergency action can be taken by the UNSC.  Now we have to see things, I mean look diplomacy, back channel diplomacy can be very useful here in stopping World War 3.  As far as many people are concerned, what could be India's stance ?  Where will India stand?  Look, it is simple.  There is no doubt that India will ask for restraint.  That means our official statement will be something like this. We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid further escalation and return to dialogue in the interest of regional and global peace.  Look, India has traditionally opposed whenever unilateral military action has been taken. Civilian nuclear infrastructure has been attacked.  But here the matter is a little different.  So this is where the US is involved.  Israel is involved.  We are strategic partners with them.  So in a way we have not directly criticized him yet. Israel has not been criticized.  Here we will not directly take anyone's side. But yes, we will not take sides openly but will maintain non-alignment strategic autonomy.  We will do multilateral diplomacy inside the UN and can play the role of neutral mediator and India will do this because what is the requirement for us? We import the first energy security of 8590% oil. If the Strait of Hermos gets closed then it will become difficult for us. Imagine crude oil goes to $200 a barrel. Because any possibility can happen given the situation that is going on.  We will do emergency energy deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and other countries and we also have Indian diaspora here.  8 million Indians live in West Asia.  So we have to take a lot of care of his safety also. So here you must have seen that Operation Sindhu was launched so that people could be brought from Iran.  Indians should be brought back and what has happened now is that we had to bring them from Israel also and the first evacuation flight that was to come from Israel to India has been stopped for now.  It was rescheduled.  Now we have to see when that will be possible.  But the reason is that right now the entire airspace of Israel and Iran , everything is completely stopped. If you see, I have taken this from flight radar. You will not see flights anywhere in the entire Middle East at this time. Especially wherever there is threat of war , whether it is Lebanon, Israel, Syria , Iraq, Iran, you can see Yemen below.  So you will not see flights flying anywhere at these places. A lot can happen here.  Let's see now.  But what do you think about this?  Regarding World War Three.  Let me know in the comments section what exactly you are thinking about this? How can things get more dangerous from here ?  Before I go, a very interesting question.  Can you tell which one of the following statements is correct regarding West Asia?
