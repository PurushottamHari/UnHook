1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
Hello Friends.  Friends, the way

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,240
America has bombed Iran,

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,080

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
you will see an atmosphere of panic not only in the Middle East but all over the world

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
and that is why suddenly there is a lot of discussion about World War 3 here.

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,240

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Many articles are being written.  You

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,119
can see here Welcome to World War

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
Three Fear Erupts as US Bombs Three

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,439
Iranian Nuclear Sites.  Here also you will be

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,359
able to see Did Trump Start a World

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,840
War.  In fact, just yesterday,

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,880
many editorials in many newspapers here wrote,

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,040
Make no mistake, a world war has

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
begun.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
, there is a need to analyse

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
what can happen from here.  Meaning,

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
when we talk about World War Three,

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,520
what does it mean and how

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,200
can things escalate from here.

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
I will tell you everything about how this can be stopped.

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
See, what happens is that first of all

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
when we talk about world war,

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
world wars do not happen due to gun fire or a

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
clash between militaries.  There is no

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
headline anywhere in the newspaper or on television that

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
World War Three has started.  It

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,559
starts very silently.  Meaning

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
it spreads gradually.  You will

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,360
not even understand and suddenly you will come to know here

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
that yes, almost many

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
countries have got involved in the war.

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
For example, if we talk about World War One

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
, World War Two,

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,159
as we say, World War One,

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,479
World War Two, what was that?  That was

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
actually a European war.  In a way it

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,400
was a European war.  Then gradually

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
many other countries got involved.

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
Especially whenever America gets involved,

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
things change.  And

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,520
here America's allies

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,079
win the world war.  Meaning, here in a

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,320
way you should understand that America was powerful even at that time.

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,479
Even today he is powerful

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,479
and in a way, he plays a decisive role.

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,880
So here you

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
need to understand that World War does

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
not start with just one word.  Things

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
keep developing gradually and today

52
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
you will see the same type of situation to a large extent.  In

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
fact, as soon as Donald

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
Trump told about the bombing, many

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
people on social media

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
started writing.  In fact, here you

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
can see that it is written, Imagine dropping the

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
world's biggest non-nuclear bomb.

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,280
Because the bomb that has been dropped is the

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
biggest non-nuclear bomb on Iran.  And

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
here Donald Trump is saying now is the

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
time for peace.  So that is why Donald Trump is being

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
criticized a lot that

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
after dropping the bomb, you are saying that now is the

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
time for peace.  So here people

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,680
believe that Trump lied.  Trump

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
repeatedly said that we do not want war.

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760
want to grind.  So in a way

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
they are doing just the opposite.  And this is why

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
people say that World War 3 has

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,720
begun.  So

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,040
let's understand a little background here.  Why did the US ultimately

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
bomb Iran?  The first

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
thing you all know about JCBUA is the

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,280
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was a

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
deal done with Iran during Obama's time.

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,239
It was simply that the

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,959
sanctions on Iran would be lifted and Iran would

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,440

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
not enrich uranium beyond a particular level.  But

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,239
when Donald Trump got elected in 2018,

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
he broke this deal.  And

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,959
if you see from then onwards,

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,040
sanctions were imposed on Iran.  Iran has also

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
started its uranium enrichment

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,319
on a large scale.  And that is why the

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
bells slowly started ringing all over the world.

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
And if you look here, there is

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,560
contempt Iran's repeated claim.

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,560
Iran was repeatedly saying that our entire

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
But the reports coming from intelligence were

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
saying that the missile

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,800
program was being fully developed.

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,800

96
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,040
Iran is making full preparations here underground to make nuclear weapons.

97
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,879
And

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
if you look at the immediate trigger of the way the strike was carried out, the

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,159
US allegation is that

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,560
Iran had almost made nuclear weapons and the

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,959
enrichment was getting close to 90% purity.

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
So the fear was

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,200
that Iran could conduct an underground nuclear

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
test at any time.  And that is

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,440
why even before this the US did a

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
bombing.  And you all know about bombing,

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,799
this morning only I made a video

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,680
in which you can see the three most

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,319
important sites are Iftihan, Nathansh and

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,799
Fardo and the most important of them is Fado,

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,280
Fado if you see, it has been built right below the

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,400
hill, very deep below the mountain and

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,720
it cannot be destroyed by any normal weapon

114
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
and that is why Israel needed America's help

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,000
because America has the B-2

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,959
bomber and what this B-2 bomber does is it

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,720

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,960
can carry and drop the bomb, the most powerful non-nuclear weapon GBU 57.

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,000
Now this

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,000
GBU 57, as soon as it is dropped, it does

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
not blast directly.  It is

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,479
released from a height of 12 km.

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
With the attitude of gravity it gains

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,880
very high speed.  And when it

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
visits a site.  There is no blast there and

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,440
it penetrates very deep.

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,160
And there it blasts off.

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,360
Because of which you can say that no matter how

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
low one makes the side.  And this

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
bomb breaks it easily.

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
In this,

132
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
it is precisely guided through GPS as to

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
where to penetrate exactly.

134
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,400
And this is exactly what Donald

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,880
Trump did here, and especially he

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,039
tried to do this at the Fado plant.

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,960
Well now the question here is

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,280
whether Donald Trump and America

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,360
achieved their goal.  In the short term you can say that

140
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,360
yes, this is

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
a huge blow to Iran's entire nuclear program.

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Iran goes back many years.  But the

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
question is, will everything be fine in the long term

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,479
?  It doesn't seem so, as

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
instability would increase considerably.

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,400
Now in the long term, Iran may have only one

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,639
goal: to make nuclear weapons as soon as possible.

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
But yes, Trump says

149
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,520
that we will not let this happen.  But as soon as

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
you see the bombing that was done by Don Trump, the

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,000
US bombing

152
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,240
on Iran, the response from Iran came in a clear

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
cut saying that it is a declaration of war

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,800
because the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khawaini had

155
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
clearly said that if the US gets involved in this,

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
we will hit the US

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,680
and you can see that the IRGC, the

158
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,639
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Al Qaeda

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
forces have been put on high alert here, they have been

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,039
mobilized, the

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,880
missile units, UAV squadrons,

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,360
all of them have been highlighted at this time.

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,520
Iran has hinted that it

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,639
may close the Strait of Hormuz.

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,560
Due to which 20% of global oil shipment

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,720
may stop.  So this

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,720
is a possibility at this time.  This is the US position.

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
Don Trump says that look, he has

169
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
worked for global peace.  Iran would have

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
made the bomb very soon.  We had to stop him.

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
So in a way the Pentagon is saying

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
we are defensive, not hostile.  We have

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,479
targeted the facilities.  No

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,039
civilians have been targeted.  But the

175
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,919
question now is that how can this

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,240
event that happened today, the bombing in Iran early in the morning,

177
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,639
escalate into World War 3

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
?  The first thing is how Iran will

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,319
respond.  How

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,160
will Iran retaliate?  Because Iran

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,639
drew the line here.  The red line was

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,120
drawn and the US has crossed that red line

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,520
and it remains to be seen here

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
whether Iran will

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
strike the US with a ballistic missile.

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
Now the US cannot directly strike the US

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,800
because Iran does not have missiles of that range, so

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,599
what can Iran do,

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,759

190
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,199
US has bases in many places in Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, it can strike there.  In

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,520
addition to this,

192
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,520
through Hezbollah and various other

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
proxies here, a

194
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,599
continuous barrage of missiles can be launched.   Apart from

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,840
this, the state of

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,160
hormones can be blocked and

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,000
terror attacks can be carried out through proxy sleeper

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
cells globally.  This means that

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
you may witness bombings at many places on the global level.

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
So if

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Iran's response is like this and it

202
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,240
attacks the US and the Gulf countries, then the war will

203
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,639
expand from here.  Then if we

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,560
assume that Israel enters more quickly

205
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,560
because the war between Israel and Iran is already going on

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
but suppose now Iran, because the

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,160
news is coming, I was just making this video

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
that Iran has again

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
started retaliating against Israel,

210
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
so we will have to see what kind of

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
retaliation it is and how does Israel

212
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
respond, so it is possible that Israel also

213
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
enters this war in a full-fledged manner,

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,240
though it has almost entered, but

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,240
Israel attacks Iran in a more aggressive manner,

216
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
meaning

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
if attacks on civilians are started now, then

218
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,160
this war will escalate more rapidly.

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,080
Now see how things will escalate from here.

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,879
Proxy wars turn

221
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,199
into regional wars.  From here things lead to regional wars

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi in Yemen, the

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
PMF group, and

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,479
Syria-based militants in Iraq.  So these are all

225
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
your Iran proxies.  So all of them

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,479
can now join the entire war

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
because they had not joined till now.  And

228
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,080
many people were wondering how did this

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,800
happen?  Earlier, whenever there was an attack on Iran,

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,640
they all would come together and take revenge.

231
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,519
But here you can see that these people

232
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,839

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,640
can attack US embassies, tankers, bases and many places.  This means that

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,120
multiple war fronts can open in West Asia.  Now

235
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,760
how will things get further involved from here?

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
From here, if we assume that if the war expands in this way in Russia and China, that is in West

237
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,480
Asia, in the Middle East, then

238
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,320
definitely the

239
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
involvement of Russia and China can be seen

240
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,160
because they are strategic

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,560
partners of Iran.  In fact, let me tell you that the

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
news came just yesterday.  Putin was asked

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
how much danger of a world war he felt he faced.

244
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
So he said, yes, it is quite

245
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
disturbing the way the

246
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
conflict is going on between Israel and Iran at present.

247
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,959
Putin told this clearly to the media yesterday

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,000
and today see what has happened.

249
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,080
So here, if the US escalates further and

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Iran escalates the matter, then

251
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Russia can send its air defense system.

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Can deploy military advisors.

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,040
China can also provide its logistical cyber support

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
to Iran.  We will have to see, in a

255
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,200
way it will be something like the

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,519
Axis and alliance structure in World War 2, in the

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,000
same way, US,

258
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,320
Iran, Israel on one side, Iran, Russia, China

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,640
alliance on the other side.  You may see some such things at

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,800
this time.  Next

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,519
how this war can convert into a full-fledged world war,

262
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,000
you see what the NATO forces are,

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,080
because in the NATO article there is

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Article 5 in the NATO Act under which

265
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,800
if there is any kind of

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,959
attack on the US, then it means that the rest of the NATO members will

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,839
also have to be protected, they will also get involved, so

268
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,920
for countries like France, UK, Germany, it is

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,440
also possible that they deploy their naval assets

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
in the Persian Gulf.   In

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
fact, the news came just a few days ago.

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
I had also made a video that the UK has

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800

274
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,200

275
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,480
started sending its war planes and assets to the Middle East.  This news had already come.  It

276
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,040
means that in a way, war can start from here, if the

277
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,880
matter reaches this point and UK, France and

278
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,959
Germany get involved, then in a way the

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,360
war front can

280
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,360
move towards the Mediterranean, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean.

281
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,440
You may get to see this thing.

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,279
But the question is whether this

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
can also be stopped.  It can definitely be stopped.

284
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,519
And the most important thing is back channel

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
diplomacy for countries like India,

286
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
Oman, Switzerland, Turkey, they

287
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,079
can perhaps do the work of mediation here.  The

288
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
cease fire here can be implemented for cooling

289
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
off period.  Now Trump likes ceasefire a lot,

290
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
you can see this these days.  So here, an

291
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,399
effort can be made to have a cooling off period

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,720
so that the escalation does not happen suddenly.   We could get

293
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
some time here so that everyone's

294
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,920
mind could cool down a bit because

295
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
right now a lot of things are heated up

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,800
and there could also be global pressure from all the

297
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
parties.  Now look at something through the UN, I do

298
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,480

299
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
n't know how much UNB will help.  Emergency

300
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,399
action can be taken by the UNSC.  Now we have to see

301
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,240
things, I mean look diplomacy, back channel

302
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,720
diplomacy can be very useful here in

303
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
stopping World War 3.  As far as many

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
people are concerned, what could be India's stance

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
?  Where will India stand?  Look, it

306
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,519
is simple.  There is no doubt that India will

307
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
ask for restraint.  That means our

308
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,079
official statement will be something like this.

309
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,160
We urge all parties to exercise

310
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,320
maximum restraint and avoid further

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,560
escalation and return to dialogue in the interest

312
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
of regional and global peace.  Look, India has

313
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,320
traditionally opposed whenever

314
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
unilateral military action has been taken.

315
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Civilian nuclear infrastructure has been

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
attacked.  But here the

317
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,920
matter is a little different.  So this is where the US

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
is involved.  Israel is involved.  We

319
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
are strategic partners with them.  So in a

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,640
way we have not directly criticized him yet.

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
Israel has

322
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
not been criticized.  Here we will

323
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,519
not directly take anyone's side.

324
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,920
But yes, we will not take sides openly but will

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,920
maintain non-alignment strategic autonomy.  We will do

326
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,160
multilateral diplomacy

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,760
inside the UN and can play the role of neutral mediator

328
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,680
and India will do this

329
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,720
because what is the requirement for us?

330
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,639
We import the first energy security of 8590% oil.

331
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
If the Strait of Hermos

332
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,760
gets closed then it will become difficult for us.

333
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Imagine crude oil goes to $200 a barrel.

334
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Because any possibility can happen given the

335
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,519
situation that is going on.  We will do

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
emergency energy deals with Saudi Arabia,

337
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
UAE and other countries and

338
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
we also have Indian diaspora here.  8 million

339
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,240
Indians live in West Asia.  So

340
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
we have to take a lot of care of his safety also.

341
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,480
So here you must have seen that

342
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Operation Sindhu was launched

343
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,399
so that people could be brought from Iran.  Indians should be

344
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,959
brought back and what has happened now is that

345
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,360
we had to bring them from Israel also and the first evacuation

346
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
flight that was to come from Israel to India has been

347
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
stopped for now.  It was

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,959
rescheduled.  Now we have to see

349
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
when that will be possible.  But the reason is that right now the

350
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,839
entire airspace of Israel and Iran

351
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
, everything is completely stopped.

352
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
If you see, I have taken this from flight radar.

353
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,160

354
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
You will not see flights anywhere in the entire Middle East at this time.

355
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Especially wherever there is threat of war

356
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,880
, whether it is Lebanon, Israel, Syria

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,120
, Iraq, Iran,

358
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,959
you can see Yemen below.  So

359
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
you will not see flights flying anywhere at these places.

360
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,720
A lot can happen here.  Let's

361
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,560
see now.  But what do you think

362
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,880
