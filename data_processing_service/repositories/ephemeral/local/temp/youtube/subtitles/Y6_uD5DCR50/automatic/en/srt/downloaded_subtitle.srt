1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,319
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,440
Welcome to Study Gloss.  Son,

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,880
America's Dobe Day Plane, one

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,880
Boeing crashed here.  Ok?

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,560
787

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,000
8 and one Boeing which makes Boeing planes,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,640
you know that in the whole world there is America

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
and France, France makes Air Bus, the

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
small Indigo planes, it became

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
Indigo, it became Air India Express

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
and the big planes, Vishal, are

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
made by Boeing, they have a monopoly, a

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,879
duopoly runs between these two countries,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,800
Europe and America, so their E4B Night Watch,

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,640
this Boeing military plane was made, which was

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
given to America in 1980, now it has become very

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
advanced, currently four such planes are

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,120
in operation.  But this Doomsday thing

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,039
landed in Maryland and he went to Washington.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,680
Now see, many people got scared.  Why are you scared, we

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,719
will talk and also talk about the Iran-Israel war.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,480

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,239
Today is the last day of the YouTube SEO Plus Thumbnail course.  The

25

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
you want to grow your YouTube channel.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
So the Domesday Plane of America is highly

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,880
secretive,

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,119
this is such a plane of America that you

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,360
cannot penetrate it.  This will not be visible.  It does

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,080
not mean that it will become invisible.  But its

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,240
technology is far ahead.  Look at

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,080
what the USA has done, it

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,680
created the top university in the world.

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,439
Why was Germany so far ahead?  People often

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
ask me, Sir, Germany was destroyed in World War One.

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,320
But how did Germany rise to such heights

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
so quickly, in just 20 years, after World War II

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,960
?  It is about

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,759
Knowledge Stem Science, Technology,

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,200
Engineering, Mathematics. When Otto Bonn

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
Bismarck came, the first thing he did was to

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
build big universities.

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,399
From Albert Einstein to Tesla,

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
everyone has run away to Germany to study.

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
Because the studies done there were

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
strange and the same applied

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
knowledge of science is used to make such weapons.

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,880
Today America is doing that work.  USA has the

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
top universities in the world.

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,360

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
They invest in STEM, the biggest intellectual power in USA.  That’s why

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
they have everything.  They apply this knowledge

56
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,040
and move themselves forward.  Is it okay

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,280
?  So the thing is that this airplane and

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,520
all this that you are seeing is the result of this.   No

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
other country has such tremendous high technology.  That is

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
why America is so

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,239
far ahead and let me also tell you that a

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,040
lot of the people here are Indians.

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,440
So what is an aircraft?  Aircraft

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,519
This is a flying military command center.

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,760
Meaning, in a way, this is a military plane

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
which has been made by Boeing especially for America.

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,280
You can say the same thing that just like Boeing

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,519
makes commercial airplanes, you tell them

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
that listen make a good military plane,

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
we need these things, it will cost this much money,

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
forget the money, we will give you as much money as you need,

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,760
we want such a plane, so this

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,120
plane, they have Doomsday, which is

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,120
called E4 Boeing E4 Night Watch,

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
now they have four such planes, they have

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
made them and given them to America,

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,000
now after that there is a war going on in the Middle East,

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
you know the Iran-Israel war, today is the

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,640
seventh day, Israel has dropped a lot of bombs,

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
friends, this war is going to last long.

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,040
If America does not intervene, Israel

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,959
cannot defeat Iran on its own.  If America does

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
not jump in, this war will last longer.  Is it okay

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,200
?  And in that case there might be a civil war in Iran.  There is

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
also a possibility that a

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,239
civil war may break out in Iran because people will get tired of

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,920
dying from the bombings and will

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
fight among themselves.  America may jump in at that time too.

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,879
But looking at Donald Trump's

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,200
attitude it seems that if not today, then

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow, Don Trump will probably

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,319
attack.  Is it okay?  This

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,120
is accounting.  So what happened here in Louisiana is that

94
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,959
this command center of theirs is

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,720
used in case of nuclear conflict or a national emergency.

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
You might have seen in movies, recently Mission

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
Possible has come, in which the President is travelling.  It is the

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
safest plane.

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
Sometimes there is conflict.  Nuclear

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
conflict occurs because nothing can happen in this plane

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,440
if you are sitting in this plane.  Is it

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,080
okay?  So what happens now is that

104
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,480
it leaves for Bossier City and

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
leaves before 6:00 pm, it lands before 6:00 pm and

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,439
lands before 10:00 pm.  Now

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
this is its mysterious call sign.  Ok?

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,879
Flight tracking data shows that this

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,599
plane did not go on its scheduled route

110
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,759
but came from another coastal route.

111
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
That means he did not go via the fixed route.  It has

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,560
come from another route.  It has come back after a round,

113
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,639
passing through Virginia, North Carolina and

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
then it landed in Maryland.

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
You already know where America's military base is.  Now what's there is this

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,560
order zero one.  Its call sign was

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
Order Zero One.  And usually its

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
call sign is Order Six.  So,

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,400
everybody's eyebrows got raised and they thought,

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
brother, what has happened?  So that means there

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
might be a problem.  Everyone started saying online that

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
America might be about to launch a

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
massive attack.  Now see,

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
when Donald Trump left G7, he

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,320
ordered to keep my situation room

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,240
ready.  Where the Situation Room is

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
where the President watches the live telecast of the

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
war.  Is it okay?  So all the things are

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
told to him.  Just like Sanjaya was

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
telling Dhritarashtra, something happens accordingly.  Is it

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
okay?  So now some people are saying here

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,800
that this mission was non-routine.  That means

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,120
this mission was different and basically

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
these things are used for high urgency.

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,120
So something very big is about to happen.

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,000
Now it always remains in ready mode.  This

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,280
plane is always in readiness mode.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,199
And that's why the timing is the

140
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,360
way Doomsday was sent.  It does

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
n't fly all the time.  It keeps flying like this.

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,600
This is put into practice for the mission so that if

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,639
any problem arises then

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,039
what will you do?  But now that it is

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,600
taking this route and its call sign is different,

146
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,479
a lot of speculation is being made.   Is it

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,120
okay?  This is accounting.  Now we all

148
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,199
know that the deployment of E4B

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440

150
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
can also happen due to military alertness that the use of this plane can

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
come at any time.  who who?  Is.  Let us

152
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
learn a little about this also.  Anyway,

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,759
I have already told you.  Pentagon, you

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
know, the White House, Pentagon, is the safest

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
place in the world where the President

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,160
sits.  So this is called the Flying Pentagon.  Is it

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,800
okay?  This is such a great plane.  It

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,479
means the same like brother, there is President House,

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
so you are like a plane like the flying President

160
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,280
House, Rashtrapati Bhavan of India.

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,560
You get exactly the same facility here.  So

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,360
Airbnb is a command post and the

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,440
President can use it.  The President

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
can then use it through the Secretary of Defense and

165
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,800
senior military leaders

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,800
during crises.  Now even if this

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,039
plane is attacked with a nuclear bomb or a

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,440
missile, nothing will happen.

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
It will also withstand electromagnetic pulses.

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
It will divert and

171
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,639
can also carry out retaliatory strikes.

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,080
So this is a walking bomb and a complete

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,479
parliament.  Then there are 67 satellite

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,120
dishes and antennas to communicate with the whole world.

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,440
It can do

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
mid-air refueling while flying.

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,520
And it can stay in the air for 35 hours.

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,720
This is such a dangerous plane.  It's all

179
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,880
fun.  So it was basically deployed in 1980.  Is it

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
okay?  And now

181
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
it has received many upgrades.

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
You can see it comfortably by pausing it.

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
Ok?  What is its speciality?

184
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
Anyway, I have already told you.  So it is

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,440
obvious that the report is saying

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
that the aircraft had departed

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,000
from Oman.  Ok?  That means two Iranian

188
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
aircraft have departed for Oman.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,080
So maybe there might be

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
diplomacy also.  This means it might be possible

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,199
that avenues for diplomacy may also be open.

192
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,840
Because Iran has taken the initiative that we have to

193
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,160
talk.  But friends, Donald Trump has

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,319
just said that it is too late.

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,240
It's too late.  We will not talk now.

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
So Donald Trump simply says

197
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
either surrender or fight.  But

198
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
Donald Trump is not coming to war.

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Now there will be mid term elections for them

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,759
next year.  There will be mid-term elections in America in 20-26

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,039
in which let us assume that Donald

202
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,039
Trump will lose.  Donald Trump will be branded as the

203
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,520
world's worst,

204
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,599
useless president. This Donald Trump who

205
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,000
talks a lot about himself that brother I am the

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,840
greatest, I want the Nobel Peace Prize,

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
but he will get the label of the worst

208
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,039
president in American history. Donald

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Trump is right, because this man has gone

210
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,400
completely mad and this man

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,879
sometimes says one thing, sometimes another, now his

212
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,879
own supporters have turned against him, Tucker

213
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
Kasan is exposing him, who was

214
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,520
considered so close to Donald Trump.  The

215
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,000
Make America Great Again lobby is

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,840
holding on to Don Trump and shouting, “

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
What are you doing, my brother?”  You were saying that

218
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
you do not want to go to war and now

219
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,880
you are jumping into the war.  The thing is,

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
friends, the pressure from Israel is huge.

221
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,360
Israel alone will not be able to defeat Iran.  This

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
war is nobody's.  Brother, look, there is

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,159
so much talk about the nuclear bomb.

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,080
But what is the truth brother?  taking the help of IAEA.

225
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,640
But the IAEA has not said

226
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
that Iran will make a nuclear bomb.

227
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
This is not mentioned anywhere in his statement.

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
He has said that he has withdrawn from NPT.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,760
Enrichment is increasing.  But it has not been said

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
whether he is close to making a nuclear bomb

231
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,920
or whether he has a nuclear bomb.  This has been talked about for

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a long time.  Now Benjamin

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
Netanya just wants that

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,320
once America comes, this war will end.

235
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,880
This is the thing.  I think the

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,200
time for conversation is over now.  However, anything

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,920
can happen.  Khamenei has issued new threats

238
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
to Israel and then to America also.

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,399
Ok?  That you come and fight the war.  Let's see

240
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,440
who sees what and who has how much strength in what place.

241
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,240
So this plane that has gone is okay, right?  This

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,720
can be very important because you can

243
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
assume that things like this are

244
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
rarely seen.  Now we will see,

245
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
whatever happens, I will tell you.

246
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
I am giving updates of the Iran-Israel war.  For the

247
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,959
rest you can avail our course.
