I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  Son, America's Dobe Day Plane, one Boeing crashed here.  Ok? 8 and one Boeing which makes Boeing planes, you know that in the whole world there is America and France, France makes Air Bus, the small Indigo planes, it became Indigo, it became Air India Express and the big planes, Vishal, are made by Boeing, they have a monopoly, a duopoly runs between these two countries, Europe and America, so their E4B Night Watch, this Boeing military plane was made, which was given to America in 1980, now it has become very advanced, currently four such planes are in operation.  But this Doomsday thing landed in Maryland and he went to Washington. Now see, many people got scared.  Why are you scared, we will talk and also talk about the Iran-Israel war. Today is the last day of the YouTube SEO Plus Thumbnail course.  The link is given in the description comment box.  After that this coupon code will come on YouTube after a long time.

This will not be visible.  It does not mean that it will become invisible.  But its technology is far ahead.  Look at what the USA has done, it created the top university in the world. Why was Germany so far ahead?  People often ask me, Sir, Germany was destroyed in World War One. But how did Germany rise to such heights so quickly, in just 20 years, after World War II ?  It is about Knowledge Stem Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. When Otto Bonn Bismarck came, the first thing he did was to build big universities. From Albert Einstein to Tesla, everyone has run away to Germany to study. Because the studies done there were strange and the same applied knowledge of science is used to make such weapons. Today America is doing that work.  USA has the top universities in the world. They invest in STEM, the biggest intellectual power in USA.  That’s why they have everything.  They apply this knowledge and move themselves forward.  Is it okay ?  So the thing is that this airplane and all this that you are seeing is the result of this.   No other country has such tremendous high technology.  That is why America is so far ahead and let me also tell you that a lot of the people here are Indians. So what is an aircraft?  Aircraft This is a flying military command center. Meaning, in a way, this is a military plane which has been made by Boeing especially for America. You can say the same thing that just like Boeing makes commercial airplanes, you tell them that listen make a good military plane, we need these things, it will cost this much money, forget the money, we will give you as much money as you need, we want such a plane, so this plane, they have Doomsday, which is called E4 Boeing E4 Night Watch, now they have four such planes, they have made them and given them to America, now after that there is a war going on in the Middle East, you know the Iran-Israel war, today is the seventh day, Israel has dropped a lot of bombs, friends, this war is going to last long. If America does not intervene, Israel cannot defeat Iran on its own.  If America does not jump in, this war will last longer.  Is it okay ?  And in that case there might be a civil war in Iran.  There is also a possibility that a civil war may break out in Iran because people will get tired of dying from the bombings and will fight among themselves.  America may jump in at that time too. But looking at Donald Trump's attitude it seems that if not today, then tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow, Don Trump will probably attack.  Is it okay?  This is accounting.  So what happened here in Louisiana is that this command center of theirs is used in case of nuclear conflict or a national emergency. You might have seen in movies, recently Mission Possible has come, in which the President is travelling.  It is the safest plane. Sometimes there is conflict.  Nuclear conflict occurs because nothing can happen in this plane if you are sitting in this plane.  Is it okay?  So what happens now is that it leaves for Bossier City and leaves before 6:00 pm, it lands before 6:00 pm and lands before 10:00 pm.  Now this is its mysterious call sign.  Ok? Flight tracking data shows that this plane did not go on its scheduled route but came from another coastal route. That means he did not go via the fixed route.  It has come from another route.  It has come back after a round, passing through Virginia, North Carolina and then it landed in Maryland. You already know where America's military base is.  Now what's there is this order zero one.  Its call sign was Order Zero One.  And usually its call sign is Order Six.  So, everybody's eyebrows got raised and they thought, brother, what has happened?  So that means there might be a problem.  Everyone started saying online that America might be about to launch a massive attack.  Now see, when Donald Trump left G7, he ordered to keep my situation room ready.  Where the Situation Room is where the President watches the live telecast of the war.  Is it okay?  So all the things are told to him.  Just like Sanjaya was telling Dhritarashtra, something happens accordingly.  Is it okay?  So now some people are saying here that this mission was non-routine.  That means this mission was different and basically these things are used for high urgency. So something very big is about to happen. Now it always remains in ready mode.  This plane is always in readiness mode. And that's why the timing is the way Doomsday was sent.  It does n't fly all the time.  It keeps flying like this. This is put into practice for the mission so that if any problem arises then what will you do?  But now that it is taking this route and its call sign is different, a lot of speculation is being made.   Is it okay?  This is accounting.  Now we all know that the deployment of E4B can also happen due to military alertness that the use of this plane can come at any time.  who who?  Is.  Let us learn a little about this also.  Anyway, I have already told you.  Pentagon, you know, the White House, Pentagon, is the safest place in the world where the President sits.  So this is called the Flying Pentagon.  Is it okay?  This is such a great plane.  It means the same like brother, there is President House, so you are like a plane like the flying President House, Rashtrapati Bhavan of India. You get exactly the same facility here.  So Airbnb is a command post and the President can use it.  The President can then use it through the Secretary of Defense and senior military leaders during crises.  Now even if this plane is attacked with a nuclear bomb or a missile, nothing will happen. It will also withstand electromagnetic pulses. It will divert and can also carry out retaliatory strikes. So this is a walking bomb and a complete parliament.  Then there are 67 satellite dishes and antennas to communicate with the whole world. It can do mid-air refueling while flying. And it can stay in the air for 35 hours. This is such a dangerous plane.  It's all fun.  So it was basically deployed in 1980.  Is it okay?  And now it has received many upgrades. You can see it comfortably by pausing it. Ok?  What is its speciality? Anyway, I have already told you.  So it is obvious that the report is saying that the aircraft had departed from Oman.  Ok?  That means two Iranian aircraft have departed for Oman. So maybe there might be diplomacy also.  This means it might be possible that avenues for diplomacy may also be open. Because Iran has taken the initiative that we have to talk.  But friends, Donald Trump has just said that it is too late. It's too late.  We will not talk now. So Donald Trump simply says either surrender or fight.  But Donald Trump is not coming to war. Now there will be mid term elections for them next year.  There will be mid-term elections in America in 20-26 in which let us assume that Donald Trump will lose.  Donald Trump will be branded as the world's worst, useless president. This Donald Trump who talks a lot about himself that brother I am the greatest, I want the Nobel Peace Prize, but he will get the label of the worst president in American history. Donald Trump is right, because this man has gone completely mad and this man sometimes says one thing, sometimes another, now his own supporters have turned against him, Tucker Kasan is exposing him, who was considered so close to Donald Trump.  The Make America Great Again lobby is holding on to Don Trump and shouting, “ What are you doing, my brother?”  You were saying that you do not want to go to war and now you are jumping into the war.  The thing is, friends, the pressure from Israel is huge. Israel alone will not be able to defeat Iran.  This war is nobody's.  Brother, look, there is so much talk about the nuclear bomb. But what is the truth brother?  taking the help of IAEA. But the IAEA has not said that Iran will make a nuclear bomb. This is not mentioned anywhere in his statement. He has said that he has withdrawn from NPT. Enrichment is increasing.  But it has not been said whether he is close to making a nuclear bomb or whether he has a nuclear bomb.  This has been talked about for a long time.  Now Benjamin Netanya just wants that once America comes, this war will end. This is the thing.  I think the time for conversation is over now.  However, anything can happen.  Khamenei has issued new threats to Israel and then to America also. Ok?  That you come and fight the war.  Let's see who sees what and who has how much strength in what place. So this plane that has gone is okay, right?  This can be very important because you can assume that things like this are rarely seen.  Now we will see, whatever happens, I will tell you. I am giving updates of the Iran-Israel war.  For the rest you can avail our course. SEO plus thumbnail description link is given in comment box.  Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off.
