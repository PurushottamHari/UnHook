1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
I want people to start thinking about

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,440
their feet because the implications it

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,519
will have for longevity is massive. But

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
there is plenty of things we can do for

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
foot strength and performance. And you

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
can actually do this at home. And I'm

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
going to educate you here. There's a lot

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,080
we could talk about here. That didn't

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,320
sound like a compliment. Dr. Courtney

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,920
Connley is a worldrenowned foot doctor

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
who's making people rethink everything

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,080
they know about their feet and the

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
shocking truth about their shoes. One in

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
three people will experience foot pain

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
and it really starts to deter your

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
physical health, your emotional health,

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
your mental health because you can't do

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
most things. And I know this because as

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
a ballet dancer and then a triathlete, I

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
had all of the diagnoses, bunions,

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
nuromomas, heel pain, and not being able

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
to walk and not being able to move. You

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,719
can go to some pretty dark places. But

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,879
when you look at the statistics, 5,000

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
steps a day can reduce the risk of

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
having symptoms of depression and also

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,079
reduce your risk of all-c causeed

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,440
mortality by 15%. Wow. Here's a bigger

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,000
wow. 9800 steps can reduce the risks of

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,920
dementia. So it's the most underutilized

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
easily accessible activity that most of

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
us are not doing. What about footwear

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
choices? Footwear has such a big

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,439
implication on our function. For

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
example, around 70% of children are

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,280
wearing shoes that are too narrow. I've

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
got a range of footwear here that most

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
people wear. So, what do you think of

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
these shoes? You shorten the muscles in

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,880
the back of the leg. What is the issue

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
with wearing these? So, they change the

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,479
structure of the foot. What about this

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
one here? You're going to make me start

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,159
sweating. So, let's talk about some good

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,200
shoes then. Okay, so these are the

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
things you want to look for in a

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
functional shoe. First,

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,479
this has always blown my mind a little

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,560
bit. 53% of you that listen to this show

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,479
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
before we start? If you like the show

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
and you like what we do here and you

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
want to support us, the free simple way

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
that you can do just that is by hitting

56
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
the subscribe button. And my commitment

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

58
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,880
everything in my power, me and my team,

59
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,719
to make sure that this show is better

60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
for you every single week. We'll listen

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
to your feedback. We'll find the guests

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
that you want me to speak to and we'll

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,079
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

64
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,079
much.

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
What are we getting wrong? And at what

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,520
stage in our life do we get it wrong? It

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
feels

68
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,120
like you have a little bit of beef with

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,640
shoes. A little bit. A little bit of

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
beef. I've got a range of different

71
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,160
shoes here. But what is it that we're

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
being sold or told that is fundamentally

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
not aligned with what it is to be a

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,720
healthy, strong, happy human? I always

75
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
say that if we started with our children

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,040
and put them in the right footwear, I'd

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
be out of a

78
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,239
job because that's when it starts.

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
That's when the foot starts developing

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,720
and that's when we start to build

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,360
strength and you know structure to the

82
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,360
foot and from a very young age we start

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,760
interfering with what goes on the foot.

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,360
And when you think about all of the

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
things that the foot can do, it's why

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm obsessed with it. I mean, there's

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
bones and ligaments and the foot should

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,200
be designed, it's designed to move.

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,440
The arch recoils, so it should lengthen,

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,239
and then it should contract. There's

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,640
four layers of muscles in

92
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,640
here. So, when we look at the function

93
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,599
of the foot, we have to respect that.

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,840
And I think

95
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:27,040
footwear can deter the function of the

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
foot. So is the is the biggest risk just

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,879
make sure I'm super clear that I will

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,640
fall when I'm older. Is that the key

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,120
risk? I mean I don't I think that is one

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,920
of the squella of what's going to happen

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,519
if we don't start paying attention. But

102
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,720
when you look at function as a whole,

103
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,360
things like walking, one in three

104
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,480
people and probably over the ages of 45

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,439
will experience foot pain. Yeah. So,

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,680
other than low back pain, there's really

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,400
no other

108
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,840
diagnosis that you'll see those types of

109
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,239
numbers. And here's the here's the issue

110
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
with foot

111
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,799
pain. You can't do much.

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,040
You can't go for a

113
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,720
walk. You can't go for a hike. You can't

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,799
do most things. You can't walk to the

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,160
mailbox when you have severe foot pain.

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,560
So, it really starts to deter your

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,600
physical health, your emotional health,

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
your mental health. So, it's one of

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,280
those things I'm extremely passionate

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,040
about because it's not just about pain.

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
It's about what happens when you can't

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
walk and you can't use your foot. And is

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
it is the foot connected to the ankle

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,080
which is connected to the correct half

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,400
which is connected to the back. Is

126
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,400
there sort of a whole body um holistic

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,479
issue here? Is it all interconnected?

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,840
Yes, 100%. Especially when I see you

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,960
know patients that have

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,080
bilateral symptoms of their feet. So

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,520
that would be both sides. Okay. So, for

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,720
example, if I see someone with bilateral

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,479
bunions, okay, which would be the bump

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,880
on the inside of the big toe. Yeah.

135
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,720
Okay. You have to ask

136
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,400
yourself, where is this abnormal load

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
coming from? Let me just check my

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,280
bunions.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah. Check. Check. Yeah. Right. Where

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,039
is it coming from? Is it, you know, is

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,280
it a something that has to do with the

142
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,840
pelvis? Right. Because when I'm

143
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,800
standing, if I tilt my pelvis forward, I

144
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,639
should feel my arches drop. Mhm. So

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
there's a direct correlation between

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
what's happening at your hips and your

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,479
pelvis and what happens at your foot.

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
And when I were to tuck my pelvis, you

149
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,520
should feel the arches

150
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,919
lift. So when we start to see things

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
happen at the foot, it's a window. It's

152
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,520
a window to what's going on, not only at

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
the foot, but everywhere else in the

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,520
kinetic chain. When patients come to

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
you, what kind of symptoms do they have

156
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,120
that are connected to the foot?

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,880
Bunyions, nuromomas, hammer toes. What's

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,759
a nuroma and a hammer? So, a nuroma

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,639
is a nerve irritation. Yeah. In between

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,960
the toes. So, the mo the most common you

161
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
will hear of is a Morton's nuroma, and

162
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,039
that's typically in between the third

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,440
and fourth toes. Okay. And it can be

164
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,880
very painful. Remember we talked about

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,199
when you go to push off when you're

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,000
walking? Yeah. The wider and the

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,759
stronger the forefoot is, the more

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,919
stable it is. So, if I have a foot that

169
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,840
doesn't have spllay or that looks like

170
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,440
this and you're trying to push off of

171
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,319
it, you can irritate the nerves within

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,720
the forefoot. Okay. And you can develop

173
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720
these nerve symptoms at the forefoot.

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
Very painful. What are the are the other

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
types of sort of injuries or symptoms

176
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,160
that people come to you with that you

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,280
then root back to the feet? Hammer toes.

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
Hammer toes, which is the clawing of the

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
toes. Oh, okay. Yeah. Right. And this is

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,919
what's cool about the foot because it's

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,479
the only place in the body where you can

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,919
see aarent loads. What does that mean?

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,759
Abnormal lo dysfunction because you

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,319
can't see it at the knee. You can't see

185
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
it at the hip unless you were to take

186
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,720
imaging where you'd start to see

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
structural change. But you can see it at

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
the foot. So, you should be asking

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
yourself, man, why am I developing

190
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,919
hammer toes? And maybe I should pay

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,400
attention to that because bunyions and

192
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,960
hammer toes

193
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,599
also will increase your risk of falling

194
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,560
and also decrease balance. That's a

195
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,840
problem. I had um planttoitis, which

196
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
meant that I struggled to walk for a

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,840
couple of weeks uh a few years ago when

198
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,680
I was training for a football match. And

199
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,080
that's really what started me on my

200
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,720
journey of understanding the foot and

201
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,319
trying to understand how to strengthen

202
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
it. Yeah. So that I could be more

203
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,560
active. Cuz if you've never experienced

204
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
planttoitis, which I'm sure some of my

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
listeners have, it really is a awful

206
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
awful thing. What are what's the the

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
rest of the list of those kinds of

208
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
injuries that people can get from having

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
a weak foot? Is there anything else that

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
we haven't covered? Well, plantar

211
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,319
fasciopathy is probably the most common.

212
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,160
That's your heel pain. Okay. And I do

213
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,599
think that that is a

214
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,440
diagnosis that we need to look at a

215
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,639
little bit differently. Achilles

216
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,039
tendonopathy also very very

217
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,199
common. Um other tendon diagnoses

218
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
posterior tibialis tendon. So that's the

219
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,919
tendon that runs along the inside of the

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
foot and it's one of the biggest

221
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
stabilizers of the medial column of the

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,640
foot. It's a powerhouse that in the

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
soius which is your calf lower the calf

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,399
muscle powerhouses of the lower leg and

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,880
all of these tissues can be strengthened

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
and produce

227
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,920
power and we need to start looking at

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,320
the foot just like we look at every

229
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,080
other part of the body. So what do you

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,680
do for a living and who are you?

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,440
Um well I'm a chiropractor by nature. Um

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,200
I went to chiropractic school.

233
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Um, you know, I knew that I wanted to

234
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,080
get into some type of medicine that was

235
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,040
proactive, you know, not reactive. I

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,959
didn't quite have interest in surgeries

237
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,720
or pharmaceuticals. Movement has always

238
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,880
been a very big part of my life. And so,

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
I knew I needed to stay in that in that

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,120
arena.

241
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,519
So, what did you do? When I was younger,

242
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
I was a dancer. I was a ballet dancer

243
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,640
and then I shifted gears into being a

244
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,040
runner and then a

245
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:46,560
triathlete and I didn't know at the time

246
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,519
why movement was a necessity for me. You

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,279
know, I certainly wasn't thinking, oh,

248
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,120
you know, I need to do this because of

249
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,519
longevity or because I'm going to have a

250
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,080
better V2 max, you know. And now in

251
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,360
hindsight, when I think about it, it was

252
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,160
a means of survival. Mhm. Uh movement

253
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,600
was survival for me. And in my teens and

254
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,160
into my 20s, you know, I had some

255
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,160
personal demons that I fought.

256
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,120
And the one thing that was consistent

257
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,839
that I felt I could control was making

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,200
sure that I stayed moving. And the

259
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,240
problem is is when you have foot pain,

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,320
you can't do that. And because movement

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,120
was a was a lifeline for me. It was a

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
mode of survival. There were days where,

263
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
you know, I was a dancer. I had all of

264
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
the diagnoses we just talked about,

265
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,079
bunions, and nuromomas, heel pain, and

266
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
when you tag on day after day of not

267
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,360
being able to walk and not being able to

268
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
move, you can go to some pretty dark

269
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,360
places.

270
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,760
And so I just it was a mission of mine

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,360
to figure this out and figure out how I

272
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,360
can personally be able to continue to

273
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
move but then also be able to hopefully

274
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,480
help other people. It got tough for you,

275
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,320
didn't it? I can see it in your face.

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Yes.

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,279
Because for this to matter this much to

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,959
you, then it's it's personal to say the

279
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,079
least.

280
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,360
It changed my life. when you're, you

281
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
know, I think whenever we have a

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,440
passion, there's always this quest

283
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,480
personally behind it. And so I

284
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,360
saw what it did for me and then over the

285
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
past 20 years being able to see what it

286
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,720
has done for my patients is why I'm even

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,040
more hardpressed to get this information

288
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,200
out there. Walking, yes,

289
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
we don't do much of that these days. It

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,839
seems to have gone out of fashion with

291
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,399
all the Ubers and the other ways to to

292
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,200
get around and all the sedentary uh

293
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,839
behavior that we do living in living and

294
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,480
working in offices. What what should we

295
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,079
know about walking and how important it

296
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,519
is? Because I'll be honest, I don't walk

297
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,720
that much. Yes. It's um I always say

298
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,720
it's the most underrated, underutilized,

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,959
easily accessible activity that most of

300
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,600
us are not

301
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:14,639
doing. If you think about if you look at

302
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,519
the research on average step count that

303
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,639
most people globally are taking, it's

304
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,000
about 45 to 4,900.

305
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,240
Okay? Which means that there's a lot of

306
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,440
us that are taking less than

307
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,880
that. So when I'm working with my

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
patients, we always look at baseline

309
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,079
numbers. What's your baseline?

310
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,720
So, for example, if you had a person who

311
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
was walking 2500 steps a day, I mean,

312
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,680
some of us would be like, "Wow, that's

313
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,079
not a lot." But for a lot of us, it

314
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:51,639
is. If you were to walk an additional

315
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,639
500 steps in a day, your baseline's

316
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,839
2500. You can reduce your risk of

317
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,800
cardiovascular mortality by 7%.

318
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,600
Wow. Here's a bigger wow. If you have a

319
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,200
thousandst step

320
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,560
increase, you can reduce your risk of

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,680
all-c causeed mortality by 15%. Dying of

322
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,639
anything, all-c causeed mortality,

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,880
15%. That's a big number for a thousand

324
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,279
steps.

325
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,000
So, I I have a story for you. This is a

326
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,680
patient of mine and it just, you

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,720
know, it warms my heart to talk about

328
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,079
him because when I saw him, he was 2

329
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,320
years into a diagnosis of heel

330
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,959
pain, 27 years

331
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,440
old. So, he had um gone to see a bunch

332
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:45,120
of people and the last doctor that he

333
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:50,480
had seen told him to limit his step

334
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:54,160
count to 2500 steps a day. Why?

335
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,920
to rest to rest the foot. Now, this is

336
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
chronic pain. Now, we're not talking

337
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,199
acute heel pain. We are two years into

338
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,240
this song and dance and he's being told

339
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,480
at 27 years old to take 2500 steps a

340
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,480
day. So, he comes into my office, we're

341
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,399
talking about all of this, and he's also

342
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
a

343
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,920
quadruplet. So, it was one of the first

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,399
quadruplets I think I've ever treated.

345
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,040
So he has

346
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,800
um you know which why I think pain is so

347
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
difficult. It's so complicated because

348
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,600
now you have this 27-year-old who's

349
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,279
seeing his siblings who are at 27 like

350
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,120
enjoy their life and doing all these

351
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,160
things and he's being told he can take

352
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,600
2500 steps a day. So he's now living in

353
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,920
his father's

354
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,680
basement and he's

355
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,079
afraid to go above 2500 steps.

356
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,839
And he used to tell me, he's like, "I

357
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,600
cry a lot. I'm

358
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,920
depressed." And wouldn't you be if

359
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,079
Yeah.

360
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,000
So there wasn't any magic exercise that

361
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,720
I was going to give him two years into

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
this. There wasn't any magic orthotic or

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
magic shoe. He had done all of that.

364
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,839
Shame on me if I would have done the

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,639
same thing.

366
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,560
So, we had a

367
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,600
conversation

368
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,360
and I knew I needed to get him outside

369
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
and I needed to get him walking. That

370
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
was my goal. Forget about the heel pain.

371
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
We didn't even focus. We didn't even

372
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,760
talk about the heel pain. I knew I

373
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,000
needed to get him outside and start

374
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
loading his

375
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,440
foot. Two years. This foot, by the way,

376
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
when you're walking, four to six times

377
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
your body weight. It can handle four to

378
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,079
six times your body weight when you're

379
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,639
walking. but you don't load it

380
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:41,440
appropriately and muscles

381
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:44,240
atrophy. So I told him, we had a long

382
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,120
long conversation and I said, "We're

383
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,040
going to slowly start to introduce

384
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,920
steps." And if you think about this, if

385
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,360
we were to say add a thousand steps a

386
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,440
day, to some people that might not sound

387
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
like a lot, but to someone who's taking

388
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,880
2500 steps, that's almost 50% of what

389
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,880
they're doing.

390
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,360
So we introduced the concept of a micro

391
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,240
walk which is a five minute

392
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:21,199
walk. So a five minute walk is about 500

393
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,480
steps. Okay. A 10-minute walk is about a

394
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,560
thousand about a thousand steps. Okay.

395
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
Right. So that makes it like a little

396
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,639
more digestible. Right. So you're

397
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,560
talking to him. And you're like,

398
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,680
"Listen, all I need is 5

399
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,199
minutes." And so we started five minute

400
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,160
walks. And for the first couple weeks,

401
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,600
it was, you know, there were good days,

402
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,160
there were bad days, and there still

403
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,639
are, but we were starting to build his

404
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,480
confidence in movement. We were starting

405
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,279
to get him comfortable on his foot

406
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,759
again.

407
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,440
And it was, you know, it was one of

408
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,959
those cases where I just like I I

409
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,399
really enjoyed working with him and

410
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
watching what had happened

411
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,520
because if you look at step counts, I

412
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,079
knew what number I was trying to get to

413
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,079
because if you look at um depression,

414
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,280
for

415
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,679
example, 5,000 steps a day can reduce

416
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,720
the risk of having symptoms of

417
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,160
depression. Mhm.

418
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,400
If you get to 7,500 steps per day, it

419
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,760
can reduce the prevalence of the

420
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,280
diagnosis of depression. So that was in

421
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
the back of my head. I'm like, we just

422
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,360
got to keep working towards these

423
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,120
numbers.

424
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,200
So while we were doing that, we were

425
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
strengthening his foot. I had him in

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,880
different

427
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,000
footwear. And at the end of each week,

428
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,760
we were also talking

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,320
about three good things. tell me three

430
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
good things that happened to you this

431
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,080
week. And in the beginning of treatment,

432
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,799
it was it was a struggle, Stephen. It

433
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,000
was a struggle for him to think about

434
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,000
good things happening in his

435
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,320
life. And

436
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,160
um I I spoke with him probably about a

437
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,320
month

438
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,799
ago and his email is like my why. He was

439
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,360
like

440
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,640
um on average he's walking between five

441
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,480
and 6,000 steps a

442
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,919
day. He still has good days or still has

443
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
bad days, more good days than bad days.

444
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,799
But he said to me, he's like, "I haven't

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,200
I can't tell you the last time I cried.

446
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,880
He's going to church. He's spending time

447
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,320
with his dad, you know,

448
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,880
and it's not it's not the step count,

449
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,720
it's the person behind the step count.

450
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,120
And that's why I think this stuff is so

451
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,440
powerful. I saw it change my life. I saw

452
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,039
what it does to my patients. I mean, it

453
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,640
has the capacity to improve not just

454
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,360
your physical health, but how you

455
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,440
interact with the world.

456
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
you

457
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,480
it has a completely different meaning

458
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
when you understand the real sort of

459
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,350
human consequences it can have on

460
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,640
someone's life for better or for worse.

461
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,320
[Music]

462
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Um and it's and it's not often until we

463
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,799
have some kind of injury or issue that

464
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,039
we yes realize that our feet and ankles

465
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
were were there. Yes. And that certainly

466
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,600
been the case in my life. It wasn't

467
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
until I got planticitis that I was like

468
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
oh my god I should have been doing

469
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,600
something about this sooner. And then as

470
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
I told you before we started recording

471
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,640
I've currently got a high ankle sprain.

472
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
So, I've pulled some ligaments in my the

473
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,039
top of my ankle training for this game

474
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,400
called Soccer Aid. So, I'm now going

475
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,919
through the whole process once again of

476
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
like figuring out what I did wrong and

477
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,919
what what I should have been doing as a

478
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
preventative measure to try and

479
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,480
strengthen my feet. One of the things I

480
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,039
think most of us get wrong is our

481
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
footwear choices. Yes. And I've got a

482
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,039
range of footwear on this table in front

483
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,440
of me here. These are the types of shoes

484
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,679
that most people wear. Um, from a very

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
young age, I think we all wear shoes

486
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
like this.

487
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,919
Yes. Narrow shoes with a big heel. If

488
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
anyone can't see our conversation at the

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,280
moment, it's like the the typical

490
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,679
trainer. What is what is the issue with

491
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,160
wearing these from an early age?

492
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,840
When I was doing research to have this

493
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
discussion with you, it was fascinating

494
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,120
to me when you look at the statistics of

495
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,320
especially with um children, with girls,

496
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,640
around 70% are wearing shoes that are

497
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,480
too narrow. Too narrow. The end part.

498
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,919
Yes. Yeah. Remember we talked about the

499
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
widest part of the foot should be the

500
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,600
toes. Mhm. So when you look at a shoe

501
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,400
like that, that is not the widest part.

502
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,640
It's tapered. See how the toe box looks

503
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,960
like it's tapered? Yeah. It's point like

504
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,039
correct. Yeah. So when you put your foot

505
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,120
in there, it's doing this. Mhm. It

506
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,760
changes the structure of the foot. It's

507
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,880
like the lowest hanging fruit for me is

508
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,760
just wear a shoe that fits your

509
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,919
foot because when it's in that

510
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,280
position, it changes the structure. If I

511
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,720
walked around with uh my arm in a sling

512
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,400
for 10 years, would my bicep get weak?

513
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,559
Yeah. Your mo you'd lose your mobility

514
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,720
as well. Correct. If you don't use it,

515
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,480
you're going to lose it. And so that's

516
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,200
why I think footwear has such a big

517
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,200
implication on our function.

518
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,679
Men's dress shoes. Men's dress shoes. I

519
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,720
mean, that is crazy. The point on that.

520
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes. It's funny. My um brother lives in

521
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
New York City and we have this

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
conversation all the time and he's like,

523
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,880
"Look at this one. It's wide." I'm like,

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,039
"Nope, that's not wide." Right. And

525
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,039
they're stiff and they're, you know,

526
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,080
again, changing the structure of the

527
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,880
foot. A lot of those shoes also have a

528
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,000
little bit of a heel to toe drop. Yeah.

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
Yes. So that is when the heel to toe

530
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,159
drop, so the heel and the toes sit in

531
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
one plane. But when you have a higher

532
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,120
heel to toe drop, it's like you have a

533
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,400
mini high heel on. Yeah. And what's the

534
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,200
problem with that? Well, if my foot is

535
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,960
supposed to sit

536
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,320
flat, I have tissues in the back of my

537
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,400
leg that are in a good length tension

538
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,600
relationship. I have even pressures

539
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,679
across my foot. Yeah. The second I go

540
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,159
and change those things where I go into

541
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,480
a heel, you put additional pressure on

542
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,799
the front of the foot, you shorten the

543
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,520
muscles in the back of the leg. So you

544
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,440
start changing the the function and the

545
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,640
structure of not only the foot, but

546
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,159
everything that sits above it, your your

547
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,520
calf, your hamstring, your back.

548
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,240
Do you see a lot of back injuries that

549
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,600
are relating to things like heels and

550
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:48,880
Yes, you do. Mhm. It's all, you know, I

551
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,360
see mostly people come in for foot pain

552
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,000
and I always say to my patients, I wish

553
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,200
it was just about the foot. I wish I

554
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,720
could just look at your foot and say,

555
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,880
"This is what it is. It's all right

556
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,679
here." But it's not because there's a

557
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,720
body that sits on top of the foot.

558
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,200
The strength of the hip, for

559
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,280
example, controls the foot. It controls

560
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
how the foot unlocks.

561
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,159
So, you have to take that into account

562
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,000
when you're looking at patients with

563
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,799
foot pain.

564
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,679
But this this is the shape because it's

565
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,120
fashionable, right? Yes. It's my

566
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,400
biggest, you know, I always tell my

567
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
daughter cuz my daughter, you know,

568
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
she's like, "You make me wear these

569
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,559
platypus shoes." And I'm like, "Listen,

570
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,600
it's function over fashion." But I get

571
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:37,600
it. That is my biggest challenge is

572
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,960
making, you know, is looking for shoes.

573
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
But they've come a long way. They're

574
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,000
they've come a very very long way and I

575
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,799
think that uh we're getting there. Is

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,080
there an issue with the thickness of the

577
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,200
heel on these shoes? This big When I say

578
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,440
the thickness of the heel, I really mean

579
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,000
the thickness of the sole. So the

580
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
cushion and the the cushion. It's I mean

581
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,919
it's really really soft soft and

582
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,840
cushiony and there's about you know an

583
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,480
inch at the back here of soul. Yeah. Um

584
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,840
the cushion conversation is always very

585
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,240
interesting.

586
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,480
Um, there's always a trade-off. So,

587
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,320
there's a lot of popular shoes right now

588
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,320
that have a lot of cushion on them.

589
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,720
Yeah. And it's hard to argue when

590
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
someone goes into a store and they're

591
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,320
given this shoe that has this pillow on

592
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,640
it and they're standing on it for 3

593
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,200
seconds and they're like, "Man, this

594
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
feels really

595
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,240
good." The problem with

596
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:41,679
cushion is that the more stuff

597
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,279
that's between your foot and the ground,

598
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,279
the less you feel. So, there's a loss of

599
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
sensory acuity. There's a loss of

600
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,679
sensory perception. Remember, the foot

601
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,960
is, imagine the foot's a sensory organ.

602
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,120
And it is because there's thousands of

603
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,200
receptors that are, you know, screaming

604
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,679
for information to help keep us upright

605
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
in a biped. So, when we start

606
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,600
interfering with how that foot feels,

607
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,159
you can expect there to be problems.

608
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,480
Now, if you have someone that's standing

609
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,400
in place all day long, right, on

610
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,480
concrete, on man-made surfaces, there's

611
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,760
a time and a place. But my

612
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,520
non-negotiable is at least keep the foot

613
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,080
in its functional position, which means

614
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,240
a wide toe

615
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,720
box. So, you want to stand on concrete

616
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,799
all day long, fine. Put a put some

617
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,440
cushion underneath your foot. Help

618
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,320
yourself out. That's okay. But at least

619
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,960
allow those toes to spllay so that you

620
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,679
can have balance. You can have your foot

621
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,679
in a position that can propel you

622
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,919
forward. I was just thinking about my

623
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,880
foot as you're talking and I'm pretty

624
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,080
sure like my I'm pretty sure like my

625
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
pinky toe

626
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,440
looks I'm not going to be able to sell

627
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,279
pictures on only fans of my feet because

628
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
my pinky toe is kind of like crumpled

629
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,240
in. It like curls under, right? Yeah.

630
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
It's like curled under, right? Kind of

631
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
looks like a shoe. like you had a shoe

632
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,039
there like Excuse me. No, no, but you're

633
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,799
right. It is. It is like that. Um it's

634
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,760
kind of like been pushed pushed in and

635
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,799
underneath and I guess that's not

636
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,240
natural. No, it is not. How does a

637
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,159
natural foot look like? Have you been to

638
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,440
see a tribe who who don't wear these

639
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,400
cushion shoes? Have you seen what like a

640
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,320
un cushioned foot looks like? I'm

641
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,559
obsessed. I watch people's feet all the

642
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,159
time. I was just in Bise with my mother

643
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,480
and daughter for spring break. It's

644
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,480
slightly creepy. Sorry. It is, isn't it?

645
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,960
And you're looking at people's feet on

646
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,960
holiday. I'm always looking at people's

647
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
feet. Uh because it tells a story. It's

648
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,559
like someone's gate, you know. Watching

649
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
someone walk tells a story. you can tell

650
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,559
if they just got fired or if they just

651
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,559
got promoted, you know. But when you

652
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,679
look at someone's foot, I was in Bise

653
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,640
and with my mom and daughter and um

654
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,679
there were these two guys building a

655
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,720
house a little bit off the beach

656
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,880
barefoot and I'm looking at their foot

657
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,960
and I'm going, "Wow, it was wide. It

658
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,240
looked

659
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,279
thick. It looked flat."

660
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,600
And you know, I think in our society, if

661
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,000
you will, when we think of a flat foot,

662
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,080
we think, "Oh, this is bad news. We

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,880
better go get an orthotic." An orthotic

664
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,039
is a um a device that you put underneath

665
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,440
the foot to help um modify loads. Uh

666
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,559
what do they call those in the UK? Um

667
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
insoles. Like an insole. Okay. Yes. And

668
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
so I'm watching these guys build this

669
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
house and they're like coming up on

670
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
their toes and they have all this, you

671
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,880
know, toe range of motion and all this

672
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,640
strength and power to their foot and I'm

673
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
like that's that's what our foot was

674
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,960
designed to do is to be strong to

675
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,200
support. It's like building a house on

676
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,480
sand. Yeah. You have to have a

677
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,320
foundation that you can build upon. And

678
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,520
it was really cool to see. It really

679
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,600
was. When I had that pain in my foot,

680
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,000
which they told me was plantificitis,

681
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,840
they recommended that I go to some foot

682
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
doctor person. And this foot doctor

683
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,039
person measured me up for insoles. Yes.

684
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,200
And I put the insoles in and then I took

685
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,559
the insoles out and instead of that, I

686
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,720
just wore different shoes. Yeah. A lot

687
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,679
of people's first sort of diagnosis and

688
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
the thing that they're told to do

689
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,399
whenever they have foot pain or back

690
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,919
pain or whatever is go get some insoles.

691
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,039
Is this what you think we should be

692
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,760
doing? Because it's really really

693
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
common. It's like it seems to be the the

694
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
like in medicine they throw pills at you

695
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,559
if you have certain symptoms. It seems

696
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,919
to be the first thing that we do when

697
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,720
someone has a foot problem or an ankle

698
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
problem. First line of intervention is

699
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,279
that's why I I you want to change how

700
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,360
we're viewing the foot. It's either if

701
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,840
your foot hurts, here's an orthosis,

702
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,320
which is a a foot orthotic, an insert.

703
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,039
Yeah. or if it hurts worse get

704
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:02,120
surgery. If you look at the research on

705
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,679
planner fascitis, okay, so itis being

706
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,399
acute, it will tell you that putting an

707
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,320
orthosis or something to modify the load

708
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,240
underneath the foot can be

709
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,760
beneficial

710
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,240
initially because you want to offload

711
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,799
something that hurts. Yeah. But if you

712
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,799
don't use it, you're going to lose it.

713
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,000
So what they're not the part of the

714
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,080
conversation that's being missed is the

715
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,320
and

716
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,720
conversation. It's wear this insert

717
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,840
and strengthen your

718
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,919
foot because the goal should be to have

719
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,039
an exit strategy for the insert and get

720
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,120
your foot back on the ground. Because I

721
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,159
have

722
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,440
patients, Stephen, they will come in

723
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,120
with 20 pairs of orthotics, 20 pairs of

724
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,640
inserts. They've tried this one, they've

725
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,720
tried that one, they've tried different

726
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,640
shoes, higher heel totoe drops, more

727
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,679
cushion, and I'm sitting there going,

728
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,760
we're missing the boat

729
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,760
here. Let's have the and conversation.

730
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,520
One of the muscles that is a good

731
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,000
predictor of having heel pain, okay, is

732
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,640
it runs parallel to the planar fascia.

733
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,720
So it's flexor digtor and brevis. It

734
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,279
basically takes the four toes and

735
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,480
presses them down.

736
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,919
There's ways you can assess for

737
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,360
this. So we'll look at their toe

738
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,640
strength and then it almost always

739
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,320
correlates with the side that has the

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,440
heel pain on because it it shouldn't be

741
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
one of those conversations. You're like,

742
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,080
man, I wonder where this came from. No,

743
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,240
your foot is weak. Your foot is weak.

744
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,559
There's a lot of load going through it

745
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and the structures are, you know,

746
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,520
getting beat up. There's something

747
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,960
Daniel Lieberman said to me which I've

748
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,559
never forgotten. He said, "If you took a

749
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
child and you put them

750
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,159
in 2in thick gloves from the day that

751
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
they were born and then you took those

752
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,279
gloves off at 30 years old, can you

753
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,799
imagine how deformed their hands would

754
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,640
be?" Right? And that's like very much

755
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,559
the way that we live our lives. We spend

756
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,399
pretty much all day wearing these big

757
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
cushioned shoes that sometimes have

758
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,919
these heels on. So, it's no wonder that

759
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,760
so many people are getting foot

760
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,000
problems, ankle problems, back pain.

761
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,559
Yeah. So, one in three people, one in

762
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,720
three people. Foot pain. I mean, it

763
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:24,559
is it really is a statistic that we need

764
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,640
to be paying attention to. We use this

765
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
word planttoicitis, but we didn't

766
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,440
explain what it is and what the symptoms

767
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,279
of it are. Is it essentially like pain

768
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,279
in the the heel of your foot? Pain in

769
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,120
the heel. So yes, and they've played

770
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,360
around with, you know, the terminology

771
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,320
being it plantar fascitis, so more of an

772
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,320
acute issue versus plantar fasciopathy

773
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,720
because often times these cases will

774
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,880
turn into, you know, having heel pain

775
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,559
for very long periods of time. Yeah. So

776
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,080
then you have to treat it differently.

777
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,360
You don't treat something that's acute

778
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,880
the same as you would treat something

779
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,600
that's chronic. And so you have to look

780
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,039
at how can I build the resiliency to the

781
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,320
foot. How did it happen?

782
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,600
How did all of this happen? How did

783
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,559
planticiitis happen? Like, how did I get

784
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,480
it? So, I'll tell you what I was doing.

785
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,559
I was living my life as normal. Yeah.

786
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,279
And then I started training to play for

787
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,840
this soccer game and I started training

788
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,919
several maybe twice a week. And then

789
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:30,320
maybe by week four or five or six, I get

790
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,640
this horrific ongoing pain which lasted

791
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,960
throughout the entire day. Yeah. where I

792
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,600
couldn't walk easily. It was especially

793
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
bad in the mornings and uh yeah, I

794
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,640
thought I'd like broken something or

795
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,360
ripped something in my foot. And when

796
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,120
they told me that it was planttoicitis,

797
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,720
I'd never heard that term before. But

798
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,880
understanding what I did there, how did

799
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,360
I get it? When I see I hear very similar

800
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,960
stories with that diagnosis, there's

801
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,360
always there always seems to be some

802
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:03,360
impetus of I I added load too fast too

803
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,519
soon. Mhm. I went on a longer hike. I

804
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,919
This was one of my favorites. Um I went

805
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,679
barefoot during COVID around my house

806
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,320
and everybody wanted to blame the fact

807
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,320
that, you know, don't ever go barefoot.

808
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
And I was like, maybe it's just cuz your

809
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,399
foot was weak and you weren't ready to

810
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,279
handle these loads. You add loads too

811
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,919
fast, too

812
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,600
soon, and the foot just says, "You know

813
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:30,240
what? You weren't ready to give me this

814
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,360
amount of load this quickly." Okay. And

815
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,519
that's, you know, when you asked me

816
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,880
earlier about

817
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,320
um why do we need to pay attention to

818
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
our foot strength? Is it just because,

819
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,440
you know, we're going to we want to

820
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,360
prevent falls when we're 70? This is the

821
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,600
why. Because we want to have healthy

822
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,960
feet, strong feet, so you can say, "Hey,

823
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,559
I want to go play a soccer game and I

824
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,399
don't want to worry about having planner

825
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,320
fascitis in my 30s." Mhm. Or I mean, now

826
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,000
with this this ankle sprain that I have,

827
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,919
Yes. pulling my ligaments which takes

828
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,919
you out of activity for so long which is

829
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,760
horrific. That's like a big part of this

830
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,279
which is if you get an injury if you get

831
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,079
a bad injury if you get like an Achilles

832
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,280
tendon issue or the you tear a ligament

833
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,760
like I have or even planttoitis

834
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,879
the inactivity that stems from that

835
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,399
causes a bunch of downstream issues. So

836
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,000
my muscles are going to atrophy. I'm

837
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,679
going to lose muscle over this next

838
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,720
couple of weeks in my lower half. I'm

839
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,480
going to get probably a little bit

840
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,960
lopsided because the injury is on my

841
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,079
right side. So now my left side's having

842
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,720
more of the burden. Uh my my lower legs,

843
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,399
my upper legs, my lower back is probably

844
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
susceptible now to some kind of injury

845
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,399
as well. And it feels like, you know,

846
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,520
this down downward spiral of injury just

847
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,440
because I didn't strengthen my foot.

848
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,679
What do you think of these shoes? These

849
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,399
are women's heels, but listen, anyone

850
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,000
can wear them. It's 2025. Um what do you

851
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,679
think of these shoes?

852
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,200
Well, it doesn't look like a foot. Your

853
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,119
foot in that position is not the

854
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,839
position it is supposed to be in. Now,

855
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,560
with that being said, there is a time

856
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,480
and a place. You know, I don't think I'm

857
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,400
going to win the battle of, you know,

858
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,119
you need to wear, you know, functional

859
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,880
footwear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

860
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,760
Time in those shoes should be

861
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,040
limited just like with, you

862
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,079
know, other things.

863
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,160
It's moderation. Do you see a lot of

864
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,560
women getting injuries because they

865
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,520
spend too long wearing heels? I don't

866
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:37,200
know if acute injury but but a weakening

867
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,599
of tissue. Yes. Because, you know, I

868
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,280
live in Colorado now, so I don't have

869
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
that uh there's not too many women in

870
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,640
Colorado that are wearing heels.

871
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,160
However, when I go to New York City,

872
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,599
it's a different conversation, different

873
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,480
environment. M so you know I have to say

874
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,000
I have to use the that is not the

875
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,240
position that you want to keep your foot

876
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,800
in. It's changing the structure of your

877
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,960
tissues changing the pressures in the

878
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,320
foot. Not to

879
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,839
mention that those aren't I don't I

880
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,520
don't care what anybody says that's not

881
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,880
comfortable to walk around in. People

882
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,839
will be like I'm really comfortable in

883
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,119
heels. I'm like are you really though?

884
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,800
The lengths we go to to look good

885
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,640
though. Right. That's right. Okay. So

886
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,200
let's talk about some good shoes then.

887
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,720
Okay. I've got two pairs of shoes here.

888
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,520
Okay.

889
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,480
One of them is Vivo Barefoot, who are

890
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,640
actually a sponsor of mine ever since I

891
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,320
s started talking about feet. Um and

892
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,160
then I don't know this brand. What is

893
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,320
this brand? That is Ultra Running.

894
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,280
So, let's talk about um the things you

895
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,560
want to look for in a functional

896
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,359
shoe. My non-negotiable is the wide toe

897
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,040
box. The toes have to be able to play.

898
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,640
When you think of all the diagnoses that

899
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,800
we talked about, bunyions, nuromomas,

900
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,079
hammer toes, when the forefoot can

901
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,880
spllay, the foot's going to function

902
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,440
better. So that's number one. Number two

903
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,760
is having the heel and the toe in the

904
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,280
same

905
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:07,320
plane. And number three is having a shoe

906
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,320
that is thin and flexible.

907
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,040
When you wear this type of

908
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,480
footwear, I call this a workhorse shoe

909
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,720
because there is more loads going

910
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,240
through all of your tissues, through

911
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,800
your bones, through your ligaments,

912
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,040
through your tendons, through your

913
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,960
muscles. So, your foot gets stronger

914
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,320
when you wear this type of footwear.

915
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,760
There's research on that.

916
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,200
Now, you have to earn your right. This

917
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,400
is the plantar fasciopathy conversation.

918
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,440
You can't go from wearing a um

919
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,119
aggressive high cushion shoe like this

920
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,040
one here with and yes with an insert for

921
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
example and say oh this stuff makes

922
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,800
sense I'm going to go take that off and

923
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm going to go wear this 24 hours a

924
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,920
day. You won't like me. Why? Because

925
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,560
you'll say hey my heels hurting because

926
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,040
you haven't done the work. It's hey

927
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,599
let's do these foot exercises. Let's

928
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,720
wear this for 10 minutes a day. And then

929
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,320
people are like, "Wow, that does feel

930
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,440
better." And then it's a transition into

931
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,160
wearing this more

932
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,960
often. Now, when you have patients that

933
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,800
have had a a very weak foot or clients

934
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,800
that have had a very weak foot with

935
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,520
different

936
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,520
diagnosis, this is a hard, you know,

937
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,680
shoe to walk around in for extended

938
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,640
periods of time. So, that's when we'll

939
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,400
talk about footwear that still puts the

940
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:40,560
foot in a wide position. wide toe box. I

941
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,640
love this shoe. And I also like the mesh

942
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,880
upper because you can the toes can

943
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,839
expand in

944
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,040
here. I still have zero

945
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,119
drop, right? Where the heel and the toe

946
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,280
sit in the same plane, but you'll notice

947
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,119
the difference between the two shoes is

948
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,040
the amount of stack height or the amount

949
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,079
of

950
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,200
cushion. There's more stuff. Yeah. So on

951
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,599
this on this shoe

952
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,320
the it does look like the you call it

953
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,560
plane looks level. Yes. Okay. And it's

954
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,960
got a good toe box. You can see from

955
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,240
this side that the toe box is wide so

956
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,320
you can play. But it is elevated.

957
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,240
It's elevated off the ground. Yeah. But

958
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,560
the heel and toe are in the same plane.

959
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,839
Okay. Fine. But it it's it's still

960
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,920
elevated though. They're still like

961
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,480
quite a thick Yes. That's not too much

962
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,800
of a problem because it's still depends

963
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,960
on what your goals are. If I'm running,

964
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,079
that is that is a I think a great shoe

965
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,839
to run on, to run with, right? If you're

966
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,520
running on concrete, if you're running

967
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,320
on asphalt, you want a little something

968
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,160
underneath the foot.

969
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,560
What

970
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,880
about

971
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,000
the Nike Alpha Flies, which is my You

972
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,520
make me start sweating. Really? Uh uh

973
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,520
this is my current running shoe and I

974
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,160
bought it because it looks great. Yes. I

975
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,760
mean, you know, it is it's I have torn

976
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,560
the the ligaments in my in my ankle, but

977
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,400
but I look good. Here's the super shoe,

978
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,720
right? So, here's this shoe, right? And

979
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,680
here's your super shoe over here. Yeah.

980
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Okay. When you look at that shoe,

981
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,280
there's certain characteristics to that

982
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,280
shoe that you definitely do not see in

983
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,320
this shoe. One of them being the toe

984
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,320
spring. So, see how it kind of lips on

985
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,560
the front of the shoe? Yeah. Okay. This

986
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,079
part here. Yeah. Yes. So, if I had that

987
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,839
shoe on this table and I went like this

988
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
to the front of the shoe, it would

989
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,280
literally rocker for me. Mhm. So, it

990
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
facilitates the rocker of the foot.

991
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
Sounds great. You put that on, you're

992
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,160
like, "Man, this is great. I can fly."

993
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,240
If you don't use it, you're going to

994
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,480
lose it. So, there is research that

995
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,640
shows when you put your foot in a

996
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,320
position with toe spring, you will

997
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,599
weaken the intrinsic muscles of the

998
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,680
foot.

999
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,000
So, I'm not

1000
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,760
saying don't have race day and wear that

1001
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,839
shoe, right? You get the research will

1002
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,079
tell you two to four% running economy.

1003
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,599
People run faster because the shoe has

1004
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,680
the technology to facilitate gate. But

1005
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,960
if you train in that all the time and

1006
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,520
you never let your foot get stronger,

1007
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,920
it's just a matter of time. You're going

1008
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,720
to say, "My hamstring, my foot, my this,

1009
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,359
my that." And it's like we that's why

1010
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,800
the conversation has to happen is this

1011
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,599
is the shoe that you're going to get

1012
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,079
stronger in. Spend time in your training

1013
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,119
shoe. And then that's your speed day.

1014
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,119
That's your race day. So it's having the

1015
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,359
shoe spectrum, knowing when to dance

1016
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,079
along the spectrum.

1017
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,640
I feel like I can bounce in these.

1018
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,920
I mean, you probably can. I literally

1019
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,839
when I put it on, I was like, "Wow, I

1020
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,000
can bounce." I think it has like a piece

1021
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,560
of metal going through the middle of it.

1022
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,920
carbon in there. You know what another

1023
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,079
fun fact is though? Certain plyometrics,

1024
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,440
so plyometric is training the spring of

1025
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,440
the body. So think like

1026
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:03,119
jumping. There's research that will show

1027
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,000
you that plyometrics also increase

1028
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,680
capacity in running by 2 to 4%. So my

1029
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,079
conversation I have with my patients is

1030
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,960
listen, what if we stacked therapies,

1031
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,440
right? What if you did plyometric work

1032
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,319
which is uh jumping? Yeah. you know,

1033
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,880
once or twice a week and we worked on

1034
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,480
your strength and I had you in these

1035
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,960
shoes the majority of the time and then

1036
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,440
on race day you want to throw that shoe

1037
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,040
on. It's like you're you're a running

1038
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,800
you're like a running fairy. You're like

1039
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
running and things look beautiful and

1040
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,520
everything is, you know, because you

1041
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,680
have a strong body on top of the shoe.

1042
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,440
But if you put a weak body and a weak

1043
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,680
foot in that

1044
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,440
shoe, you got to earn your right. Should

1045
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,920
we be standing more often? Because most

1046
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,680
of us work and live in offices now and

1047
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
we sit at desks and I I you know I do

1048
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,480
this podcast sat down. Do you think much

1049
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,119
about standing desks or how often we

1050
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,520
should spend bipedal or I think that's

1051
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,520
what you refer to as I think that it's

1052
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,359
more about movement. Okay. I don't know

1053
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,040
if standing in one place is any better

1054
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,560
than sitting in one place other than

1055
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,640
when you're standing you can actually

1056
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,680
like you know move around and you know

1057
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,640
make it more active standing but it is a

1058
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,760
matter of taking movement breaks like

1059
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,599
that's I call them you know movement

1060
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,079
snacks all of us spend a lot of time

1061
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,640
either sitting all day long or you know

1062
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,040
standing at our

1063
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,640
desks if we were to take micro walks a

1064
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,560
five minute walk a couple times a day.

1065
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,119
The system stays moving. You're staying

1066
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,960
active and you're slowly, you know,

1067
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,800
inching up that step count that we know

1068
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,960
is so important for not only physical

1069
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,960
health, but emotional and mental health.

1070
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,359
That's what I like about it. I think you

1071
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,560
mentioned there was an association with

1072
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,880
movement, walking, and dementia,

1073
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,400
Alzheimer's risk. What What does the

1074
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,240
science say there? You

1075
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,280
know, when you look at step counts, if

1076
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,880
that was going to be our

1077
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,720
baseline,

1078
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,880
9,800 steps per day can reduce the risks

1079
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,319
of dementia. But what I think is the

1080
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,359
cool part with that is

1081
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:20,359
3,800 steps, you get 50% of the maximal

1082
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,359
benefit.

1083
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,839
So, if you were to, let's just call it

1084
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:32,560
4,000, shoot for 4,000 steps, you're

1085
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,520
going to get a benefit,

1086
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,200
a 50%

1087
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,119
benefit. And some of my favorite

1088
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,880
research on looking at that

1089
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:46,160
population with walking is relationship

1090
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,000
walking. There's really cool studies um

1091
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,960
looking

1092
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,119
at walking in groups for the elderly

1093
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,119
population and how that has a social

1094
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,599
connection and it improves their

1095
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,960
emotional health and it combats

1096
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,119
loneliness and feelings of

1097
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,520
isolation and that is the beauty of a

1098
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,720
walk. Run clubs are getting incredibly

1099
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,000
popular at the moment, aren't they? All

1100
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,119
around the world. Are you seeing more

1101
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,400
and more people come to you as a result

1102
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,319
of that? Yes, I think also um you know

1103
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,359
it was interesting. I was working at the

1104
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,599
running event in Austin, Texas, and I

1105
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,640
was teaching there. And so, a lot of the

1106
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,960
shoe stores were there, and one of the

1107
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,720
bigger shoe stores had said that the

1108
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,319
majority of their clients now are

1109
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,359
actually walkers and not

1110
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,680
runners. And I thought that was pretty

1111
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,960
interesting. And I'm thinking to myself,

1112
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,560
I wonder why that is. Like, are more

1113
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,319
people reverting to walking because

1114
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,760
they're getting injured when they're

1115
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:47,359
running? Are they, you know, I'm making

1116
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,520
all these conclusions in my head. I'm

1117
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,520
like, well, is it because we're going in

1118
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,000
the wrong direction with footwear

1119
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,599
because we're creating this shoe that is

1120
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,680
basically doing the work for us and it

1121
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,560
feels so good and, you know, people

1122
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,480
aren't putting the work in

1123
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,800
anymore. I don't know, but I'm certainly

1124
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,880
going to do my best to change that.

1125
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,760
You brought me a box which I have Yes.

1126
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,200
here in front of me.

1127
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,200
Foot health kit. Yes, that's what it

1128
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,839
says on the front of the box. Um, a foot

1129
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,720
health kit. I mean,

1130
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,480
what is in this box? It's like my little

1131
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,640
like bag of treats. You know, when I

1132
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,640
started doing this, it was funny. Um,

1133
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,760
this is what you give people as a bag of

1134
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,160
treats. That's right. For their

1135
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,800
birthdays and stuff.

1136
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:36,000
I want people to start thinking about

1137
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:40,440
their feet because I I think there's

1138
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,760
such um implications for their health.

1139
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,680
And I wanted to make it easy because

1140
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,760
when we think about all the things we

1141
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,280
need to do to stay healthy, it's like I

1142
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
have to strength train, I have to, you

1143
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,560
know, eat this. I need to V2 max. I need

1144
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,920
my cardiorespiratory fitness. There's a

1145
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:01,680
lot. So, I wanted to make it easy. So I

1146
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,160
um first what one of the things that

1147
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,440
that is in there are toe strengtheners.

1148
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,040
So I'll pull them out the box. So

1149
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,960
those are toe spacers. Toe spacers. Yes.

1150
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,760
So is this all the same thing, right?

1151
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,280
Yes. So these are toe spacers. Correct.

1152
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,040
And then there's this. Yes. What's this?

1153
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,640
Those are toe strengtheners. Toe

1154
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,400
strengtheners. Okay. So that's my toe

1155
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,560
workout. There is this thing, a band.

1156
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,720
And

1157
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:33,599
then there's this ball. Yes. So this is

1158
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,359
like this is my foot gym. That's right.

1159
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,359
Can you show me how this stuff works?

1160
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,720
Absolutely. Okay. So um these are my

1161
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:44,400
feet and these are my ankles. So I had

1162
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,880
planttoitis in I believe it was this

1163
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,400
foot actually and then right now I've

1164
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,240
got a high ankle sprain which is some

1165
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,599
kind of ligament here has been torn and

1166
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,640
they told me that it's torn on all three

1167
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,160
sides. So, I've been in a boot for the

1168
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,200
last couple of weeks, but I've taken it

1169
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,480
off over the last week or two, and I was

1170
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,839
on crutches as well. Um, what are you

1171
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,200
The minute I took my socks off, you

1172
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,480
became fixated on my feet. Yes. What

1173
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,920
What do I need to be thinking about? And

1174
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,599
what can you see just by looking at my

1175
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
feet? You know, when you're looking at

1176
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,960
this foot here, you can start to see

1177
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,240
this little see this little bump here.

1178
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,200
You can start to see bumps on the top of

1179
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,599
the big toe. Mhm. Okay. And the

1180
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,680
diagnosis is a hex limitus or a hex

1181
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,319
rigidus. And basically what that means

1182
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,319
is that you have formed um

1183
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:37,280
arthritis on the top of the toe. So it

1184
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,800
prevents you from getting that full

1185
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,559
range of motion that we need when we

1186
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,839
walk and run. Okay.

1187
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,920
Okay. If the bump goes out to the

1188
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:50,480
side, that's what we call hex valgus.

1189
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,680
That's the bunion. The bunion. Okay.

1190
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,079
Okay.

1191
00:48:51,680 --> 00:49:00,079
So that's what why the foot is a window

1192
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,559
to mechanics because you can see loads

1193
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,280
aarent loads right why is this forming

1194
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,040
here so you know one of the first things

1195
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,559
I want to look at is how much range of

1196
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,839
motion the big toe it's all about the

1197
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,839
big toe when we're walking we put a lot

1198
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,599
of loads and force that go through the

1199
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:22,079
big toe when we walk you should have

1200
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:26,520
about 40 to 45 degrees to walk out of

1201
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:31,920
that big toe. So, here's Eddie. Here's

1202
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:33,520
45 degrees up. Up. Okay. Okay. So, yes.

1203
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,599
So, what I'll want to see is how much

1204
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,440
range of motion. Can you see how he's

1205
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,280
off the ground, though? I want the ball

1206
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,640
of the big toe on the ground.

1207
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
That's a good amount of range. That's

1208
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,079
the first nice thing you've said about

1209
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,599
my feet.

1210
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,599
We're just getting started. I'll find

1211
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,839
something else. And then you want to

1212
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,200
look at toe dexterity. So in other

1213
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:58,640
words, can you isolate your toes? So can

1214
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,559
you lift just your big toe on the right?

1215
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,200
Good.

1216
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,720
And then on the left.

1217
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,960
That's actually quite hard. Like I've

1218
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,160
never had to do that before.

1219
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,079
It's funny because when you'll see

1220
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,160
people that have poor awareness to their

1221
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,640
feet, when they try to lift their toes,

1222
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,640
you'll see them like their hands and

1223
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,400
like your back isn't going to extend

1224
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,720
your toe. Okay. Okay. And then put your

1225
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,240
big toe down and then extend your four

1226
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,160
toes. Yes.

1227
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,040
No, that pinky is not that's not

1228
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:32,240
listening. There you go. And

1229
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,599
here. Okay. And then what I want you to

1230
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,160
do is you're going to lift up all of

1231
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,960
your

1232
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,240
toes and spread

1233
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,520
them. And you can see two, three, and

1234
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,640
four, right? They don't want to spread

1235
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,160
as much. Mhm. Earlier we talked about

1236
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,559
those nuromomas. The nuromomas live

1237
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,520
within the toes here, right? Within

1238
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,200
right in between the toes.

1239
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,640
So if we have issues with nerve problems

1240
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,640
here, you got to be able to spllay.

1241
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:08,559
So you wear vivos. You know, when you

1242
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,040
allow your foot to be in a shoe where

1243
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,599
the feet can actually spllay, you'll

1244
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,359
start to see changes. Mhm. But imagine

1245
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,280
if you, you know, were in a shoe where

1246
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,760
your foot I mean I had a I was at an

1247
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,800
expo working a couple weeks ago and this

1248
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
woman came up to me and she's like,

1249
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,760
"Man, I can't figure out why my foot

1250
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,559
hurts." And I took her shoe off and I'm

1251
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,119
telling you, her foot looked like this.

1252
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,400
It look like a shoe. And I took a

1253
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,240
picture and I showed it to her and I was

1254
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,400
like, "Does your foot look like a foot

1255
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,839
or does it look like a shoe?" We don't

1256
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,400
really know the difference these days.

1257
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,839
No, because remember the widest part of

1258
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,839
the foot should be the toes.

1259
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,200
So that's what we want to look for in

1260
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,880
the front of the foot. We also talked

1261
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,559
about that muscle. What side did you

1262
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:57,040
have the heel pain on?

1263
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,359
I believe it was the right side. So one

1264
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,880
of the things we'll do um and you can

1265
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,040
actually do this at home. You could use

1266
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,640
like a a credit card. So in my office we

1267
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,079
can actually measure that. But if you

1268
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,480
were to do it at home, you just take a

1269
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,000
card and put it underneath the toe.

1270
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,319
Okay. Okay. And make sure you're lined

1271
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,720
up here. Yep. And some people will also

1272
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,240
do that. See how you're like holding

1273
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,240
your leg just the toe. Mhm. And then

1274
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,559
I'll try to pull the card out from under

1275
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,040
you. And I shouldn't be able to do that.

1276
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,880
I should feel some tension.

1277
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,839
And then I'll ask the patient, "Where do

1278
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,119
you feel this? What's

1279
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:38,240
working?" And if they say my hip, my

1280
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,240
quad, it's wrong guy. We're talking

1281
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,040
about the foot. So you should feel that

1282
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,520
in the arch of the foot and maybe into

1283
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,800
the calf.

1284
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,200
Okay. Big toe flexoralis longus. This

1285
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:56,240
guy by the way, this muscle starts over

1286
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,880
here. It's very important to strengthen

1287
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,280
this muscle when you have a history of

1288
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,839
ankle sprains. Starts on the fibula,

1289
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,240
which is the outside of the leg. It

1290
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,640
comes down the foot, crosses under, and

1291
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,000
inserts into the big toe. Then I'm going

1292
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,720
to take the card and I'm going to put it

1293
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,079
underneath the four

1294
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,440
toes. The muscle that we're looking for.

1295
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,920
Yes, that's beautiful. See how you got

1296
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,640
that little See, that's the second comp

1297
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,640
compliment I gave you

1298
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,200
about. I'm going to put this underneath

1299
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,760
your toes.

1300
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,640
Yeah.

1301
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,880
Right. Little. Yep. And then don't let

1302
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,640
me pull the card

1303
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,760
out. And you should feel that in the

1304
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,520
arch of your foot. patients that have

1305
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,960
I'm not really feeling it to be honest.

1306
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,760
I'm not feeling it anymore. Okay. Oh,

1307
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
what? Okay, there you go. Roll the roll

1308
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,520
the bottom of the foot like this. Yes.

1309
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,280
Just wake it up a little bit. There's a

1310
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,359
bunch of receptors on the bottoms of the

1311
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,920
foot. So, when we can't feel things and

1312
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:56,240
it shouldn't surprise us, you know, if

1313
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,760
we've been walking around in footwear

1314
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,559
that compromises the function of the

1315
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,119
foot or we've had injuries, you start to

1316
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,800
lack what we can feel. So, just wake it

1317
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,880
up a little bit. And how long would you

1318
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,520
do that for in the morning?

1319
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,800
60 90 seconds. Do you do this every day?

1320
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,480
Uh, I do. I'll tell you when I like if

1321
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,200
I'm standing at my desk, I'll keep the

1322
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,319
ball there. Okay. When I come back from

1323
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,880
a run, I do this whole little setup. But

1324
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,000
I wear these all day.

1325
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,880
What is that that you're wearing,

1326
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,880
though? So, these are toe spacers. So,

1327
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,200
they do exactly that. They spllay the

1328
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,440
foot. And why are you wearing that?

1329
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,880
Okay. Remember when I was telling you

1330
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,359
about my years of being a ballet dancer?

1331
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,119
Okay. Um, inpoint shoes. Uh, I wore

1332
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,040
orthotics for a long period of time. I

1333
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,760
wore ill-fitting footwear and my foot

1334
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,319
was weak and things hurt. Okay. And we

1335
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,760
talked about why I needed to fix all of

1336
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,119
that. Um, you can

1337
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:57,839
see my bunion here.

1338
00:54:54,119 --> 00:55:02,160
Okay. So, I work on all of this stuff

1339
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:04,960
all the time and toes play is a big part

1340
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,319
of that. So when I have these toe

1341
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,960
spacers

1342
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:14,559
in, they spllay the foot for me. Every

1343
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,680
pair of shoes that I wear um is

1344
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,400
compatible with a toe spacer. Okay. So

1345
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,640
you don't wear any narrow shoes. Yeah.

1346
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,280
Non-negotiable.

1347
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,640
Okay. And this is

1348
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:30,640
important. There is a difference between

1349
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:34,200
a wide toe box and a wide shoe. So

1350
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,800
people will say, "Well, I ordered the

1351
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,839
wide." The width will come

1352
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,160
here. That's where they change the

1353
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,839
width. But if the toes are still

1354
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,480
tapered,

1355
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,200
the width has to extend into where the

1356
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,680
toes are. Mhm. So that's where you got

1357
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,760
to be careful. It's a wide shoe is not a

1358
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,160
wide toe box shoe. And if you try to

1359
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,240
wear these in just a wide shoe, you're

1360
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,240
not going to be comfortable. So if I

1361
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,119
wore this for one year, what promise

1362
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,520
could you make me or what could you tell

1363
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:09,440
me the benefit and the upside would be?

1364
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:12,319
You would definitely see improvement of

1365
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,839
display of your foot. Yeah.

1366
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:19,520
And when you have the tissues the the

1367
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,040
spllay, you can start to improve the

1368
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,319
strength of the foot. And what's

1369
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,400
downstream from strong foot? Go up the

1370
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:28,559
chain. You have better toe strength.

1371
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,559
You're going to build a better platform.

1372
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,960
You're gonna have a jet engine on a jet

1373
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,040
engine. So, your ankle mobility, then

1374
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,799
your knee extension, your hip extension,

1375
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:40,400
because your foot is doing what it was

1376
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:42,720
designed to do, which is be mobile and

1377
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,760
be strong.

1378
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,319
Okay? We need to pay attention. If you

1379
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,640
if things go south from

1380
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:56,319
here, you can expect there to be changes

1381
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,960
up the chain. I see it all the time.

1382
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,640
This one change has transformed how my

1383
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,880
team and I move, train, and think about

1384
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,880
our bodies. When Dr. Daniel Lieberman

1385
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,040
came on the diio, he explained how

1386
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,359
modern shoes with their cushioning and

1387
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,799
support are making our feet weaker and

1388
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,799
less capable of doing what nature

1389
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,720
intended them to do. We've lost the

1390
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,720
natural strength and mobility in our

1391
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,440
feet. And this is leading to issues like

1392
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,760
back pain and knee pain. I'd already

1393
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,280
purchased a pair of Viva barefoot shoes.

1394
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,040
So I showed them to Daniel Lieberman and

1395
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,960
he told me that they were exactly the

1396
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,480
type of shoe that would help me restore

1397
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,000
natural foot movement and rebuild my

1398
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,280
strength. But I think it was planticitis

1399
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,640
that I had where suddenly my feet

1400
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,480
started hurting all the time. And after

1401
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,400
that I decided to start strengthening my

1402
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,839
own foot by using the Vivo Barefoots.

1403
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,200
And research from Liverpool University

1404
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,000
has backed this up. They've shown that

1405
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,359
wearing Vivo Barefoot shoes for 6 months

1406
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,079
can increase foot strength by up to 60%.

1407
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,680
Visit

1408
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:52,960
vivarefoot.com/doac and use code diary

1409
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,240
20 from my sponsor for 20% off. A strong

1410
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,200
body starts with strong feet.

1411
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,400
Is there anything else that we need to

1412
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,359
be aware of? What is what is this other

1413
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,599
stuff here? You've got like toe

1414
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:03,359
strengtheners as well. So before we get

1415
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,040
to those with you know the big toe and

1416
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,960
the four toes, this is when you can use

1417
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,079
that band. Okay. Right. So you just put

1418
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,319
your heel on there. Okay. You grab your

1419
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,319
four

1420
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,720
toes. Right. It's like you're doing a

1421
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,400
bicep curl, but you're doing it with

1422
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,799
your

1423
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,880
toes. And you press into the band. Then

1424
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,200
you lift up and you press it into the

1425
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,480
band. There is research, four sets, 12

1426
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,920
reps. I mean, these are some of the

1427
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,119
things that they work on to improve

1428
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
function of the foot that helps with

1429
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,599
planer fascitis.

1430
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,559
Okay? And then you go around the house

1431
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,040
and you grab the big toe. Keep that ball

1432
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,880
of the big toe on the floor and then

1433
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,880
press.

1434
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Yes.

1435
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,640
Right. And it's it's a good place to

1436
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,040
start. You're building strengths in your

1437
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,559
foot.

1438
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,319
And if you want to if you want to really

1439
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,520
get after it, go for just the little

1440
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,319
guy. Oh my gosh. Little piggy. Let's

1441
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,720
have a look.

1442
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,880
It's really wild because the abductor

1443
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,720
digit, the muscle that abducts the

1444
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
little toe is just as big as the big

1445
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,000
one. And we like just are like, "Oh,

1446
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,440
that toe is just there to, you know, hit

1447
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,520
furniture.

1448
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,799
It stabilizes the outside of the foot.

1449
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,599
What is the difference between someone

1450
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,400
that does this and doesn't do this?

1451
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:26,000
Well, let's start with pain. Yeah, they

1452
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,760
and I I use the word prevent injury.

1453
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,599
That's tough for me. You want to create

1454
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,040
an

1455
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,920
environment where you can have the best

1456
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,880
opportunity for function. Mhm. So when

1457
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,520
people strengthen their foot, they are

1458
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,240
going to have a foundation that's going

1459
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,000
to have resilience to the rest of their

1460
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:50,240
system. This is what we we walk

1461
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,240
on. You cannot um build a jet engine on

1462
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,160
a paper

1463
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,000
airplane. I'm working with a lot of, you

1464
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,440
know, athletes right now are getting

1465
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,599
bigger. They're getting stronger.

1466
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,599
They're getting faster. And if you look

1467
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:05,040
at the rates of injuries at the foot,

1468
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,640
they're going up because we know the

1469
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,960
amount of loads that go through the foot

1470
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,240
when we walk and when we run. So if we

1471
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,760
want to do a bunch of squats and do a

1472
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,319
bunch of deadlifts and do all the sexy

1473
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,079
stuff, but not pay attention to the

1474
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,839
foundation on which we're putting all of

1475
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,040
this on, you're going to run into

1476
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,160
problems. So from a function

1477
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,079
perspective, you're improving your

1478
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,000
function from the ground up. You're

1479
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,240
providing a better environment for your

1480
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,079
body to decrease pain. And when we get

1481
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,000
older, it's, you know, you don't want to

1482
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,680
be chasing your tail with this stuff.

1483
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,720
How does this dovetail into mobility and

1484
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,240
flexibility? Because that's something

1485
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,799
I'm thinking a lot about at the moment.

1486
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,720
Uh I I realize that as I do a lot of

1487
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,280
upper body workouts and stuff like that.

1488
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,880
When you watch me like pick up the

1489
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,359
weights and stuff, put them back down. I

1490
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,760
look like I'm I've got the mobility of

1491
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,520
someone that you would think was double

1492
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:55,680
whed if it a lot of it starts with our

1493
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,000
feet. So, we talked about the big toe.

1494
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,839
When you're

1495
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,680
walking, the big toe has to extend a

1496
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:05,520
certain amount. Okay, I'm going to show

1497
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,119
you here. Okay, so when I'm walking, I

1498
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,839
have to have a certain range of motion

1499
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:12,480
out of my toe. And that gives me range

1500
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:16,400
of motion out of my knee and out of my

1501
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,400
hip. If I cheat the system, so let's say

1502
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,079
this is the only amount of range I have.

1503
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,960
Let's say I have a big toe that's only

1504
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,119
going to extend 20 degrees.

1505
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,760
you're going to

1506
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:30,160
compensate. You might shorten your

1507
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,000
stride. You might take shorter steps.

1508
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,599
You might not get access to hip

1509
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,040
extension because your toe isn't going

1510
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,760
into full extension. So, you will see

1511
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,040
some type of

1512
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,200
compensation. You know, the other one I

1513
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,119
think about is ankle mobility. You know,

1514
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,240
I was listening to one of your podcasts

1515
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,400
and you were talking about

1516
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:53,280
um the story of rafting in Bali, I

1517
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,119
think. Oh yeah. And how you were, you

1518
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,400
know, walking down the stairs and how

1519
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,079
it's something that you want to be able

1520
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,720
to do.

1521
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,760
And I was thinking to myself, I'm like,

1522
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,200
if you were to ask

1523
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,680
someone, if you wanted to continue to be

1524
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,599
able to do that as you age, what would

1525
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,880
you wear?

1526
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:17,839
Probably V2 max. Endurance. Yeah. Your

1527
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,079
hip strength, maybe. Yeah. Right. Your

1528
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:22,640
core strength, your hip mobility. I

1529
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,280
think very few people would say ankle

1530
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,960
mobility and toe strength. But here's

1531
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,920
the

1532
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,480
deal. If you don't have good toe

1533
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,880
strength, where are you going? You could

1534
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,680
be falling. If you don't have good ankle

1535
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,319
mobility, same

1536
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:42,400
thing. So ankle mobility is a big one.

1537
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:45,200
Also, it gives us access when we squat,

1538
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,200
when we go up and down a stair, even

1539
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,880
walking. So what do you mean by ankle

1540
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,480
mobility? Do you mean my ability to go

1541
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,480
like this? This dorsif

1542
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:58,240
flexion. The ankle also plantar flexes

1543
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,040
and it inverts and eververts. But the

1544
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,599
the one I'm talking about when you're

1545
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,880
you know this ankle dorsif flexion is

1546
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,720
something I look at with all of my

1547
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,720
patients.

1548
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,799
And I it's not stood up is it? Sorry,

1549
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,040
it's not sat down. Is it stood up? Like

1550
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,559
you would if you you can do it. You look

1551
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,160
at it seated. Yes. But you want to keep

1552
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,160
that heel on the ground.

1553
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,480
Okay. I mean, that's that's all we've

1554
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,400
got there. Okay. And we're looking for

1555
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,359
about, you

1556
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:31,280
know, between 20

1557
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:32,480
30°, but this range of motion is very

1558
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,880
restricted. Remember the high heel

1559
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,960
conversation. Yeah. You walk around in a

1560
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:40,359
high heel for a long time, ankle dorsif

1561
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,520
flexion is affected.

1562
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:44,960
And what can I do to improve my ankle

1563
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,960
mobility to prevent myself getting

1564
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,280
injured or getting pains or issues with

1565
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,799
my lower leg, upper leg, back?

1566
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,280
Um, you know, I think joints, you have

1567
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:57,599
to look at joints from two perspectives.

1568
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,839
Both mobility and stability. How well

1569
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:04,000
does it move and how well can you

1570
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:07,400
control that motion? Yeah. Right. So you

1571
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,520
can work on static stretching, dynamic

1572
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,079
stretching. The other thing I would be

1573
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,240
looking at here though is the strength

1574
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,680
of one of my favorite muscles, which is

1575
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:21,200
the solius, this big calf muscle back

1576
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:26,680
here. Okay? Because it's the solius,

1577
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:30,400
right, that helps control this motion.

1578
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:32,559
And you know, if you had a seated calf

1579
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,119
raise machine here,

1580
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,599
And we wanted to look at baseline like

1581
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,000
what can you do with your single single

1582
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,559
leg seated calf raise which is this one

1583
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,760
right? Yes.

1584
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,920
The capacity that the solius can produce

1585
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,160
is you it can put eight times your body

1586
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,119
weight going through your forefoot.

1587
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:56,079
That's a

1588
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:58,559
lot. So there was a study that looked at

1589
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:02,720
return to run.

1590
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:05,200
So, um, they were looking at how much

1591
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,359
strength, if you will, can we produce

1592
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,319
out of a seated single leg calf raise?

1593
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:13,680
Yeah. One and a half times your body

1594
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:17,599
weight six times. Well, six reps. Yes.

1595
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,720
Single leg. Okay. So, you would put one

1596
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,400
and a half times your body weight plates

1597
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:26,240
six times. That's a

1598
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,559
lot. If you were to do it standing,

1599
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:32,160
holding half your body weight, six

1600
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:34,559
reps. But we don't train the lower leg

1601
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,200
like we do everywhere else. No.

1602
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,520
Especially men. Yes. And don't care

1603
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,960
about legs. Yeah. It's I always say

1604
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,640
it's, you know, the the machine at the

1605
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,240
gym that should have the longest weight

1606
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,559
line is the seated calf raise machine.

1607
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,760
And it's always open.

1608
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,920
What what do you see the biggest

1609
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,640
mistakes that runners make outside of

1610
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,400
the alphs issue wearing those big

1611
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,200
cushion shoes? Is there a certain way

1612
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,760
that we run that is causing us problems?

1613
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,920
And also it are we running too much

1614
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:08,160
because some people they really get

1615
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:10,640
hooked on running. I mean I love it. I

1616
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,200
think running is one of the best forms

1617
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:15,599
of activity. I think if we wanted to

1618
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,440
keep it very simple overstriding is the

1619
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,960
enemy. Overstriding. Yes. What's an

1620
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,440
overstrike? So, if I'm running, right,

1621
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,200
here's my foot. Yeah. I want my foot to

1622
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,359
strike as close to my center of mass as

1623
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,160
possible. As in as close to your body as

1624
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:32,240
possible. Yes. Okay. So, overstride

1625
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:37,160
would be as if I landed with my foot all

1626
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:41,200
the way out here. Okay. Yes. Got you.

1627
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:44,720
So, our calccanous, this heelbone was

1628
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:48,440
beautifully designed to absorb shock.

1629
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,720
Okay. When I overstride and I can feel

1630
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,880
it, what am I going to do? That's going

1631
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,480
to hurt. So, you're not going to do it

1632
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,160
anymore. You're going to overstride and

1633
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:00,000
be like, "Ah, that hurts." So, I'm going

1634
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,720
to adopt my gate pattern and I might not

1635
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,280
overstride and bring that foot closer to

1636
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,680
me. So, you strike differently. You want

1637
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,280
the foot to hit in line with your body a

1638
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,880
little bit in front of the body. Okay.

1639
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,760
It's the heavy overstride you want to

1640
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,559
avoid. Okay. Okay.

1641
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,119
But if I can't feel

1642
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:21,760
anything, you don't know. That's the the

1643
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,359
more stuff on the shoe. You can

1644
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,319
overstride hot and heavy and because you

1645
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:27,599
have all this cushion there, you're

1646
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,240
like, well, yeah. So, that's, you know,

1647
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,480
the argument of allowing your foot to be

1648
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,240
able to feel things. What about this

1649
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,640
whole thing with gates and stuff?

1650
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,400
Because sometimes when when I was

1651
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,319
videoed from the back and someone in the

1652
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,000
comment section was like, "Your like

1653
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,480
gate is wrong or something." when you

1654
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,960
run Steve. So, I don't know what he

1655
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,079
meant. I didn't say qualifications, so I

1656
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,640
kept it moving. But everybody has a

1657
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,559
certain gate. What is a gate? You have a

1658
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,400
running gate or a walking gate. It's

1659
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,880
just your what happens when your foot

1660
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,039
strikes the ground to the time it hits

1661
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,599
the ground again. So, you have certain

1662
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,920
um stride lengths and step lengths.

1663
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,599
Okay. So, when I'm if you were if we had

1664
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,599
a treadmill here, Yeah. and I would have

1665
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,680
you start running,

1666
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,000
that would be your running gate. I'd be

1667
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,640
looking at you from the back, from the

1668
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,040
side, from the front and seeing what

1669
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,440
happens when your foot hits the ground

1670
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,120
when it comes back up into swing phase.

1671
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,640
What's happening above the foot? So,

1672
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,199
what are your hips doing? What is your

1673
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,279
pelvis doing? So, you're really looking

1674
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:31,120
at the person. And then you're also

1675
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:35,120
looking at, you know, what am I seeing

1676
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:39,359
that I think could be um, you know, a

1677
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:41,759
factor in either pain or poor

1678
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,040
performance.

1679
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,239
And then you see those things and you're

1680
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,159
like, "Okay, let's start working on

1681
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,480
this." But this is the interesting thing

1682
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:49,600
with gate,

1683
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,279
right? Someone will see something and

1684
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,719
they'll say, "Okay, you need to start

1685
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,799
doing calf

1686
01:08:53,719 --> 01:09:01,679
raises." If they also don't

1687
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:04,120
cue gate, right? Or let's work on your

1688
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:06,560
cadence. Let's work on some type of

1689
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,679
skill. Strength and skill light up

1690
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,040
different parts of your

1691
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:13,600
brain. So, you can get really good at

1692
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,679
calf raises and great, but if you want

1693
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,600
to be a good runner, you have to look at

1694
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,279
different things.

1695
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,520
So, what what's the most common issue

1696
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,239
with someone's gates? The overstride.

1697
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:28,319
Overstride. And then also kind of the

1698
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:31,040
crossover. Why is that a bad thing?

1699
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,600
It takes away some of that efficiency.

1700
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,440
So, often times you can see, you know,

1701
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,920
if someone's crossing over, when they

1702
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,600
land, they'll have more of this kind of

1703
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,199
collapse through the extremity. if you

1704
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,040
will. Okay. Okay. We want to control the

1705
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:47,359
foot when it hits the ground. That's why

1706
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,159
the hip conversation, right? The hip

1707
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:53,440
controls what happens at the foot. Are

1708
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:55,840
we supposed to be barefoot?

1709
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,640
We are supposed to let our foot function

1710
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,800
how it was designed. And that is letting

1711
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,960
the foot feel the ground. Now, we live

1712
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,000
on man-made surfaces and we walk around

1713
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,600
on concrete. So, for me to say yes, we

1714
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,360
should all be walking around barefoot.

1715
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,440
That's a conversation that's difficult

1716
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,960
to have.

1717
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:17,440
But the stronger that your foot becomes

1718
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,960
and the more resilient that it becomes,

1719
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,120
you can handle these things a lot

1720
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,600
better. And it makes interacting with

1721
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,199
your environment so much more fun and

1722
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,760
easy.

1723
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:30,239
What are these?

1724
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,840
Okay, my daughter was a rock climber and

1725
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,440
she was up in her room one day and she

1726
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,840
had the bands around her fingers and she

1727
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,040
was like strengthening her hands and I

1728
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,120
was looking at it. I was like, man, I'm

1729
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,199
like, I want one of those for the foot.

1730
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,040
And I'm looking for them and I couldn't

1731
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:46,719
find them. So, I said, well, here we go.

1732
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,640
So, I designed these and they're

1733
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,840
different resistances.

1734
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:54,000
So, it's the same concept as you would

1735
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,239
with your hands. You just put them

1736
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,440
around your toes. Okay. Okay. Give me

1737
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:00,000
the easy one. Which one's easy? That's

1738
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,760
the easy one. Okay. Here we go. Are they

1739
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,280
all the same size, which you need

1740
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,960
different sizes for different size feet?

1741
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,159
Nope. So when your toes

1742
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,080
spllay, you can slide those on a little

1743
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:13,440
easier. My little piggy is completely

1744
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,120
redundant. It's doing nothing. It feels

1745
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,159
like it feels like it's disabled. Well,

1746
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,520
we're going to change that. Okay. Yeah.

1747
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:22,960
So when you lift up all your

1748
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:26,880
toes, try to get your big toe to touch

1749
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,400
my finger. Yes. That's abductoralysis.

1750
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,400
That's this muscle right here. So people

1751
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,880
that have like bunions, it's like just

1752
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,480
strengthen that muscle. Right. So you

1753
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:38,280
that guy goes in and you hold right

1754
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,719
there. So now you're

1755
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,760
strengthening inside of the foot. You're

1756
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:46,080
strengthening the muscles

1757
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,840
inside the arch of the foot. If you can

1758
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,840
get that little guy to go out, you're

1759
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,920
going to strengthen this guy. So you're

1760
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,800
just going to lift all your toes. Good.

1761
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,280
And then spread reach him forward. Try

1762
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,679
to keep the tripod of the foot, though.

1763
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,159
Okay. So I'm trying to lift all your

1764
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:05,560
toes, but keep that tripod. One to

1765
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:07,719
center of the heel. So, lift.

1766
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:10,239
Yes. Yes.

1767
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:14,040
Yes. And split. Yes. Now, press those

1768
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:19,040
toes to the ground as you spread them.

1769
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:21,280
Lift. Spread. Reach. Oh, that's pretty.

1770
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,920
Thank you.

1771
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,520
Okay. So, and that gets you've got ones

1772
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,520
that get incrementally harder. So, this

1773
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,920
would be harder. This would be hardest.

1774
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,679
Okay. So, we're doing like 30 40 reps a

1775
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,800
day. That's how you'll know someone

1776
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,159
needs to work on this because they can't

1777
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,440
keep those points. So they're kind of

1778
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:41,040
like it looks like their foot's on an

1779
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:43,120
ice skate. Yeah. So that's the front of

1780
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,800
the foot. Yeah.

1781
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,199
When you get into this part of the foot,

1782
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,199
the rear

1783
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,080
foot, there's certain things you want to

1784
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,640
pay attention to.

1785
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:59,120
We already talked about mobility at the

1786
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:01,520
ankle, but you also want to look at what

1787
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,280
happens when that heel comes off the

1788
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,840
ground because this is when all the

1789
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,760
magic happens because the foot engages.

1790
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,920
The intrinsic muscles engage. It's

1791
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,320
basically like I'm getting ready to to

1792
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,920
propel

1793
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:16,719
forward. So, there's certain muscles

1794
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,640
that you want to have some good capacity

1795
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,120
to be able to get your foot in this

1796
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,280
ready position.

1797
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,239
So two we can talk about is one that

1798
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,239
runs along the inside

1799
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,880
and then this is posterior tibialis one

1800
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,880
of the very big stabilizers of the arch

1801
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,400
of the

1802
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:40,800
foot and his best friend which is the

1803
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:44,520
solius. Those guys help do this to the

1804
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:49,280
foot help invert the foot.

1805
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:50,440
Okay. So go ahead and stand up for me.

1806
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,480
Put your foot in

1807
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:55,600
here. I'm going to put this around your

1808
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,800
ankles. Oh,

1809
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,480
there you go. Okay. Spread your feet a

1810
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,120
little

1811
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:05,320
bit. Toes pointing straight

1812
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:08,199
ahead. Which, by the

1813
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:11,280
way, we want to talk about

1814
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:13,520
gates. When I'm moving from point A to

1815
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,000
point B, my feet should also look like

1816
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,560
they're moving in this direction. If

1817
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,719
someone's walking like this with their

1818
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,880
feet pointed out, correct? Yeah. I want

1819
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:26,719
to know why,

1820
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:30,719
do they have a a bone in their lower leg

1821
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:31,960
that's rotated out, which could happen,

1822
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,159
but if

1823
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,560
not, you don't get to you don't get to

1824
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,560
walk like

1825
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,199
that. So, we want the toes pointing

1826
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,520
straight ahead as long as there's no

1827
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:45,239
compromise

1828
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:48,400
structurally. Okay. Okay.

1829
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:50,320
So, what I want you to do here is you're

1830
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,159
going to keep the ball of the foot on

1831
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,080
the floor

1832
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,600
and I want you to drive your ankles

1833
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,120
almost like you were going to sprain

1834
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,679
your ankle. Right? So, you're going to

1835
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,880
push into that

1836
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:03,280
range out. So, you're going to take your

1837
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,880
ankles and drive them into the band.

1838
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,280
Into the band. Yep. Watch right

1839
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,520
here. Okay. So,

1840
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,280
here. This way.

1841
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,760
Yes. Now, keep that big toe on the

1842
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,760
ground.

1843
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:22,400
Yes. See, there's your other compliment.

1844
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,800
That didn't sound like a compliment.

1845
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,440
But what you should feel here is that

1846
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,679
when you increase the arch of the foot,

1847
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,800
you should feel it also in the hips. I

1848
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,080
feel like I just don't have an arch in

1849
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,400
my foot. I don't know. It's weird. I

1850
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,880
don't feel like I can. How about this?

1851
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,400
Put your hands on your chest. Rotate to

1852
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,440
your left as far as you can. Keep your

1853
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,960
feet on the ground. See, that's pretty.

1854
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,840
See that arch?

1855
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:50,640
Yes. Now go this way. So that's another

1856
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,880
way to work on how the foot feels

1857
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:57,280
because the foot should change shape. It

1858
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:59,440
should lower and it should increase the

1859
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,480
arch. So you recommend people do these

1860
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,000
types of exercise frequently. Oh yeah. I

1861
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,280
mean you're standing at your desk, you

1862
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,199
know, here's your movement break. You

1863
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:12,159
rotate 20 times. Let your foot change

1864
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:14,880
shape.

1865
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:16,560
Do your toe yoga. Big toe, four toes.

1866
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,880
Lift all your toes, spread them, and

1867
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,880
reach them forward.

1868
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,600
[Music]

1869
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,719
My physio gave me a towel and he put it

1870
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,400
on the floor and he said I have to like

1871
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,480
grab it and pull it up and grab it and

1872
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,800
pull it up as part of my recovery from

1873
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,320
my injury. Have you do you do you ever

1874
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,239
tell people to do that? You know that

1875
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,440
towel thing where you grab I don't. You

1876
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,880
don't. What?

1877
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,440
I don't want to get anybody in trouble

1878
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:46,000
here. No. Call them out. Okay. When do

1879
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:48,640
you ever do this? Never. Correct. So

1880
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,840
unless you were, you know, and maybe in

1881
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,960
your initial phases of rehab, where you

1882
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,600
are just trying to wake up the foot, you

1883
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,440
want to, you know, towel scrunch, pick

1884
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,159
up marbles like they, you know, that's a

1885
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:05,440
very common foot exercise.

1886
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:07,280
But from a functional perspective,

1887
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,199
that never happens in the gate cycle.

1888
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,239
When you're walking and you're running,

1889
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:14,480
your toes never do this or they

1890
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:17,040
shouldn't. Most people when their foot

1891
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,199
is weak, that's one of the biggest

1892
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,760
compens compensations that you will see.

1893
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:24,320
They toe grip. You'll see them walking

1894
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,280
and it's like, you know, they start

1895
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,640
gripping the ground because they feet

1896
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,920
are weak. Feet are weak to compensate

1897
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,360
for something. Yes. Okay. I made the

1898
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,000
biggest investment I've ever made in a

1899
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:38,080
company because of my girlfriend. I came

1900
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,080
home one night and my lovely girlfriend

1901
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,840
was up at 1:00 a.m. in the morning

1902
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:45,120
pulling her hair out as she tried to

1903
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:47,199
piece together her own online store for

1904
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,040
her business. And in that moment, I

1905
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,920
remembered an email I'd had from a guy

1906
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,159
called John, the founder of Stanto, our

1907
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,239
new sponsor and a company I've invested

1908
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,920
incredibly heavily in. And Stanto helps

1909
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,760
creators to sell digital products,

1910
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,159
courses, coaching, and memberships all

1911
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,719
through a simple customizable link in

1912
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,320
bio system. and it handles everything.

1913
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,800
Payments, bookings, emails, community

1914
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,800
engagement, and even links with Shopify.

1915
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,400
And I believe in it so much that I'm

1916
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,920
going to launch a Stan challenge. And as

1917
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,040
part of this challenge, I'm going to

1918
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,400
give away $100,000 to one of you. If you

1919
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,920
want to take part in this challenge, if

1920
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,760
you want to monetize the knowledge that

1921
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,560
you have, visit

1922
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,960
stevenbartlet.stan.store to sign up. And

1923
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,280
you'll also get an extended 30-day free

1924
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,199
trial of Stanto if you use that link.

1925
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,280
Your next move could quite frankly

1926
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,360
change everything. Make sure you keep

1927
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,520
what I'm about to say to yourself. I'm

1928
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,520
inviting 10,000 of you to come even

1929
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,800
deeper into the diary of a CEO. Welcome

1930
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,320
to my inner circle. This is a brand new

1931
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,920
private community that I'm launching to

1932
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,320
the world. We have so many incredible

1933
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,159
things that happen that you are never

1934
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,360
shown. We have the briefs that are on my

1935
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,360
iPad when I'm recording the

1936
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,960
conversation. We have clips we've never

1937
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,480
released. We have behind the-scenes

1938
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,800
conversations with the guests and also

1939
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:04,080
the episodes that we've never ever

1940
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,840
released and so much more. In the

1941
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,360
circle, you'll have direct access to me.

1942
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,199
You can tell us what you want this show

1943
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,640
to be, who you want us to interview, and

1944
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,360
the types of conversations you would

1945
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,360
love us to have. But remember, for now,

1946
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,520
we're only inviting the first 10,000

1947
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,800
people that join before it closes. So,

1948
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,080
if you want to join our private closed

1949
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,199
community, head to the link in the

1950
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,199
description below or go to

1951
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,199
daccircle.com.

1952
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,440
I will speak to you then.

1953
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,760
Do you wear socks? Uh, I do not wear

1954
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:40,800
socks. Why? I just haven't found any

1955
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:43,520
that I, you know, love. My second and

1956
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,960
third toes, personal information here.

1957
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:49,840
Mhm. Are webbed. So, basically, there's

1958
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:53,440
skin that comes up in between two and

1959
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,440
three. Mhm. So, as far as socks are

1960
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:58,199
concerned, most of the socks out there,

1961
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,480
like if you look at a compression

1962
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:03,280
sock, when someone puts it on their

1963
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,040
foot, it literally like with my bunion,

1964
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,360
you'll see my foot look like this

1965
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,239
because it's just suctioning my foot

1966
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,360
together and it's so uncomfortable.

1967
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:15,760
So, my option would be a toe sock.

1968
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,679
Mhm. So, a sock that you know just fits

1969
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,600
over your toes. But because my toes are

1970
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,560
webbed, I can't wear them. What what do

1971
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,000
you think is the most important thing

1972
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,199
that we haven't talked about yet that we

1973
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,880
should have talked about as it relates

1974
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:28,960
to foot health and everything downstream

1975
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,840
from foot health?

1976
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,320
I mean I think you know big picture like

1977
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:38,159
what I hope to do like my passion is to

1978
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:41,199
bring awareness to the foot because when

1979
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:43,280
we start doing that and we pay attention

1980
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:46,239
from getting stronger from the ground up

1981
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,400
things life gets easier and I mean that

1982
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,960
not just physically but just like we

1983
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,920
talked about wellness because you're

1984
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,400
able to move and get out there and walk

1985
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:58,719
and run and move like you want to. So

1986
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,040
that's kind of the big the big picture

1987
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,719
here. I think we talked about the

1988
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,440
importance of foot strength and foot

1989
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,120
mobility and driving home the importance

1990
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,360
of

1991
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,800
footwear. I think the

1992
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:15,199
biggest, you know, or maybe the lowest

1993
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:17,440
hanging fruit for people is if this kind

1994
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:19,040
of work seems overwhelming like I have

1995
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:21,760
to strengthen my toe and do all this

1996
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:24,239
stuff, just wear a shoe where your foot

1997
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:27,040
can feel the ground and your foot can be

1998
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:29,199
in its functional position. start there

1999
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,120
because the research will tell you just

2000
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,320
doing

2001
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,560
that you will start to improve the

2002
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:38,080
strength of your

2003
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:40,960
foot and I think that's that's key and

2004
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,080
start small transition. It's so

2005
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,800
interesting listening to so many of

2006
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,679
these um the comments from some of your

2007
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,000
previous work, people of all ages, but

2008
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:52,880
often people that are slightly older

2009
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,320
talking about how transformative finding

2010
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,199
out more information about their feet

2011
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,960
has been and changing their footwear in

2012
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,320
particular.

2013
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,600
Reading this one comment here from this

2014
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:07,600
guy says he's 65 years old and when he

2015
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:10,159
discovered the zero drop wide box toe

2016
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,719
shoes, he lost all the pain in his feet,

2017
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:16,600
ankles, knees, and hips within a couple

2018
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:19,360
of months. I hear it all the

2019
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:22,639
time. I hear it all the time. And it's

2020
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:25,320
it seems so counterintuitive to us

2021
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:29,199
because I think we've been, you know,

2022
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:31,440
trained to think that our foot needs

2023
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:34,159
stuff. It needs support. It needs

2024
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,159
cushion. It needs spring. And that

2025
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:38,560
changes the dynamics of how your foot

2026
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:41,040
interfaces with the ground. So when you

2027
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:44,159
bring it back to what it was designed to

2028
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,239
do, those comments you'll hear you will

2029
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,840
hear all the

2030
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:50,639
time. And it's it's a wonderful thing.

2031
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,520
It's literally why I do this. Is there

2032
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,840
anything else we should have talked

2033
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,760
about that we didn't that you think is

2034
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,040
pertinent to anyone that's trying to get

2035
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,600
control of um their foot health? I mean,

2036
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:04,320
I think, you know, I just want to make

2037
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,159
sure the we highlight the conversation

2038
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,960
of transition because I think that's

2039
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:11,520
where we lose people is this when people

2040
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,880
listen to this, there's bells going off

2041
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,719
in their brains going, man, this makes

2042
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,400
sense. This makes sense. They want to go

2043
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,880
home, burn all their shoes, and like go

2044
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,159
buy a pair of barefoot shoes and call it

2045
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,800
a day. You got to earn your right. So,

2046
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:27,679
there has to be that transition. There

2047
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:31,000
has to be that I'm going to step. I'm

2048
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:33,840
going to build. I'm going to have a shoe

2049
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,320
spectrum. And that that conversation of

2050
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,960
a shoe spectrum, there's a time and a

2051
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,199
place. You have your workhorse shoe. You

2052
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,719
have your cheat

2053
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:47,040
shoe. And you know when to wear what.

2054
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,880
Where am I now? I'm I think I'm in the

2055
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,400
workhorse shoe. I'm trying not to wear

2056
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,480
any cushion shoes as much as I possibly

2057
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,000
can. Well, when you think about it with

2058
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,280
ankle sprains, this is what I find

2059
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,360
fascinating,

2060
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,840
right? When that thing heals, when your

2061
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,040
ankle

2062
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,159
heals and you say, "Well, I'm going to

2063
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:07,280
go into a cushion

2064
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:10,159
shoe." Some of these shoes are getting

2065
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,679
getting high. Mhm. So you put the sole

2066
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:15,760
of your foot on a shoe that has a high

2067
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:18,159
cushion. You see the distance you have

2068
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,960
from your foot to the ground. Yeah. So

2069
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:22,880
let's say you step on a rock and you

2070
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,159
have poor propriception because your

2071
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,000
foot can't feel real well because you

2072
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,000
have a history of ankle sprains and you

2073
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,199
step on a rock and you have this far to

2074
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,719
go. Where do you think that ankle's

2075
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:33,040
gone?

2076
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,440
So my ankle sprain patients, I want them

2077
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:39,120
close to the ground. I want them to

2078
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,560
feel right. Right. So, it's it's pretty

2079
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,120
wild when people are like, I want to

2080
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,480
wear, you know, all this

2081
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,480
stuff, you know, hiking boots. Another

2082
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:52,239
conversation. What's wrong with hiking

2083
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:54,480
boots? Well, people will say, "I need a

2084
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,800
hiking boot cuz I I want my ankles to

2085
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:59,920
feel

2086
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:02,320
stable, and that's not what they do. It

2087
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,400
might be a and there will be research

2088
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,239
coming out on this. When you wear a

2089
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,719
hiking boot, it's like a neurological

2090
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,239
hug. It kind of feels like, you know,

2091
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,760
I'm gonna have this thing around my

2092
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:14,360
ankle. It's going to protect me. It's

2093
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,880
going to protect me. It

2094
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:20,239
doesn't. And when you walk down a

2095
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,960
mountain, this foot has to do, remember

2096
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:24,159
we talked about this, ankle dorsif

2097
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,560
flexion. If you have something that's

2098
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,120
going to restrict ankle dorsif flexion,

2099
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,199
you have transfer

2100
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:36,159
loads. So, you end up transferring load

2101
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:37,600
to the knee. Mhm. So, you know, when my

2102
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,679
patients say to me, "I need a hiking

2103
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,040
boot." I say to them, listen, why don't

2104
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:45,000
we just work on getting your ankle more

2105
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:48,639
stable, improving your

2106
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,280
mobility. So then you won't need to feel

2107
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,320
like you need this thing around your

2108
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:56,800
ankle and that takes

2109
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:58,719
time, but in the long run. Is there an

2110
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,080
issue if I'm wearing the barefoot shoes

2111
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,840
at the moment and then I start wearing

2112
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,480
like football boots again or I think you

2113
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,480
guys call them cleats? Yeah. Is there

2114
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,560
chance of me getting injured because I

2115
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:12,239
spent so long in the barefoot shoes. Now

2116
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,760
I'm No, it's Sometimes you can't do

2117
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:16,560
anything about the environment of the

2118
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:20,159
shoe. So, think of a cleat, um an ice

2119
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:23,560
skate, a ski boot. There's certain um

2120
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:26,560
you know, sports that require the

2121
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,960
stiffness. And so when you pay attention

2122
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,239
to your foot

2123
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:34,000
health and then you put that foot in the

2124
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:35,440
cleat, you just make sure that when you

2125
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,880
get your foot out of the cleat, you do

2126
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,480
all the stuff. You take that kit, you

2127
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,960
roll the bottom of the foot. When I get

2128
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,239
out of my cycling

2129
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,800
shoes, even though they are wider now,

2130
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:47,000
they have wide toe box cycling shoes.

2131
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,239
I'm always doing stuff for my

2132
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,840
foot because it's a the cleat is an

2133
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:55,280
environment for the sport. So, you know,

2134
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,280
you pay attention before and you pay

2135
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,480
attention after. Courtney, we have a

2136
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,600
closing tradition on this podcast where

2137
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,480
the last guest leaves a question for the

2138
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,639
next guest, not knowing who they're

2139
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:05,360
going to be leaving it for. And the

2140
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:07,199
question that has been left for you Oh,

2141
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,159
this is going to be good, huh? It is a

2142
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:13,360
good one. What do you fear you will most

2143
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:16,400
likely regret 10 years from now?

2144
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,440
This is a battle that I have um in my

2145
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:21,639
head pretty much all the time. I love my

2146
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:25,120
work so much. It

2147
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:27,199
is it's just the reason that I feel that

2148
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,719
you know there's so much I want to do.

2149
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:31,199
There's so much I want to learn. There's

2150
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:34,159
so many ways I want to help people. Um

2151
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:38,360
and I work a lot but I don't look at it

2152
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:41,239
as work. I I enjoy it.

2153
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:44,840
Um, but I I'm also a

2154
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:47,159
mother and I need

2155
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,960
to find

2156
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:53,440
that work life balance where I I don't

2157
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:57,520
want to fear in 10 years that I look

2158
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:59,120
back and said, "Man, I worked a lot, but

2159
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,239
I really wished I would have gone to her

2160
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:06,560
soccer game."

2161
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:08,040
So, I've created this life for me where

2162
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,639
I can

2163
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:12,880
say, "I'm not going to do that. I'm

2164
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,400
going to her soccer game." And she gets

2165
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,760
mad at me all the time, but I tell her,

2166
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,760
I'm like, "This is what happens when you

2167
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,760
own your own business." She's like,

2168
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,840
"Mom, quit saying that." I mean, she

2169
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,800
knows I work my ass off, but at the same

2170
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:27,440
time, she also knows that I can drop

2171
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,719
anything and go be there for her at any

2172
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,840
time.

2173
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:33,760
And so that's what I really want to work

2174
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,239
on and make sure that in 10 years I

2175
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:39,280
don't look back and say,

2176
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:40,719
"Gosh, I missed some of that."

2177
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,880
As I'm often told, you don't get that

2178
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,560
time back either, do you? So yeah, it's

2179
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,280
not something that's very easy to

2180
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,040
correct. Yeah. Courtney, thank you so

2181
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,000
much for doing what you're doing. I I'm

2182
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,280
very much looking forward to your book

2183
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,080
because it's been a bit of a black box,

2184
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:58,000
I think, my feet, my foot health. um up

2185
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,199
until more recently when I discovered

2186
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,880
your work, but also just from this

2187
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:03,679
conversation today. It feels like I now

2188
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,719
have a better understanding of how this

2189
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,639
thing that I thought was largely

2190
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:10,000
irrelevant is having a big downstream

2191
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:11,520
impact on a bunch of things that I

2192
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
really really care about. But also,

2193
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,440
maybe most importantly, is just having a

2194
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,679
set of actions that I can take on a

2195
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,440
daily basis, on a weekly basis to

2196
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,880
prevent finding myself in a situation

2197
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,320
where I'm older and I fall or where I

2198
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,639
lose my mobility or movement or the

2199
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,159
meaning in my life because I have

2200
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:29,280
something wrong with my

2201
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:30,960
foundations. Hopefully, next time we see

2202
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,320
each other, I will have the strongest

2203
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,760
feet you've ever seen. I was just

2204
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,120
thinking the next time we see each

2205
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,600
other, there's going to be so many more

2206
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:40,239
compliments. On my feet. On your feet.

2207
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,600
Yeah. One can only hope. Courtney, thank

2208
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:45,080
you so much. Thank you so much. An

2209
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,080
honor. Thank you.

2210
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,440
This has always blown my mind a little

2211
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,600
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

2212
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,440
regularly haven't yet subscribe to the

2213
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,560
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?

2214
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,000
If you like the show and you like what

2215
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,679
we do here and you want to support us,

2216
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,520
the free simple way that you can do just

2217
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:01,199
that is by hitting the subscribe button.

2218
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,719
And my commitment to you is if you do

2219
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,400
that, then I'll do everything in my

2220
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,320
power, me and my team, to make sure that

2221
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,159
this show is better for you every single

2222
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,600
week. We'll listen to your feedback.

2223
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,360
We'll find the guest that you want me to

2224
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:15,400
speak to and we'll continue to do what

2225
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,400
we do. Thank you so much.
