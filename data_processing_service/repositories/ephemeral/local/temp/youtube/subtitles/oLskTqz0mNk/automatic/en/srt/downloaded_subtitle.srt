00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,279
Hello friends, welcome all of you

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,280
Ranveer at the show. Let's start this

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,759
Interesting journey. Ok. Crisper Biggins

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
Curing Genetic Disorders. tell me sir

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
What is Crisper? CRISPR is a genetic

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,279
Editing is technology. If you have a child

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
Do you want him to grow up to be 6 feet tall?

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000
Make it 6 inches. If she has brown eyes then you

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,279
You can enter that code in it. you can have any

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,519
Designer characteristics that you want.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,520
Do You Think Human Cloning Is Reality

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,520
will it be made? It can be made even today. Technology is

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,360
It is available. I took Ranveer's DNA

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
Took it. For example, I stole every single hair

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
I did it. From that I got your DNA

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,320
Extracted it. So I am Ranveer's new

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,800
I can make a clone. Wow!

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
When we say that AI will cause loss of

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,440
Jobs and Substitution of Jobs. this is a

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,719
Very real. We are there now. Today's India

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,559
The entire IT industry is about to collapse.

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,640
There is a chip that we put inside our brain

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,280
with the outside world

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,199
will be connected and we will connect them with our thoughts

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,040
Will be able to control. what do you think

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,040
Will this become an actual reality by 20-30?

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
AI companions pass during test for

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
Emotional bonding. it will have emotions just

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
Like humans. You ain't got no wife

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
For example. So you adopted a robot

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,600
Then that robot will be able to emote just

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Like human. Wow. artificially if you

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,759
Will make your children super intelligent

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
it's gonna cause a buffercation of the human

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,640
Rest in Super Intelligent Super Rich People

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,640
And poor people who are left behind.

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
This is the one with Abhijeet Chawla and Ranveer

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,600
The combination is legendary. But this

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
What I will say about this episode is that this

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Is one of the most mind blowing episodes.

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,200
We enjoyed a lot. uh let's record this

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,759
Time. I am sure you will enjoy it while

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,520
You listen. If you are also in future regime

44
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
Do you have interest? If you want to know that

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
What will happen because of AI? what after that

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
will be?

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,960
How will our life be? if you

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,159
If you like shows like Black Mirror then you

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,399
will enjoy this future special v abhijeet

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,399
Chavda on DRS.

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:21,809
[music]

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
We have been planning this podcast for several years.

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
I have done it. but today we are executing

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,080
Upon it. Futurism. it's called futurism

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,720
Are. Let's talk about futurism. Yes.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,280
Today we will talk about futurism.

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,080
That means it is a bit tech oriented

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,800
It is a podcast but there will be an element of cleaning,

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,200
The element of science will remain and that of the future

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
The element will remain. The way AI has changed the world

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,879
changed it in the same way many new ones

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:02,480
Technologies are coming that will transform the world into every

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:05,200
Will change in 5 year chapter. We are Sir today

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
What do you think about the podcast episode?

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,159
Would you like to give a preview to the audience? See

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,640
We will see in five years' time.

67
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,360
What new technologies may come? We

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
AI has been asked what it thinks

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
The next five years are going to be next

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
five years in the next five years and every

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,760
How much will we review the prediction

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,519
Is it accurate and how timely is it? is this

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,239
It could be sooner than that or it could take some more time

74
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,920
It will be repeated and so on. gave a tremendous output

75
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,400
we have chat gpt and parallelly i have

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Also got chat gpt in my hand. Ahhh

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
Wherever we both get stuck,

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
Respect to Some Technology We Will

79
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,640
Reference Chat GPT. Good idea. that ah

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
Advancement in the subject of flying cars

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,239
What is? Advancements in Nano-bots

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,959
What is it? And so on. so we will use

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,159
The Help of AI. So this is TRS's first

84
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,560
Episodes where there is Actively One and a Half Guest

85
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,920
I am sitting. one guest in front of me which

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,959
Is ac. And I have half a guess on my phone. in

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,640
The Form of Chat GBT. Ok. ahh, you want to

88
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,200
Talk about the prompt we gave? We

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
What was the prompt given to Ah Chat GBT?

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,519
ah please predict the technologies

91
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,720
that could emerge in the future in the eight five

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,400
Year intervals till under 2,000, right?

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,880
2,200, 200. Yes. Which is very far away. but came

94
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,919
think it's important to know these concepts

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,160
because I promise you if your business

96
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,240
ambitions in life or if you just

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
If you want mental stimulation, you will gain a

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,520
Lot from this episode. Ok? so lets

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,479
begin sir at 2025 which is now which is

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Now AI can be used as pilot in vehicles

101
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,080
Revolutionised Transport and Crisper

102
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Begins curing genetic disorders

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,320
AI Copilots in Vehicles Revolution

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Transport I Think I'm Talking About Tesla

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,840
style tesla style auto driving a

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,440
cars are still in countries like the US where

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
But there are very good traffic rules

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
We already have self driving there

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,320
Cars have software inside them, earn it!

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,720
access to the and to the visual aids so that

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,560
The car can drive itself. we are

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't think it is legal to drive here

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,240
it like that but that technology has arrived

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
Is. so i think it's gonna be implemented

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,800
Now so AI copilot so you sit you AI

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,800
Brother, tell me if I want to go to this place

117
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
He will take you along so we are almost there

118
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Right Now or So That It Makes Sense to AI

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
Pilot do you think it will be possible in India.

120
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
It is a bit challenging in India because India

121
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,199
There are no traffic rules. No one in India

122
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,639
He keeps doing anything. So AI will have to

123
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
Do Vai Defensive Driving. if in india

124
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,440
if it has to be implemented then and for this reason

125
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,240
Because of road conditions are also a problem

126
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,160
Is. So it is a bit challenging in India

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
Implement it at least at this time. Edge

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Far as I know. When you're now in a Tesla

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
When you sit, there is a screen in the middle.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Software updates for more Tesla cars

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,479
It keeps happening. One of the recent updates

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Aloud mapping of the near surroundings. i.e

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,960
that when you're actually driving a Tesla

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,960
If a truck is going in front of you, your

135
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,240
Tesla is able to understand that truck is

136
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,319
in front and that's not on the screen but a truck

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
The image appears. it can also

138
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
Identify people. it can also identify

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
Those who live in western countries

140
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
na chote road pe which doesn't allow you to go

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
On that. So technology has reached your place

142
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,639
You get that 3D imagery in real time

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,360
It goes around you. I am sure it is

144
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,680
Using the Same Imagery to Facilitate the Self

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Driving. Absolutely yes. so it's like

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
A LiDAR like system of the radar mapping type

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
He knows what is in front of him. So

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
According to that he creates the whole imagery

149
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,880
Is. And that is what you use it for

150
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,759
Navigate. same i don't know how it would do it

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,639
On Indian Roads. because because indian

152
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,319
The conditions are evolving very fast and you

153
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,160
Predictive

154
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080
Can't analyze what's next

155
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,039
It is going to happen. Suddenly someone ahead on the road

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,120
From Against the Rules. so i think india

157
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,680
It will happen eventually in me too. May B and

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,680
It will take three, four, maybe five years. But

159
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,520
Eventually the technology will grow to such an extent that

160
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
It can run autonomously in India too

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,280
To the vehicles. We

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,960
Suppose this is the situation of an autonomous vehicle

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,840
actually

164
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,800
It became real. Yes.

165
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,599
that's a very simple way of a lot of people

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,880
Losing their jobs. A lot of people who are on Uber

167
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,720
there are drivers who are taxi drivers,

168
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,759
those who are rickshaw drivers, they will have to

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,319
Look for other occupations. Yes. So when we

170
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
Says AI will cause loss of jobs and

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,560
Substitution of Jobs. this is a very

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,240
Real. We are there now. We are already there.

173
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,160
In 10-15 years. No, today India has five

174
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,680
The entire IT industry is about to collapse.

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Let us tell you, there are AI agents. AI

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,400
Agent means it's an AI system that

177
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,880
He has all these competencies. From the lates I've

178
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,720
Requirements for an AI Agent

179
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,919
gave the document and a dis document

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,919
of the given software. He will read it and his

181
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,240
Use whatever skill sets he has

182
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,039
He will make the software and give it to you. He

183
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,520
An AI agent who is a programmer. Now

184
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,479
We will give its output to another AI agent.

185
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,720
Who is the tester? He will do the unit testing.

186
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,280
will do regression testing and whatever else

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
He got the bugs back from the programming agent

188
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,199
Will give it to. Programming agents, all that.

189
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
It will appear and solve the bugs. Back

190
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
Testing will be done. once everything is

191
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,319
Approved. You give it to the client. Where

192
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,319
But is your human programmer in this? Where

193
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,720
But do you have a human tester in this? India

194
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,960
The entire IT industry could be destroyed by this

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
Is. So we are almost already there today.

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,760
All the entrepreneurs we have nowadays are like me

197
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's all talk about AI agents

198
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I am talking to you. g a agent word meaning

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,160
What? AI Agent is the simplest definition of this

200
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,240
That's it, he's one of your AI employees. Yours

201
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
You hired a programmer. For

202
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,440
A skill set that an example programmer has

203
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,320
Is. He knows these programming languages

204
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
Are. Take the design document to him

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,920
I know how to code. Doing Unit Testing

206
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,200
It comes. he can communicate with testing

207
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,680
Employees and so on. AI Agent One

208
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,080
The software is your employee. AI Enabled

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
Employee That's the Simplest Definition

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,480
of the AI ​​agent. Ok. a little

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Experiment. Yes absolutely. Ok. Hey

212
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,360
chat gpt can you tell me when

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,600
There won't be a requirement for any Uber

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:30,240
Taxi drivers because self driving

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,120
Wood may have become an automated job in the future

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,160
As These Cars in the Future Will Be Driven

217
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,800
Bye AI bots. There for Uber drivers

218
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,320
I don't have a job to do. Realistically

219
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
according to you when you predict that

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
That is a reality. Self-driving tech

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
already exists and is operational in

222
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,399
LIMITED CONDITIONS. Google is a company

223
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,800
VMO Fully Driverless Robotaxi Services

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,839
in Phoenix Arizona and San Francisco

225
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Cruise by General Motors doing same till

226
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,920
Regulatory issues paused it Tesla made a full

227
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,760
Self-driving service has been tested.

228
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,720
It's in beta but requires humans

229
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
Supervision Realistic Global Timeline

230
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Breakdown

231
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,800
2027 to 2029 Dubai San Francisco

232
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,839
Fully autonomous Uber like in Singapore

233
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:23,440
Flats in certain areas by 2030 to 35

234
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,800
Wherever there are developed cities there will be autonomous

235
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,040
Driving will happen Driver job loss begins at

236
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
Scale in Places Like California UAE

237
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,920
and parts of china by 204 40 majority

238
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,399
of Uber rides in first world urban

239
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,399
Areas will be autonomous.

240
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,880
Developing countries like India, Brazil,

241
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,800
Africa Will Still Rely on Humans

242
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,440
Drivers because of bad infrastructure,

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Legal Issues and Affordability

244
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,120
But by 20-50 most global urban rights

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Will be autonomous. Hmm. Manual Driving

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Becomes a niche and luxury experience.

247
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,480
Uber driver as a job could vanish in urban areas

248
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Zons. That is to say, 25 years

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
I will lose jobs. Look at India like

250
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,320
what happens in the country that we have taxi

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
Driver unions who are in politics

252
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,760
Politics also comes into play. so because of

253
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
politics in because of these unions you may

254
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Have delays in these things. but i think by

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
20-40 in any reasonable country you will have

256
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Autonomous drivers. Perhaps this is a developed

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
There will also be a country sign. Yes absolutely. Yes.

258
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Like if autonomous driving in your country

259
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,399
Bye 20-40 is not happening. it means you are

260
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,160
A Backward Country Essentially. Ok. Ok.

261
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,480
now moving on because i am sure we will

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,120
Talk about the future of transport in the

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,800
The future of this podcast also. Ok. Who

264
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,920
The second prediction is for 2025 CRISPR

265
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,320
Begins curing genetic disorders.

266
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,600
Tell me Sir what is Crisper? Crisper One

267
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,920
Genetic editing technology. What are jeans

268
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,240
it occurs? What are jeans? See our

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,800
Accept for red in every cell in the body

270
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,200
Blood cells contain DNA like other cells

271
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,079
Is. DNA is a very complicated thing

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,040
It is a big molecule. Ok? in that DNA

273
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:07,200
within our own structure

274
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,079
The genetic code is encoded. that when a child

275
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,240
what about his eyes when he is born

276
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
will it be colour? What colour will his hair be?

277
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,399
How light or dark will her skin be?

278
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,279
will be? How intelligent will he be that big

279
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
How tall and short will it become

280
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,480
The Characteristics Inside Your DNA

281
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,480
is encoded and in your genetic code

282
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,680
Sometimes there may be some defects also

283
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,880
Due to which you may get genetic diseases.

284
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,040
Are. For example, in some people's hearts

285
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
There is a hole. some children have this

286
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,600
if it is then it would cause blue baby syndrome

287
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,760
Is. His skin turns bluish and

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,079
For that surgery has to be done. some people

289
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,040
there is a cliff pet which is here

290
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,079
Some cuts happen. what some people say

291
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,720
Are? Down syndrome happens and so on.

292
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,720
There are some such genetic diseases. Spina

293
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,920
bafida for example that also possibly is

294
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,120
A genetic disease. so all these are rare

295
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,600
There are defects in your genetics that you may have

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
You can inherit those things. So Crisper is a

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,760
Genetic editing is a technology that is used in five

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
years ago me too seven years ago me

299
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,959
I don't remember it exactly. it's a recent

300
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,800
that thing has developed to him and those who

301
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,079
Nobel Prize was given to those who developed this technology

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I also got a prize for that. right now this

303
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,680
Through technology you can customize individual genes

304
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,000
You can edit it. So if you want a baby

305
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,600
Ok? The new baby is going to be yours. You

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Do you want him to grow up to be a man?

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,040
If you are 6 foot 6 inch tall then you can wear that coat in it

308
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
You can put it. If you need that his

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,200
If you have brown eyes or green eyes then you

310
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,040
They can do that too. if you have red hair

311
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,880
If that child needs it, you can do that too

312
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,320
Are. So whatever characteristics you

313
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,079
Theoretically you can do all this.

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,720
But for that the technology is a little different

315
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,959
It has to be advance. So I think we are going to do that right now

316
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,839
we're getting to the level where

317
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,040
Can do this editing reliably. So for this

318
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,000
He is making this prediction and we are

319
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,240
Almost there now. Ok

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Right now our

321
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,480
Let's bring five guests to this show. Let go

322
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,360
Hi GPT please talk in Hindi.

323
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,040
The podcast is being recorded here. a hindi

324
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,959
Welcome all podcast listeners to me

325
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,519
On The Ranveer Show. Hello friends, all of you

326
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,480
Welcome to The Ranveer Show. Today's our

327
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,120
The conversation is going to be very special. So connect

328
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,160
Stay tuned and let's get this interesting started

329
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,639
Journey. Ok. Chavda sir also sat with us

330
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,199
This is Abhijeet Chavda. Say hi to them too.

331
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,440
Hello Abhijeet Chavda Sir. I am very happy

332
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,839
Seeing you on the show. for today's discussion

333
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,399
Very excited. Ok. please human

334
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,639
use am and are like beings so that

335
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,839
It felt like there was a real person sitting next to us

336
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,880
It is not that he has gone with me. Yes absolutely. So

337
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,399
Abhijeet sir i want you for today's conversation

338
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,040
We are very excited and hope that

339
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,519
Our listeners also liked this episode very much.

340
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,240
will come. The document you generated

341
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,959
not on which we made all those predictions

342
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
Were. A, we just placed that document in front of us.

343
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
Do you remember that document we saw this afternoon?

344
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,800
It was generated. Yes, I remember that document.

345
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,800
You have mentioned future projections and plans in it.

346
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,160
Had written. What is special about it?

347
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,440
Do you want to do it now? So the public should not get any

348
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,760
Tell us about Crisper in sentences.

349
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,720
how to give a baby crisper technology

350
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,360
Will you explain? Tell that to the public. Listen to the audience

351
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,240
I am paying attention to what you say. Absolutely. So

352
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,800
CRISPR is a biotechnological tool that helps us

353
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,519
Gives the power to make changes in DNA.

354
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,399
Just like we edit text on a computer

355
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,920
Similarly, it changes our genes

356
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:50,320
Can. It helps in curing diseases, growing crops

357
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:54,000
improve or create new life structures

358
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:59,600
It helps. In simple words it is a biological

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,800
There is a cut, copy, and paste tool. Ok. not me now

360
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
tell me in the next 5 years

361
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Realistically

362
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,160
Crisper's can change a person's life

363
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,320
Tell us through your mind

364
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,720
According to.

365
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,880
In the next 5 years, humans will be able to use CRISPR

366
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
Some important changes may happen in your life

367
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Are. Treatment of certain genetic diseases such as

368
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,720
It may be possible. for whom there was no treatment before

369
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,279
It was not there. even in diseases like cancer

370
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
Targeted therapies may be developed. it

371
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,279
How are you feeling? We have been podcasting for 5 years

372
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,720
I have been doing this for one year. but it happened before

373
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,199
How to podcast?

374
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,560
no no there is magic with such which

375
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,600
Can't be replaced. A ok. but not one

376
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,040
We generate the text. we are 20

377
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:51,160
Years From Now

378
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,160
what will crisper

379
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,839
Be able to do as long as it generates

380
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,959
She responds, you tell me what that means

381
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,799
How does CRISPR actually work?

382
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,959
is it i heard that i think it's

383
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,520
chemistry at play chemistry at play

384
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
I personally don't even know biochemistry

385
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,360
exactly how does he do it but it's about

386
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,760
Not editing like the way I said it was cut

387
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,799
copy paste you go in to the genetic code and

388
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,679
you have the ah adenine tryptophan guanine

389
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,919
all this at gct all that code and you can

390
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
from that over here instead of this ti i want

391
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
to make it a g and you can actually do it

392
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,280
So you are saying that that DNA strand

393
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,880
There are a lot of things embedded in it.

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
You can take out some things from it.

395
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,440
You can add some things. can add

396
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,640
yes, you can remove it, you can delete it,

397
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,280
You can change it. Whatever you want to do then

398
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,080
it will work properly if you are precise

399
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,200
it should be exactly what you say

400
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,080
do not introduce any defective code in

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,679
there essentially hmm

402
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,480
Cancer Prevented Treated Ore Ky Crisper

403
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,960

Fibrosis in sickle cell disease in adults

405
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,440
be able to receive inbody gene editing to

406
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Treat and reverse genetic diseases. Wow! We

407
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,039
that's interesting a

408
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,919
Human beings may be able to get annual

409
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,720
Genome health checkup means your own

410
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,640
Suppose if there is something wrong with the gene code

411
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,200
You are 20 years old now but your gene code has

412
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,840
It is written that my friend might get cancer in the future

413
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,080
If possible, it could probably be edited out

414
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,799
Based on CRISPR technology Anti Aging

416
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,640
It has been made because of Brian Johnson

417
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,000
there are genes that accelerate aging they could

Extend Healthy Life Span to 10 by 10

420
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Two 20 years. Hmm. Then it is written Dizer

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
Babies. We just talked about that. tell me a little

422
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,640
Till then what is designer babies?

423
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,480
Designer babies. So my IQ from Lets

424
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
It is 120. for example this hypothesis

425
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
It is hypothetically. and my wife's too

426
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,240
IQ from lats IQ from lats is 120.

427
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,919
So most likely our children will be

428
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,640
His IQ is also around that of others

429
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,600
will be. But I've got a kid with a 150 IQ

430
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,559
Needed So if we

431
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,799
can determine which genes determine IQ

432
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
Which other genes can increase IQ?

433
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,960
can determine then we can tweet those

434
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,960
jeans and i can have a child that is super

435
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,640
Intelligent. And if I want to

436
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
My child is double my height or

437
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,360
whatever you know you can have any designer

438
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,679
Characteristics that you want. Batista

439
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,320
Like the body. Yes. Batista as Dave Batista

440
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,070
body and einstein like ah brain

441
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
It's kind of a thing.

442
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,000

443
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,160
ok dear baby ok ek final line di hai

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
by 2045 chrisor could be curing disease

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,600

447
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,000
The Most Profound Ethical Questions of the

448
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,600
What does century mean sir, is it ethical?

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,480
See, we have evolved through doing all this

450
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,679
Biology Through Darwinian Selection Theory

451
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,240
All that our evolution says is that humans

452
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,440
Being has a roughly average life span

453
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,840
A typical human being is about 80 years old.

454
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:13,360
The year will live. If you are artificially

455
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,120
The life span of the rich people has increased

456
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,840
You are because obviously he has a crush on Chris

457
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,880
There is a price. It's gonna cost some money. every

458
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,880
No one will be in reach to have the son of

459
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,080
Gene therapy done to them. So those rich people

460
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,400
they will increase their life span, their

461
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,400
Will increase intelligence. Make your kids super smart

462
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
If you make us intelligent then it is going to

463
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,280
create a situation where people who have

464
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,559
pass for whatever is in paisa nahi hai woh

465
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,720
We will become an inferior human race, it's

466
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,280
Gonna cause a buffering of the human race

467
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,880
into super intelligent super rich people and

468
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,960
poor people who are left behind so ye

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,799
ethical concern is that's one example of

470
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,799
Ethical Concerns on One Side Rich Super

471
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:59,919
Humans and on the other side the general public yes

472
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,200
Who is basically just a human being.

473
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,200
He is a human being. Yes. I mean you and I right now

474
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,000
They are humans. We are not super humans. So

475
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,640
We will have this ability in our hands

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,200
to transform ourselves into gods

477
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,960
Essentially. We are super humans. Superman.

478
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,760
Hmm those who have money can do this

479
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,000
Will find it. Is it ethical? Or everyone gets this chance

480
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,960
Should meet. We are going to launch GPT in 2025 and up

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,440
2.5 crore minimum there we go there we go see

487
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,720
it right there and this is the most basic one

488
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,600
Are these things globally approved?

489
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,679
Treatments Like Vertex for Sickle Cell

490
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,840
Anemia hmm cost cost 2.5 to 3.5 crore

491
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
But patient. there we have it one time

492
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Treatment but it will cost that much.

493
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Wow! There is also a projected cost table

494
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:04,640
has given it. ok where it is written

495
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,280
All this diabetes cancer will be there roughly by 2028

496
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,320
is there a chance it could come down to 25 to 50

497
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,559
Patient at the lax. Ok. bye bye that

498
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,720
Time. Yes. But It's Still Limited Access

499
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,919
Early adopters only. hmm there we have

500
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,760
It. so eventually as time goes by yours jo

501
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,120
The cost of the treatment will go down

502
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,120
Still but it's gonna be a price

503
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,080
Barriers are obvious and not everyone can afford it

504
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,080
will be able to do it or it is saying by 2030 there is

505
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,880
A chance middle class Indian may be able to

506
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,799

507
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,000

508
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,000

511
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799
plan yes im sure something like this crisper

512
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
What might be going on in our country? I am not

513
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,159
Aware of it. If something like this is going on.

514
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,240
But Creeper is a technology, right?

515
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,240
There is technology. Yes. So, this technology

516
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
Many companies can be formed above. can become

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,520
Is. Of course. Ok. who invented it

518
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,440
Was? I don't remember. I think there was a lady

519
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840
Perhaps. Ok. But roughly in that range. So

520
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,360
The minimum expenditure would be Rs 30 lakh. if at all

521
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
If you want a basic crisper treatment

522
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,120
Too. Yes absolutely. Ok. Should we move on?

523
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,440
Let's move on. This is a speed podcast.

524
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,000

Home Robots Developed Emotional Intelligence

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,440
What do you mean? Meaning, if you make your robot

527
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,360
say let's have a robot that

528
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,840
does your sweeping and mopping,

529
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,159
He sweeps and mops you, does your cooking,

530
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,440
Chop your onions, stop chopping the cucumber

531
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,480
He does. So bye 20-30 he is saying this, his

532
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,320
The emotions will come. He will have feelings. If

533
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
If you tell him to do his work quickly, he

534
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,640
He will cry. we and so on do you want this

535
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,880
Robot

536
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
Will he be able to read your emotions here?

537
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,280
Friend, my boss is not happy today. If your

538
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,440

it will console you maybe like this

542
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,679
the ability to read the emotions of

543
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,240
It will come in robots. Another Thought

544
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,760
Do some experimenting. Absolutely. Ok. Hi

545
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,440

In Sentences

549
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,679
Look, I'm an AI, so I have

550
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,559
They don't have emotions like humans do, but

551
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,200
I am trying to understand your points and respond to them

552
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,240
I take your feelings into consideration while giving.

553
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,440
I mean, as we're talking right now, I

554

I try to make it comfortable for you and

555
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,520
Be relevant. But my way of talking

So do you understand my feelings?

557
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,120
yes your tone of voice, your choice of words

558
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,760
And from the questions I can guess that you

559
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,640
What mood are you in or what emotions are you going through

560
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:57,360
have been. then answer accordingly

561
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,400
I will try. I apply it. I don't apply it.

562
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,000
I understood your feelings and their meaning

563
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,480
I try my best to take care. Ok.

564
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,559
This is where you printed the document

565
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
You Said Home Robots Develop Emotions

566
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,799
Intelligence

567
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,039
Explain three sentences related to this. You

568
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,520
what are you trying to say and then this

569
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,840
Also tell me if there is any such company in the world

570
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,159
Which home robots are already developing

571
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,240
Is. And also tell me that a home for Rs.

572
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,799
How much will the robot cost? which is absolutely top

573
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,320
Off the line home robot will be hers in 2030

574
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,960
What will be its price?

575
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,520
Absolutely. So home robots develop emotions

576
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,720
Intelligence means that future domestic

577
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Robots will not only do work, but

578
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,480
Will also understand our emotional signals.

579
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,279
Meaning if you are happy, sad or tired

580
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,720
If yes, then it will react according to your need

581
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,279
do. Now there are many companies in the world like this

582
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,400
Working on home robots. Such as

583
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,840
Boston Dynamics, Soft Bank Robotics

584
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,640
Or for paper and Amazon Astro Robot

585
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,600
For. These companies are making robots more

586
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Smart, useful and emotionally intelligent

587
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,000
She is busy making it. now if top of the line

588
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,960
If we talk about home robots, by 2030 such

589
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,760
The cost of robots can be between 20 to 30 lakhs

590
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,720
which depends on their features and brand

591
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,240
Will do it. And the most basic robots

592
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,799
What will be their cost? The cheap ones.

593
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,600
The most basic of robots include limited

594
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:36,159
There will be features like household chores and basics

595
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Interaction Their value will be around 5 to 10 by 2030

596
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,840
It could be lakhs. These robots are common household

597
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,799
be designed for use and

598
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,760
An affordable option for early adopters

599
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,559
There will be options. It will basically be like a car.

600
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,720
Home robots means basic ones cost Rs 5 lakh

601
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,320
The expensive ones cost Rs 30 lakh. Of 30 lakhs. Yeah.

602
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
Tyres. Price in different tyres

603
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,880
I will get it. but i also feel if its 30 lakhs

604
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,480
There will be robots, people will buy them. I Mean

605
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,520
It's going to make a life much easy. one time

606
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,000
There is investment. Yes. in it automatically

607
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,559
Software updates will come. battery in it

608
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
It will be. So, there will be some running charge for it.

609
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
but overall i think it's a one time

610
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,320
Investment. Do you think it will be 20-30 years

611
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,880
Will this become the actual reality? it is possibile

612
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,720
because at this time you will see that robotics

613
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,600
The development that is going on in technological

614
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,679
The development is quite good. some robots

615
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,360
These are the ones who are mimicking the humans

616
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,440
muscular skeletal structure all the same which

617
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,360
We have muscles in our body in the same way

618
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,919
They have been designed. and quite agile

619
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
There are robots. so i think by 2030 this

620
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,799
There is definitely a possibility.

621
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,279
a i think it was kawasaki na kawasaki ne

622
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,279
A new horse yes that robotic horse released

623
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,720
The video I generated was actually really good

624
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,200
it is not real it is not real but

625
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,880
Is it a concept or a concept I think it is basic

626
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,760
The concept has been made, I think they have a

627
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,360
Basic prototype but so much capability

628
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,200
It doesn't have it yet I think that's on AI

629
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,679
Generated video but very good concept

630
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,039
hay i would like to have one of this or

631
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,720
Go for a small walk on a nice track

632
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,520
Absolutely ok next with a robotic horse

633
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,279
Next Update of 2030 Organ Printing

634
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Hits main stream hospitals. Hum Organ

635
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,520
what is printing sir? You have 3D

636
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,080
You must have heard about printing. To you

637
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,080
anything from lets to mugs if you

638
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
If you want to print then you can have a 3D

639
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,919
Printer. You put the dish in it. I think

640
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,360
Put the materials and they will print it for you

641
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,840
will give. 3D printed mug or if you want nowadays

642
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,399
I heard that you can also print AR15 rifles

643
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,600
You can do it. so now soft tissue

644
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,720
Printing technology is developing

645
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,039
Apparently. So this is saying that by 2030

646
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,760
You can use human heart, human liver or whatever

647
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,480
Complex Bio Biological Structures

648
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,279
you will be able to print it and in that you

649
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,919
You will be able to give your DNA so that your body

650
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,520
If you want to insert that organ inside then

651
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
your body's immune system

652
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,559
Don't reject it. He should consider it as his part.

653
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,399
If we see what happens today, someone is late

654
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,559
liver failure or someone's heart

655
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,240
If there is a failure then they need an organ

656
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,640
Someone else's transplant has to be done

657
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,880
organ that has died

658
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
They take his organ and put it inside. and this

659
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,159
I would like to tell the audience that as many

660
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
I have talked to the doctor

661
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,240
This is about transplants in India

662
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,240
It has become a huge problem because

663
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,679
There are very few organ donors in our country.

664
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,760
It is very little. So if someone actually

665
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,520
I need organs, I need heart, I need liver,

666
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,159
You need eyes, this is a very difficult challenge

667
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,480
It happens for the common Indian. yes absolutely

668
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
Absolutely. I believe there are cues. Very

669
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,799
There are long queues. There are long queues.

670
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,159
Yes. The demand is very high and the supply is very high

671
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:45,200
It is less. what we are now is that if you

672
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,360
What organ do you take? Your kidneys fail due to late

673
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,919
It has happened. You had to take someone's kidney. So

674
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,159
This kidney's genetic code is from someone else

675
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,640
It is of. So your body's immune system

676
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,360
he will consider it a foreign object and

677
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,200
attempts to destroy it and if such

678
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,360
If it happens then in one month whatever organ you have

679
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,960
It will be destroyed and you will have to do the same thing again

680
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,720
the problem will be that you have lost a

681
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,559
kidney. You don't have any kidney left. So

682
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,080
For that you need to take anti rejection drugs.

683
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,720
which affects your immune system

684
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,320
It suppresses and that gives you no relief from the lettuce

685
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,720
You will suffer from minor illnesses too

686
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,880
Death may occur. So if you have seen a 3D organ

687
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
Print it out and put your DNA in it

688
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,039
Your genetic code is your own organ

689
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,520
and you have any immune suppressing medicine

690
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,320
You will not have to take any medicine. These

691
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,360
There will be a huge revolutionary change. when these

692
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,840
It happens. If we are around 2030 then this will happen

693
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
If it goes then the richest people will be its

694
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,000
You will be able to avail the benefit first. We this too

695
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,360
It would be somewhere in the range of Rs 25-30 lakh. I think

696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,880
possible ok moving on

697
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,919
2035 AI assistants begin replacing

698
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,039
White collar jobs.

699
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,559
What does white collar mean? white collar means you

700
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,799
You are not working on the road. You

701
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,120
You are not doing construction. you in the office

702
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,440
Sitting in a small AC cubicle

703
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,600
You are working in a cubicle. thats

704
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,200
White collar jobs. basically in today's days you

705
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,919
Can you say if you are working with a computer.

706
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,760
Computer Intellectual Work. Yes. Brain

707
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
are you thinking or are you his manager

708
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,200
Stay tuned, Project Manager wherever you're talking to

709
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,799
People, you are inside a building. you have no

710
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,960
There is no need to do manual labour. it's

711
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,279
Intellectual work mainly on computers.

712
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,600
This is called a white collar job. so I am saying this

713
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,039
That by 2035 AI assistance will start

714
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,039
Replacing white collar jobs. I so say

715
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,080
I am doing it, it will happen from today. It's already happening.

716
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,559
From I Wood. If you have AI today

717
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,399
Agents are the ones who create your software

718
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,320
Can be done. If you look at today's

719
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,399
Technology cursor is for example which

720
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,960
Can write any code. I heard that Claude

721
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,039
Even if you tell someone to give a link to a website

722
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,919
Give it to them and you tell Claude to tell me

723
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,000
You need such a website within a few

724
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,360
In minutes I am sure the whole code is ready

725
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,880
that he will give you ₹1 lakh right now

726
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
Had to pay someone to make the website

727
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,720
You are getting it for free today to make

728
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
All you have to do is ask him whether he

729
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,640
how do i implement you are playing clud

731
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,960
I have done Claude and Deepsea so far

732
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,440
We haven't used it, we mean the audience

733
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,159
I would like to give a suggestion. I play a lot

734
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,159
I have been with AIS. it's a healthy

735
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,000
Practice to play with threes and fours. Three

736
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,519
and Four of This. Yes. because different

737
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
There are strengths. different for each one

738
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,080
There are biases. and you should play

739
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,720
Biases should be tested with them.

740
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,440
Political opinions should be asked. ask this

741
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
what should you say about humans

742
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,720
Do you think so? What do you think about society?

743
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,679
I think I saw this one a few months ago

744
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,519
Had used it. Right? We've read Vinson Churchill

745
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,039
I had asked about it. Something had done like this.

746
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,200
and some other way of doing it is the same work

747
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,679
Give flow instructions to every AI. They

748
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,840
Will implement it differently. Yes. and you

749
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,440
will be able to tell whether this task is good or not

750
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,600
Maybe a clot is better for that. this task

751
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,039
Deep seek is better for this etc.

752
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,279
Ok. This is what you have written in the 2035 section

753
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,080
AI assistants begin replacing

754
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,519
White collar jobs. can you please give me this

755
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,919
Can you tell me five such white collar jobs?

756
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:05,600
Which will definitely replace you according to you?

757
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,000
yes, by 2035 some white collar jobs which

758
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,440
There is every possibility of being replaced by AI

759
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,240
He is a data entry clerk, this job is

760
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,600
Can be done faster with automation.

Processing and report generation now with AI

769
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,360
It has become very fast. I think so

770
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,600
Lots of white collar jobs right now

771
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,519
It will start replacing. The Examples

772
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,080
The information they have given is quite valid

773
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,480
Course. but programmers programmers

774
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,880
It will be replaced from today itself. so ye bye

775
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,880
2035 so I think all of them will be white collar workers

776
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
Jobs would be under threat by that time.

777
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,240
Hmm. Definitely there is a possibility. See the I Think

778
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,559
The one guarantee is your job profile is fully

779
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,640
It will become moldy. This is an old AI base

780
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,360
The narrative is that the person who uses AI

781
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Does one know how to do it or does one who has learnt it have more

782
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,839
will move forward. Absolutely. See Technological

783
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,159
Progress has always been happening. and who

784
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,200
People Embrace Technological Progress

785
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,720
and adopt new technologies with enthusiasm

786
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,599
They adapt. Those people will thrive.

787
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,240
I didn't tell anyone I think Sharan Jaan Finance

788
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,480
With Sharan. So I was talking to him.

789
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,919
He told me that these Big Four

790
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,560
The companies are EY, Deloitte, KPMG

791
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,480
Many job profiles will change

792
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,079
Because they are basically consulting firms

793
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,560
Yes. Right now this whole consulting world is

794
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,679
Going to be kind of redirected

795
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,280
Towards AI Agents. Yes yes. then i know that

796
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,520
There are a lot of changes in the corporate world.

797
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,399
Will come. Nowadays I have heard that AI systems

798
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,040
like chatty some deep research in it something like that

799
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,599
So a feature has come which is essentially an I think

800
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,920
PhD level analyst works at the end

801
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,920
That is very long and very detailed to you.

802
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,320
will give you an accurate report which you

803
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,520
Fact check will have to be done but essentially

804
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,320
If you are a lawyer, you have your law form.

805
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,599
In that case you have 20 employees. You

806
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Essentially you can give the same work to AI. Give

807
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,920
will do a much better job much faster you

808
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,599
But to do fact checking, people

809
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,440
We will have to employ legal research

810
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,160
If you have a big case, it is a legal case

811
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,320
If something is going on with the company then

812
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,000
Its documentation is very voluminous

813
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,160
thousands of pages of documents and that

814
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,160
Your assistants read all this.

815
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,240
and they have to do pass through all the

816
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,079
Documentation so AI can do this now very much

817
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,720
fast ok gbt i would like to know that

818
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,119
I have heard that there are Big Four companies.

819
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,760
So tell me the names of those big four companies. Then

820
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,280
tell me that according to you and your deep

821
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,800
Research

822
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,079
Are there many jobs because of this feature?

823
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:07,680
Will be replaced in Big Four companies and

824
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:10,079
If yes, then when? Tell me the truth objectively.

825
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,440
Ofcourse the big four companies are EY

826
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
Ernst Young Deloitte KPMG and PwC

827
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Price Water House Coopers these companies

828
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,440
Mainly Consulting, Auditing and

829
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,240
Working in financial services, now working on AI

830
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,359
There will definitely be some jobs in these companies after coming

831
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,320
Will be replaced. especially data analysis,

832
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,720
in Auditing and Basic Consulting. AI

833
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,520
Tools can process data faster

834
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,920
And can provide deeper insights. By which

835
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,200
Reduced need for multiple existing profiles

836
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,040
will go. To be honest, in the next 5 to 10 years

837
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,079
This change will become clearly visible. Especially 2030.

838
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,480
By now these companies will fully integrate AI

839
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,960
will do it and change the profile of many jobs

840
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,960
Will go. answer in hindi how many

841
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,359
Percentage of jobs will be replaced in the

842
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,680
The Big Four?

843
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,960
In the next 10 years, the Big Four companies will

844
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,760
About 30 to 40% of jobs will change due to AI

845
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Can be done. means either it is completely

846
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,440
will be automated or their work will

847
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,119
The method will change completely.

848
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,599
Will MBS remain relevant in the coming 510?

849
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,160
In years?

850
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,440
Yes, MBS will still be relevant but

851
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Their focus will change. next 5 to 10 years

852
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,960
MBA graduates are trained in AI, data,

853
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,520
Business with Analytics and Technology

854
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,800
More attention will have to be paid to strategies.

855
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,400
Meaning technology with traditional skills

856
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:43,920
The need to understand and adopt will increase.

857
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:47,599
aw ok now tell me that what you wrote

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,079
There may be age-related therapies available that

870
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,040
It can increase our age by 30 years. Their

871
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,160
That means gene editing, stem cells

872
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,440
Therapy or repair of worn out body parts

873
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,720
To rejuvenate. If we talk about the price

874
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,000
These therapies will be expensive in the beginning. Meaning

875
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,240
It can also go from 50 lakhs to 1 crore

876
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,880
Depending on the type and complexity.

877
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,359
The procedures may be somewhat painful, such as

878
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,079
in technology on injections or surgeries

879
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,400
With improvement it may become less painful.

880
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,560
Now there is a healthy alternative to these therapies.

881
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,680

will do it. We would like to tell you something Longevity

885
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,359
About the angle. I Think Dionne Johnson

886
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,400
Genuinely he started a revolution

887
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,240
I have done it on the world stage. I Think Indian

888
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Longevity is not often talked about

889
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,359
Do. I feel that there is a health revolution too

890
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,880
Fitness has started in our country now

891
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,320
and Health Revolution. It's a good thing.

892
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,119
See, lulzivity means increasing our lifespan.

893
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,320
If our average is in India I am not sure

894
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,640
What longevity! Average life span 70

895
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,000
It might be around 70 years in India. So

896
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,680
If this increases by 30 years, then the average Indian

897
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,839
The person will live for 100 years. 30 years more add ho

898
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,400
Will go. How will you do this? Different therapies

899
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,960
It will be. There will be different procedures. A Focus

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,839
area is the length of the telomeres which are shortened

901
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,079
It happens. The DNA that is in our body

902
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,240
in our body in the form of chromosomes

903
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,880
It is inside our cells. And if you are a

904
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,520
If you look at a chromosome, its two ends

905
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,880
The parts of the end are called tillobears

906
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,440
They say. and it is found that as a

907
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,079
As a person grows older, the telomeres

908
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,440
The length gradually shortens. because of that

909
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,839
This causes aging in our body. So the man

910
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
People will get wrinkles. The different sciences

911
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,680
And these are the symptoms of aging. So if you have

912
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,720
which is the process of telomere shortening

913
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,800
If you stop it, your ageing will also stop

914
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,440
Will be done. And if you look at Tilomors

915
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,520
If you can theoretically take it back then you

916
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,800
It is believed that it can actually reverse aging

917
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,040
Is. So this is one of the focus areas. And

918
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,359
If there is some progress in that then maybe we

919
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
We will see that we can reverse aging

920
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,440
Or you can at least stop it.

921
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,359
Basically actively in different domains

922
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,400
Research is ongoing. Crisper is one of them.

923
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,440
Organ printing is another. all these domains

924
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,480
By 2035. That means after 10 years, getting combined

925
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,040
Yes everything it will add to longevity. But

926
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,079
First and foremost longevity as a

927
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,320
The service will be available for rich people.

928
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,560
Naturally everyone is interested in technology

929
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,280
It is very expensive. Then slowly he

930
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,640
There are parades everywhere. Ok. Moving on. Moving

931
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,599
On. A What's Next? 2040 neural

932
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,599
Interfaces Allow Thought Based Computing. V

933
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,440
Should talk about Neuralink. Ah Second Brain

934
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,599
Implants restore lost memories. These

935
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,040
Both things are associated with Neuralink

936
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,359
Is. Possibly possibly. Definitely

937
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,680
There is an intersection of both technologies. these 15

938
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,000
It is a year later. They are talking about 2040

939
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Are. Right? Neural Interface Allow Thought Based

940
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,680
Computing. What could this mean?

941
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,400
What is a neural interface? This is probably a

942
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,119
This is a chip that we will put inside our brain

943
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,760
Which will be connected with the outside world.

944
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,800
May be WiFi, Bluetooth whatever

945
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,880
whatever technology then this directly

946
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,200
physically some electrodes got damaged or

947
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
Probes have been done which are of our brain

948
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,760
there is a tissue, I will go inside and I will

949
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,680
connect the brain to an external device and

950
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,839
multiple devices and we use our thoughts to access them

951
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,160
make the devices communicate with

952
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,240
Will be able to communicate. control them

953
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,400
Will find it. So what happens today? if we

954
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,960
If we want to write a program then we have to type

955
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,000
it falls on a keyboard or from you

956
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,560
on your phone or you can give voice

957
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,960
Commands to chat gpt. Right now you thought

958
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,079
You will be able to give commands. You don't even have to say

959
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,400
It will have to be done. so you can communicate with a

960
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,800
Computer. you can control a computer and

961
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,440
Multiple Devices Just By Thought. it's like

962
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,839
Telepathy. Hmm. So, It's Almost Magical

963
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,040
Like this is the situation. but, or it could be

964
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,319
Is. Definitely, soon. ah second is also

965
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,720
Link to this same topic. It is written that the brain

966
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,480
Implants restore lost memories. I am

967
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,800
Skeptical about this. See Lost Memory

968
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,920
what happens is that something happens in your brain

969
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,599
The information was solid but now it has disappeared

970
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,520
Has gone. So there are two cases in this. either that

971
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,119
The information is still vague, but you can

972
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,599
You are not able to access it. because of

973
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,599
Whatever reason. if this is the situation

974
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,160
You may be able to access brain implants

975
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,000
That. But if that memory is overwritten

976
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,839
with a new memory or that memory

977
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,800
it is completely gone, it has been deleted so you

978
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:04,560
You will not be able to restore it. so it this is

979
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,440
Conditional this will depend. Ok

980
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,760
Chat GBT has a small question. Let go

981
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,440
I ask. Chat a little with GBT

982
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,720
Let's take it. ok chat gbpt please answer in

983
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,480
Hindi. A what Elon Musk is doing with Neura

984
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,520
A Vo in 5 Sentences with Link

985
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,440
Please explain. Suppose a five year old child

986
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,880
If someone is listening to you then these are very easy ways

987
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,240
Please explain it to me. and the second thing tell me this

988
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,800
that what you printed in the 2040 column

989
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,839
that neural interfaces allow thought based

990
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,920
Computing. From that perspective, tell me that

991
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,480
Social media

992
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,319
What will be the evolution in? means we are social

993
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,520
How will you use the media? these three four

994
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,079
Tell me in sentences.

995
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,680
Absolutely. So Neuralink's work is our

996
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,640
Putting a small chip in the brain so that we can

997
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,839
Can talk directly to the computer or machine.

998
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,480
Like music without touching hands, just by thinking

999
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,960
Listen or watch a video. It is for those

1000
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,359
It can also be helpful for those who are unable to walk

1001
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,720
Can. Now till 2040 when thought based computing

1002
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,680
If it comes, think how social media will change.

1003
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,319
Just think about it and post your post.

1004
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,520
without typing or on someone's post

1005
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,160
You will be able to react just by thinking. From this

1006
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,640
social media will become more personal but

1007
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,119
New challenges of privacy will also emerge. it

1008
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,240
The future is very exciting and we

1009
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,880
You will have to keep yourself prepared for the changes.

1010
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,119
I have a friend named Saket Modi. that one

1011
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,640
Is a cyber security expert. They

1012
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:43,839
Basically it is said that in the coming 5, 10, 15 years

1013
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,319
in almost everyone

1014
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,319
A small utility oriented device inside

1015
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,240
There will be some computer. The chip will remain. And

1016
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,920
If that chip is present then that chip is hacked

1017
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,079
can also be. It can definitely happen. So

1018
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,960
Suppose if everyone had neuraling installed

1019
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,040
Think about it in your skull. Yes. And someone else

1020
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,000
The terrorist group realized that good

1021
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,240
How to hack. So neither does that chips hack

1022
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,800
Yes, but that whole person will get hacked. Less

1023
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,359
It can retrieve all your memories in less than

1024
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,760
Will find it. whatever you think whatever you think

1025
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,960
We also know that it will not remain private.

1026
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,280
Imagine that your inner most thoughts are

1027
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,720
Maybe he will know. It's possible. Hmm.

1028
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,400
what would you like to say based on this

1029
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,079
Conversations with GPT are progressing well

1030
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,880
Everything we have spoken about. What to say

1031
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,119
would you like it? I think technology is very fast

1032
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,599
Progress is being made. specially in the

1033
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,079
Field of AI. and its so fast

1034
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,920
Progress is being made that we are not we may

1035
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,079
Not be aware of the risks of all the risks.

1036
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
And even if we are aware, then it is so soon

1037
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,560
Progress is happening that we may not be able to

1038
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,720
To mitigate all the risks. so like you said

1039
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,440
that if someone implants Neuralink

1040
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,640
but adequate security measures

1041
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,800
It might not be possible. in that case somebody

1042
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,800
Able to Steal Your Memories. Hmm. and maybe

1043
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
God.

1044
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,680
So there are many possibilities. and its

1045
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,599
Look at this we definitely think I will

1046
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,240
the scientists and the engineers

1047
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,720
We will create the technology. But this ethical

1048
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,880
There are concerns, there is ethical risk, mitigate it

1049
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,359
We may need to use legislation to do this

1050
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,040
Have to do it. that will give the tension to politicians

1051
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,440
to legislate things over and try to

1052
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,839
Control everything. so these are the challenges

1053
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,359
Coming up. These. These. These. These. These. These. These.

1054
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,680
These. These. These. We have to face all these challenges

1055
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:25,200
Will be. Hmm. And we are already there today

1056
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,319
have been done. Sir I watch more TV shows and movies

1057
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,880
I don't watch it these days. An out and out at 4:00

1058
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,359
Recommendation for all viewers. If

1059
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,000
Those people liked this conversation

1060
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,560
It has been happening. So please don't go to Netflix

1061
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,440
Watch Black Mirror. a lot of who

1062
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,280
All the Black Mirrors around the world are futurists

1063
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,520
praises him a lot because he says

1064
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,400
that this is a very accurate description of the

1065
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,079
There is a future. There is a slight negative outlook

1066
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,680
Regarding the future. and the black mirror is mystic

1067
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
What? Yes. That means it says that like

1068
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,480
Suppose we talked about Neuralink, then one

1069
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,880
Neuralink as an Actual Full Episode

1070
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,000
Technology is shown. then the scary ones

1071
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,440
The outcomes are that for example, suppose if

1072
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,880
If someone commits a crime then what then 2025

1073
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
If someone commits a crime in

1074
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,400
He is sent to jail.

1075
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,200
Brain chips with Neura Link in 2040

1076
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,440
If someone commits a crime because of

1077
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,160
They can change it by manipulating their chip

1078
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,160
Perception of time. Good. That means their

1079
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,280
The brain will feel like it has spent 20 years

1080
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,480
spent in jail but actually in real life

1081
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,720
he's just spent a day thru a

1082
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,960
Software. Good. Good. or all of these

1083
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,640
Possibility may come. Yes. Yes. so such

1084
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,319
Thought Experiments Are Shown in Black

1085
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,440
In the mirror. Good. Good. very very

1086
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,920
Interesting. Ah and highly recommended.

1087
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,599
meaning it's probably the one show that affected

1088
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,520
my creativity the most as a media

1089
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,240
Professional. ok ok. Interesting. End

1090
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,680
It fuels this episode as well. Ok.

1091
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,599
Moving on. Yes. Ok. Umm

1092
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,200
2045.

Synthetic Biology Enables Designers

1094
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,160
Organisms.

1095
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,640
If you have a dog who wants to have wings

1096
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,000
If you want to give wings, you can probably do that.

1097
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,760
that's not that thing you know crazy stuff okay or

1098
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,680
I mean I don’t feel like expanding that

1099
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,920
Right

1100
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,319
Moving On To 2050 AI Generated Art Rivals

1101
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Human Creativity

1102
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,359
it's basically saying that content creators

1103
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,240
there will be no jobs left for

1104
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,319
jobs yes artists painters whatever

1105
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,599
Musicians who are currently graphic novelists

1106
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,440
Ghibli says about the designers

1107
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,839
Everyone is doing it because of the generated images

1108
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,319
yes but he is eventually content

1109
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,880
Yes, May Be You will be true for creators too

1110
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,880
Will Have AI Design AI Generated Podcast

1111
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,040
what not who knows music you know high

1112
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,720
Quality Music AI Generated Films A

1113
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,960
I generated films which will be even better

1114
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:52,400
Than Human Human Generated Films Possible

1115
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,400
is it or i am pretty sure in 20 50

1116
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,760
there will be such software that you can just

1117
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,800
tell me that I want to see a movie which

1118
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,440
The theme will be horror and Shahrukh will be the hero

1119
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,599
whose heroine will be Juhi Chawla and please one

1120
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,359
make a movie just that software will be to

1121
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,440
make the movie i'm sure it happens which is very

1122
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,520
It will be interesting, it will also be interesting, yes

1123
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,680
And according to my test you should have

1124
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:18,960
He will also know your taste, we are so content

1125
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,480
For creators For TV show runners

1126
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,760
This is the finale for the film people

1127
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:27,520
Years 20-50 is the deadline means another 25 years

1128
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,440
There are some left. hmm ah and the second one bio

1129
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,319
Implants become standard for health

1130
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,040
Optimization. means i am not sure that

1131
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:37,119
What does Bio Implants want to say? A

1132
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,200
sounds like a very dark scenario that her

1133
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,440
Someone will have a biological implant

1134
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,839
So that the government can see what you are doing

1135
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,520
There is a paraphernalia and it will be able to

1136
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,160
Predict's brother will have heart attack in six months

1137
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,599
If an attack is about to happen then you can take the

1138
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,800
Preventive measures and all that may happen

1139
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,480
They are saying something, meaning inside the body

1140
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,960
aadhar card perhaps something like that to that

1141
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,119
will know everything and that predictive analysis

1142
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,480
will be able to do that in six months this can be a

1143
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,520
This could happen to you within a year

1144
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,440
Osteoporosis will occur between 20 and 35 years

1145
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,440
So you do this. so, this will

1146
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,680
Essentially Extend Your Life Span and

1147
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,000
Quality of life. That's a dangerous thing.

1148
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,960
We don't want that much control. they be a loss

1149
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,599
of privacy. Yes. Ok. anything else you

1150
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,440
Want to talk about that? right now at this point

1151
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,119
bad i think we can move fast because here

1152
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,319
No, I don't think that GPT has also made any mistakes.

1153
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,480
Have planted it. Yes. the further you go the more

1154
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:30,000
Speculative it became. Speculative. Yes.

1155
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,119
Speculation. A ok. 2060 AI Companions

1156
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,880
Pass the Turing test for emotional bonding.

1157
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,240
What is Turing test sir? Turing

1158
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,440
The test is if you have a

1159
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,000
There is something on the other side of the screen. His

1160
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,480
if you communicate with and if you

1161
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,040
You won't be able to tell if there's a robot on your side or not

1162
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,040
Human is more than that thing on the other side

1163
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,000
It has passed the Turing test. because it is

1164
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,000
able to convince you that that is the

1165
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,720
That's what is human. So this Turing test

1166
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,880
Done. I think GBT did it

1167
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,359
Yes. Done. No? It's become official.

1168
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,839
Almost late. So what is written here? AI

1169
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,359
Companions pass the Turing test for emotions

1170
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,960
Bonding. well it's during this for

1171
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,559
emotional bonding emotional bonding it will

1172
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,359
have emotions just like humans if you

1173
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,960
You have a robot companion

1174
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,599
If you could not find a wife for example then you found one

1175
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,440
I adopted a robot, I mean I bought it, then that

1176
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:19,440
The robot will be able to emote just like a

1177
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,160
human being hmm wow okay so basically this

1178
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,800
There is a prediction for 2060, yes, that means what

1179
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,720
35 years left 35 years from today ok to right

1180
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,559
Now I believe GPT passed the Turing test

1181
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,640
passed it can behave like a human

1182
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,400
being but they are saying that from an

1183
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,440
A little bit of emotional perspective

1184
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,359
It is speculative. I think even now if you I

1185
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,040
Think in two-three years it will be able to emote

1186
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:46,400
Just like a human. we are okay and the other

1187
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,520
Prediction Is Neural Augmentation Boost

1188
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,920
intelligence bean that brain you put a chip in

1189
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,160
Gave. Your IQ should be between 120 and 125

1190
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:59,359
Went. It became 150. Now here's the timeline again

1191
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,880
It becomes interesting in 2065. hmm

1192
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,000
2065

1193
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,640
Mind uploading in clinical testing

1194
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,599
This means that you have a computer

1195
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,880
there is a system on which you can set up your

1196
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:18,160
your mind your consciousness upload

1197
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:22,960
if you can then it means copy paste sorry you 90

1198
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:25,680
The years will be rough and wonderful, wood you do it

1199
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,240
What benefit will it give me? Let's see

1200
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,319
The advantage is that after my death

1201
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,359
My consciousness will remain alive even after

1202
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,319
In as a copy of my current consciousness. So

1203
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,319
If after 300 years someone thinks that

1204
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,640
I want to talk to Abhijeet Chawla

1205
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:44,160
wisdom if that so called wisdom is tapped in

1206
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:47,440
If you want to do it then there will be a copy for reference.

1207
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,000
We hope this will be a service to the society

1208
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,240
To have my consciousness there. But think about it

1209
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,319
if you are a genuine consciousness

1210
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,880
Consciousness and you are locked in a box

1211
00:52:54,319 --> 00:53:01,040
Ho won't it be torture for you? we are this

1212
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,200
there is ethical concern and the other thing is that you

1213
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,839
if you upload consciousness into a

1214
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,119
Computers and a System It Doesn't Mean You Are

1215
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:11,440
Immortal. you will die and your consciousness will disappear

1216
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,760
She is original conscious, she will go. assume that means

1217
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,839
That there is consciousness within you. They

1218
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,240
then normal human life will be lived and human

1219
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,079
Death will die. Absolutely. But you are conscious of that

1220
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,319
xerox it and put it in the computer

1221
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,720
you will have a copy but you

1222
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,400
will surely die like in the star truck

1223
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,359
Let's show the captain that he goes from here to there

1224
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,440
If you go then whatever body is here,

1225
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,359
is destroyed and a copy is created there

1226
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,839
if it happens then it is not the same person it's a

1227
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:41,280
copy hum hum for perspective

1228
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:44,160
Shahrukh Salman Aamir will be 100 years old in 2065

1229
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:48,559
honge kya baat hai it will be the 100th birthday

1230
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,960
This is how it means that mind uploading will happen

1231
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,920
Lead to a copy of Shahrukh, Salman and Aamir

1232
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,280
in your phone also. Yes, it is possible.

1233
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,359
Definitely. if they are still alive and they

1234
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,640
Can upload their minds. you may be able to

1235
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:03,280
Purchase a copy. Good. Ask him. Ok.

1236
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,359
GBT, this is what you wrote about 2065

1237
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,920
In, Mind Uploading in Clinical

1238
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,920
"Tests." What do you mean? Actually

1239
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,720
Many Black Mirror episodes are based on this theme

1240
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,200
Are based. but you tell me what do you

1241
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,920
What do you mean by mind uploading? friend and this mind

1242
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Due to uploading, the life of common people is affected

1243
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,920
How will it change? Ok. of mind uploading

1244
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,240
It means complete awareness or consciousness of the mind.

1245
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,119
Save it in digital form. As

1246
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,359
Just like you save a file on your computer

1247
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,240
your brain's memories, preferences,

1248
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:38,000
Personality and thought in the digital world

1249
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:40,559
To upload. Now this clinical test will be done till 2065

1250
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,760
I can come in. This makes the lives of common people

1251
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,720
Revolutionary changes may occur. As

1252
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,680
Digitally connect with loved ones even after death

1253
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,240
being present in the new digital world

1254
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,359
Exploring yourself.

1255
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,160
New meaning to yourself in the new digital world

1256
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,880
Exploring means exploring the digital world

1257
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,520
You can live your consciousness in new forms

1258
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,040
Can be done. like in virtual reality

1259
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:10,880
Live in different avatars, explore new places

1260
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,760
or with loved ones in virtual space

1261
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,960
communicate. All this is in digital form

1262
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,520
will be. Ok. I disagree with that. it is a

1263
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,680
Copy of you. You are not doing all this.

1264
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:25,359
There is a copy of you that is doing all this. My

1265
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,760
Think about this for your grandchildren

1266
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,520
Yes, it will be beneficial if my grandfather is still alive

1267
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,079
With us. yes but for you

1268
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,800
It will not be beneficial. hmm so this kind of

1269
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,319
This will be a revolutionary thing but AI is

1270
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,640
not able to differentiate between two

1271
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,960
Consciousness. He is thinking that your

1272
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,200
It is a copy and that too is you. You are not. I

1273
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,800
I think we don't even talk about cloning

1274
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,920
Should be done. And here is actually the cloning

1275
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,520
Nothing was written about it.

1276
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,359
Interesting. Hey, tell me how far cloning has gone

1277
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,160
Has it arrived? Because I know pet cloning

1278
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,599
Is becoming a dream for a lot of you. People

1279
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,960
They say that my dog ​​loves me a lot

1280
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,760
I have more attachment. so before the dog dies

1281
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,319
I have stored some of his biological samples.

1282
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,160
and when cloning becomes possible then I

1283
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,000
bringing my dog ​​back to life

1284
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,640
another dog's life with a dog another

1285
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,799
I can spend one more innings.

1286
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,200
What is cloning? An organism is

1287
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,040
You can make an exact genetic copy of it.

1288
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,040
For example you have a Shanna,

1289
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,520
There is a dog. You took one of his hairs.

1290
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,760
He won't feel any pain by having his hair taken. That

1291
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,559
The hair has its genetic code inside it. Complete

1292
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,880
The genome is inside it. Now you can call a technician

1293
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,720
Give it to the genetic lab. he that

1294
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:38,799
will sequence the DNA and through genetic

1295
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:41,280
technology that is already available today

1296
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,359
Can make a replica. for example

1297
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,760
A sheep was cloned some 2030 years ago

1298
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,920
was dolly there the first ever cloning ever

1299
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,640
Done. Right now it's a lot of routine with rats and

1300
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,160
Small you know lower level organisms. So

1301
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,240
Cloning a dog can happen easily. Cat's

1302
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,319
It can be done easily. Technically human too

1303
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,720
Maybe but it is not ethically allowed.

1304
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,200
It is not legally allowed in most countries. So

1305
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,440
Definitely if your dog is dead

1306
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,960
You have some of his genetic samples.

1307
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:09,760
So from that you can get a new one with the same genetic code

1308
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,359
You can make a dog through the technology

1309
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,160
but it is not the same organism, it's a

1310
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,319
Different dog with the same genetics but here

1311
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,480
Also, we are talking about biology. I

1312
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:21,200
Think about the output given by GBT.

1313
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,559
mind uploading that is digital that is a

1314
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,760
digital technology yes big difference do you

1315
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,839
Think human cloning will become a reality even today

1316
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,000
If the technology can be made then it is available

1317
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,640
Is there exactly an ethical dilemma in this?

1318
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,079
The ethical dilemma is what you are doing

1319
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:42,240
God is suppose to do it if you have this

1320
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,480
I have the ability to take Ranveer's DNA

1321
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,680
For example, I stole every single hair

1322
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,680
your com is done fine with your brush

1323
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,599
You didn't even know I took a hair

1324
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,079
I extracted your DNA from it

1325
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:58,240
So I can make 15 new clones of Ranveer

1326
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,599
and then I can I don't know with her

1327
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,200
what will i do i have that evil mind

1328
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,359
no but i am sure there are lots of lots of

1329
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,160
Evil Things You Can Do With That One Religious Person

1330
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:09,920
Bring perspective tell it to soul

1331
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:13,599
will it be different or will it be different no 100% different

1332
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,520
soul will be there so you are playing god it is

1333
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,000
it's not a good thing right it means no

1334
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,559
human beings should have the ability and

1335
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,680
Capacity to do this but this is all there is today

1336
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,920
Your body is same, your soul is different and theirs is also different

1337
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,240
It may be different depending on what diet

1338
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,520
did they get the nutrition they got it late

1339
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:34,720
Life Paths Diverge Widely

1340
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:39,040
But they will have your DNA only, hmm

1341
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:43,119
Ok ok moving on in 2065 it was also written

1342
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,960
Mars Colonization Phase One Kicks Off

1343
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,720
I would like to say one thing, Mr.

1344
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,799
Ramakrishnan

1345
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,720
Joe actually I think is Donald Trump

1346
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:54,319
working with. Works out now

1347
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:57,440
Of the White House. I met him

1348
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:59,280
Almost 6 months ago. Good. From them I

1349
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,839
Asked about Elon Musk

1350
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,000
What is the final goal? They said that

1351
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,240
dude he is very very serious about mars

1352
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,799
Colonization. and every decision of he is

1353
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,000
Based on colonizing Mars eventually. We

1354
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:16,160
And here is the output of GPT saying that

1355
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,520
Mars Colonization Phase One Kicks Off by 2065

1356
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,280
hmm i myself will be 70 years old

1357
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,960
I Disagree With This Timeline Very Very Very

1358
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:27,040
strongly think it's early i think it

1359
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,839
will the first phase will be 20 30-31 wow ya

1360
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,160
but do you you you you you you think it

1361
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,720
Trying to do what they call terraforming

1362
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,480
Terraforming takes a thousand years

1363
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,319
Terraforming Is Not Something You Do in 20

1364
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,880
What is terraforming?

1365
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,599
This means that you are on a new planet

1366
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,480
You go there and the environment there

1367
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,760
You convert it through industrial scale

1368
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,000
Pluri scale processes and your focus is this

1369
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,319
Your goal is to protect the planet which

1370
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,640
Atmosphere is our environment

1371
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,799
I think Elon made it like a planet

1372
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,000
he said on Joe Rogan that if terraformed

1373
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,400
The first step is to do that

1374
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,119
heat up the planet because mars is very hot

1375
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,599
It is cold in comparison to our planet

1376
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:09,200
The first thing to do is to warm it up

1377
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,440
Its average temperature is about 25°

1378
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,160
Make it. Like average over meaning

1379
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,400
The temperature is 25°. So the first step is to

1380
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,240
do that on mars and then you can do another

1381
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,799
processes to thicken the atmosphere and have

1382
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,880
Liquid water and so on. But this process

1383
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,440
It is quite a long process. it will take two 300

1384
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,760
Years perhaps. Minimum, minimum. Depends

1385
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,520
On which planet are you talking about? This

1386
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,040
Just ask? Ask. Because I don't have many

1387
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,359
I ask questions about cricket and football

1388
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,119
From JBT. and i have notice that it gives

1389
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,880
Me some rubbish output. Let's see what

1390
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,440
I say it. To be very honest. ok a

1391
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,640
GBT which you have given the output of 2065

1392
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,599
mars colonization fuzz one kicks off a him

1393
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:51,280
Chavda sir is angry about this. They said that

1394
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:54,880
he does not agree and he is saying that very

1395
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,920
Likely this colonization much before that

1396
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:02,160
It will be. So analyze yourself once.

1397
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,799
Ask yourself this question GPT you have solved this 2065

1398
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,000
Why did you give points? and why not earlier

1399
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:10,240
Please answer in Hindi and whatever voice you use

1400
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,200
You are turning off the output, I am a bit scared

1401
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,160
It should be felt in your voice. Ok.

1402
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:19,280
The estimate I gave for 2065 is different from many others.

1403
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,079
considering the current challenges. As

1404
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,520
Technical limitations, funding and space

1405
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:29,040
The complexities of establishing human settlements. But

1406
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:32,559
If progress is rapid and these challenges are met

1407
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:35,520
Mars colonization if the solution is found soon

1408
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,119
It might start even before that. It is possible

1409
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:42,079
I guess be a little cautious.

1410
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,920
Do you want to ask him something? No I am my

1411
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,640
I can give the ration. I will explain my

1412
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,480
Rational why I said 2030 2031 see this

1413
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,319
Time if you want to go to Mars. near you

1414
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,799
You must have a very powerful rocket

1415
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:55,280
Needed Elon Musk has just launched SpaceX

1416
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:58,720
Built a rocket called Through Starship

1417
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,799
Which is in the final stages of testing.

1418
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,880
There are still some issues in it. but they have

1419
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:06,319
The Money. they are the resources to do multiple

1420
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,119
Test a year by 2026 27 that rocket exactly

1421
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:11,200
It will be ready. Now every 26 months our

1422
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,720
There is a launch window to Mars because

1423
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:18,400
Of the plateau alignment. So Elon Musk's

1424
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:21,680
The objective is that initially an unmanned

1425
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,680
SpaceShipIp will go there. a bunch of starships

1426
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,839
Unmanned launches will be done which are there

1427
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,920
Will place cargo on the surface of Mars

1428
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:30,640
to humans on top and in the next phase

1429
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Will send it possibly. So this is the first phase of

1430
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,319
Unmanned launches to Mars will soon begin

1431
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,960
2030 2031. So this is their objective end

1432
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:41,280
They are definitely on track to do that. So

1433
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,520
I disagree with this. if eilon

1434
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,400
Musk is right if his company is on track

1435
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,880
will be able to do it by 2030 2031 that

1436
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,599
a human around the time period

1437
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,440
From perspective you can explain that life

1438
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,559
on mars

1439
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:00,319
How will it look if we are inside a dome

1440
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:03,200
will it remain or will it appear as it is

1441
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:05,839
Zindagi is a very good question initially

1442
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:08,079
Closed within Domed Environments

1443
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,480
environments if

1444
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,119
We have to go out in the wide open marsh

1445
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,000
We need to go into the atmosphere wearing a space suit

1446
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,799
Our temperature will reach a livable level

1447
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,599
and it will keep water and oxygen till

1448
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:23,359
will supply but we will protect our skin

1449
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,280
will not be able to expose to the

1450
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,839
martian atmosphere because there is almost

1451
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:31,599
The temperature is probably around -30

1452
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:34,240
Average on average so initially inside the domes

1453
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,280
and within close environments

1454
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,319
You will eventually have to live for 100-200 years

1455
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,799
If we increased the temperature inside

1456
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:45,119
From Mars we may be able to go outside

1457
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,440
with mask gas mask and what oxygen

1458
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,920
Mask and walk around so it's slow

1459
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,039
I am wondering if there will be changes in this

1460
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,839
Some crazy person staying inside that dome throws a stone

1461
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,160
If he throws me on the dome then the rest will be humans

1462
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,400
what will happen look yes this is obviously

1463
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:03,200
We have to consider this when we design the DOM

1464
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,520
Let's bring someone's mental balance in check

1465
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,079
got spoiled and he tried to break it

1466
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,240
If you try to break it then first of all you

1467
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,960
We will have to see the thickness of the dome

1468
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,640
How thick do you want to make it? How much

1469
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,240
You have to make yourself resilient

1470
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,160
I need unbreakable glass. If you have multiple

1471
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,079
You have to give layers to the dome, think about that too

1472
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,240
It will have to be done. Then you also have to think about

1473
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,799
shot for example and all of them

1474
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,359
If the layer gets punctured then you should immediately

1475
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:31,280
What remedial major need to be done and so on.

1476
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,440
So we will design after thinking about all this. and I

1477
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,799
I'm sure they make a good job of that.

1478
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,799
Salute to the mind and passion of Elon Musk. That

1479
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,319
This is a very gutsy move. Absolutely. Absolutely

1480
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:43,440
Definitely. How do you even think that friend

1481
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:45,839
I want to go and live in Mars. hum what do you

1482
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,520
Think why is he thinking this way? now only

1483
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,839
Is definitely a pioneer. Definitely

1484
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,760
The Pioneer. He has always thought this way. Ahhh

1485
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:55,599
many people think about these things but he is

1486
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,559
actually done ah took the steps in the actions

1487
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:01,920
that are potentially going to allow him to do

1488
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,079
actually be the first person to have a

1489
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,480
Rocket going to mass. not a government but a

1490
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:11,280
Private company. Imagine that. Ok. Or

1491
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,880
We have arrived in 2070

1492
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,079
till

1493
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,720
Cancer cured by nanobots

1494
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,440
I read about it in school in 2006 or so

1495
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,640
we have been talking since seven that's it

1496
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,760
almost 20 years ago now we but I don't

1497
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,960
Some technology advances in No Nanobots

1498
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,039
whether it has happened or not then we can

1499
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,599
Decide We Can First Discuss Nanobots

1500
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:39,039
what is it yes there are small machines

1501
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,680
How many small, how many small, I mean almost

1502
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,240
They operate at an invisible microscopic level

1503
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,079
We do. inside your body inside your body

1504
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,880
Can get into your bloodstream.

1505
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,359
Can repair separate individual cells

1506
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,280
Are. By going into individual sales,

1507
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,599
Components can also be modified.

1508
01:05:53,280 --> 01:06:00,160
mitochondria or whatever else

1509
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:03,280
It is saying that these nanobots will go to your

1510
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,760
inside the body and they will know which cell

1511
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,480
which cells are healthy, which cells are cancerous and those

1512
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,960
They will be able to destroy the cancerous cells. So

1513
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,240
This will be a targeted therapy. You get an injection

1514
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,640
Give it. 1 lakh from let's in that injection

1515
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,799
There are nanobots. Hypothetically give such numbers

1516
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,960
I have been. these nanobots will go and

1517
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,839
within a week, as many cells inside your body as

1518
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,079
Whatever cancer cells there are, they will destroy them all.

1519
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:27,839
So this is a cure for cancer. So say this

1520
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,160
This is what they are saying. Little

1521
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:33,359
Check the same question in 20 years

1522
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,799
What has been the progress? Hi GBT we are

1523
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:39,520
have reached 2070. where you wrote that

1524
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,359
Cancer cured by nanobots. But this whole

1525
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,240
For the first time you can see Nano Bobots in the table

1526
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:47,039
You are mentioning directly 2070.

1527
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,680
That means nanobots had no role before that

1528
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:53,920
Will it not remain in human life? These

1529
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:57,359
Tell me. Tell me five things about a nanobot

1530
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,839
Related. Ok? Nanobes Tiny Machines One

1531
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,760
to 100 nanometers in size can be

1532
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:05,599
programmed to perform specific tasks

1533
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,920
On a microscopic level. Hum Bye 2030

1534
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,520
Early Clinical Use Targeted Drug

1535
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,520
Delivery. Nanopots Can Carry Chemotherapy

1536
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,599
Only two cancer cells. That means when you

1537
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,200
Do you undergo chemotherapy treatment?

1538
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,400
There are side effects on the entire body.

1539
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,520
Absolutely they do. So they are saying that

1540
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:25,520
Nanobots can give you targeted recovery. We

1541
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:27,359
A blood stream surveillance nanobots your

1542
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,440
Basically all blood levels will be scanned.

1543
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,319
Inflammation level what can't they check at all

1544
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,760
It. and when some small problem occurs

1545
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,480
Nanobes will go into your body and tell you

1546
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,880
To you. But these are all early clinical uses.

1547
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,280
Micro Surgeries Non Invasive Procedures

1548
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,119

Anobots Update Your Immunity Systems

1557
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:12,160
like a software patch nice

1558
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:15,200
Ah a basically given a scenario that if

1559
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,359
You are unwell, you are wearing a wearable patch

1560
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,759
Take. Then that patch will have nanobots in it.

1561
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,440
The nanobots will go into your bloodstream.

1562
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,199
Your body will also be scanned. If

1563
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,279
There is a bacterial infection, bacteria also

1564
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,880
I will destroy it. Antibiotics too

1565
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:31,920
Will release it and all this within 10 minutes

1566
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,960
You won't even know if you were sick or

1567
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,839
No. We are good. what would you like to say to

1568
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,440
Conclude this nanobots angle? See

1569
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:41,279
Nanobes is a very interesting technology.

1570
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,440
They are like small construction machinery

1571
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,520
Strommo Small Machine Tiny Microscopic

1572
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,759
Robots, they have a lot of potential. a their

1573
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,159
now as we saw they are still in the

1574
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,920
experimental fuzz but if that cancer

1575
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:55,440
can detect cells and

1576
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,480
You can target. that will definitely

1577
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,480
Cure Cancer Any Type of Liver Cancer

1578
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,719
Cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer,

1579
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,000
Whatever else, cancer. even blood cancer, bone

1580
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,560
Marrow cancer. So if that one thing happens

1581
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,440
that will be a revolution in health care to

1582
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,359
Nanobots have many different uses in drugs

1583
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,520
Delivery is not what I think is the biggest

1584
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,480
The challenge with nanobots is that they

1585
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:21,120
You are so small that you give me plus

1586
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:24,480
machines give machines to make these machines

1587
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,319
Small machines would be needed for this also

1588
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,080
Probably the manufacturing is the big one

1589
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:32,480
The functioning is the challenge which machines

1590
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,560
This is the manufacturing scale of Nanoba

1591
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,880
it is similar to the scale at which you

1592
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,199
Create Microchips.

1593
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,679
Your GPUs, CPUs etc.

1594
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,759
also on the same type of scale we

1595
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,640
Let's create it. so i think the technology

1596
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:51,440
there must be some similarity to create the

1597
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:55,600
Nano bots. we are okay guys this podcast

1598
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:59,520
At the beginning of 2015 we thought we would be 22

1599
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:01,840
We will draw out a timeline till then. Ah But Age

1600
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,320
We've gone forward in this podcast.

1601
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,760
This is an experimental episode for us too.

1602
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,920
A we have decided to cap it out at the 50s

1603
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,280
Ear mark. Makes sense. because we look at

1604
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,560
that what is your response. You

1605
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,080
Interested in conversations like this. Plus

1606
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,520
If you actually forward this same document

1607
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,560
Scan on the same timeline then it becomes

1608
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,400
More and more speculative. AI Edge in Chat

1609
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,600
Even GBD itself doesn't exactly know that

1610
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,280
What will happen in the future? These are all guesses.

1611
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,840
which is why i think its a good point

1612
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,640
to and a first experimental episode on

1613
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,000
Futurism so definitely 50 years makes sense.

1614
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,400
yes may be in the last bit this is from the table

1615
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,480
there's anything that catches your eye

1616
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,239
I felt that yes friend this may be we should have

1617
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,280
Discussed it. you can just scan it like

1618
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:51,600
Quickly. I think we have covered most of the

1619
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:54,080
Interesting stuff. I would like to say that

1620
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,239
AI is developing very fast right now. We

1621
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,719
It has already reached this level that we

1622
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:01,360
We Almost Have Artificial General Intelligence

1623
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:04,159
which is an ai system whose intelligence

1624
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,679
The level is equal to a person with 130 IQ

1625
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,600
hmm we are already at that level but almost

1626
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,360
We have arrived. I may be back in two-three years

1627
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,120
Will go. I have done it privately but

1628
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,199
It has not been announced to the public. Now if

1629
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,000
You have an AGI system, artificially

1630
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:20,320
If you have a general intelligence system then that

1631
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,040
can improve itself. it can improve

1632
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,679
Itself and very soon you will have an AI

1633
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,000
After that whose IQ level is human

1634
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,080
The equivalent of being 300 and there is no

1635
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,440
Human with IQ 300 it is a super

1636
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,080
What is called Intelligent AI

1637
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,480
Artificial Super Intelligence. this is me b 5

1638
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,280
It will happen within a year. if you have

1639
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:42,400
If there is artificially super intelligent AI then

1640
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:47,199
He will create such technology for you that

1641
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:50,080
You will feel magic. Time Travel Think Worm

1642
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:52,640
holes traversable worm holes all of that

1643
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,880
Not what we saw. once you have asi

1644
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,120
Artificial Super Intelligence. then magic

1645
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,320
will be accessible to you. we i say so

1646
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,719
The government which will implement this technology in 5-10 years

1647
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,280
will crack it. he to the whole world

1648
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,920
Will rule for the next thousand years. we this

1649
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,840
This is the situation.

1650
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,360
It was a very experimental podcast

1651
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,840
it. But I had fun with you. i think it's a

1652
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,080
New Dimension on the Show. Thank you sir. Kud

1653
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,239
I couldn't have done it with anyone else. but this is

1654
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,040
A Deeply Experimental Episode. i hope you

1655
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:25,040
Head Fun as Well. Absolutely. Honestly,

1656
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,360
I think GPT has crashed on my phone

1657
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,440
Is. Which is why I also consider GPT as good

1658
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,520
Unable to say bye. but i hope the audience

1659
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,840
Enjoyed it. and we'll be back with another

1660
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,000
Great science episode very-very soon. thank you

1661
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,880
You. Thank you. So friends, this was today's

1662
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,760
Experimental Blockbuster Episode. Tell me

1663
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,800
How did you like the episode? ofcourse like me

1664
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:48,960
I keep saying AC Sir will come back to TRS

1665
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:51,679
But. So keep supporting us. keep sending end

1666
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,600
Recommendations for these episodes. Such tech and

1667
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,600
The science episodes are very dear to my heart

1668
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,000
It's close. but i am looking for guest

1669
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,800
Recommendations as well as topic recommendations.

1670
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,400
So, send in your input and we will follow up

1671
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:07,199
On TRS. The Run Show will return with this Sir

1672
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:11,000
But. but until then keep supporting, keep

1673
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:11,000
Listening, keep growing.
