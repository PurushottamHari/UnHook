Hello friends, welcome all of you Ranveer at the show. Let's start this Interesting journey. Ok. Crisper Biggins Curing Genetic Disorders. tell me sir What is Crisper? CRISPR is a genetic Editing is technology. If you have a child Do you want him to grow up to be 6 feet tall? Make it 6 inches. If she has brown eyes then you You can enter that code in it. you can have any Designer characteristics that you want. Do You Think Human Cloning Is Reality will it be made? It can be made even today. Technology is It is available. I took Ranveer's DNA Took it. For example, I stole every single hair I did it. From that I got your DNA Extracted it. So I am Ranveer's new I can make a clone. Wow! When we say that AI will cause loss of Jobs and Substitution of Jobs. this is a Very real. We are there now. Today's India The entire IT industry is about to collapse. There is a chip that we put inside our brain with the outside world will be connected and we will connect them with our thoughts Will be able to control. what do you think Will this become an actual reality by 20-30? AI companions pass during test for Emotional bonding. it will have emotions just Like humans. You ain't got no wife For example. So you adopted a robot Then that robot will be able to emote just Like human. Wow. artificially if you Will make your children super intelligent it's gonna cause a buffercation of the human Rest in Super Intelligent Super Rich People And poor people who are left behind. This is the one with Abhijeet Chawla and Ranveer The combination is legendary. But this What I will say about this episode is that this Is one of the most mind blowing episodes. We enjoyed a lot. uh let's record this Time. I am sure you will enjoy it while You listen. If you are also in future regime Do you have interest? If you want to know that What will happen because of AI? what after that will be? How will our life be? if you If you like shows like Black Mirror then you will enjoy this future special v abhijeet Chavda on DRS. [music] We have been planning this podcast for several years. I have done it. but today we are executing Upon it. Futurism. it's called futurism Are. Let's talk about futurism. Yes. Today we will talk about futurism. That means it is a bit tech oriented It is a podcast but there will be an element of cleaning, The element of science will remain and that of the future The element will remain. The way AI has changed the world changed it in the same way many new ones Technologies are coming that will transform the world into every Will change in 5 year chapter. We are Sir today What do you think about the podcast episode? Would you like to give a preview to the audience? See We will see in five years' time. What new technologies may come? We AI has been asked what it thinks The next five years are going to be next five years in the next five years and every How much will we review the prediction Is it accurate and how timely is it? is this It could be sooner than that or it could take some more time It will be repeated and so on. gave a tremendous output we have chat gpt and parallelly i have Also got chat gpt in my hand. Ahhh Wherever we both get stuck, Respect to Some Technology We Will Reference Chat GPT. Good idea. that ah Advancement in the subject of flying cars What is? Advancements in Nano-bots What is it? And so on. so we will use The Help of AI. So this is TRS's first Episodes where there is Actively One and a Half Guest I am sitting. one guest in front of me which Is ac. And I have half a guess on my phone. in The Form of Chat GBT. Ok. ahh, you want to Talk about the prompt we gave? We What was the prompt given to Ah Chat GBT? ah please predict the technologies that could emerge in the future in the eight five Year intervals till under 2,000, right? 2,200, 200. Yes. Which is very far away. but came think it's important to know these concepts because I promise you if your business ambitions in life or if you just If you want mental stimulation, you will gain a Lot from this episode. Ok? so lets begin sir at 2025 which is now which is Now AI can be used as pilot in vehicles Revolutionised Transport and Crisper Begins curing genetic disorders AI Copilots in Vehicles Revolution Transport I Think I'm Talking About Tesla style tesla style auto driving a cars are still in countries like the US where But there are very good traffic rules We already have self driving there Cars have software inside them, earn it! access to the and to the visual aids so that The car can drive itself. we are I don't think it is legal to drive here it like that but that technology has arrived Is. so i think it's gonna be implemented Now so AI copilot so you sit you AI Brother, tell me if I want to go to this place He will take you along so we are almost there Right Now or So That It Makes Sense to AI Pilot do you think it will be possible in India. It is a bit challenging in India because India There are no traffic rules. No one in India He keeps doing anything. So AI will have to Do Vai Defensive Driving. if in india if it has to be implemented then and for this reason Because of road conditions are also a problem Is. So it is a bit challenging in India Implement it at least at this time. Edge Far as I know. When you're now in a Tesla When you sit, there is a screen in the middle. Software updates for more Tesla cars It keeps happening. One of the recent updates Aloud mapping of the near surroundings. i.e that when you're actually driving a Tesla If a truck is going in front of you, your Tesla is able to understand that truck is in front and that's not on the screen but a truck The image appears. it can also Identify people. it can also identify Those who live in western countries na chote road pe which doesn't allow you to go On that. So technology has reached your place You get that 3D imagery in real time It goes around you. I am sure it is Using the Same Imagery to Facilitate the Self Driving. Absolutely yes. so it's like A LiDAR like system of the radar mapping type He knows what is in front of him. So According to that he creates the whole imagery Is. And that is what you use it for Navigate. same i don't know how it would do it On Indian Roads. because because indian The conditions are evolving very fast and you Predictive Can't analyze what's next It is going to happen. Suddenly someone ahead on the road From Against the Rules. so i think india It will happen eventually in me too. May B and It will take three, four, maybe five years. But Eventually the technology will grow to such an extent that It can run autonomously in India too To the vehicles. We Suppose this is the situation of an autonomous vehicle actually It became real. Yes. that's a very simple way of a lot of people Losing their jobs. A lot of people who are on Uber there are drivers who are taxi drivers, those who are rickshaw drivers, they will have to Look for other occupations. Yes. So when we Says AI will cause loss of jobs and Substitution of Jobs. this is a very Real. We are there now. We are already there. In 10-15 years. No, today India has five The entire IT industry is about to collapse. Let us tell you, there are AI agents. AI Agent means it's an AI system that He has all these competencies. From the lates I've Requirements for an AI Agent gave the document and a dis document of the given software. He will read it and his Use whatever skill sets he has He will make the software and give it to you. He An AI agent who is a programmer. Now We will give its output to another AI agent. Who is the tester? He will do the unit testing. will do regression testing and whatever else He got the bugs back from the programming agent Will give it to. Programming agents, all that. It will appear and solve the bugs. Back Testing will be done. once everything is Approved. You give it to the client. Where But is your human programmer in this? Where But do you have a human tester in this? India The entire IT industry could be destroyed by this Is. So we are almost already there today. All the entrepreneurs we have nowadays are like me Let's all talk about AI agents I am talking to you. g a agent word meaning What? AI Agent is the simplest definition of this That's it, he's one of your AI employees. Yours You hired a programmer. For A skill set that an example programmer has Is. He knows these programming languages Are. Take the design document to him I know how to code. Doing Unit Testing It comes. he can communicate with testing Employees and so on. AI Agent One The software is your employee. AI Enabled Employee That's the Simplest Definition of the AI ​​agent. Ok. a little Experiment. Yes absolutely. Ok. Hey chat gpt can you tell me when There won't be a requirement for any Uber Taxi drivers because self driving Wood may have become an automated job in the future As These Cars in the Future Will Be Driven Bye AI bots. There for Uber drivers I don't have a job to do. Realistically according to you when you predict that That is a reality. Self-driving tech already exists and is operational in LIMITED CONDITIONS. Google is a company VMO Fully Driverless Robotaxi Services in Phoenix Arizona and San Francisco Cruise by General Motors doing same till Regulatory issues paused it Tesla made a full Self-driving service has been tested. It's in beta but requires humans Supervision Realistic Global Timeline Breakdown 2027 to 2029 Dubai San Francisco Fully autonomous Uber like in Singapore Flats in certain areas by 2030 to 35 Wherever there are developed cities there will be autonomous Driving will happen Driver job loss begins at Scale in Places Like California UAE and parts of china by 204 40 majority of Uber rides in first world urban Areas will be autonomous. Developing countries like India, Brazil, Africa Will Still Rely on Humans Drivers because of bad infrastructure, Legal Issues and Affordability But by 20-50 most global urban rights Will be autonomous. Hmm. Manual Driving Becomes a niche and luxury experience. Uber driver as a job could vanish in urban areas Zons. That is to say, 25 years I will lose jobs. Look at India like what happens in the country that we have taxi Driver unions who are in politics Politics also comes into play. so because of politics in because of these unions you may Have delays in these things. but i think by 20-40 in any reasonable country you will have Autonomous drivers. Perhaps this is a developed There will also be a country sign. Yes absolutely. Yes. Like if autonomous driving in your country Bye 20-40 is not happening. it means you are A Backward Country Essentially. Ok. Ok. now moving on because i am sure we will Talk about the future of transport in the The future of this podcast also. Ok. Who The second prediction is for 2025 CRISPR Begins curing genetic disorders. Tell me Sir what is Crisper? Crisper One Genetic editing technology. What are jeans it occurs? What are jeans? See our Accept for red in every cell in the body Blood cells contain DNA like other cells Is. DNA is a very complicated thing It is a big molecule. Ok? in that DNA within our own structure The genetic code is encoded. that when a child what about his eyes when he is born will it be colour? What colour will his hair be? How light or dark will her skin be? will be? How intelligent will he be that big How tall and short will it become The Characteristics Inside Your DNA is encoded and in your genetic code Sometimes there may be some defects also Due to which you may get genetic diseases. Are. For example, in some people's hearts There is a hole. some children have this if it is then it would cause blue baby syndrome Is. His skin turns bluish and For that surgery has to be done. some people there is a cliff pet which is here Some cuts happen. what some people say Are? Down syndrome happens and so on. There are some such genetic diseases. Spina bafida for example that also possibly is A genetic disease. so all these are rare There are defects in your genetics that you may have You can inherit those things. So Crisper is a Genetic editing is a technology that is used in five years ago me too seven years ago me I don't remember it exactly. it's a recent that thing has developed to him and those who Nobel Prize was given to those who developed this technology I also got a prize for that. right now this Through technology you can customize individual genes You can edit it. So if you want a baby Ok? The new baby is going to be yours. You Do you want him to grow up to be a man? If you are 6 foot 6 inch tall then you can wear that coat in it You can put it. If you need that his If you have brown eyes or green eyes then you They can do that too. if you have red hair If that child needs it, you can do that too Are. So whatever characteristics you Theoretically you can do all this. But for that the technology is a little different It has to be advance. So I think we are going to do that right now we're getting to the level where Can do this editing reliably. So for this He is making this prediction and we are Almost there now. Ok Right now our Let's bring five guests to this show. Let go Hi GPT please talk in Hindi. The podcast is being recorded here. a hindi Welcome all podcast listeners to me On The Ranveer Show. Hello friends, all of you Welcome to The Ranveer Show. Today's our The conversation is going to be very special. So connect Stay tuned and let's get this interesting started Journey. Ok. Chavda sir also sat with us This is Abhijeet Chavda. Say hi to them too. Hello Abhijeet Chavda Sir. I am very happy Seeing you on the show. for today's discussion Very excited. Ok. please human use am and are like beings so that It felt like there was a real person sitting next to us It is not that he has gone with me. Yes absolutely. So Abhijeet sir i want you for today's conversation We are very excited and hope that Our listeners also liked this episode very much. will come. The document you generated not on which we made all those predictions Were. A, we just placed that document in front of us. Do you remember that document we saw this afternoon? It was generated. Yes, I remember that document. You have mentioned future projections and plans in it. Had written. What is special about it? Do you want to do it now? So the public should not get any Tell us about Crisper in sentences. how to give a baby crisper technology Will you explain? Tell that to the public. Listen to the audience I am paying attention to what you say. Absolutely. So CRISPR is a biotechnological tool that helps us Gives the power to make changes in DNA. Just like we edit text on a computer Similarly, it changes our genes Can. It helps in curing diseases, growing crops improve or create new life structures It helps. In simple words it is a biological There is a cut, copy, and paste tool. Ok. not me now tell me in the next 5 years Realistically Crisper's can change a person's life Tell us through your mind According to. In the next 5 years, humans will be able to use CRISPR Some important changes may happen in your life Are. Treatment of certain genetic diseases such as It may be possible. for whom there was no treatment before It was not there. even in diseases like cancer Targeted therapies may be developed. it How are you feeling? We have been podcasting for 5 years I have been doing this for one year. but it happened before How to podcast? no no there is magic with such which Can't be replaced. A ok. but not one We generate the text. we are 20 Years From Now what will crisper Be able to do as long as it generates She responds, you tell me what that means How does CRISPR actually work? is it i heard that i think it's chemistry at play chemistry at play I personally don't even know biochemistry exactly how does he do it but it's about Not editing like the way I said it was cut copy paste you go in to the genetic code and you have the ah adenine tryptophan guanine all this at gct all that code and you can from that over here instead of this ti i want to make it a g and you can actually do it So you are saying that that DNA strand There are a lot of things embedded in it. You can take out some things from it. You can add some things. can add yes, you can remove it, you can delete it, You can change it. Whatever you want to do then it will work properly if you are precise it should be exactly what you say do not introduce any defective code in there essentially hmm Cancer Prevented Treated Ore Ky Crisper Eradication of genetic diseases like cystic Fibrosis in sickle cell disease in adults be able to receive inbody gene editing to Treat and reverse genetic diseases. Wow! We that's interesting a Human beings may be able to get annual Genome health checkup means your own Suppose if there is something wrong with the gene code You are 20 years old now but your gene code has It is written that my friend might get cancer in the future If possible, it could probably be edited out Based on CRISPR technology Anti Aging And Longevity Therapies which are a huge craze It has been made because of Brian Johnson there are genes that accelerate aging they could BB Switched Off and Crisper Might Extend Healthy Life Span to 10 by 10 Two 20 years. Hmm. Then it is written Dizer Babies. We just talked about that. tell me a little Till then what is designer babies? Designer babies. So my IQ from Lets It is 120. for example this hypothesis It is hypothetically. and my wife's too IQ from lats IQ from lats is 120. So most likely our children will be His IQ is also around that of others will be. But I've got a kid with a 150 IQ Needed So if we can determine which genes determine IQ Which other genes can increase IQ? can determine then we can tweet those jeans and i can have a child that is super Intelligent. And if I want to My child is double my height or whatever you know you can have any designer Characteristics that you want. Batista Like the body. Yes. Batista as Dave Batista body and einstein like ah brain It's kind of a thing. [music] ok dear baby ok ek final line di hai by 2045 chrisor could be curing disease Extending Live Designing Trades redefining biology but it will raise the The Most Profound Ethical Questions of the What does century mean sir, is it ethical? See, we have evolved through doing all this Biology Through Darwinian Selection Theory All that our evolution says is that humans Being has a roughly average life span A typical human being is about 80 years old. The year will live. If you are artificially The life span of the rich people has increased You are because obviously he has a crush on Chris There is a price. It's gonna cost some money. every No one will be in reach to have the son of Gene therapy done to them. So those rich people they will increase their life span, their Will increase intelligence. Make your kids super smart If you make us intelligent then it is going to create a situation where people who have pass for whatever is in paisa nahi hai woh We will become an inferior human race, it's Gonna cause a buffering of the human race into super intelligent super rich people and poor people who are left behind so ye ethical concern is that's one example of Ethical Concerns on One Side Rich Super Humans and on the other side the general public yes Who is basically just a human being. He is a human being. Yes. I mean you and I right now They are humans. We are not super humans. So We will have this ability in our hands to transform ourselves into gods Essentially. We are super humans. Superman. Hmm those who have money can do this Will find it. Is it ethical? Or everyone gets this chance Should meet. We are going to launch GPT in 2025 and up How Expensive Are CRISPRs Till 2030 Related Treatments Please Give Me An Output in rupees and not dollars Realistic Projection for Crisper Related Treatment Cost in India 2.5 crore minimum there we go there we go see it right there and this is the most basic one Are these things globally approved? Treatments Like Vertex for Sickle Cell Anemia hmm cost cost 2.5 to 3.5 crore But patient. there we have it one time Treatment but it will cost that much. Wow! There is also a projected cost table has given it. ok where it is written All this diabetes cancer will be there roughly by 2028 is there a chance it could come down to 25 to 50 Patient at the lax. Ok. bye bye that Time. Yes. But It's Still Limited Access Early adopters only. hmm there we have It. so eventually as time goes by yours jo The cost of the treatment will go down Still but it's gonna be a price Barriers are obvious and not everyone can afford it will be able to do it or it is saying by 2030 there is A chance middle class Indian may be able to Afford Basic CRISPR Based Disease Correction we especially with health insurance Reforms ok there might be a make in india biotech scale up make good in India CRISPER Prime Minister CRISPER plan yes im sure something like this crisper What might be going on in our country? I am not Aware of it. If something like this is going on. But Creeper is a technology, right? There is technology. Yes. So, this technology Many companies can be formed above. can become Is. Of course. Ok. who invented it Was? I don't remember. I think there was a lady Perhaps. Ok. But roughly in that range. So The minimum expenditure would be Rs 30 lakh. if at all If you want a basic crisper treatment Too. Yes absolutely. Ok. Should we move on? Let's move on. This is a speed podcast. Ok. 2030 Home Robots Developed Emotional Intelligence What do you mean? Meaning, if you make your robot say let's have a robot that does your sweeping and mopping, He sweeps and mops you, does your cooking, Chop your onions, stop chopping the cucumber He does. So bye 20-30 he is saying this, his The emotions will come. He will have feelings. If If you tell him to do his work quickly, he He will cry. we and so on do you want this Robot Will he be able to read your emotions here? Friend, my boss is not happy today. If your let's have a dog if you have a dog then that He understands your emotions the day you are happy He also becomes happy. the day you are sad it will console you maybe like this the ability to read the emotions of It will come in robots. Another Thought Do some experimenting. Absolutely. Ok. Hi GPT Are You Emotionally Intelligent Now Answer in Hindi for a human being Tell me five quickly with ams and ass In Sentences Look, I'm an AI, so I have They don't have emotions like humans do, but I am trying to understand your points and respond to them I take your feelings into consideration while giving. I mean, as we're talking right now, I I try to make it comfortable for you and Be relevant. But my way of talking So do you understand my feelings? yes your tone of voice, your choice of words And from the questions I can guess that you What mood are you in or what emotions are you going through have been. then answer accordingly I will try. I apply it. I don't apply it. I understood your feelings and their meaning I try my best to take care. Ok. This is where you printed the document You Said Home Robots Develop Emotions Intelligence Explain three sentences related to this. You what are you trying to say and then this Also tell me if there is any such company in the world Which home robots are already developing Is. And also tell me that a home for Rs. How much will the robot cost? which is absolutely top Off the line home robot will be hers in 2030 What will be its price? Absolutely. So home robots develop emotions Intelligence means that future domestic Robots will not only do work, but Will also understand our emotional signals. Meaning if you are happy, sad or tired If yes, then it will react according to your need do. Now there are many companies in the world like this Working on home robots. Such as Boston Dynamics, Soft Bank Robotics Or for paper and Amazon Astro Robot For. These companies are making robots more Smart, useful and emotionally intelligent She is busy making it. now if top of the line If we talk about home robots, by 2030 such The cost of robots can be between 20 to 30 lakhs which depends on their features and brand Will do it. And the most basic robots What will be their cost? The cheap ones. The most basic of robots include limited There will be features like household chores and basics Interaction Their value will be around 5 to 10 by 2030 It could be lakhs. These robots are common household be designed for use and An affordable option for early adopters There will be options. It will basically be like a car. Home robots means basic ones cost Rs 5 lakh The expensive ones cost Rs 30 lakh. Of 30 lakhs. Yeah. Tyres. Price in different tyres I will get it. but i also feel if its 30 lakhs There will be robots, people will buy them. I Mean It's going to make a life much easy. one time There is investment. Yes. in it automatically Software updates will come. battery in it It will be. So, there will be some running charge for it. but overall i think it's a one time Investment. Do you think it will be 20-30 years Will this become the actual reality? it is possibile because at this time you will see that robotics The development that is going on in technological The development is quite good. some robots These are the ones who are mimicking the humans muscular skeletal structure all the same which We have muscles in our body in the same way They have been designed. and quite agile There are robots. so i think by 2030 this There is definitely a possibility. a i think it was kawasaki na kawasaki ne A new horse yes that robotic horse released The video I generated was actually really good it is not real it is not real but Is it a concept or a concept I think it is basic The concept has been made, I think they have a Basic prototype but so much capability It doesn't have it yet I think that's on AI Generated video but very good concept hay i would like to have one of this or Go for a small walk on a nice track Absolutely ok next with a robotic horse Next Update of 2030 Organ Printing Hits main stream hospitals. Hum Organ what is printing sir? You have 3D You must have heard about printing. To you anything from lets to mugs if you If you want to print then you can have a 3D Printer. You put the dish in it. I think Put the materials and they will print it for you will give. 3D printed mug or if you want nowadays I heard that you can also print AR15 rifles You can do it. so now soft tissue Printing technology is developing Apparently. So this is saying that by 2030 You can use human heart, human liver or whatever Complex Bio Biological Structures you will be able to print it and in that you You will be able to give your DNA so that your body If you want to insert that organ inside then your body's immune system Don't reject it. He should consider it as his part. If we see what happens today, someone is late liver failure or someone's heart If there is a failure then they need an organ Someone else's transplant has to be done organ that has died They take his organ and put it inside. and this I would like to tell the audience that as many I have talked to the doctor This is about transplants in India It has become a huge problem because There are very few organ donors in our country. It is very little. So if someone actually I need organs, I need heart, I need liver, You need eyes, this is a very difficult challenge It happens for the common Indian. yes absolutely Absolutely. I believe there are cues. Very There are long queues. There are long queues. Yes. The demand is very high and the supply is very high It is less. what we are now is that if you What organ do you take? Your kidneys fail due to late It has happened. You had to take someone's kidney. So This kidney's genetic code is from someone else It is of. So your body's immune system he will consider it a foreign object and attempts to destroy it and if such If it happens then in one month whatever organ you have It will be destroyed and you will have to do the same thing again the problem will be that you have lost a kidney. You don't have any kidney left. So For that you need to take anti rejection drugs. which affects your immune system It suppresses and that gives you no relief from the lettuce You will suffer from minor illnesses too Death may occur. So if you have seen a 3D organ Print it out and put your DNA in it Your genetic code is your own organ and you have any immune suppressing medicine You will not have to take any medicine. These There will be a huge revolutionary change. when these It happens. If we are around 2030 then this will happen If it goes then the richest people will be its You will be able to avail the benefit first. We this too It would be somewhere in the range of Rs 25-30 lakh. I think possible ok moving on 2035 AI assistants begin replacing White collar jobs. What does white collar mean? white collar means you You are not working on the road. You You are not doing construction. you in the office Sitting in a small AC cubicle You are working in a cubicle. thats White collar jobs. basically in today's days you Can you say if you are working with a computer. Computer Intellectual Work. Yes. Brain are you thinking or are you his manager Stay tuned, Project Manager wherever you're talking to People, you are inside a building. you have no There is no need to do manual labour. it's Intellectual work mainly on computers. This is called a white collar job. so I am saying this That by 2035 AI assistance will start Replacing white collar jobs. I so say I am doing it, it will happen from today. It's already happening. From I Wood. If you have AI today Agents are the ones who create your software Can be done. If you look at today's Technology cursor is for example which Can write any code. I heard that Claude Even if you tell someone to give a link to a website Give it to them and you tell Claude to tell me You need such a website within a few In minutes I am sure the whole code is ready that he will give you ₹1 lakh right now Had to pay someone to make the website You are getting it for free today to make All you have to do is ask him whether he how do i implement you are playing clud GPT Deep See How I Used GPT I have done Claude and Deepsea so far We haven't used it, we mean the audience I would like to give a suggestion. I play a lot I have been with AIS. it's a healthy Practice to play with threes and fours. Three and Four of This. Yes. because different There are strengths. different for each one There are biases. and you should play Biases should be tested with them. Political opinions should be asked. ask this what should you say about humans Do you think so? What do you think about society? I think I saw this one a few months ago Had used it. Right? We've read Vinson Churchill I had asked about it. Something had done like this. and some other way of doing it is the same work Give flow instructions to every AI. They Will implement it differently. Yes. and you will be able to tell whether this task is good or not Maybe a clot is better for that. this task Deep seek is better for this etc. Ok. This is what you have written in the 2035 section AI assistants begin replacing White collar jobs. can you please give me this Can you tell me five such white collar jobs? Which will definitely replace you according to you? yes, by 2035 some white collar jobs which There is every possibility of being replaced by AI He is a data entry clerk, this job is Can be done faster with automation. Second Translators Language Translation Now AI The tools are easy to do. Third Customer Service Representatives Chatbus and Virtual assistants are taking their place. Fourth, bookkeepers, accounting softwares and AI doing financial analysis Are. Fifth Research Analysts, Data Processing and report generation now with AI It has become very fast. I think so Lots of white collar jobs right now It will start replacing. The Examples The information they have given is quite valid Course. but programmers programmers It will be replaced from today itself. so ye bye 2035 so I think all of them will be white collar workers Jobs would be under threat by that time. Hmm. Definitely there is a possibility. See the I Think The one guarantee is your job profile is fully It will become moldy. This is an old AI base The narrative is that the person who uses AI Does one know how to do it or does one who has learnt it have more will move forward. Absolutely. See Technological Progress has always been happening. and who People Embrace Technological Progress and adopt new technologies with enthusiasm They adapt. Those people will thrive. I didn't tell anyone I think Sharan Jaan Finance With Sharan. So I was talking to him. He told me that these Big Four The companies are EY, Deloitte, KPMG Many job profiles will change Because they are basically consulting firms Yes. Right now this whole consulting world is Going to be kind of redirected Towards AI Agents. Yes yes. then i know that There are a lot of changes in the corporate world. Will come. Nowadays I have heard that AI systems like chatty some deep research in it something like that So a feature has come which is essentially an I think PhD level analyst works at the end That is very long and very detailed to you. will give you an accurate report which you Fact check will have to be done but essentially If you are a lawyer, you have your law form. In that case you have 20 employees. You Essentially you can give the same work to AI. Give will do a much better job much faster you But to do fact checking, people We will have to employ legal research If you have a big case, it is a legal case If something is going on with the company then Its documentation is very voluminous thousands of pages of documents and that Your assistants read all this. and they have to do pass through all the Documentation so AI can do this now very much fast ok gbt i would like to know that I have heard that there are Big Four companies. So tell me the names of those big four companies. Then tell me that according to you and your deep Research Are there many jobs because of this feature? Will be replaced in Big Four companies and If yes, then when? Tell me the truth objectively. Ofcourse the big four companies are EY Ernst Young Deloitte KPMG and PwC Price Water House Coopers these companies Mainly Consulting, Auditing and Working in financial services, now working on AI There will definitely be some jobs in these companies after coming Will be replaced. especially data analysis, in Auditing and Basic Consulting. AI Tools can process data faster And can provide deeper insights. By which Reduced need for multiple existing profiles will go. To be honest, in the next 5 to 10 years This change will become clearly visible. Especially 2030. By now these companies will fully integrate AI will do it and change the profile of many jobs Will go. answer in hindi how many Percentage of jobs will be replaced in the The Big Four? In the next 10 years, the Big Four companies will About 30 to 40% of jobs will change due to AI Can be done. means either it is completely will be automated or their work will The method will change completely. Will MBS remain relevant in the coming 510? In years? Yes, MBS will still be relevant but Their focus will change. next 5 to 10 years MBA graduates are trained in AI, data, Business with Analytics and Technology More attention will have to be paid to strategies. Meaning technology with traditional skills The need to understand and adopt will increase. aw ok now tell me that what you wrote in the 2035 column that Lanvity Therapies Extend life by 30 years so I was born It happened in 1993 when was your birthday sir 76 sir what happened in 1976 so you have written here that longevity replies extend life by 30 years what does this mean can you say this are you sure therapies will be available and if we Can you buy these therapies? Tell me this also. Hindi I answer. if we can buy dos Therapies, what will be the price of these Repis in Rupees? Ok? So long till 2035 There may be age-related therapies available that It can increase our age by 30 years. Their That means gene editing, stem cells Therapy or repair of worn out body parts To rejuvenate. If we talk about the price These therapies will be expensive in the beginning. Meaning It can also go from 50 lakhs to 1 crore Depending on the type and complexity. The procedures may be somewhat painful, such as in technology on injections or surgeries With improvement it may become less painful. Now there is a healthy alternative to these therapies. It is important to maintain your lifestyle Because it's Longevity Therapy's Lifestyle Work on improving both science and biology will do it. We would like to tell you something Longevity About the angle. I Think Dionne Johnson Genuinely he started a revolution I have done it on the world stage. I Think Indian Longevity is not often talked about Do. I feel that there is a health revolution too Fitness has started in our country now and Health Revolution. It's a good thing. See, lulzivity means increasing our lifespan. If our average is in India I am not sure What longevity! Average life span 70 It might be around 70 years in India. So If this increases by 30 years, then the average Indian The person will live for 100 years. 30 years more add ho Will go. How will you do this? Different therapies It will be. There will be different procedures. A Focus area is the length of the telomeres which are shortened It happens. The DNA that is in our body in our body in the form of chromosomes It is inside our cells. And if you are a If you look at a chromosome, its two ends The parts of the end are called tillobears They say. and it is found that as a As a person grows older, the telomeres The length gradually shortens. because of that This causes aging in our body. So the man People will get wrinkles. The different sciences And these are the symptoms of aging. So if you have which is the process of telomere shortening If you stop it, your ageing will also stop Will be done. And if you look at Tilomors If you can theoretically take it back then you It is believed that it can actually reverse aging Is. So this is one of the focus areas. And If there is some progress in that then maybe we We will see that we can reverse aging Or you can at least stop it. Basically actively in different domains Research is ongoing. Crisper is one of them. Organ printing is another. all these domains By 2035. That means after 10 years, getting combined Yes everything it will add to longevity. But First and foremost longevity as a The service will be available for rich people. Naturally everyone is interested in technology It is very expensive. Then slowly he There are parades everywhere. Ok. Moving on. Moving On. A What's Next? 2040 neural Interfaces Allow Thought Based Computing. V Should talk about Neuralink. Ah Second Brain Implants restore lost memories. These Both things are associated with Neuralink Is. Possibly possibly. Definitely There is an intersection of both technologies. these 15 It is a year later. They are talking about 2040 Are. Right? Neural Interface Allow Thought Based Computing. What could this mean? What is a neural interface? This is probably a This is a chip that we will put inside our brain Which will be connected with the outside world. May be WiFi, Bluetooth whatever whatever technology then this directly physically some electrodes got damaged or Probes have been done which are of our brain there is a tissue, I will go inside and I will connect the brain to an external device and multiple devices and we use our thoughts to access them make the devices communicate with Will be able to communicate. control them Will find it. So what happens today? if we If we want to write a program then we have to type it falls on a keyboard or from you on your phone or you can give voice Commands to chat gpt. Right now you thought You will be able to give commands. You don't even have to say It will have to be done. so you can communicate with a Computer. you can control a computer and Multiple Devices Just By Thought. it's like Telepathy. Hmm. So, It's Almost Magical Like this is the situation. but, or it could be Is. Definitely, soon. ah second is also Link to this same topic. It is written that the brain Implants restore lost memories. I am Skeptical about this. See Lost Memory what happens is that something happens in your brain The information was solid but now it has disappeared Has gone. So there are two cases in this. either that The information is still vague, but you can You are not able to access it. because of Whatever reason. if this is the situation You may be able to access brain implants That. But if that memory is overwritten with a new memory or that memory it is completely gone, it has been deleted so you You will not be able to restore it. so it this is Conditional this will depend. Ok Chat GBT has a small question. Let go I ask. Chat a little with GBT Let's take it. ok chat gbpt please answer in Hindi. A what Elon Musk is doing with Neura A Vo in 5 Sentences with Link Please explain. Suppose a five year old child If someone is listening to you then these are very easy ways Please explain it to me. and the second thing tell me this that what you printed in the 2040 column that neural interfaces allow thought based Computing. From that perspective, tell me that Social media What will be the evolution in? means we are social How will you use the media? these three four Tell me in sentences. Absolutely. So Neuralink's work is our Putting a small chip in the brain so that we can Can talk directly to the computer or machine. Like music without touching hands, just by thinking Listen or watch a video. It is for those It can also be helpful for those who are unable to walk Can. Now till 2040 when thought based computing If it comes, think how social media will change. Just think about it and post your post. without typing or on someone's post You will be able to react just by thinking. From this social media will become more personal but New challenges of privacy will also emerge. it The future is very exciting and we You will have to keep yourself prepared for the changes. I have a friend named Saket Modi. that one Is a cyber security expert. They Basically it is said that in the coming 5, 10, 15 years in almost everyone A small utility oriented device inside There will be some computer. The chip will remain. And If that chip is present then that chip is hacked can also be. It can definitely happen. So Suppose if everyone had neuraling installed Think about it in your skull. Yes. And someone else The terrorist group realized that good How to hack. So neither does that chips hack Yes, but that whole person will get hacked. Less It can retrieve all your memories in less than Will find it. whatever you think whatever you think We also know that it will not remain private. Imagine that your inner most thoughts are Maybe he will know. It's possible. Hmm. what would you like to say based on this Conversations with GPT are progressing well Everything we have spoken about. What to say would you like it? I think technology is very fast Progress is being made. specially in the Field of AI. and its so fast Progress is being made that we are not we may Not be aware of the risks of all the risks. And even if we are aware, then it is so soon Progress is happening that we may not be able to To mitigate all the risks. so like you said that if someone implants Neuralink but adequate security measures It might not be possible. in that case somebody Able to Steal Your Memories. Hmm. and maybe God. So there are many possibilities. and its Look at this we definitely think I will the scientists and the engineers We will create the technology. But this ethical There are concerns, there is ethical risk, mitigate it We may need to use legislation to do this Have to do it. that will give the tension to politicians to legislate things over and try to Control everything. so these are the challenges Coming up. These. These. These. These. These. These. These. These. These. These. We have to face all these challenges Will be. Hmm. And we are already there today have been done. Sir I watch more TV shows and movies I don't watch it these days. An out and out at 4:00 Recommendation for all viewers. If Those people liked this conversation It has been happening. So please don't go to Netflix Watch Black Mirror. a lot of who All the Black Mirrors around the world are futurists praises him a lot because he says that this is a very accurate description of the There is a future. There is a slight negative outlook Regarding the future. and the black mirror is mystic What? Yes. That means it says that like Suppose we talked about Neuralink, then one Neuralink as an Actual Full Episode Technology is shown. then the scary ones The outcomes are that for example, suppose if If someone commits a crime then what then 2025 If someone commits a crime in He is sent to jail. Brain chips with Neura Link in 2040 If someone commits a crime because of They can change it by manipulating their chip Perception of time. Good. That means their The brain will feel like it has spent 20 years spent in jail but actually in real life he's just spent a day thru a Software. Good. Good. or all of these Possibility may come. Yes. Yes. so such Thought Experiments Are Shown in Black In the mirror. Good. Good. very very Interesting. Ah and highly recommended. meaning it's probably the one show that affected my creativity the most as a media Professional. ok ok. Interesting. End It fuels this episode as well. Ok. Moving on. Yes. Ok. Umm 2045. Synthetic Biology Enables Designers Organisms. If you have a dog who wants to have wings If you want to give wings, you can probably do that. that's not that thing you know crazy stuff okay or I mean I don’t feel like expanding that Right Moving On To 2050 AI Generated Art Rivals Human Creativity it's basically saying that content creators there will be no jobs left for jobs yes artists painters whatever Musicians who are currently graphic novelists Ghibli says about the designers Everyone is doing it because of the generated images yes but he is eventually content Yes, May Be You will be true for creators too Will Have AI Design AI Generated Podcast what not who knows music you know high Quality Music AI Generated Films A I generated films which will be even better Than Human Human Generated Films Possible is it or i am pretty sure in 20 50 there will be such software that you can just tell me that I want to see a movie which The theme will be horror and Shahrukh will be the hero whose heroine will be Juhi Chawla and please one make a movie just that software will be to make the movie i'm sure it happens which is very It will be interesting, it will also be interesting, yes And according to my test you should have He will also know your taste, we are so content For creators For TV show runners This is the finale for the film people Years 20-50 is the deadline means another 25 years There are some left. hmm ah and the second one bio Implants become standard for health Optimization. means i am not sure that What does Bio Implants want to say? A sounds like a very dark scenario that her Someone will have a biological implant So that the government can see what you are doing There is a paraphernalia and it will be able to Predict's brother will have heart attack in six months If an attack is about to happen then you can take the Preventive measures and all that may happen They are saying something, meaning inside the body aadhar card perhaps something like that to that will know everything and that predictive analysis will be able to do that in six months this can be a This could happen to you within a year Osteoporosis will occur between 20 and 35 years So you do this. so, this will Essentially Extend Your Life Span and Quality of life. That's a dangerous thing. We don't want that much control. they be a loss of privacy. Yes. Ok. anything else you Want to talk about that? right now at this point bad i think we can move fast because here No, I don't think that GPT has also made any mistakes. Have planted it. Yes. the further you go the more Speculative it became. Speculative. Yes. Speculation. A ok. 2060 AI Companions Pass the Turing test for emotional bonding. What is Turing test sir? Turing The test is if you have a There is something on the other side of the screen. His if you communicate with and if you You won't be able to tell if there's a robot on your side or not Human is more than that thing on the other side It has passed the Turing test. because it is able to convince you that that is the That's what is human. So this Turing test Done. I think GBT did it Yes. Done. No? It's become official. Almost late. So what is written here? AI Companions pass the Turing test for emotions Bonding. well it's during this for emotional bonding emotional bonding it will have emotions just like humans if you You have a robot companion If you could not find a wife for example then you found one I adopted a robot, I mean I bought it, then that The robot will be able to emote just like a human being hmm wow okay so basically this There is a prediction for 2060, yes, that means what 35 years left 35 years from today ok to right Now I believe GPT passed the Turing test passed it can behave like a human being but they are saying that from an A little bit of emotional perspective It is speculative. I think even now if you I Think in two-three years it will be able to emote Just like a human. we are okay and the other Prediction Is Neural Augmentation Boost intelligence bean that brain you put a chip in Gave. Your IQ should be between 120 and 125 Went. It became 150. Now here's the timeline again It becomes interesting in 2065. hmm Mind uploading in clinical testing This means that you have a computer there is a system on which you can set up your your mind your consciousness upload if you can then it means copy paste sorry you 90 The years will be rough and wonderful, wood you do it What benefit will it give me? Let's see The advantage is that after my death My consciousness will remain alive even after In as a copy of my current consciousness. So If after 300 years someone thinks that I want to talk to Abhijeet Chawla wisdom if that so called wisdom is tapped in If you want to do it then there will be a copy for reference. We hope this will be a service to the society To have my consciousness there. But think about it if you are a genuine consciousness Consciousness and you are locked in a box Ho won't it be torture for you? we are this there is ethical concern and the other thing is that you if you upload consciousness into a Computers and a System It Doesn't Mean You Are Immortal. you will die and your consciousness will disappear She is original conscious, she will go. assume that means That there is consciousness within you. They then normal human life will be lived and human Death will die. Absolutely. But you are conscious of that xerox it and put it in the computer you will have a copy but you will surely die like in the star truck Let's show the captain that he goes from here to there If you go then whatever body is here, is destroyed and a copy is created there if it happens then it is not the same person it's a copy hum hum for perspective Shahrukh Salman Aamir will be 100 years old in 2065 honge kya baat hai it will be the 100th birthday This is how it means that mind uploading will happen Lead to a copy of Shahrukh, Salman and Aamir in your phone also. Yes, it is possible. Definitely. if they are still alive and they Can upload their minds. you may be able to Purchase a copy. Good. Ask him. Ok. GBT, this is what you wrote about 2065 In, Mind Uploading in Clinical "Tests." What do you mean? Actually Many Black Mirror episodes are based on this theme Are based. but you tell me what do you What do you mean by mind uploading? friend and this mind Due to uploading, the life of common people is affected How will it change? Ok. of mind uploading It means complete awareness or consciousness of the mind. Save it in digital form. As Just like you save a file on your computer your brain's memories, preferences, Personality and thought in the digital world To upload. Now this clinical test will be done till 2065 I can come in. This makes the lives of common people Revolutionary changes may occur. As Digitally connect with loved ones even after death being present in the new digital world Exploring yourself. New meaning to yourself in the new digital world Exploring means exploring the digital world You can live your consciousness in new forms Can be done. like in virtual reality Live in different avatars, explore new places or with loved ones in virtual space communicate. All this is in digital form will be. Ok. I disagree with that. it is a Copy of you. You are not doing all this. There is a copy of you that is doing all this. My Think about this for your grandchildren Yes, it will be beneficial if my grandfather is still alive With us. yes but for you It will not be beneficial. hmm so this kind of This will be a revolutionary thing but AI is not able to differentiate between two Consciousness. He is thinking that your It is a copy and that too is you. You are not. I I think we don't even talk about cloning Should be done. And here is actually the cloning Nothing was written about it. Interesting. Hey, tell me how far cloning has gone Has it arrived? Because I know pet cloning Is becoming a dream for a lot of you. People They say that my dog ​​loves me a lot I have more attachment. so before the dog dies I have stored some of his biological samples. and when cloning becomes possible then I bringing my dog ​​back to life another dog's life with a dog another I can spend one more innings. What is cloning? An organism is You can make an exact genetic copy of it. For example you have a Shanna, There is a dog. You took one of his hairs. He won't feel any pain by having his hair taken. That The hair has its genetic code inside it. Complete The genome is inside it. Now you can call a technician Give it to the genetic lab. he that will sequence the DNA and through genetic technology that is already available today Can make a replica. for example A sheep was cloned some 2030 years ago was dolly there the first ever cloning ever Done. Right now it's a lot of routine with rats and Small you know lower level organisms. So Cloning a dog can happen easily. Cat's It can be done easily. Technically human too Maybe but it is not ethically allowed. It is not legally allowed in most countries. So Definitely if your dog is dead You have some of his genetic samples. So from that you can get a new one with the same genetic code You can make a dog through the technology but it is not the same organism, it's a Different dog with the same genetics but here Also, we are talking about biology. I Think about the output given by GBT. mind uploading that is digital that is a digital technology yes big difference do you Think human cloning will become a reality even today If the technology can be made then it is available Is there exactly an ethical dilemma in this? The ethical dilemma is what you are doing God is suppose to do it if you have this I have the ability to take Ranveer's DNA For example, I stole every single hair your com is done fine with your brush You didn't even know I took a hair I extracted your DNA from it So I can make 15 new clones of Ranveer and then I can I don't know with her what will i do i have that evil mind no but i am sure there are lots of lots of Evil Things You Can Do With That One Religious Person Bring perspective tell it to soul will it be different or will it be different no 100% different soul will be there so you are playing god it is it's not a good thing right it means no human beings should have the ability and Capacity to do this but this is all there is today Your body is same, your soul is different and theirs is also different It may be different depending on what diet did they get the nutrition they got it late Life Paths Diverge Widely But they will have your DNA only, hmm Ok ok moving on in 2065 it was also written Mars Colonization Phase One Kicks Off I would like to say one thing, Mr. Ramakrishnan Joe actually I think is Donald Trump working with. Works out now Of the White House. I met him Almost 6 months ago. Good. From them I Asked about Elon Musk What is the final goal? They said that dude he is very very serious about mars Colonization. and every decision of he is Based on colonizing Mars eventually. We And here is the output of GPT saying that Mars Colonization Phase One Kicks Off by 2065 hmm i myself will be 70 years old I Disagree With This Timeline Very Very Very strongly think it's early i think it will the first phase will be 20 30-31 wow ya but do you you you you you you think it Trying to do what they call terraforming Terraforming takes a thousand years Terraforming Is Not Something You Do in 20 What is terraforming? This means that you are on a new planet You go there and the environment there You convert it through industrial scale Pluri scale processes and your focus is this Your goal is to protect the planet which Atmosphere is our environment I think Elon made it like a planet he said on Joe Rogan that if terraformed The first step is to do that heat up the planet because mars is very hot It is cold in comparison to our planet The first thing to do is to warm it up Its average temperature is about 25° Make it. Like average over meaning The temperature is 25°. So the first step is to do that on mars and then you can do another processes to thicken the atmosphere and have Liquid water and so on. But this process It is quite a long process. it will take two 300 Years perhaps. Minimum, minimum. Depends On which planet are you talking about? This Just ask? Ask. Because I don't have many I ask questions about cricket and football From JBT. and i have notice that it gives Me some rubbish output. Let's see what I say it. To be very honest. ok a GBT which you have given the output of 2065 mars colonization fuzz one kicks off a him Chavda sir is angry about this. They said that he does not agree and he is saying that very Likely this colonization much before that It will be. So analyze yourself once. Ask yourself this question GPT you have solved this 2065 Why did you give points? and why not earlier Please answer in Hindi and whatever voice you use You are turning off the output, I am a bit scared It should be felt in your voice. Ok. The estimate I gave for 2065 is different from many others. considering the current challenges. As Technical limitations, funding and space The complexities of establishing human settlements. But If progress is rapid and these challenges are met Mars colonization if the solution is found soon It might start even before that. It is possible I guess be a little cautious. Do you want to ask him something? No I am my I can give the ration. I will explain my Rational why I said 2030 2031 see this Time if you want to go to Mars. near you You must have a very powerful rocket Needed Elon Musk has just launched SpaceX Built a rocket called Through Starship Which is in the final stages of testing. There are still some issues in it. but they have The Money. they are the resources to do multiple Test a year by 2026 27 that rocket exactly It will be ready. Now every 26 months our There is a launch window to Mars because Of the plateau alignment. So Elon Musk's The objective is that initially an unmanned SpaceShipIp will go there. a bunch of starships Unmanned launches will be done which are there Will place cargo on the surface of Mars to humans on top and in the next phase Will send it possibly. So this is the first phase of Unmanned launches to Mars will soon begin 2030 2031. So this is their objective end They are definitely on track to do that. So I disagree with this. if eilon Musk is right if his company is on track will be able to do it by 2030 2031 that a human around the time period From perspective you can explain that life on mars How will it look if we are inside a dome will it remain or will it appear as it is Zindagi is a very good question initially Closed within Domed Environments environments if We have to go out in the wide open marsh We need to go into the atmosphere wearing a space suit Our temperature will reach a livable level and it will keep water and oxygen till will supply but we will protect our skin will not be able to expose to the martian atmosphere because there is almost The temperature is probably around -30 Average on average so initially inside the domes and within close environments You will eventually have to live for 100-200 years If we increased the temperature inside From Mars we may be able to go outside with mask gas mask and what oxygen Mask and walk around so it's slow I am wondering if there will be changes in this Some crazy person staying inside that dome throws a stone If he throws me on the dome then the rest will be humans what will happen look yes this is obviously We have to consider this when we design the DOM Let's bring someone's mental balance in check got spoiled and he tried to break it If you try to break it then first of all you We will have to see the thickness of the dome How thick do you want to make it? How much You have to make yourself resilient I need unbreakable glass. If you have multiple You have to give layers to the dome, think about that too It will have to be done. Then you also have to think about shot for example and all of them If the layer gets punctured then you should immediately What remedial major need to be done and so on. So we will design after thinking about all this. and I I'm sure they make a good job of that. Salute to the mind and passion of Elon Musk. That This is a very gutsy move. Absolutely. Absolutely Definitely. How do you even think that friend I want to go and live in Mars. hum what do you Think why is he thinking this way? now only Is definitely a pioneer. Definitely The Pioneer. He has always thought this way. Ahhh many people think about these things but he is actually done ah took the steps in the actions that are potentially going to allow him to do actually be the first person to have a Rocket going to mass. not a government but a Private company. Imagine that. Ok. Or We have arrived in 2070 till Cancer cured by nanobots I read about it in school in 2006 or so we have been talking since seven that's it almost 20 years ago now we but I don't Some technology advances in No Nanobots whether it has happened or not then we can Decide We Can First Discuss Nanobots what is it yes there are small machines How many small, how many small, I mean almost They operate at an invisible microscopic level We do. inside your body inside your body Can get into your bloodstream. Can repair separate individual cells Are. By going into individual sales, Components can also be modified. mitochondria or whatever else It is saying that these nanobots will go to your inside the body and they will know which cell which cells are healthy, which cells are cancerous and those They will be able to destroy the cancerous cells. So This will be a targeted therapy. You get an injection Give it. 1 lakh from let's in that injection There are nanobots. Hypothetically give such numbers I have been. these nanobots will go and within a week, as many cells inside your body as Whatever cancer cells there are, they will destroy them all. So this is a cure for cancer. So say this This is what they are saying. Little Check the same question in 20 years What has been the progress? Hi GBT we are have reached 2070. where you wrote that Cancer cured by nanobots. But this whole For the first time you can see Nano Bobots in the table You are mentioning directly 2070. That means nanobots had no role before that Will it not remain in human life? These Tell me. Tell me five things about a nanobot Related. Ok? Nanobes Tiny Machines One to 100 nanometers in size can be programmed to perform specific tasks On a microscopic level. Hum Bye 2030 Early Clinical Use Targeted Drug Delivery. Nanopots Can Carry Chemotherapy Only two cancer cells. That means when you Do you undergo chemotherapy treatment? There are side effects on the entire body. Absolutely they do. So they are saying that Nanobots can give you targeted recovery. We A blood stream surveillance nanobots your Basically all blood levels will be scanned. Inflammation level what can't they check at all It. and when some small problem occurs Nanobes will go into your body and tell you To you. But these are all early clinical uses. Micro Surgeries Non Invasive Procedures From inside your body. Wow. think of a Nanobots Clearing Artery Blockages Interesting Cost Estimate 10 to 30 Lacs per session initially Hum Mass used by 20-40 could bring it below one to 2 lax ok good bye 20 40 to 50 anti Aging Therapies Brain Machine Interface Increases In Immunity Immunity 2.0 we end Anobots Update Your Immunity Systems like a software patch nice Ah a basically given a scenario that if You are unwell, you are wearing a wearable patch Take. Then that patch will have nanobots in it. The nanobots will go into your bloodstream. Your body will also be scanned. If There is a bacterial infection, bacteria also I will destroy it. Antibiotics too Will release it and all this within 10 minutes You won't even know if you were sick or No. We are good. what would you like to say to Conclude this nanobots angle? See Nanobes is a very interesting technology. They are like small construction machinery Strommo Small Machine Tiny Microscopic Robots, they have a lot of potential. a their now as we saw they are still in the experimental fuzz but if that cancer can detect cells and You can target. that will definitely Cure Cancer Any Type of Liver Cancer Cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, Whatever else, cancer. even blood cancer, bone Marrow cancer. So if that one thing happens that will be a revolution in health care to Nanobots have many different uses in drugs Delivery is not what I think is the biggest The challenge with nanobots is that they You are so small that you give me plus machines give machines to make these machines Small machines would be needed for this also Probably the manufacturing is the big one The functioning is the challenge which machines This is the manufacturing scale of Nanoba it is similar to the scale at which you Create Microchips. Your GPUs, CPUs etc. also on the same type of scale we Let's create it. so i think the technology there must be some similarity to create the Nano bots. we are okay guys this podcast At the beginning of 2015 we thought we would be 22 We will draw out a timeline till then. Ah But Age We've gone forward in this podcast. This is an experimental episode for us too. A we have decided to cap it out at the 50s Ear mark. Makes sense. because we look at that what is your response. You Interested in conversations like this. Plus If you actually forward this same document Scan on the same timeline then it becomes More and more speculative. AI Edge in Chat Even GBD itself doesn't exactly know that What will happen in the future? These are all guesses. which is why i think its a good point to and a first experimental episode on Futurism so definitely 50 years makes sense. yes may be in the last bit this is from the table there's anything that catches your eye I felt that yes friend this may be we should have Discussed it. you can just scan it like Quickly. I think we have covered most of the Interesting stuff. I would like to say that AI is developing very fast right now. We It has already reached this level that we We Almost Have Artificial General Intelligence which is an ai system whose intelligence The level is equal to a person with 130 IQ hmm we are already at that level but almost We have arrived. I may be back in two-three years Will go. I have done it privately but It has not been announced to the public. Now if You have an AGI system, artificially If you have a general intelligence system then that can improve itself. it can improve Itself and very soon you will have an AI After that whose IQ level is human The equivalent of being 300 and there is no Human with IQ 300 it is a super What is called Intelligent AI Artificial Super Intelligence. this is me b 5 It will happen within a year. if you have If there is artificially super intelligent AI then He will create such technology for you that You will feel magic. Time Travel Think Worm holes traversable worm holes all of that Not what we saw. once you have asi Artificial Super Intelligence. then magic will be accessible to you. we i say so The government which will implement this technology in 5-10 years will crack it. he to the whole world Will rule for the next thousand years. we this This is the situation. It was a very experimental podcast it. But I had fun with you. i think it's a New Dimension on the Show. Thank you sir. Kud I couldn't have done it with anyone else. but this is A Deeply Experimental Episode. i hope you Head Fun as Well. Absolutely. Honestly, I think GPT has crashed on my phone Is. Which is why I also consider GPT as good Unable to say bye. but i hope the audience Enjoyed it. and we'll be back with another Great science episode very-very soon. thank you You. Thank you. So friends, this was today's Experimental Blockbuster Episode. Tell me How did you like the episode? ofcourse like me I keep saying AC Sir will come back to TRS But. So keep supporting us. keep sending end Recommendations for these episodes. Such tech and The science episodes are very dear to my heart It's close. but i am looking for guest Recommendations as well as topic recommendations. So, send in your input and we will follow up On TRS. The Run Show will return with this Sir But. but until then keep supporting, keep Listening, keep growing. [music]
