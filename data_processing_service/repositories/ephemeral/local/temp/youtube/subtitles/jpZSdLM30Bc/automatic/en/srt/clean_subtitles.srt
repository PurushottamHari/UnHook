Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, 7 days have passed since the war between Iran and Israel. USA has not yet officially started its participation in this war. Look, Trump is testing Israel.  USA's continuous involvement is delaying this war. Now USA has said that after two weeks we will see whether we have to directly participate in this war or not. Because Trump believes that who knows, some reconciliation might happen in the meantime, some ceasefire etc. might happen. Whereas its possibility does not seem to be there. If you look yesterday, Israel shared this animation with the world.  Israel told the world that Iran has a nuclear reactor in Arak.  This nuclear reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force. Because Israel believes that the only function of this nuclear reactor was to build a nuclear bomb. So Iran's nuclear reactors are being destroyed in this manner.  Suddenly news is also coming that earthquakes are occurring one after another in Iran. What is its region?  No one really knows.  But Iran is also continuously attacking Israel from its side. Recently you might know that Iranian missiles have fallen on a big hospital in Israel. Due to which there has been huge loss to this entire hospital.  So at a time when the nuclear reactor is being attacked. When hospitals are being attacked. The situation is continuously getting worse.  S Indians what is our concern?  See, under Operation Sindhu, we had already gone to Iran for Indian students to study.  The process of removing them has been started.  We have brought many Indians back to Delhi via Armenia. However, among the Indian students we have brought back, many are from Kashmir.  He complained that look, you brought me to Delhi. But who will leave Kashmir from Delhi?  Complete arrangements should have been made.  Take me to Kashmir also. And now, under Operation Sindhu, many Indians who are currently in Israel will also be evacuated.  Because again this war does not seem to be happening from anywhere.   It will stop.  I recently listened to one from Iran.  They are saying that now if ceasefire happens then it will give Israel time to build back its supplies and develop more missiles. Iran here believes that Israel's missile defense system is gradually becoming weaker.  The efficiency of their missile defence system was 90% on the first day, now it has fallen to around 65%.  And Iran is now saying that they have the most advanced missile right now.  He has not even used it. So Iran is in no mood to ceasefire from anywhere.  And this puts India's investment of $50 million at risk. Yes, I am talking about Chabahar Port here.  Look at this time, if Israel has to attack anywhere in Iran, then it can attack.  Absolutely Chabahar Port can also be destroyed here because again there is no limit left.  I recently saw that the Russian government has given a warning to Israel. At first Vladimir Putin tried to talk to Nitin Yahoo. When the Russians felt that nothing would be achieved by talks. So Russia openly said that look, we are building a nuclear power plant in Iran.  Actually Russia is building two nuclear power plants in Iran.  So Russia has given the warning here that if this under construction nuclear plant of Iran is attacked then it could lead to a Chernobyl style disaster.  Chernobyl you may know is a city in Ukraine. Radiation had leaked here during the USSR era. Because of which many people died.  Even if we look at the entire Chernobyl today, it is not fit for living.  There is a lot of radioactivity there.  So Russia has openly told Israel that blind boring is being done and reactors are being destroyed. Meanwhile, do not attack our nuclear plant which is under construction.  The whole of Asia will feel its impact. And look somewhere, many reports are claiming that India has also told Israel that even Iran has attacked Israel's Haifa port. As you all know, Hafa Port is currently owned by Adani Group.  There has been an attack on Even Do Hafa Port.  India has told Israel not to attack Chabahar Port because due to this India's investment of 550 million dollars will get set back by many years.  It took us a lot of time to develop Chaba Port because USA has imposed sanctions on Iran.  How were Kens brought here? How the construction took place here. Today, three or four Israeli missiles are going to fall here.  and everything it will fall flat. Chabar port will be destroyed.  And that is why you must have seen that many Indian geopolitical experts have written such articles in the international media that this is an open attack by Israel on Iran.  This is a geopolitical blow for India as its grand plan was to reach Central Asia, Russia and Europe using Chabahar. Look at this right now, it seems to be in great danger.  A Weekend Iran will japotize India's foothold in the region while benefiting our cruel Pakistan.  Most geopolitical analysts assume that once Iran becomes weak, Pakistan 's dominance in the region will increase.  Now again, many people give a counter argument to this that what does Israel want to do?  Does Israel want to destroy Iran's infrastructure?  No, the main target of Israel under Operation Rising Line is to overthrow the current Islamic government in Iran and install a very pro-Western government in Iran, just like the government during the time of the Shah of Iran. So once this happens then Iran will become more stable. The way Iran is supporting Pakistan many times.  Even if Iran gives a statement against India, it will not have such policies regarding Kashmir issue. But again, it remains to be seen whether Israel will be successful in what it wants to do or Israel, out of frustration, will destroy Iran's infrastructure so badly that even whatever little economy of Iran is left will not be able to survive.  And look at Israel's current objective in Iran, they have recently released a one minute video regarding this. I want you guys to watch this video.  Four Deads The Iranian People Have Under Fear Control Andression.  Here we are talking about the Islamic Revolution in Iran.  That happened in 1979, and ever since then, the Iranian government has been very anti- Israel.  This is not just a story about military force.  This story is about people freedom the freedom it's more than [music] found after the 1979 revolution IRGC exporters is there in 2019 they killed over 1,500 civilians in a matter of dying arrests and in 2022 the world watch 22 [music] wide uprising student journalists and one still pending execution and the IRGC turn the country for its own people here you heard the narrative from Israel that the Iranian government has turned its country into a prison and here Masa Mini dies. Elections here are not conducted in a fair manner.  There is no democracy.  Those who are minorities have no rights. Women have no rights.  Etc., he has said such things here.  Now the question is, will the common people of Iran revolt against their government on the basis of this issue?  Because somewhere Israel will also need an internal rebellion. Donald Trump, I would say, is very cleverly waiting to see if this move by Israel will make any difference? Is Iran internally destabilized? If that were not the case, the US would want to stay away from Iran altogether, otherwise, in that case, as you can understand.  Just like the US was stuck in Afghanistan for over a decade. Iran will also be stuck for a long time in the effort to bring democracy.  So see, the coming two weeks are going to be very interesting. How much involvement will USA be in Iran case ?  Will the US come to Israel's aid ?  It will not come out in the open. All this will largely decide what will eventually happen to India's investment of $ 550 million in Chabar Port ?  So regarding some updates, I will keep bringing new videos for you.
