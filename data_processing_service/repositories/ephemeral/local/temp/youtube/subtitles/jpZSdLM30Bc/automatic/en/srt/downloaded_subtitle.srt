00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,040
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
Prashant Dhawan. Now, 7 days have passed since the war between Iran and Israel.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,960
USA has not yet

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,359
officially started its participation in this war.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,320
Look, Trump is

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,960
testing Israel.  USA's continuous

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,760
involvement is delaying this war.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,640
Now USA has said that after two weeks we will

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
see whether we have to directly

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,880
participate in this war or not.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,520
Because Trump believes that who knows,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
some reconciliation might happen in the meantime, some ceasefire etc. might happen.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
Whereas its possibility does not seem to be there.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
If you look yesterday, Israel

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
shared this animation with the world.  Israel

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
told the world that Iran

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,280
has a nuclear reactor in Arak.  This

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
nuclear reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Because Israel

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,719
believes that the only function of this nuclear reactor was to

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,960
build a nuclear bomb.

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
So Iran's nuclear

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,760
reactors are being destroyed in this manner.  Suddenly

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
news is also coming that earthquakes are occurring one after another in Iran.

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
What is its region?  No one really knows.  But Iran is also

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,600
continuously attacking Israel from its side.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
Recently you might know that

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
Iranian missiles have fallen on a big hospital in Israel.

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,040
Due to which there has been huge loss to this

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
entire hospital.  So at a time when the

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
nuclear reactor is being attacked.

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
When hospitals are being attacked.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,080
The situation is continuously getting worse.  S

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Indians what is our concern?  See,

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,520
under Operation Sindhu, we had already

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,079

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
gone to Iran for Indian students to study.  The process of removing them has been

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,560
started.  We have brought many Indians

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,280
back to Delhi via Armenia.

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,960
However, among the Indian students we have brought

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
back, many are from

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
Kashmir.  He complained

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,759
that look, you brought me to Delhi.

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,680
But who will leave Kashmir from Delhi?  Complete

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
arrangements should have been made.  Take me to Kashmir also.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
And now, under Operation Sindhu,

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,040
many Indians who are currently in Israel will

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
also be evacuated.  Because

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,920
again this war does not seem to be happening from anywhere.   It

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,640
will stop.  I recently listened to one

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,160
from Iran.  They are saying that now

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,280
if ceasefire happens then it will

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,360
give Israel time to build back its supplies and

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
develop more missiles.

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
Iran here believes that

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
Israel's missile defense system is gradually becoming weaker.  The

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,959
efficiency of their missile defence system was 90% on the first day, now it has

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,040
fallen to around 65%.  And Iran is now

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
saying that they have the most

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
advanced missile right now.  He has not even used it.

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
So Iran

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,160
is in no mood to ceasefire from anywhere.  And this

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,400
puts India's investment of $50 million at risk.

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes, I

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
am talking about Chabahar Port here.  Look at this time,

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
if Israel has to

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
attack anywhere in Iran, then it

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
can attack.  Absolutely Chabahar Port

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,720
can also be destroyed here because again there is no

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
limit left.  I recently

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,040
saw that the Russian government has given a warning to Israel.

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
At first Vladimir Putin

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
tried to talk to Nitin Yahoo.

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,920
When the Russians felt that nothing would be achieved by talks.

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,040
So Russia openly said that

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,959
look, we are building a nuclear power plant

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
in Iran.  Actually

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
Russia is building two nuclear power plants

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,760
in Iran.  So Russia has given the warning here

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,239
that if this under

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,799
construction nuclear plant of Iran is attacked

84
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,640
then it could lead to a Chernobyl style

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
disaster.  Chernobyl you

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,840
may know is a city in Ukraine.

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,159
Radiation had leaked here during the USSR era.

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,120
Because of which many people died.  Even

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,120
if we look at the entire Chernobyl today, it is not fit for living.  There

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,159
is a lot of radioactivity there.  So Russia has openly

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,080
told Israel that blind boring is being done and

93
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,560
reactors are being destroyed.

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,560
Meanwhile, do not attack our nuclear plant which is under construction.  The

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,599

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
whole of Asia will feel its impact.

97
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,519
And look somewhere, many

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,879
reports are claiming that India has also

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
told Israel that even Iran has

100
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,959
attacked Israel's Haifa port.

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,680
As you all know, Hafa Port is

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
currently owned by Adani Group.  There has

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
been an attack on Even Do Hafa Port.  India has told

104
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
Israel not to attack Chabahar Port

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
because due to this India's

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,240
investment of 550 million dollars will get set

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,080
back by many years.  It

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
took us a lot of time to develop Chaba Port

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
because USA has imposed sanctions

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,520
on Iran.  How were Kens brought here?

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,000
How the construction took place here.

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,560
Today, three or four Israeli missiles are going to

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
fall here.  and everything it will fall flat.

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,199
Chabar port will be destroyed.  And that is why

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,759
you must have seen that many Indian geopolitical

116
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,960
experts have

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,160
written such articles in the international media that this is an open

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,320
attack by Israel on Iran.  This is a geopolitical blow for

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,199
India as its grand plan

120
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,000
was to reach Central Asia,

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
Russia and Europe using Chabahar.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,960
Look at this right now, it seems to be in great danger.  A

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,199
Weekend Iran will japotize India's

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,759
foothold in the region while benefiting our

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,919
cruel Pakistan.  Most geopolitical

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,400
analysts assume that once

127
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,039
Iran becomes weak, Pakistan

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,680
's dominance in the region will increase.  Now again,

129
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
many people give a counter argument to this that

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,560
what does Israel want to do?  Does Israel

131
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,960

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
want to destroy Iran's infrastructure?  No, the

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,080
main target of Israel under Operation Rising Line is to overthrow the current

134
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
Islamic government in Iran and

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,120

136
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,440

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
install a very pro-Western government in Iran, just like the government during the time of the Shah of Iran.

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,039
So once this happens

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
then Iran will become more stable.

140
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,680
The way Iran is supporting Pakistan many times.  Even if

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Iran

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,080
gives a statement against India,

143
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,960
it will not have such policies regarding Kashmir issue.

144
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,360
But again, it remains to be seen whether Israel will be

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,240
successful in what it wants to do

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,240
or Israel, out of frustration, will

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
destroy Iran's infrastructure so badly that even whatever

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
little economy of Iran is left will

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
not be able to survive.  And

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,039
look at Israel's current objective

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
in Iran, they have recently released a one minute video regarding this.

153
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
I

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,080
want you guys to watch this video.  Four Deads The

Andression.  Here we are

157
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,560
talking about the Islamic Revolution in Iran.  That

158
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
happened in 1979, and ever since then, the

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Iranian government has been very anti-

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,800
Israel.  This is not just a story

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,240
about military force.  This story is about

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,030
people freedom the

163
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440

169
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,720
2019 they killed over 1,500 civilians in

170
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,680
a matter of dying arrests and in 2022 the

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,400
narrative from Israel that the Iranian

180
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,199
government has turned its country into a prison

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,680
and here Masa Mini dies.

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
Elections here are not conducted in a fair manner.  There

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
is no democracy.  Those who

184
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
are minorities have no rights.

185
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
Women have no rights.  Etc.,

186
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
he has said such things here.  Now the

187
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,080
question is, will the common people of Iran

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,479

189
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,919
revolt against their government on the basis of this issue?  Because somewhere Israel will

190
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,000
also need an internal rebellion.

191
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,879
Donald Trump, I would say, is very

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,840
cleverly waiting to see

193
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,800
if this move by Israel will make any difference?

194
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,599
Is Iran internally destabilized?

195
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
If that were not the case, the US would want to

196
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,440
stay away from Iran altogether, otherwise, in that case,

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
as you can understand.  Just like the US was

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
stuck in Afghanistan for over a decade.

199
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
Iran will also be stuck for a long time

200
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
in the effort to bring democracy.  So

201
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
see, the coming two weeks are going to be very

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
interesting.

203
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,120
How much involvement will USA be in Iran case

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,760
?  Will the US come to Israel's aid

205
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,040
?  It will not come out in the open. All this

206
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,680
will largely decide what will eventually happen to India's investment of $ 550 million

207
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,160
in Chabar Port

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
?  So

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,800
regarding some updates, I will

210
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
keep bringing new videos for you.  Look, I

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,040
believe that if you are

212
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
not using Artificial Intelligence

213
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,240
in your work today, then you are living in a different era

214
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,880
because with the help of AI, you can do many jobs.

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
You can make a lot of money.  You

216
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
can upskill yourself.  For

217
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,440
example, if I want to show

218
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,839
that Captain America is

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai and

220
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,160
a very attractive text is written on it '

221
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,120
Yummy', then I can easily do this by

222
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,160
entering the correct 'P'.  And here you

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,560
can see it was just that easy,

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,519
you can make many variants of it.  If I

225
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,600
want to move this image, then I can do it in the

226
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,320
way you can see on your screen.

227
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,959
I can make

228
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
this image move with the help of lots of generative AI software.  I

229
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,839
can create a story.

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,800
I can pretty much do anything.  And this is

231
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
just one small, I mean one very

232
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,320
small, aspect of generative AI.

233
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,320
With the help of generative AI, you can write books.

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,959
