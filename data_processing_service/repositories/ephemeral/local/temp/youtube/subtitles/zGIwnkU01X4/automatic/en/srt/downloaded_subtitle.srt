1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,520
You sold 1,000 products in 3 days of

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,200
your launch. Yeah, that is crazy. Those

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,120
who don't know me, we are a skincare

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
brand. They decided to start a company

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,080
in the middle of co and decided to get

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
into the beauty and personal care. 100

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
cr of revenue. We were doing some seven

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
or eight cr a month. When did that

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,119
hockey stick growth happen? Minimalist

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,760
raised 110 crore rupees in series A

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,880
funding round. Clinical as a word has

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,040
been misused a lot. Right. uh and they

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,120
have data like 80% success rate, 98%

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
success rate. No research will say that

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,960
serum will be a big industry in India.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,800
What are you saying? If you look at some

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
of the most successful brands, I'll not

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
name them but you will understand. Like

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
you said, they're all based on marketing

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,879
facade. 50 the thing that brands are

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
promoting, there's hardly any data. What

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
is the difference in behavior that

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
you've seen between men and women when

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
it comes to skincare? Someone were to

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
launch a skincare brand today, what

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,680
should be a healthy margin that they

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
should keep for gross so that they can

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,760
consider it to be feasible to enter the

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
market. So I think the biggest piece in

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,640
this which is not controllable by a lot

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,119
of people. Now when you're going against

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,240
funded competitors and they pour in that

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,080
funding into spoiling your reputation,

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,040
that's a disaster, right? protecting

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,040
that is very important because

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
consumerism

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,470
key is there a real problem that you're

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,579
solving. My answer to this would be

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,579
[Music]

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,140
[Music]

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,479
Before

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
we move on, I would like to thank Odo

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
for supporting our content. People, if

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
you're running a shop, you already know

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,159
how chaotic retail can get. Orders pile

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
up, stocks get misplaced, cash registers

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
go unchecked, and by the end of the day,

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
you are left with juggling receipts,

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
staff logs, and inventory mismatches.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
But that's where ODO's point of sale

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,959
steps in and changes the game. The ODO

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,040
every part of running a shop. You can

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
track every sale, manage cashier

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
accounts securely and monitor realtime

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
cash flow and all of this can be done

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
from a single dashboard. So whether you

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,239
need to see your daily totals or dig

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
into a specific transaction, every past

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
order is just a search away. It helps

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,319
you schedule shifts, track employee

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,840

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,840

shops today. People, this is a

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
conversation that I had with Mohit Yadav

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
who is the founder of minimalist. Now if

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,560
you think about it, in the skincare

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,280
category, there are multiple brands, but

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,840
minimalist is by far the most successful

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,480
brand in India. And skincare as a

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,720
category has always been crowded before

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,239
and after minimalist. But even then,

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
Mohit ended up doing something so

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,159
magical that he took minimalist from 0

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,720
to a 3,000 cr valuation in just about 5

92
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,799
years. And that says that minimalist as

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,200
a business has something very very

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
magical to teach all of us. So if you're

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,799
somebody who's building in the skincare

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,560
or beauty category, please watch this

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080

step-by-step guide to help you excel in

101

this podcast helps you build a

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
millionoll brand. Thank you so much for

103
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,080
watching and now on to the episode. Mit,

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
I am deeply interested to understand the

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
story of minimalist for multiple

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
reasons. A you started out of Jaipur.

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,519
Most people would start out of Bangalore

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,359
or Mumbai. Okay. B

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
I read some stat which said and you can

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,960
correct me if if this is wrong. You sold

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,560
1,000 products in 3 days of your launch.

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,400
Yeah, that is crazy. And in fact I am

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,280
educated about skinare because of my

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,520
wife. Had she not been there

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,520
face wash

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
from there I've become an evolved

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
species who now uses vitamin C vitamin E

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,400
and so on and so forth. Now this is the

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,560
case 2025. Today I see a lot of people

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
around me who are educated about the

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
skincare routine. They may choose to

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,759
follow it, they may not choose to follow

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
it. But then the education is there and

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,479
the hardest thing to do in the market is

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
education. It's not customer acquisition

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,720
because if a customer is educated about

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,479
it, you can acquire customers. But then

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,440
going back to 2020 or 2019 when you

129
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,000
started

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,560
and that too from Jaipur,

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,199
what exactly prompted you to get into

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
skincare? Because back then when it

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,600
comes to awareness it was significantly

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,759
lesser right. So how did you decide to

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
enter this market? So before minimalist

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
we were actually running a different

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
brand called free will. Okay. And there

138
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
we were doing some personalized hair

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,720
care product and honestly we started

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,160
that completely from tech and product

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
angle that you know we come from tech

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
industry

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,759
we know some bit of programming and

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,479
coding and if we can create personalized

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,039
solutions for individual we can do

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,520
better in product. So, say brands are

147
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,160
selling four different variants. If I

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,080
have 400 or 4,000 which are uniquely

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,240
tailored for a particular individual's

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
need, then I'm hoping the product will

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
do better. What did Free Will do? So,

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
Free Will was doing personalized hair

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,440
care. Can you explain this in depth? You

154
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,479
know, depending on your hair type, your

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,360
lifestyle and your goals. Okay. We will

156
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,039
ask some 25 28 different questions and

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
based on those parameters create a

158
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,759
product from scratch and the entire

159
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,319
formulation was written through a

160
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,240
program. So my system will algorithm

161
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
will say that okay which ingredient and

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
what percentage should be added into the

163
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,560
product bases the question that you

164
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
filled and then we'll create every

165
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
product from scratch ship to the

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
customer. So it's like completely

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
tailored made for you. So that was the

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,600
idea. Uh so we rolled in some

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,360
formulators from US and other places and

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,680
India team was largely into programming

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,000
and coding. So it was a tech company not

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,400
a CPG, FMCG or or a beauty company right

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,919
and we ran it for almost one and a half

174
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,720
two year and in that period honestly we

175
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,319
met lot of suppliers in India

176
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
lot of folks even globally also and uh

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,759
few thing

178
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,880
you know as an outsider when you are

179
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
introduced to the to the industry you

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,759
kind of see all those you know good bad

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,880
side of it right and uh we felt that you

182
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,120
know most companies when you sit uh look

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,400
from outside feels like you know bigger

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,880
companies larger you know R&D teams and

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,520
all

186
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,759
bigger promises also but in honesty what

187
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,360
actually goes into the product is driven

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,240
largely by marketing and branding

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
uh and a small team of 10 15 20 people

190
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
can actually create a better product.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
Can you give me an example like don't

192
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
take the name of brands but then give me

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,440
an example of such kind of product. So

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,080
okay uh say brightening as a category

195
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,560
right there are some clinically proven

196
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,319
solutions which work on brightening.

197
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,199
Vitamin C says one such ingredient when

198
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,919
used in a certain concentration it give

199
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,479
desired outcome

200
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,720
law as such does not require the minimum

201
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,560
percentage of that product to be used

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,400
for those claims. So say if I have.1%

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
vitamin C I can still call it a

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,960
brightening product and someone is

205
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
giving 10 15% vitamin C also can still

206
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,839
call it a brightening product right both

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,800
are brightening uh you know regulators

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
will ask that are for the claim what is

209
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,159
the support you will say I'm using

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
vitamin C they will not test the

211
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,640
validity concentrations and all it's

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,360
okay about it right and whenever some

213
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,839
new thing come lot of time your basic

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,920
product is same you just play with those

215
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,560
minor concentrations

216
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,480
which just revolve around the the brand

217
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,959
or the claims you're taking right and we

218
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
felt that is not how the product should

219
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,720
be created

220
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,959
second is how they are even market to

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,279
people so again you know if I know I'm

222
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,360
not using the right concentration

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,000
claiming it to be a brightening product

224
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,480
claiming it to be something else

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
again we felt this is how it should not

226
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
be right uh you know there are many

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,440
product which are

228
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
absolutely very different in terms of

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,160
what they offer. So say it'll have

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,120
fragrance of rose and sold as maybe rose

231
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,399
extract or something sensorally you will

232
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,160
feel oh I can sense it has the fragrance

233
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
and all but it's just a fragrance

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
there's no rose extract and all right so

235
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
a lot of those thing uh were like an eye

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
opener for us also and we felt that you

237
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
know customers are not should not be

238
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
treated like that but how did you

239
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
discover this this is a very technical

240
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
problem right so when you actually talk

241
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,000
to a lot of suppliers and vendors uh We

242
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,880
used to start visiting a lot of expose

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,480
the constant question people used to ask

244
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
what is your marketing story that you're

245
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,839
looking at okay not your ingredients

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
exactly right and I okay you know we are

247
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
here to solve like that time we working

248
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,079
on hair care that how to work on a say

249
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,519
hair fall I don't have a story I don't

250
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,720
even care whether this ingredient come

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,519
from Brazilian rainforest come from

252
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
African come from Korea how does it

253
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
matter

254
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,839
Does it work or does it not? Right? And

255
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,720
if you say it work, do you have clinical

256
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:40,240
data or study to prove? Trust me, 90% of

257
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,800
those have no real data.

258
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
And you can if you'll think now as a

259
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
consumer, you know, every time you will

260
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,600
see a different trend come, brand will

261
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,760
say, "Oh, we found some revolutionary

262
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
ingredient." It stays in market for 2

263
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,680
year and then it go away and something

264
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
else again is in market. For example, if

265
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Amazon rainforest is something that's in

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
everybody's mind, can you expect a big

267
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,040
brand to say, "Oh, you know what? We

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,399
have extracts and minerals taken from

269
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,680
the Amazon rainforest." You can you can

270
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,959
by putting trace amount of it, right?

271
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
You don't have to put in the same

272
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,160
concentration like you know I think for

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,440
a while even for hair loss in India

274
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,200
onion and onion rated B become a fat. Uh

275
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,519
if you'll actually see a lot of data

276
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
there's none. There are hardly any

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
clinical studies or research done on

278
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,000
that and after two year it becomes

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,000
something else. Right? If something is

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
actually revolutionary

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,240
deliver what it promises there's no need

282
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
for any brand to change those stories

283
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,680
every two year. Correct. Right. Then

284
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
it'll be a different story. Then it'll

285
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
be different story and then the cycle

286
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
continue to go on and on and on. Right.

287
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
And also the celebrities will keep

288
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
changing. Yeah. And if you'll see

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
actually on the pharmaceutical those

290
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,600
product some of those ingredient

291
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,640
continue for a very long time. Like say

292
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,680
if you go and talk to a dermat and say

293
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,440
if you're dealing with acne

294
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
uh two three solution doctor have been

295
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,880
prescribing for a long time one is

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,120
salicylic one is benzol peroxide

297
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,040
I don't know how many decades these

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,320
toilet have been sold how many clinical

299
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,440
studies have been done on that they have

300
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
results on certain concentration right

301
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
so you'll find lot of that data if you

302
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,920
create a product you know what outcome

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,600
you'll get anything Other than that uh

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,480
with 50 other things that brands are

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,440
promoting there's hardly any data. So

306
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,440
again you know we were outsiders we did

307
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
not know how industry work and we felt

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,920
that you know what can be our

309
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,519
superpower. Uh my superpower is not

310
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,200
creating a new trend. I don't think we

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,920
can do that. uh our superpower is not a

312
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,480
branding or brand story that you know

313
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,880
hey I know I can say something which

314
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,279
people would want and I can continue to

315
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,959
sell through those stories. We felt we

316
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760
have been very functional throughout our

317
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,320
life. Okay. And that maybe because of

318
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,880
our upbringing, because of the city

319
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
where we come from, maybe a lot of other

320
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
factors, maybe just because we were

321
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,440
outsiders also. And we felt there would

322
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,800
be some customers like us who just

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,399
wanted to buy a product because it's

324
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,040
solved, right? So again like you know if

325
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,720
I know I'm dealing with ene

326
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,720
every day in the morning, my only

327
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,000
concern is what should I apply just to

328
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,480
solve this. I don't then care you know

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,519
where this Indian is coming at. I don't

330
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
dream next day oh what if I have a

331
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
different ingredient which can solve

332
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
this acne right I mean just sol it and

333
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,839
move on. What if I have Brazilian

334
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
extracts on my face? Exactly. I mean you

335
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,160
feel that you know there are so many

336
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,519
thing that goes in your life just solve

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,120
this part so that I can do something

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,560
else in my life. I mean I don't have

339
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
like five hour every day to just think

340
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,200
about it. And we felt that you know can

341
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,160
we create a functional brand which work

342
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,440
on clinical proven solutions and then

343
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,680
which is transparent you give what it is

344
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
uh

345
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,160
it's just starting with the belief that

346
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,839
there would be some people like us who

347
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
would want their skin care to be like

348
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,680
this so resultoriented products that's

349
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,399
it correct and when I say resultoriented

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,720
uh what we internally call it clinically

351
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,560
proven because clinically proven will

352
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,519
give result oriented. Funnily enough,

353
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
clinically proven, clinical as a word

354
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
has been misused a lot, right?

355
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,560
Absolutely. But tell me something Mo,

356
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
before we get into skincare, I'm just

357
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
asking this out of curiosity because

358
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,040
I've been seeing a lot of brands pop up

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,480
lately which often claim to solve hair

360
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,839
fall. Yeah. And they have data like 80%

361
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,760
success rate, 98% success rate. Now, I

362
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,440
just wanted to understand because we

363
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,839
might have a founder over here who's

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,120
claiming to solve hairful. But before

365
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,240
that I just want to understand from you

366
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,560
can you really solve hair fall and can

367
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,600
you really solve a baldness? There are

368
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,360
some solutions and

369
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
depending on the complexity of the

370
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,760
problem some of those solutions might

371
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,320
work for you. So someone who is dealing

372
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,480
with say a very normal hair fall the

373
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,800
problem may have initiated you even find

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,399
product which are OTC over the counter

375
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,240
without prescription that you can buy

376
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,160
and you can start your you know routine

377
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,160
with that. Then on the level two there

378
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,959
are some farmer product also where you

379
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,839
have minoxidil minoxidil based product

380
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,079
uh they also have lot of data around it.

381
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,000
Uh then the third is if you have some

382
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,160
deficiencies which then can be solved in

383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,560
a different manner. So depending again

384
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,199
see uh no one solution can work for

385
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,320
every individual and then depending on

386
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,880
the type of problem you have uh you can

387
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
start with something which is more

388
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,959
milder which is like say over the

389
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,600
counter and if it is not working the

390
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,839
best is to consult a doctor figure out

391
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,199
what exactly the changes you need to do

392
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,759
and then look at the solutions. M can it

393
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,000
be solved? The answer is yes. It may not

394
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
be a hit and dry always. I mean it is a

395
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
hit and dry always. Correct. It may not

396
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,440
be. I mean if you go and talk to a

397
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
dumbat or someone you can just skip the

398
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,480
hit and try. So a lot of time I have

399
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,720
seen people that you know I'll keep on

400
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,880
trying multiple product and then you

401
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,759
feel oh this is working this is not

402
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
working and then at times you also at

403
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,720
time you give up on it right that okay

404
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
I've tried 50 solutions it's not working

405
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
and sometime you know topical product

406
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,120
can only do so much if you have certain

407
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,680
other deficiencies you need to see it in

408
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,399
a more holistic manner so again you know

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,240
I never felt that skinincare will be

410
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,079
skin care separate ely or wellness in a

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
different category or say farmer in a

412
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,040
different one end of the day it'll all

413
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
converge in a particular manner and it

414
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,959
should be a very holistic wellness this

415
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,959
is how individual should look at it and

416
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,279
then bases it how my solution should

417
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,639
also come is hair fall dependent largely

418
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,680
on genetics some part of it yes it can

419
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,240
be those challenges also uh apart from

420
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,399
that you know

421
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,639
your exposure environment can also be a

422
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
factor again I'm saying you know the

423
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
severity It can be different. So you're

424
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
saying that the problem is more complex

425
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,799
than we think. Yeah. You can't have a

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
one solution fits all. True. Okay. So if

427
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,720
somebody is let's say encountering hair

428
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,959
fall, what exactly should that person's

429
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,439
approach be? Should it be to look for

430
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,880
the best products in the market because

431
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
then they'll have to go by marketing or

432
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
are there certain products by default

433
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
that people can use which will solve

434
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,160
their problem or should they just go and

435
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,360
consult somebody? I think first thing

436
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,799
which is very easy now to be honest like

437
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,039
educate yourself and even if you are not

438
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,000
able to find right content there are

439
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,600
dermat who don't

440
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,760
sell product or do brand endorsement and

441
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
again given internet you don't have to

442
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,960
even follow some dermat which is on your

443
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
own city you can even follow someone

444
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,520
sitting in US UK some other places right

445
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,320
who don't have any interest or any you

446
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,000
know uh partnership chip uh from a

447
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
particular brand right second is when

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
you follow any GPT you can even check

449
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
that okay which ingredient which basic

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,520
thing right uh if a basic level of

451
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,160
awareness or knowledge does not exist

452
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,600
you will be taken for right by brands

453
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,160
got it so you think that the first step

454
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,799
should be to find the root cause of your

455
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,640
problem it could be nutrition deficiency

456
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
and then get educated with some

457
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
ingredient also like you know uh if you

458
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
would read about minoxid There's a lot

459
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,559
of data on minoxidil uh which is a

460
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,960
prescription based product. On

461
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,520
non-minidal there are ingredient like

462
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,080
you know redenzil, procapill and other

463
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,480
those also if you're aware then the

464
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,440
third step would be finding a product

465
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,000
right and in those rather than going

466
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,480
with the marketing claims and all just

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,960
turn the label see whether it contain

468
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
those ingredient and if it does in what

469
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
concentration

470
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,039
so like you know we're talking about

471
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,480
vitamin C uh putting a.1% vitamin C

472
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,880
won't solve your problem if you know

473
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,880
what is the desired percentage page and

474
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
then select certain product based this

475
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,760
research you'll always find better

476
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,160
outcome. Got it? So it's research

477
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,160
reasons

478
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
and then products. Yeah. Most people

479
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,039
actually go the other way around. They

480
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,720
first go to products then they see if

481
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,320
they consist of the right ingredients

482
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,919
and then they look for reasoning once

483
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
the products don't give results and then

484
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,120
eventually then they start doing

485
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,559
research as to why aren't these products

486
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
working out in the first place. See

487
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,720
you're consuming something right? I mean

488
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,080
u consumption does not happen only with

489
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,919
something that you're eating. Even

490
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,400
applying topically is also a way of

491
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,320
consumption. Uh don't blindly follow

492
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
anything and again I'll even say for our

493
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,760
own brand you know question ask you know

494
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,080
what it does what it contain get some

495
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
education and then only trust brands.

496
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
Got it. Beautiful. Now let's come back

497
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
to skincare. As you mentioned there was

498
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,080
a lot of facade that was going on in the

499
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,640
market because of which you realize that

500
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,320
most products that exist in the market

501
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,559
are not functional products. They're

502
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,039
just marketing gimmicks who just do not

503
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,240
give out concrete results. Results might

504
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
be visible here and there but that's

505
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
quite perception based. But they don't

506
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,120
give out tangible results. And that is

507
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
when you realize that okay there is a

508
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,559
gap in the market where if you can

509
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
design a product that can give out

510
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,360
results then regardless of how much

511
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,200
marketing budget you have you'll be able

512
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,840
to scale. Was that the thesis?

513
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Absolutely. Okay. Then during that time,

514
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
give me an outlook of the skincare

515
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,360
market of India back then on the basis

516
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
of awareness and TAM or data in case if

517
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
you have any and then we can get deeper

518
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,559
into it. See, we never started with TAM

519
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
for the category because say our first

520
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,440
few product were face serums. Okay. And

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,120
face serum was very new in India. Face

522
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,840
serum. What is a face serum and how is

523
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,559
it different from other products? So the

524
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,400
form factor is different. So say a

525
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,919
moisturizer is more of a imulsion or

526
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,720
cream. A serum is uh in a lay manage if

527
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,919
I have to explain uh more like a a

528
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,320
liquid based product. Uh so the

529
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,240
objective of that is to deliver the

530
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,039
ingredient to you know the receptors and

531
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,919
also let it work right. Uh so the format

532
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,600
is different and that is how we started.

533
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,320
If I go back and look at all the

534
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,080
research of 2019, no research will say

535
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,200
that serum will be a big industry in

536
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,120
India, right? Because uh the challenge

537
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,000
with most reports is they give you data

538
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,320
of things which already happened or

539
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,799
where they are today. Very few report

540
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,000
can tell you where things will be. And

541
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,360
at times you have to you know have a gut

542
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
feel or a hunch or something that okay

543
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,640
you know I think this will be big

544
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
because again people are becoming more

545
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
aware there's high level of

546
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
understanding about these ingredients

547
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,039
you can even see how things are you know

548
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,320
shaping up globally and basis that do

549
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,840
you think that will be relevant in India

550
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,480
or not so that is how we also started

551
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
so not with the time and all okay any

552
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,679
observation that you particularly made

553
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,760
which inspired you to get into skincare

554
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,000
so The journey was actually pivot from

555
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
free will. So you said I I told you

556
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,360
right we were working on free will. We

557
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,960
were doing hair care and around that

558
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,480
time we were thinking of creating a

559
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,840
personalized range of skincare also. Uh

560
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
challenge with personalization is

561
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,159
distribution because I'm creating every

562
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,320
product from scratch. I am not able to

563
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
leverage retail. I'm also not able to

564
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,240
leverage the marketplaces and other

565
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,679
channel because in those cases unity

566
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,919
they have a product which is already in

567
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,520
their warehouses

568
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,960
and

569
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,000
around that time of course we all were

570
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,440
impacted by co so we had some 3 4 month

571
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,080
in which we took a step back

572
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,280
it gave us some time to think how we

573
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,080
should launch this category and one idea

574
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,480
that we had is why can't we create

575
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,919
problem specific product let people buy

576
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,799
more and want to create their own

577
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
personalization that also solve our

578
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,760
distribution issue which we had with

579
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
personalization. Oh, that's beautiful

580
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,159
bro. Problem specific product. Can you

581
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,240
give me an example? Yeah. So, uh say

582
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,799
what you're doing in personalization is

583
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,280
uh and specifically to say skincare. Say

584
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,640
you have two requirement that I have

585
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,640
some pigmentation mark and then maybe

586
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,039
I'm 30 plus I also need some solution

587
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,480
for aging right I can then create a

588
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,240
product which contain both the solutions

589
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,080
in a bottle. Second could be I have two

590
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
product now. One is very specific to

591
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,400
pigmentation, one is very specific for

592
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,400
aging. You can buy both the product you

593
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,159
can use as a layering or maybe one in

594
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
the morning, one at night and through

595
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
that you can create your own

596
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,799
personalized routine. And if we are able

597
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,760
to identify say 10 15 unique problems,

598
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,520
it can be different combinations can

599
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,679
work for different people and that is

600
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,320
how they can create their own you know

601
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,400
uh routine or programs. Got it. But with

602
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,720
that we are able to use every

603
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,039
marketplace and all the offline channels

604
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,600
also for distribution. So that was the

605
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,400
thesis behind launching minimalist. Now

606
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,600
if I have to go back and encounter a

607
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
challenge I'm imagining that you're

608
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
calling a product a face serum, right?

609
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,280
Or were you calling it something else?

610
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Face serum. So minimalist face serum.

611
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,799
Okay. Now

612
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,000
as a customer if I were to go back to

613
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,000
2019 2019, right? If I if I have to go

614
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
back to 2019 and then I encounter a face

615
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,039
serum,

616
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,240
I don't know what to do with it. I don't

617
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,919
what kind of problem is it going to

618
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,799
solve for me? And you did not have a big

619
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,200
fat marketing budget either. So how did

620
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,919
you convince the customer that this is

621
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,919
phase zero and it can be used for a BC

622
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,080
problems? See I think at a very early

623
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,000
stage and again this is my personal

624
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,360
belief right uh you need those 5 10,000

625
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,360
people who can make sense of it right

626
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,720
you should be

627
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,880
everything for someone and something for

628
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,400
everyone so creating a product which is

629
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
like you know a small set of people are

630
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,679
really looking forward in the market to

631
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,240
have so for those small set of customers

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,640
minimalist probably was everything Okay.

633
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,559
Right. That you know I'm looking for

634
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,799
solution which are clinically proven.

635
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm looking for these serums. I was

636
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,919
looking for say salis with 2%. Because

637
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm like very evolved in skinare and I'm

638
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,720
very knowledgeable consumer right and

639
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,720
this exactly fit into the kind of

640
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,039
product I was looking at. Hm which was

641
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,600
face serum which was face serum versus

642
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,120
trying to look at a much larger time

643
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,960
where different segment of customers

644
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,120
just feel oh there's one more brand I

645
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,360
don't feel very excited about it which

646
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,000
is like okay you know it's okay that you

647
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,559
know the hundreds and one brand or

648
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,679
whatever it is right so that was our

649
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,840
thought that if we look at customer in

650
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
different parame

651
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,679
uh the early movers Those who know about

652
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
the segment, those who know those

653
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,880
concentrations pretty well because even

654
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,200
in serum the first four or five were

655
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,960
actually sold with the ingredient name.

656
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,520
So the product were 2% salicylic acid or

657
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,679
say 10 10% nioinamide.

658
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,200
So that is how we were selling it. Not

659
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,520
by acne serum or a whitening serum or

660
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,799
something else. These were sold on

661
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,400
ingredient specifically like retinol

662
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,919
0.3%.

663
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,919
Right? And we knew these people will

664
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,440
know about it. Who who are these people?

665
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,880
So if I were to understand the spectrum

666
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,760
of early mos, if you go from early moss

667
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,919
to late majority

668
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,240
in the tech domain, you know who are the

669
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,120
early movers, right? And if I were to

670
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,200
map them out amongst a population of 1.4

671
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,120
billion, I would usually categorize them

672
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
as teenagers who are really excited to

673
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,279
try gadgets.

674
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,440
Then I would look at all the tech geeks

675
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
who go to these tech conferences where

676
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
they are by default early moers because

677
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
of their profession and then I can go

678
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,159
and sell a software product to them or

679
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,919
maybe I can go and sell a gadget to a

680
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,760
kid. It's very easy to identify the

681
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,720
early moss

682
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,679
for tech. Similarly when it comes to

683
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,840
protein a person going to the gym is

684
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,400
aware about whey protein he's aware

685
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
about casein. So I can find my subset of

686
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
customers over there at the gym. Mhm.

687
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,840
Now what I'm not able to wrap my head

688
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,240
around is how on earth did you find the

689
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,760
early mos skincare? How would you go and

690
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
find that subset? Would it be with the

691
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,640
dermats or would it be a specific place

692
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,080
that you go to or was that you know

693
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
through performance if you can find that

694
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,440
particular niche who are extremely

695
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,360
aware? How did you go about it? See

696
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,200
first few months was not driven by

697
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,200
performance because again as you rightly

698
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,200
mentioned it is very very difficult to

699
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,320
find those customers right because

700
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,360
there's no one particular group uh and

701
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,360
even if you work with datmat

702
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,760
and then the dermat will maybe inform

703
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
three or four of his patient and the

704
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,840
cycle will just continue to go on for a

705
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,240
very long time right uh you need to Find

706
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480
one people who are dealing with some

707
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,799
problems, right? And that can happen

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,919
through searches, right? Uh second is

709
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,480
from that segment there would be some

710
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,840
who would be consuming content and are

711
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,240
aware about some of these solutions. For

712
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,919
example, look uh if I don't have a skin

713
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
concern,

714
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,279
my probability of that time, I'm saying

715
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,520
2019, uh knowing what salisake or

716
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,120
retinel is is very low because I'm not

717
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,520
very invested into it. Uh so usually the

718
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,600
one who is dealing with those challenges

719
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
would be doing some research. Correct.

720
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,960
Uh so that is how basically the initial

721
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,200
journey started. So surge for us become

722
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,559
important part and the first few were

723
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,919
also the product that we launched were

724
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,919
also very problem specific. Uh so again

725
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,600
you know your painkillers versus vitamin

726
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,919
right. Uh now we have a lot of product

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,039
which are maintenance good to have and

728
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,840
all initial some were bases three or

729
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,720
four problem which we felt are very

730
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,960
prominent in India. Okay like so acne is

731
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,640
one so if you're a teenager large

732
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,399
percentage customers do go through it

733
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,520
those challenges. Second is again

734
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,399
pigmentation. Uh which again is a a big

735
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,520
problem in India. Uh aging I will not

736
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,799
call a problem but you know beyond it's

737
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,880
a perceived problem. Uh and then your

738
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,000
skin type. So you know you may have

739
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,360
either very d oily skin. So that is how

740
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,159
the first four or five product were

741
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,320
designed. Perfect. So let's say you

742
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,080
understood that the largest tab let's

743
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,360
say exists for acne because it's very

744
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,919
commonly visible and you can actually

745
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,760
understand the customer better.

746
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,039
And then you've got your products like

747
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,320
retinol and salicylic acid. Now how did

748
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,399
you find those customers and how did you

749
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,600
sell it to them? Yeah. So we started our

750
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,520
journey through our own social media

751
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,440
page and we feel that you know we can

752
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,960
create lot of educational content and

753
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,240
through which we can of course create

754
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,720
awareness eventually 100 customers will

755
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,799
come if they're happy they will tell

756
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,000
maybe 200 more and then the cycle will

757
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,640
continue to go on. Right? Uh so you know

758
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,240
one content creator just found the

759
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,120
brand. She did a story or some post in

760
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,440
her community section on YouTube uh that

761
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,679
hey you know I came across this brand.

762
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
The product looked promising and I'll

763
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,039
just give it a try. That's it. Okay. She

764
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,679
had a very engaged community. So those

765
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,559
100 to 200 people came from her page. Oh

766
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,520
wow. Some of them become our customers.

767
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,799
Right. Then UGC started to kick in uh

768
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
because yeah so they were early movers

769
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,159
so they started posting on their own

770
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,080
page that you know oh I am trying this

771
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,559
product maybe after a week or two week

772
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,360
once I use the product I'll let you know

773
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,919
right uh but those in their own group

774
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
some of them again were the early movers

775
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,240
early adopters because you know if

776
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,840
you're able to reach out to them then

777
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,600
it's a it become the battle right uh

778
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,360
then the next set of 200 people would

779
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,960
have came from their post or their

780
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,360
stories without even trying the product

781
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,000
now because all this happened in a

782
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,799
period of what 2 to 3 days. Okay. Yeah.

783
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,200
So first 500 or maybe thousand people

784
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,600
just came from this particular uh

785
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,840
virality. One person found out 100 tried

786
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,399
and then they posted as a story that I'm

787
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,840
trying and another 4 500 tried from

788
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,440
there and they started following our

789
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
page and all and that is how our journey

790
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,320
started. Got it. So we were probably

791
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,760
lucky that people found us uh very

792
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,279
easily without spending a lot of money

793
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,679
in marketing. Uh but the second set of

794
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,640
growth actually came from these people.

795
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,159
So after 15 days, after 21 days once

796
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,120
they tagged the product and they felt

797
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,039
that this is legit, this is working that

798
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,080
build a lot of confidence in the second

799
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,320
set of customers. So you essentially got

800
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,559
hold of two campaigns for free. One is

801
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm trying this product and the other is

802
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,640
I've seen results. Is that correct?

803
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah. Wow, that's beautiful. By the way,

804
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,240
guys, uh UGC is user generated content.

805
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,240
What this means is that this content

806
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
doesn't have to come from a creator or a

807
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,399
celebrity. It can just be produced by

808
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,080
ordinary people. But then the word of

809
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,399
mouth spreads and then other people

810
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,559
begin to create similar content which

811
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,640
eventually becomes your user generated

812
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,519
content. Okay, not from a celebrity, not

813
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,159
from a creator, just an ordinary user.

814
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,960
Okay. So once this happened then you got

815
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,120
an massive influx. Is it correct? Yeah.

816
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,880
Beautiful. Actually uh UGC is something

817
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,279
that you use till today. M so initially

818
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,279
for the 3 month you know we had a plan

819
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,440
that we will only work with community

820
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,679
because we want to show real results and

821
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,559
real outcome and uh we don't want anyone

822
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,880
endorsing the product without trying it.

823
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,559
Uh look there are a lot of good content

824
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
creators

825
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,840
but large majority

826
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,519
follow a script and they will endorse

827
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,279
anything that the brand will ask them to

828
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,399
do it without even using the product

829
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:09,360
right and we feel that will not be right

830
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,679
for a brand uh and when we started again

831
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
you know while clinical proven solution

832
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,720
one part of it second was again when we

833
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,720
spoke about the transparency and honesty

834
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,600
with whom we need to work with customer

835
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,120
and we thought that we'll not do it uh

836
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
let us also to see whether the product

837
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,240
working or not. So first three or four

838
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,000
month that was the plan and you know we

839
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,279
started getting a lot of email DMs from

840
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,799
a customer that hey you know one thing

841
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,519
that I like love about the brand is

842
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,159
your honesty on the content part that

843
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,320
you don't give lot of PR packages you

844
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,919
don't give endorsement you don't work

845
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,600
with content creators on paid

846
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
partnerships

847
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,720
please don't change it okay and we felt

848
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,760
that this means so much for people this

849
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,840
is exactly what we should do so Even

850
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,399
till now, our paid partnership would

851
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,480
have been like four or five in the

852
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,000
entire 5 year period. But bro, what I

853
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
think is I actually disagree with that

854
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,080
because if you're a great product, you

855
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,159
should market the hell out of your

856
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,960
products. Why? Because if you don't do

857
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,040
that, we will see other brands who are

858
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,440
not authentic, who do not produce

859
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,520
results, then engage in this marketing

860
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,159
facade because of which they'll end up

861
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,639
capturing your market share and you will

862
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,560
be doing a disservice to your potential

863
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,879
customers by not marketing your

864
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,320
products. I may be a little old school

865
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,720
in this. So see what I believe is one

866
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,000
see given now uh everyone is on social

867
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:41,839
media. So everyone is a content creator.

868
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,919
Um if today we say ship some

869
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,679
20 30,000 product a day or maybe more

870
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,079
than that large part of that are on

871
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,240
social media already. They may have

872
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,399
lesser number of followers but their

873
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,720
opinion is highly regarded in that

874
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,960
group. Okay. Right. Versus say a content

875
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,000
creator with maybe a million followers

876
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,160
or so. M if we can tap in large number

877
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,160
of those customers who actually become

878
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,320
our evangelist

879
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,160
the cumulative effect of that would be

880
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,040
lot more as a impact than a paid

881
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,839
endorsement. Okay. But the cumulative

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,920
impact of that plus paid endorsement

883
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,480
will snowball it right. It will uh

884
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,520
we again I said you know we were never

885
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,880
as such against paid partnership.

886
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,720
Uh like we did some and in those cases

887
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,880
mandate was very clear that you know use

888
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,599
the product and be authentic about it

889
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,599
share what you like and also share what

890
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,480
you don't like about it.

891
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,400
uh not many follow this mandate right I

892
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,720
mean and you can clearly see that it's

893
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,160
very sugarcoated oh I love this product

894
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,640
this changed my life and all those

895
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,240
things and we felt that you know we are

896
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,760
not

897
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,440
we're doing disservice to a customer

898
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,640
because you know they are relying on a

899
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,160
particular opinion while in marketing

900
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,280
sense

901
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,880
uh it work

902
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,839
if I think primarily from consumer side

903
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,119
it is actually not right and you know

904
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,359
all the things that are telling you that

905
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,680
why we started thinking the brands are

906
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,400
not you know honest with the customers

907
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,119
and all following the same thing will

908
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,359
not make us any different than the other

909
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,920
with whom we felt you know uh were not

910
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,119
and second is again you know if you look

911
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,680
at finite versus infinite mindset

912
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,160
u we don't have to win skincare as a

913
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,440
category like a 3 month

914
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,800
you know there's a good saying that you

915
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,720
know you earn trust just in drop and

916
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,880
leave it in bucket or whatever. Right?

917
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,000
So you know it take lot of time to build

918
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,160
trust. True. And one wrong thing and

919
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
your entire reputation is like gone.

920
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,640
Whatever effort that you put in two to

921
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,920
three year uh every time say a story is

922
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,680
on a social media which is even legit

923
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,160
people will take it with a pinch of salt

924
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,599
that is it true or not. Yeah. uh we

925
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,520
don't have that challenge today because

926
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,280
they never did it and with time if a

927
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,440
product deliver the result see people

928
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,839
are vocal uh at least in architecture we

929
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
have seen that so if the snowball is

930
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,880
there if there's a large number of

931
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,680
returning customers eventually you'll

932
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,760
grow and I think we are a good example

933
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,960
of of you know those practices so you

934
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,960
know if you stay true to the values if

935
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,200
you actually give some value to a

936
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,240
customer and people are really nice to

937
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,320
give it back multiffold. Yeah, that's

938
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,160
actually very interesting. In fact, bro,

939
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,640
the reason why I asked you this question

940
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,640
is because India has a very socialistic

941
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,560
mindset saying, "Oh, please don't do

942
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,320
paid marketing." There is a very big

943
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,800
problem that we have with paid

944
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,359
marketing. Essentially, people have a

945
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,680
problem with false marketing, not paid

946
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,839
marketing. But because all false

947
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,200
marketing is paid marketing, they put it

948
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,240
under the same bucket. It's hard to

949
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
differentiate. Yeah, it's hard to

950
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,480
differentiate because I was having this

951
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,640
conversation with Nikl and uh you know

952
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
Zeroded often says that we don't spend

953
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,880
on marketing. I said you're doing a bad

954
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,960
job by not spending a lot on marketing

955
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,800
because if you look at Zeroda they do

956
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,440
things that are so counterintuitive. In

957
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,880
fact, Zerodha loses money in some cases

958
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,839
by introducing new features. For

959
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,440
example, they've got a feature called

960
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,280
the nudge. So if there's a stock split,

961
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,839
people tend to go people tend to go and

962
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,400
buy that stock because they think ar

963
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,359
1,200 rupees stock I'm getting it at 300

964
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,800
rupees. But the moment you make that

965
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,160
transaction, you are into a soup. Zeroda

966
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,880
will make money because Zeroda makes

967
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,760
money per transaction, right? But

968
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,359
eventually the investor loses money. So

969
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,960
they've got a feature called nudge.

970
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,800
Every time something like a stock split

971
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,640
happens and investors go and investors

972
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
try and buy that particular stock

973
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,640
there's a nudge which comes up and says

974
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,240
you know this company has recently gone

975
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,480
through a stock split so you should

976
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,240
educate yourself before buying the stock

977
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,960
and in most cases after reading that

978
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,440
people don't buy the stock similarly if

979
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,599
there is a lot of telegram flooding that

980
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,000
is happening for a particular stock

981
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,440
zeroda has an intelligence team they

982
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,440
don't make money out of it they have an

983
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,000
intelligence team they tell their

984
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,480
investors that this stock is being

985
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,800
heavily marketed on telegram groups so

986
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
you should reconsider buying the stock

987
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,720
and here's some information to educate

988
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,680
yourself after that you may choose to or

989
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,440
not choose to buy that stock now these

990
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,359
are features

991
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,280
back in the day when Zeroda introduced

992
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,560
these features other companies did not

993
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,200
take this approach why because they

994
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,960
would lose money because every user is

995
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,280
going to give you some money that's

996
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
obviously very less but then once that

997
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,520
compounds to a million users That's a

998
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,440
lot of money and considering the fact

999
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,079
that they are competitors by investing

1000
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
heavily into IPL ads and several other

1001
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,520
things. I said that you are doing a

1002
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,599
disservice to your potential customers

1003
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,760
by not marketing these products because

1004
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,000
if you market these products people will

1005
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,720
come to Zeroda. Once they come to Zeroda

1006
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,040
they can actually save some money. So

1007
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,440
Nikil said yeah that's actually a good

1008
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,920
thing. It's just that no marketing has

1009
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,119
been stuck with us. So now we have this

1010
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,480
reluctance to market our products and

1011
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,160
the problem that I had with that

1012
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,680
socialist comment saying that oh please

1013
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,320
don't engage in paid marketing bro the

1014
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,000
same thing happened with us as well. Um

1015
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,240
we were just about to do a sponsored

1016
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
deal. We have a very strict due

1017
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,920
diligence procedure. Back then it was

1018
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,320
not that strict but we still did as much

1019
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,320
as we can but now our due diligence

1020
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,560
process is very strict. We think a 100

1021
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,320
times before endorsing any product. In

1022
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,920
fact, even before we call any guest, we

1023
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,079
do a lot of due diligence before we call

1024
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,920
any guest.

1025
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,359
In fact, we say no to 1 cr worth of

1026
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,520
deals per month, by the way. So

1027
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,560
when we do that, what we've understood

1028
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,200
is that in spite of doing all of this,

1029
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,280
when you endorse a particular brand that

1030
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,599
one random subscriber doesn't agree with

1031
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,440
or that one random subscriber has had a

1032
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,400
bad experience with, they would just

1033
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,880
put out a lot of hate, which then

1034
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,079
creates a ripple effect. So I always

1035
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,680
wanted to tell subscribers that A just

1036
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,880
because we're endorsing a product

1037
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,359
doesn't mean 100% of the subscribers

1038
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,599
will have a great experience. B

1039
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,839
endorsement is not a bad thing. False

1040
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,000
endorsement is a bad thing. So

1041
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,480
understand the lines properly because in

1042
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,160
India like I said socialistic approach

1043
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
anything that has been done to make

1044
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,400
money is a bad thing. That's not how it

1045
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,160
works. There is capitalism, there is

1046
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,000
crony capitalism and there is conscious

1047
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,680
capitalism. In fact, if you do the right

1048
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,040
thing and then you make money, that

1049
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,960
person should be making the maximum

1050
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,240
amount of money because that way the

1051
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,319
world will be a better place. Like

1052
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
Zeroda today makes about what 2,000 odd

1053
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,760
crores in profits. The world is a better

1054
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,560
place because of them. Because if you

1055
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,800
look at any great company in the D2C

1056
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,560
category starting from whole truth to

1057
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,079
all of the brands, Zeroda has an

1058
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,440
investment and they all have this

1059
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,839
license to do the right thing even if it

1060
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,000
means slowing down of revenue because

1061
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,560
Zeroda calls itself. I mean, rain matter

1062
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,319
calls itself a perennial investor. We'll

1063
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,200
stick with you forever even if it means

1064
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,119
defying the odds of investment which is

1065
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,040
where you know my counterargument came

1066
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,280
in that if you're so good you should

1067
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,000
market the hell out of your products.

1068
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,079
Yeah. So you know as you said at times

1069
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,160
it's tricky because you know you

1070
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,240
stuck in your own thoughts that I was

1071
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,640
not doing this so generally I should

1072
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,400
not. Uh second is in your own example

1073
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,359
when you said you know one customer or

1074
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,680
subscriber felt offended and all but

1075
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,680
majority still agrees with you and they

1076
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,079
can see the honest in you right which is

1077
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,839
more important uh you cannot be loved by

1078
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,400
100% people there would be some

1079
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,200
exceptions and all and see the third

1080
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,440
part is uh while you would want to do

1081
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,760
the right marketing you also need to

1082
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,400
figure out people who are aligned with

1083
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,920
your values and thing. So say there's a

1084
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,319
content creator and the person do 10

1085
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,119
endorsement. Out of those 10, eight are

1086
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,480
false endorsements. While you are right

1087
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,960
and you are saying all the good or bad

1088
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,480
about it, the minute this person doing

1089
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,680
start do the doing the endorsement,

1090
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,440
right? People will also put you in the

1091
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,800
same bucket in which the other eight

1092
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,079
are. And for them it is very difficult

1093
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,680
to understand that this out of those 10

1094
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,400
is legit, eight other are not. Uh so

1095
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,119
associating yourself with particular

1096
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,960
segment you always feel it can be

1097
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,800
challenging. Uh and if you're doing say

1098
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,359
content partnership you have to do it in

1099
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,599
hundreds and thousands. M we still do

1100
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,920
some as I said. So we work with some

1101
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,440
dermats and we do a lot of education

1102
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,760
content. We also work with our PR firm

1103
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,119
and they curatively shortlist some

1104
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,200
journalist who get our product without a

1105
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,640
mandate to write anything about us. If

1106
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,760
they lie, they'll write about it. If

1107
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,040
they don't, they will they'll mention

1108
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,359
that I don't like anything about it.

1109
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,319
Right? So, we do it in bits and pieces.

1110
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:18,160
But then you have to work a lot in terms

1111
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,160
of having the voice uh and how closely

1112
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,800
we can work with the customers that you

1113
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,880
know can I create lot of UGC so that

1114
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,040
whatever noise someone is creating by

1115
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,200
doing a lot of paid conversation or paid

1116
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,680
content can I have the same through

1117
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,560
customers and that only happen if you're

1118
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,920
able to give lot to them. So we always

1119
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,680
stick in creating a lot of educational

1120
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,200
part. Uh we even repost some of the

1121
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,760
success stories that people share with

1122
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,160
us by even tagging them very

1123
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,560
selectively. Uh all the faces that you

1124
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,560
see on our site on our page are real

1125
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,000
customers. They are not models, right?

1126
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,000
And we even give credit that hey this is

1127
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,680
a person. So you can go in and see this

1128
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,720
person will have 200 followers. It's not

1129
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,400
a content creator or a celebrity. So if

1130
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,440
you continue to do the right thing see

1131
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,079
eventually people figure out and that

1132
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,240
trust is very difficult to buy overnight

1133
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,440
and you know again the compounding of

1134
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,000
that in 5 7 10 years is massive. Yeah.

1135
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,920
You know every time somebody in fact we

1136
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,400
often keep having this debate over here

1137
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,760
about ethics and you know marketing

1138
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,520
ethics because you're being ethical but

1139
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,760
you need to tell people today that oh

1140
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,359
you know what guys we're ethical so you

1141
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
know please consider us to be a little

1142
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,599
different than the other people that you

1143
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
are comparing us with. So

1144
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,319
when it comes to people eventually

1145
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,680
figuring out the problem that I often

1146
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,240
have and the question that I often ask

1147
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,640
myself is what if that eventually is 50

1148
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,319
years because if you look at some of the

1149
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
most successful brands I'll not name

1150
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,920
them but you will understand like you

1151
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,240
said they're all based on marketing

1152
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
facade like some of the soft drinking

1153
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,560
brands that we have in the market today

1154
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,800
are based on marketing facade and

1155
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,760
they've been marketed as

1156
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,680
the source of several superstars energy.

1157
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah, you know what I'm saying, right? I

1158
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,800
know. Mo, the one thing that I want to

1159
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,640
touch upon and then we'll move on to

1160
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,440
skincare and we'll go deeper into it is

1161
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,280
about influencers.

1162
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,599
There's a D2C wave that's going on and

1163
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,760
even large companies have started to use

1164
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,920
creators and influencers to promote

1165
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,480
their product. Now, as a brand, I want

1166
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
to understand how do you think and to a

1167
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,680
large extent you've already told me that

1168
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,079
if you find an influencer to be

1169
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,520
authentic, you would engage with them.

1170
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,400
But my question is, how do you gauge

1171
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,880
authenticity? Because if a creator has

1172
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,480
about 500 posts,

1173
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,560
you can't have an idea about all the

1174
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,240
brands that they're endorsing.

1175
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,520
You can't have an idea about the

1176
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,000
reasoning behind their endorsement.

1177
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,599
Sometimes it might be authentic, but you

1178
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,680
might just disagree with them. So, it's

1179
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,000
quite subjective, right? So, when you

1180
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,599
give a brief to your team about choosing

1181
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,359
creators,

1182
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,440
what exactly are the attributes that you

1183
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:01,040
ask them to look for? And B, how do they

1184
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,960
execute it? So you can't look at all 500

1185
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,440
but you can very easily look at last

1186
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,480
five or 10 and that will give you a good

1187
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,800
flavor about areas they are talking

1188
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,680
about and does that align with your

1189
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,520
brand idea philosophy or not right and

1190
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,599
for every campaign also you need to have

1191
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,119
a very clear

1192
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,040
guideline or a mandate or something that

1193
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,240
you want to achieve.

1194
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,640
uh do you need a product endorsement or

1195
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,760
do you need someone to create education

1196
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,760
content basis that customers can make

1197
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,640
informed decision. See as a brand we

1198
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,200
always overindex on education and if I

1199
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,079
know the person has depth on a

1200
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,440
particular subject and they can create

1201
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,880
some content which can be relevant for

1202
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,839
people because you know the way maybe we

1203
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,400
are creating content is not easy for

1204
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,720
everyone to understand and adding your

1205
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,280
personal flavors and own examples can

1206
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,680
make it easier for users. Right? So that

1207
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,079
is how we always looked at it. But it

1208
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,280
can vary depending on one your brand

1209
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,160
goal and also your overall brand

1210
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,119
personality. Got it. So let's talk about

1211
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,440
minimalist. Let's talk about one of your

1212
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,520
early brand goals. Your early brand

1213
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,119
goals would be education. So I'm

1214
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,200
assuming you would stick with dermats

1215
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,040
and not fashion creators. Correct. You

1216
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,960
would get Dermats to use scientific

1217
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,520
persuasion to talk about your product.

1218
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,119
Yeah. whether that's good or bad, both

1219
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,040
of them put together and then you'll put

1220
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,359
that message out. But now let's say you

1221
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,640
want to put out a mass outburst and

1222
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,000
that's where you'll have to use fashion

1223
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,200
creators. How do you gauge a fashion

1224
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,839
creator's authenticity? See uh if you

1225
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,400
think your first part is done where

1226
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,559
awareness is there in people and now you

1227
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,559
just need endorsement or certain content

1228
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,119
which is large number people are able to

1229
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:50,319
consume a very simpler word right u and

1230
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:54,079
again I said see if you're able to see

1231
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,960
last few post if you think in those

1232
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,559
cases you know any endorsement the

1233
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,200
person has done still has some honesty

1234
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,760
to it and you can gauge honesty basis

1235
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,559
you know I'm sharing good or bad both

1236
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,400
about it right and I have a opinion and

1237
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,800
not every other pose that I do is just a

1238
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,880
paid partnership so some of those

1239
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,480
smaller thing you can see and again uh I

1240
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,079
will not say those are must have uh it

1241
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,760
need to align with your own personal

1242
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,839
views also it need to align with your

1243
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,400
own brand views also so organic versus

1244
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,559
inorganic content

1245
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,040
less paid marketing and more organic

1246
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,240
content so if you see 10 posts If two

1247
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,400
are paid posts and eight are organic

1248
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,200
that's a green flag for you. Correct.

1249
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,680
See as a brand actually we don't do paid

1250
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,880
partnership even now. So even now we

1251
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,920
only do UGC. Uh even though we know we

1252
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,920
can spend budget but we don't do it. Uh

1253
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,160
some stories that we started doing now

1254
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,160
because again how can we uh reach out to

1255
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,160
larger users. You said we do

1256
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,000
testimonials. So we actually invite

1257
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,480
customers to our studio, ask them to

1258
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,400
share their honest journey with the

1259
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,720
brand, how they discovered, which

1260
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,680
product they're using, you know, any

1261
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,680
learnings that others can use and post

1262
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,359
those on our YouTube and then promote

1263
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,200
those. So there are ways in which you

1264
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,640
can figure out what works for you and

1265
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,359
what is right for you. U we have always

1266
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,960
been on organic not on inorganic but

1267
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,240
someone looking at inorganic I think

1268
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,520
these are certain traits that you can

1269
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,680
follow. So Mohit in 2020 2020 was a

1270
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,359
strange year because it was one of the

1271
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,520
gold rush years of the Indian startup

1272
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,720
ecosystem where every Tom Dick and Harry

1273
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,800
was getting millions of dollars in

1274
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,640
funding.

1275
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,040
But the problem with authenticity is

1276
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,440
that it cannot be solved with funding

1277
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,200
and you cannot gain success because of

1278
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,720
funding by sticking to authenticity.

1279
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,559
Authenticity by nature is slow. It will

1280
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,040
result into compounding but then it

1281
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,640
takes time but during that time since

1282
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,400
you are not the only skincare brand in

1283
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,559
the market.

1284
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
How did you manage to stay authentic and

1285
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,839
what are the challenges that you faced?

1286
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,920
Because if I were to be your competitor

1287
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,000
and I know that Mohit is not going to

1288
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,000
engage with fashion creators I will go

1289
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,760
out there in the market even though you

1290
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,119
have a better product than mine. I would

1291
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,839
go out there and put my message out

1292
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,480
there and become a better known product.

1293
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:19,280
And as we all know the brutal truth of

1294
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,200
the startup ecosystem is that best

1295
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,680
products don't win in the market. The

1296
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,920
best known products win in the market.

1297
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,880
Did you face this challenge? And if yes,

1298
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,720
how did you encounter it? See uh I think

1299
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,880
one we I said we started with the

1300
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,640
category which was very differentiated.

1301
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,119
So all the large companies are focusing

1302
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,079
on

1303
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:44,319
certain trends uh which were say either

1304
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:47,839
natural and all those stories we

1305
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,400
stick to the ingredient we stick to a

1306
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,520
format which was serum which was not

1307
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,119
very crowded right so that at least two

1308
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,280
good six seven months give us some space

1309
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:02,240
to breathe uh competition catch up when

1310
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,640
they know there's a success story till

1311
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,559
and no one even care what this brand is

1312
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,000
right and when they know their success

1313
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,119
stories by them then you have a 6 month

1314
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,240
head start uh and you have a community

1315
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,880
which know your brand so I think the

1316
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,400
first big aspect whenever someone is

1317
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,440
starting up you know start in a segment

1318
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,319
which is less crowded blue ocean yeah

1319
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
and start with a

1320
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,400
again a differentiation which is not

1321
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,240
like hey I'm 10% better I always say

1322
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,160
internally we need to be like 10 times

1323
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,359
better

1324
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,520
If you cannot stand out in both that you

1325
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,640
know my outcome is significantly better

1326
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,480
than the other solutions that you have

1327
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,680
in the market and then I'm starting in

1328
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,800
certain category which are not very

1329
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,079
crowded people care they listen they

1330
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,319
notice and that basically can give you

1331
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,000
the initial push that you need which

1332
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,559
money cannot buy so in short you're

1333
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,599
saying results speak that's it yeah so

1334
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,319
results will come uh but again I said

1335
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,920
you know results for us was in a

1336
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,599
category which was lesser crowded So it

1337
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,200
was not very competitive. So while

1338
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,839
larger brands were fighting in certain

1339
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,839
spaces, we were in a very opposite

1340
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,839
space. So everyone was saying that hey

1341
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,680
you know I'll go with natural and we

1342
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,400
were saying oh I have chemicals, I have

1343
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,800
acids. Uh people saying my product

1344
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,880
contain you know sensorial part good

1345
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,520
fragrances and all those thing. We said

1346
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,440
all our product without fragrance right.

1347
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,240
Uh you have beautiful packaging and we

1348
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,720
have like boring plain black and white.

1349
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,680
uh that people never knew can be a

1350
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,200
playbook to create a good brand or big

1351
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,400
brand. So it was a very unique playbook

1352
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,280
that we followed. No one else was doing

1353
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,800
anything in that by the time people felt

1354
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,319
oh this can be very interesting this is

1355
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,559
becoming big and this can be a good

1356
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:52,400
trend. Uh we had 6 month some startup

1357
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,000
after that started following up but even

1358
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,839
large companies can't create anything in

1359
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,160
6 month. we will need maybe an year or

1360
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,839
two year 2 years later if you're not

1361
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,240
able to pull it off then something is

1362
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,400
wrong with your execution

1363
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,559
uh so I think initial decision that we

1364
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,680
took help us a lot did you go to South

1365
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,520
Korea to do your market research we did

1366
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,400
and what did you find out we did that

1367
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,720
very late okay so yeah I was in Korea

1368
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
just last year

1369
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,319
yeah yeah

1370
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,040
see again when I said the initial thesis

1371
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,760
was always about following some indid

1372
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,280
and practices which are wellknown and

1373
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,480
clinically proven. Oh, so you don't have

1374
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,839
to go to South Korea to understand. I

1375
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,240
don't have to create a trend. I said

1376
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,280
that today say snail m something is

1377
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:42,079
popular but we always see that okay is

1378
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:44,480
there enough data for it and if the

1379
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,079
okay what is the end goal of rating a

1380
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,920
product and that is how what we work

1381
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,640
right so if I have to work on say aging

1382
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,599
what are the most potent solution for

1383
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,119
aging today then the answer would be say

1384
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:02,400
retinol and now molecules like retinol

1385
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,760
uh if so do I have to solve aging or do

1386
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,359
I have to give say a snail mucin? If

1387
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,640
your choices are very clear that which

1388
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,839
brand you are creating, I think the

1389
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,359
answer also become very clear. H very

1390
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,359
interesting.

1391
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,839
In fact, two stories that I actually

1392
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,680
remember are uh you know be under the

1393
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,599
hood until the giants discover that

1394
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,240
there is an opportunity. The founder of

1395
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,319
VBA sauce, he built a 1,000 cr company,

1396
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,720
bro. And he was like I just hope nobody

1397
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,240
figures this out. And then Forbes came

1398
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,760
and did a story on him and everybody

1399
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,079
figured out that there is a huge market

1400
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,400
opportunity which is uh quite

1401
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,839
interesting. In fact tell me something

1402
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,240
today if an entrepreneur wants to get

1403
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:44,240
into skincare which expo in South Korea

1404
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,920
should entrepreneurs visit to understand

1405
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,559
what's going to happen in the skincare

1406
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,240
industry in India 5 years down the line.

1407
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,400
See there are two expos uh and these

1408
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,440
expos happen in different part of the

1409
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,079
world. One is incosmetic.

1410
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,680
Second is cosmoproof.

1411
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:06,960
So this is a one where lot of suppliers

1412
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,319
will come with new molecules discoveries

1413
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:13,680
in certain ingredient. So this is mostly

1414
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:17,680
for your procurement supplier labs and

1415
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:21,200
all. Cosmoprof is a event where you'll

1416
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,640
have your ODMs and these partner. What

1417
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,160
do you mean by ODM? So there are two

1418
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,680
type of companies right? one who create

1419
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,119
their own product and they have their

1420
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:32,000
own manufacturing uh like how we work.

1421
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,599
So we have our own labs, we have our our

1422
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,200
R&D. So we look at these you know

1423
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,079
solutions, we buy ingredient, we create

1424
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,119
our own product. Uh then on other side

1425
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:46,640
there are third party manufacturers

1426
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,799
and they do a lot of research. They have

1427
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,720
their in-house team and they also do a

1428
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,319
lot of end to-end manufacturing and all

1429
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,440
which is white labeling. which is white

1430
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,960
labeling and you will find a lot of

1431
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,480
these people also in event like

1432
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,640
Cosmograph

1433
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:06,559
right so both are relevant uh one is

1434
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:09,119
largely on the scientific part of it

1435
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,280
ingredient molecules and all I think we

1436
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,920
visit those events more often because

1437
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,839
that align with our overall product

1438
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,319
philosophy and how we create product

1439
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,760
second is these cosmopro kind of event

1440
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:24,000
where you have OBMs ODMs and all And

1441
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,599
there actually you can see certain

1442
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,040
trends. U so if there are 100 people and

1443
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,480
you can see that three or four solutions

1444
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,160
everyone is selling you can you can

1445
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,920
clearly see that oh this probably will

1446
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,480
become popular right you can just get

1447
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:40,480
some vibes of it. Uh and some of those

1448
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,000
initial hints can be important for you

1449
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,720
to understand will that trend be

1450
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,440
relevant in India or not. Uh but if you

1451
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:52,160
just marry that with some data and see

1452
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,960
uh whether those ingredient and over

1453
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,079
oral formulation make sense or not uh it

1454
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,760
can be important rather than plainly

1455
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,319
buying a marketing story. You have to

1456
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,240
apply some of your own work on that. Did

1457
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,920
you outsource your manufacturing or did

1458
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,760
you do it in house? We do it in house.

1459
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,040
But why not outsource manufacturing?

1460
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,640
Because if you can have R&D in-house

1461
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,960
then you have control over the

1462
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,880
formulation and if you outsource

1463
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,799
manufacturing you don't have the

1464
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,480
headache of high capex and maintenance

1465
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,480
and in India setting up a manufacturing

1466
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,960
plant is a big headache. So why not take

1467
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,200
the convenient route of keeping R&D

1468
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,680
in-house and keep manufacturing

1469
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:33,839
outsourced. There are two challenges. uh

1470
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:36,400
one see just like any startup when we

1471
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,799
also started we never had the volumes

1472
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,280
with us that I can go to a big

1473
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,200
manufacturer and can get my product you

1474
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,760
know I need say thousand bottles 5,000

1475
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,160
bottles and all uh bigger companies

1476
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,400
won't work for us and whosoever will

1477
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,280
work probably their infrastructure will

1478
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,720
not be as good as what I require so

1479
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,799
quality to great uh you know uh manner

1480
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,079
will be questionable

1481
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,440
Second, if you become bigger and later

1482
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,680
you want to outsource your

1483
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,839
manufacturing, uh you are sharing the

1484
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,760
entire foundation with a third party and

1485
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,440
you know what exactly I would want in my

1486
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,200
product. So you're not able to protect

1487
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,880
your IP. Can't you have like a legal

1488
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,559
clause that can protect you from that?

1489
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,040
There's ways in which you can manage

1490
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,960
that part and it's very easy, right? So

1491
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,280
we always feel that you know if we are

1492
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,440
investing so much into R&D and creating

1493
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,400
our own IP, we would want to protect

1494
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,400
that. Got it. But tell me something. You

1495
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,079
mentioned that all the ingredients are

1496
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,319
pretty basic. You can use Google search

1497
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,960
to find them out

1498
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:43,599
and now you're telling me that the

1499
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,359
formulation is very very important. So

1500
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,920
is it a secret or is it general

1501
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:52,880
knowledge? So the general knowledge is

1502
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,480
the ingredient and the percentage and we

1503
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,920
won't disclose that very transparently.

1504
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,160
So I I'll give you example of say

1505
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,720
vitamin C, right?

1506
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,520
Now there are multiple forms of vitamin

1507
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:09,200
C also from you know ethilelescorbic

1508
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,680
to other variants and you need to see in

1509
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,400
terms of purity of that and stability of

1510
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,440
that and then again the R&D will come

1511
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,280
into play. So even if you're disclosing

1512
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,720
it that which form of vitamin C I'm

1513
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:26,480
using next is where you are sourcing. So

1514
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,760
there are multiple vendors in bases

1515
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,559
their material they are different

1516
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,240
specifications also like you know uh we

1517
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,960
publicly disclose I can share like we

1518
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,240
buy nasamide from a company Netherlands

1519
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,920
it's called lonza right and in nasamide

1520
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,640
you have impurities which create

1521
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,799
irritation we tested a lot of suppliers

1522
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,799
from other countries also their impurity

1523
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,799
content was slightly higher this company

1524
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,760
has the lowest impurity content while

1525
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,359
their RM is four times expensive but we

1526
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,040
are okay with it because of this

1527
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,839
particular part. So then finding the

1528
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,359
right supply is also very important. The

1529
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:03,839
last part of it say I'm creating this

1530
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:05,440
nas with 10% concentration right uh end

1531
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:09,680
of the day the objective is not to give

1532
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:12,000
nas in 10% objective is to ensure it

1533
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,559
actually deliver the result that you

1534
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,079
would want it to right the kind of

1535
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,880
solvents you're using so that it

1536
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,359
penetrate in your skin and work on the

1537
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,319
receptor that is very important part so

1538
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:26,559
that 90% people don't know right so say

1539
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,240
if I mix nasin and water apply on my

1540
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,400
skin it'll just stay on top of my skin.

1541
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,160
It won't do what it is supposed to do. M

1542
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,240
it will not seep in your sink. Correct.

1543
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,880
Okay. So, which solvent I'm using? How I

1544
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,200
am mixing the product? Uh we even quote

1545
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,119
an ISM with certain solvent to ensure

1546
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,640
better bioavailability. So, sometime

1547
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,480
these word become our marketing work

1548
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,720
that hey we have bioavailable product

1549
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,319
and all but the science behind that is

1550
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,760
slightly more deeper. Then which

1551
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,359
secondary technology we are using along

1552
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,520
with it. What kind of clinical studies

1553
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,280
we have done with it. So honestly for

1554
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,599
even one particular serum where we know

1555
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,000
the form factor we have created 20 30

1556
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,760
different product whenever we launch a

1557
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,280
new one it still take anywhere between

1558
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:08,079
12 to 24 month and protecting that is

1559
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,920
very important because that is anyways

1560
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,559
the only edge you have with someone

1561
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,680
else. Got it. So in the skincare domain

1562
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,319
the moat is IP. In our case we always

1563
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,799
wanted that to be a moat. uh see there

1564
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:23,119
can be still some companies who can

1565
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:25,520
start with marketing first approach and

1566
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,599
their mode can be better marketing you

1567
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,760
need to figure out which game you would

1568
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,079
want to play which you think you can win

1569
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:36,000
so sustainable mode you're saying is IP

1570
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:38,319
I always feel it's IP got it mo what

1571
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,319
exactly is the difference in behavior

1572
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:43,280
that you've seen

1573
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:45,599
between men and women with skincare

1574
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,680
because I'll tell you what my limited

1575
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,280
data says

1576
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,839
I don't want to put in a lot of efforts

1577
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,000
into skincare. I'll just get the first

1578
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:58,079
lotion that I get now whether that's

1579
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,760
Dove or Cetaphil or if it's white, if

1580
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,520
it's smooth, that's enough for me. I

1581
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,599
will apply. If it's fragrant, it's even

1582
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,440
better for me. In fact, recently I was

1583
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,440
told that it's actually a bad thing. I

1584
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,559
still don't know why, but that's the

1585
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,960
maximum I knew about skincare until very

1586
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,960
recently. So, I would just take the

1587
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,680
first thing that I get, apply, and

1588
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,640
leave. But if you look at my wife, she

1589
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,200
will first start with face wash. Then

1590
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:26,640
she will apply vitamin C. Then she will

1591
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,359
apply moisturizer. Then she will apply

1592
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:32,160
sunscreen. And then she will start

1593
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:34,640
applying a concealer. And then it ends

1594
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,920
with uh

1595
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,240
fixer. Then it ends with a fixer. And

1596
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,160
then there is also a reverse routine

1597
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,200
that I discovered that if you have to

1598
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,960
now wash your face, you can't just wash

1599
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,039
your face apparently. You have to then

1600
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:54,359
use a makeup remover

1601
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,359
tissue paper.

1602
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,079
But apparently that is dangerous because

1603
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,000
it consists of certain ingredients. I'm

1604
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,799
sure even she doesn't know about it. But

1605
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,039
she's told that it is dangerous. And uh

1606
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,799
there's a makeup remover that comes in

1607
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,119
and you're supposed to apply that and

1608
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:14,000
then you know you can get rid of all the

1609
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,920
bad ingredients from your skin. And then

1610
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,720
a few days ago when I was at my friend's

1611
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,319
place, Apura's place, she told me that

1612
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,319
there is a method called double

1613
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,319
cleansing.

1614
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:35,440
So two questions. Where does it end?

1615
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,440
Where does it end?

1616
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,319
consumerism

1617
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,599
key. Is there a real problem that you're

1618
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:51,200
solving? Yeah. My answer to this would

1619
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,720
be don't fix what is not broken. So if

1620
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,799
you don't have any skin concerns and

1621
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,480
challenges, why you need to reinvent

1622
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,160
what is working for you? Even if those

1623
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,680
two step which is say cleansing and a

1624
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,359
moisturizer that's okay. uh just that

1625
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,720
someone is following five step you don't

1626
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,240
have to mindlessly follow those five

1627
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,520
step so I think one people need to

1628
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:14,400
mindful what is right for them and if

1629
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,119
someone is following five 7 10 step

1630
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,280
there's no need for that right and I

1631
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,480
think the last step which I think is

1632
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,079
very important is sunscreen so what do

1633
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,319
you call prevention is better than cure

1634
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,319
so if you're able to prevent lot of

1635
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,760
solutions you don't need at later stages

1636
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,640
right I think these two I'll say are

1637
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,280
important

1638
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:37,280
anything in between that you apply which

1639
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,119
is any serum or any the product do only

1640
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,680
if you think your skin need that

1641
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,400
solution right so so say so if you don't

1642
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,440
have concerns of pigmentation and all

1643
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,359
you don't need to follow a lot of

1644
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,640
pigmentation product if you don't think

1645
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,839
you know you have uh dark spots and all

1646
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,119
sometime you know following vitamin C

1647
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:55,599
for brightening and all if that is not a

1648
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:59,440
desired goal that you have there's no

1649
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,680
need for it right keep it simple uh if

1650
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,359
If you are new just start with maybe

1651
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,799
beyond these two product is said you

1652
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,400
know cleansing and moisturizer maybe

1653
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,119
sunscreen just start with maybe adding

1654
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,640
one product at a time again uh we see a

1655
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,079
lot of customers who sometime come and

1656
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,799
say that hey I would want to buy five

1657
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,400
product and all this is not a sprint

1658
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:19,359
that tomorrow I'll apply all the product

1659
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,280
my problems will go away uh it's more of

1660
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:24,079
a marathon it's more of a discipline

1661
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:27,039
right just start adding one product see

1662
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,200
what it does uh if after that you feel

1663
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,680
there's a need for one more mindful

1664
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,200
fully add one more speaking of results

1665
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,000
and discipline I've seen that the

1666
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,640
patience level in men is very less when

1667
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,760
it comes to results with skincare

1668
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,200
whereas with women it's infinite I mean

1669
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,400
half of the women don't even have the

1670
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,319
problems that they're trying to solve

1671
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,640
for and that's the case with several

1672
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:50,160
other things one of them being skincare

1673
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,200
where they would just keep on following

1674
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:56,160
the skincare routine until in fact

1675
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:59,200
forever but when it comes to men if we

1676
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,079
see a 3% difference on our face by

1677
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,520
applying three different products. After

1678
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,400
a certain point, we would give up

1679
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,680
because we are not great observers of

1680
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,440
change on our face. Women are very sharp

1681
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,160
observers of what's happening to their

1682
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,160
face. We are not very sharp observers.

1683
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:20,000
At the same time, we don't have the

1684
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:22,000
patience to follow that routine and then

1685
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,799
expect something to happen and then see

1686
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,039
that happen and then decide on okay, are

1687
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,720
we going to keep using these products or

1688
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,000
are we supposed to add one more or

1689
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,920
subtract one more? So first of all,

1690
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,760
let's talk about the composition of your

1691
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,280
customers. How many of them are what

1692
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,559
percentage of your customers are men and

1693
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,440
what percentage of your customers are

1694
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,680
women? So before that one, see, I know

1695
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,440
we are coming at so I'll not generalize.

1696
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:50,240
M uh are they 100% generalized

1697
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,359
so you will find

1698
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,599
both the kind of you know uh behaviors

1699
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:58,319
in both genders will you find them in

1700
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,240
equal proportions again we have not

1701
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,079
quantified that so I can't answer

1702
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,799
whether that is like 50/50 in both or

1703
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,680
certain percentage in both uh but you'll

1704
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:10,400
still find again you know so

1705
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,920
given uh you have asked this question so

1706
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,359
I don't want to start with generalizing

1707
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,440
for everything else I'll give you data

1708
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:19,120
guys. But for this, it's just my bias.

1709
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:22,880
So, same same with me also. Yeah. Uh in

1710
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,679
terms of our customer uh split,

1711
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,799
70% would be women, 30% now for us is

1712
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,359
also men. Uh because as a brand, we

1713
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,920
always

1714
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,480
stay gender neutral which actually what

1715
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,520
skincare is. uh so I think all those

1716
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,600
skincare claim that you see for men for

1717
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,239
women and all those thing again are just

1718
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,560
marketing stories and all uh it doesn't

1719
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:49,440
work very differently our needs are

1720
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,799
different so the skin type and

1721
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,560
properties in men are slightly different

1722
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:54,799
than women so we have a slightly thicker

1723
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,000
skin compared to women so you know our

1724
01:08:54,799 --> 01:09:01,120
hydration level our aging and all are

1725
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,799
slightly different uh but say if someone

1726
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,319
is looking for a solution for aging like

1727
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,080
say retinol retinol are the one which

1728
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,159
work for both end of the day you're

1729
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,239
buying it even if you'll see men's skin

1730
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,520
care for aging turn the bottle see the

1731
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,839
label it'll have the same ingredient

1732
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,679
that will have for women also correct

1733
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,520
but going by data what is the difference

1734
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,279
in behavior that you've seen between men

1735
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,560
and women when it comes to skincare and

1736
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,679
how do you address that as a brand

1737
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,080
because your messaging has to be

1738
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,640
different your

1739
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,880
perceived results have to be different

1740
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,440
and your story has to be different so

1741
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,400
being a genderneutral brand addressing

1742
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,040
both men and women for something like

1743
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:40,239
skincare where both these customers have

1744
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,759
vastly different behaviors.

1745
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:43,359
Let's talk about the difference in

1746
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,199
behavior and then let's talk about how

1747
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,040
do you address the challenge that comes

1748
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:49,040
with it. So what's the difference in

1749
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,279
behavior that you've noticed from your

1750
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,839
data? No, I think uh there has been

1751
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:57,280
anyways a taboo associated with skincare

1752
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:59,920
in specific men right and uh one we were

1753
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:03,040
not very open in talking to others that

1754
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,239
hey I have a skincare um and you know

1755
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,159
you would have seen a lot of campaigns

1756
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,480
of

1757
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:10,560
other brands you know mocking men using

1758
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,520
a skincare and all so that was always

1759
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,840
the case which is changing people are

1760
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,280
talking about it and if you know sitting

1761
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,360
here I'll say hey I have a skincare

1762
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,600
you'll not judge me right so that

1763
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:24,400
changing. Uh second is of course you

1764
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,880
know the steps in men are lesser

1765
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,719
compared to women and lot of that are

1766
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,239
also more functional right and then

1767
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,320
third is the needs also a little

1768
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:36,480
different as I said that you know uh see

1769
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,520
the requirement of certain product in

1770
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,640
women because of lot of factors are

1771
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,000
again very different between men. Can

1772
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,520
you say this again? What is very

1773
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,800
different between men and women? Well,

1774
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,320
like I said, you know, uh, our skin

1775
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,920
textures and thickness are different

1776
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,679
between men and women. So, say women

1777
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,840
will have thinner skin because of which

1778
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,440
you'll start to see some of the aging

1779
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,440
signs maybe little early compared to

1780
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,880
men, right? So, maybe because of that

1781
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,280
their need for certain product would be

1782
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,960
slightly earlier compared to men, right?

1783
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,719
Uh there are certain some of those

1784
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:11,120
thing. uh see how we communicate when I

1785
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:14,320
say is always more about a product

1786
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:17,600
properties and an outcome you can expect

1787
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:19,760
from a product we never sell that say

1788
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,520
for a women these are the 10 15 product

1789
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:26,000
you should buy or for a man hey buy just

1790
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,760
these three right uh say for a cleanser

1791
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,920
if you have say sensitive skin this is

1792
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,080
what we have or if you're oily we have a

1793
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,640
product that is relevant for both now

1794
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,040
say as a men if you have a need for oily

1795
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,400
or acne prone on skin you will be able

1796
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,159
to relate to that communication you'll

1797
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,600
buy and even if you're a woman you'll

1798
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:44,400
able to relate to it because it is more

1799
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,400
factual basis that you can figure you

1800
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,600
can see that okay now beyond this

1801
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,239
cleanser I'm now looking for a

1802
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,159
moisturizer can I figure out something

1803
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,239
from a portfolio again very easily

1804
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:56,800
because everything is more datadriven

1805
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:58,640
and functional so we never face that

1806
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,199
challenge because we never promoted

1807
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,120
oursel very heavily as a women or

1808
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:04,960
promoted maybe certain steps certain

1809
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,000
routines which are different for both

1810
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,840
Got it. So you are more problem oriented

1811
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,760
rather than gender oriented. Is that

1812
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,080
correct? Absolutely. And regardless of

1813
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,920
whether this person is a man or a woman,

1814
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,280
Yeah. if they have a problem, they can

1815
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,040
come to minimalist. Correct. Was that

1816
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,080
your communication strategy? Exactly.

1817
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,760
Very very functional. Okay. So if I were

1818
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,320
to summarize what you just said, you

1819
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:29,760
said that skin types are different,

1820
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:33,120
results expected are different. And

1821
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:35,600
while amongst men it is largely a taboo,

1822
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,840
amongst women it's a flex. So it's

1823
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,040
easier to sell it to a woman as compared

1824
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,040
to a man. And like you mentioned that

1825
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,880
you because you're general neutral, you

1826
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,640
focus solely on functionality. But the

1827
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,280
one question that I often had is when

1828
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,440
you can increase your TAM by being

1829
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,840
general neutral,

1830
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,080
why do brands stick with oh we are for

1831
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,719
women and we are for men. Why do they

1832
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,640
stick to one particular category?

1833
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,440
Because when they do that, they're

1834
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,920
practically shrinking their TAM, right?

1835
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,000
One, you're able to create a niche in a

1836
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,480
growing segment. So, tomorrow we say

1837
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,840
that, hey, we have now a brand which is

1838
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,760
minimalist men created only for men. We

1839
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,360
can have a bigger pie of men from that

1840
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,560
particular brand because lot of

1841
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,440
customers will feel, oh, this is more

1842
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,000
relevant for me. Uh on a gender neutral,

1843
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,520
I still have to educate you that hey,

1844
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,400
you know, skin is same.

1845
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,000
It's no different right uh sometime if

1846
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,520
you're not aware you'll go to a shelf

1847
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,040
you'll see five product one is

1848
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,440
minimalist then next to it you'll see a

1849
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,320
brand ABC for men you'll most likely

1850
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,840
feel that is more relevant for me uh so

1851
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,840
in a long run we always feel because

1852
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,520
people are becoming more aware more

1853
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,480
knowledgeable

1854
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,880
uh doing right thing will help and will

1855
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,360
win uh but sometime again you know we

1856
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,880
have a large set of users from top to

1857
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,400
the bottom of the pyramid depending on

1858
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,880
which segment you're also going after

1859
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,400
the bottom is also pretty large and that

1860
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,920
will take like decades as you rightly

1861
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,520
mentioned before they understand what

1862
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,280
have been what they have been buying is

1863
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,800
just a marketing story. Got it. So

1864
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,520
you're saying that resonance is a major

1865
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,520
factor. Yeah. If a brand says that I'm

1866
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,600
only for women,

1867
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,360
they strike a better chord with women as

1868
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,000
compared to a brand that says I am both

1869
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,239
for men and women. But that makes your

1870
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,159
job even more difficult. Then why not

1871
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,480
start with women and then introduce

1872
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:24,880
minimalist men because you know that

1873
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,560
both products are the same. You can tell

1874
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,480
the customers that both products are the

1875
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,320
same. It's just the look and feel of

1876
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,080
both the products are completely

1877
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:36,960
different. Wouldn't this be an easier

1878
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,239
way to penetrate the market?

1879
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,600
I mean there's nothing wrong with that,

1880
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,080
right? See, one if you would have

1881
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,440
started with say skincare for women and

1882
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,880
then tomorrow I'm also launching

1883
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,400
something for men. I'm creating a lot of

1884
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:51,679
content that hey why this is for women

1885
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,679
and again if going back uh on the

1886
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,000
principles and the values see every

1887
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,400
decision that we take always goes

1888
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,320
through these two filters clinically

1889
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,159
proven and transparent if this is not

1890
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,239
transparent this is not honest and I'm

1891
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:07,360
lying about certain thing just because

1892
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:10,080
it suit my proposition that is wrong and

1893
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:12,080
we felt we don't want to do that as much

1894
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,760
as I appreciate that there's also an

1895
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,199
easier way out you don't have to spec

1896
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,880
specifically say that this is only for

1897
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,640
women. You just need to have women

1898
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,400
ambassadors endorsing your brand and

1899
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,320
people will assume that this is for

1900
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,320
women. You can use branding and design

1901
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,560
language to strike a better call with

1902
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,239
women without saying that this is only

1903
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,400
for women, right? And same is the case

1904
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:33,360
with men as well. But then I'm talking

1905
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,440
about this from a business standpoint

1906
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,719
because you entered a market which was

1907
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,199
extremely challenging

1908
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,719
and when you have so many challenges in

1909
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,199
fact you started with zero investment

1910
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,719
eventually you raised money right so

1911
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,159
speaking about it from a market

1912
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,080
viability standpoint customer

1913
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,840
desiraability standpoint it is easier to

1914
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:55,360
start with one category and then extend

1915
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:58,320
into the other without actually putting

1916
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,719
out something misleading. For example,

1917
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,320
if I have women ambassadors who endorse

1918
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,440
my brand, I don't have to say that this

1919
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:07,600
product is only for women automatically

1920
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,360
because thinking fast and slow, Daniel

1921
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,719
Carnean system one, system two, the

1922
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,040
monkey brain is going to assume that

1923
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,280
this is meant only for women and they'll

1924
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,400
buy that product. You could have struck

1925
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:20,800
a better chord with women

1926
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,560
in a much easier manner and that could

1927
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,080
have got you inside the market. See

1928
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,360
anyways you know if you look at the

1929
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:29,760
overall industry split uh and I really

1930
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,520
don't have the data but I'm sure 65 to

1931
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,920
70% of the consumers in skincare is

1932
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,320
anyways women correct right and

1933
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,640
initially also all our messaging image

1934
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,360
that you mentioned was largely towards

1935
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:45,840
women so while we were not calling it a

1936
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:48,480
women or men related brand image was 70%

1937
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,040
women maybe 25 30% men and that is how

1938
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,480
we also positioned ourself without

1939
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:56,320
explicitly calling calling it men or

1940
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,840
women. uh you gave example of two brand

1941
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,080
and you said you know you're using

1942
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,239
certafil and I'm sure that is equally

1943
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,560
popular in both the genders right you

1944
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:07,040
don't see certafil women and men so even

1945
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,360
if brands take a genderneutral position

1946
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,159
there's a way to attract both uh you

1947
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,640
gave example of dove right again a very

1948
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,640
very iconic brand love it uh they again

1949
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,560
are popular amongst both the genders so

1950
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,560
that is also one way of building it so

1951
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,199
they are in both the path you need to

1952
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,719
figure out which path you'd want to

1953
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,920
And

1954
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,159
again you know my own personal

1955
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,360
experiences and learning u see

1956
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:34,320
eventually it's not about all the right

1957
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,640
thing that you do it's also about how

1958
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,679
many less or wrong decision you have

1959
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,640
taken in the journey right and every

1960
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:46,080
decision which is calling it a women or

1961
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,800
men using endorsement from content

1962
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:52,320
creator doing something else has a

1963
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,760
repercussion and these are like

1964
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,440
either or kind of a thing, right?

1965
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,440
Whether you're this or do this, you

1966
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:01,040
can't do both. Mhm. It is very

1967
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,600
surprising how long-term you thinking

1968
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,960
when you are not a big brand. It's quite

1969
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,520
interesting because when you're a very

1970
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,800
large brand, you tend to think long-term

1971
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,320
because you're here in this game for the

1972
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,960
next 30 years. But when you're a very

1973
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,480
small brand, the natural instinct of an

1974
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:19,920
entrepreneur is to always survive and to

1975
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:22,719
get a foot at the door. But then somehow

1976
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,600
brother you are you are but actually if

1977
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,040
you don't think for 10 years see again

1978
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,440
I'll not lie that you know we have been

1979
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,000
thinking 30 50 years right but if I

1980
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,679
don't even think for 10 year I can't

1981
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,679
build a big brand that's a very big

1982
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,280
window though 10 years because you know

1983
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,360
nal raan says something very very

1984
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,040
interesting he says that the greatest

1985
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,040
entrepreneurs are often the ones who

1986
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,719
don't ever want to exit their business

1987
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,480
and every time they pick something they

1988
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,840
always have a very clear reasoning about

1989
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,719
how this is going to play out in the

1990
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,400
next 10

1991
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:54,239
and they just tend to do it

1992
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,920
instinctively right for example I told

1993
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:58,480
you about the zeroda decision right to

1994
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,640
put nudge over there and I've had this

1995
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:03,199
conversation with Nikil and Nithan also

1996
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:05,520
why did you do this he said you know

1997
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,199
this is just beneficial

1998
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,120
they never thought it to be a big deal

1999
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,600
because for them this was beneficial and

2000
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,960
that's it they never thought uh you know

2001
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,560
we're losing out on revenue because they

2002
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,480
said 10 years down the line we don't

2003
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,640
want people to find out that there could

2004
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,760
have been a feature and we missed out on

2005
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,760
that and this happened quite

2006
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,440
instinctively

2007
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,000
a lot of them are not able to articulate

2008
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,880
that but the way you articulating

2009
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,719
everything I'm able to understand that

2010
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,920
every single pillar of foundation that

2011
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,600
you've laid is a foundation

2012
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,199
that will reap benefits for the next two

2013
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,640
decades whether this is about being

2014
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:42,880
gender neutral focusing on functionality

2015
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,120
focusing on authenticity because you and

2016
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,440
I we both know D2C brands that are today

2017
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,880
billiond dollar companies

2018
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,960
through paid partnerships which which

2019
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,239
are not very authentic right but they've

2020
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,679
been able to do that because they choose

2021
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,159
the easier route but then it's so

2022
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,600
difficult to choose the harder route and

2023
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,280
somehow from this conversation I'm able

2024
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,080
to make out that you somehow always

2025
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,719
choose to do things the harder way my

2026
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:10,000
question is what exactly is that driving

2027
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:13,040
factor which is consistently pushing you

2028
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,719
to do things the harder way again it

2029
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:18,880
might honestly look very hard initially

2030
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,719
Eventually it become very obvious to

2031
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,880
you. See eventually you have seen the

2032
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,400
result. No when I say eventually I'm not

2033
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,440
saying you know 5 year 10 year or so

2034
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,560
right? Our journey has been only for 5

2035
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,560
year.

2036
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,800
uh like you know a lot of time when you

2037
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,880
think about how you take decisions, how

2038
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,199
to

2039
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,080
you know ask your team to take decision

2040
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,679
right u you need to have certain

2041
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,000
processes or certain values on which

2042
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,000
teams are taking decision and again you

2043
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,960
know minimally started because of our

2044
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,880
own discomfort with the way brands have

2045
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,960
been selling their product so it started

2046
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,120
with very clear philosophy when I say

2047
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,800
that you know hey be like honest honest

2048
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,159
honest and you can't be selectively

2049
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,679
honest M uh then take every decision

2050
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,440
which is right for a customer because

2051
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,520
you know I have been a customer and I

2052
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:09,199
was like pissed with the way I was

2053
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,640
treated u when it come to my own brand I

2054
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,199
can't sit on the fence and say oh this

2055
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:16,000
is suiting my particular agenda I should

2056
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:18,159
do it but then I'll say wrong things

2057
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,280
about five other brand if today I don't

2058
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,400
have trust in food someone should fix it

2059
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,800
there are some brands which are fixing

2060
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,159
it right but you know if those brand

2061
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,239
also become very selective that okay

2062
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:30,159
today that is suiting my agenda. Uh will

2063
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,840
that be right for customers? No. Right?

2064
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,520
And again, you know, there are a lot of

2065
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,040
supporters

2066
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,880
who support those businesses just

2067
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,360
because they're honest. But what I'm

2068
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,360
trying to figure out is

2069
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,159
what exactly happened in your life so

2070
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,239
profoundly that is pushing you to be so

2071
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:48,400
ethical. I'll give you my experience and

2072
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,920
you'll be able to you'll be able to tell

2073
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,760
me what happened in your case. In my

2074
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,280
case, it's very simple. I just don't

2075
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,840
have a good night's sleep if I do

2076
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,120
something even remotely wrong. So I just

2077
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,199
don't do it because I know for a fact

2078
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,480
that if I do it today I'll keep thinking

2079
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:05,920
about it. Even if it is debatable I just

2080
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:09,520
won't do it. So for me it makes a huge

2081
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:11,280
difference that night. Similarly when I

2082
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,440
asked Nan the same question he told me

2083
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,600
that you know

2084
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,520
tomorrow if there's one random guy who

2085
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,920
pops up and says that you know because

2086
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:24,560
of this feature of yours I lost money. I

2087
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:27,440
don't want that story. So um

2088
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:30,320
the potential for

2089
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:33,600
being found guilty

2090
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:35,679
for something that is quite debatable is

2091
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,960
also something that Nathan avoids. Okay,

2092
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,040
you get what I'm saying right? Even if

2093
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,760
it is remotely

2094
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:44,880
possible that because of one of Zeroda's

2095
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,880
feature an investor loses money and he

2096
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,320
comes and tells Nathan that bro I lost

2097
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,280
money because of you. He doesn't want

2098
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,800
that. He doesn't want that on his um on

2099
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:57,600
his record of deeds. Similarly, my

2100
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,600
question to you is what exactly happened

2101
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:04,000
so profoundly in your life which is

2102
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:05,360
pushing you to do things the hard way

2103
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,199
even though you are in a market which

2104
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,159
has cutthroat competition. Yeah. So

2105
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,159
there were two things right. Uh so one

2106
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:14,320
see again that was largely related to

2107
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:17,040
our upbringing. So I was born in a very

2108
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,280
low-inccome family and you know growing

2109
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,880
up around that time uh there are certain

2110
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:24,239
things that your parents always tell you

2111
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,560
right and my father used to say always

2112
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:28,480
that you know don't do anything wrong

2113
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,560
right and there's a karma it'll come

2114
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:32,239
back and all if you see some wrong thing

2115
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,639
happening around your family

2116
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:38,880
neighborhood and all he'll always say

2117
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:40,880
that don't worry you know karma so

2118
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,880
there's someone who is watching you

2119
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,600
right I don't know I you

2120
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,440
So that you know that is how we we grew

2121
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,960
up. So that always stay in back of the

2122
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:53,679
mind. I think second is uh see at some

2123
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,080
point in time you also think as a

2124
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,560
founder how your team should function

2125
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:02,400
right and

2126
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,679
I felt that you know I if we say that oh

2127
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,320
we have a value which is being

2128
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:09,120
transparent and honest it can't be a

2129
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:12,960
value written on a wall somewhere. Yeah.

2130
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:15,920
uh and if they see it every day that we

2131
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,719
come in a room we decide everything

2132
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,480
which suit our agenda and then tomorrow

2133
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,880
I'm doing a town hall and saying hey be

2134
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,639
honest and all those thing that is a BS

2135
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,520
you don't want to be a hypocrite you

2136
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:30,239
don't want to be a hypocrite uh but the

2137
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,199
good thing is if you start following

2138
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:36,080
some of those practices

2139
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:39,360
the kind of impact it has on people that

2140
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:42,080
is insanely positive

2141
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,120
uh like after our one year you know we

2142
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:48,880
did like a company ENPS or something

2143
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:51,440
right and we had both a set of c people

2144
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:54,239
some said hey I'm very happy some said

2145
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,760
I'm completely unhappy okay uh because

2146
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:58,000
maybe I'm not happy with my manager

2147
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,320
which is a usual thing maybe I think you

2148
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,159
know your policies per some of those

2149
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,600
thing can be better and there are always

2150
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:06,239
certain challenges which you know you

2151
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,080
need to fix there was one question which

2152
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,880
we ask in that questionnaire

2153
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:13,440
that you know do you feel proud to be

2154
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:16,159
part of NIM list you know the answer for

2155
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:19,199
that was 100% not a single person said

2156
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:21,040
no oh wow that's amazing that was

2157
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,400
amazing that was the moment I felt that

2158
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:26,480
okay you know we are creating something

2159
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:29,440
which we know we can be proud of m u we

2160
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:31,920
talking you know giving examples of D2C

2161
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,159
uh for D2C being on marketplace is very

2162
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,920
important now for marketplaces your

2163
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,440
rating reviews are very important you

2164
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,040
know there's an entire industry

2165
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,159
You can pay 20 30 rupee to get a

2166
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:44,159
fivestar review, right? Does it help? It

2167
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:47,280
does. There's a category for this. It's

2168
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:49,840
called online reputation management.

2169
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:52,000
And when I heard about it,

2170
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,600
it was very strange and scary. Like

2171
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,800
tomorrow, I could be building a D2C

2172
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,480
brand and my competitor could flood my

2173
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,679
comment section, correct? With

2174
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:04,639
absolutely terrible comments and that

2175
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:06,719
could result into a loss for my company.

2176
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,639
Now when you're going against funded

2177
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,679
competitors and they pour in that

2178
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:13,840
funding into spoiling your reputation

2179
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:16,719
that's a disaster right no so see you

2180
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:21,199
need to believe in two things one again

2181
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:23,360
what you're doing uh on that and like

2182
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:26,639
talking about the reviews and online

2183
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:29,440
management uh we never purchase even

2184
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,719
single review ever and every time the

2185
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,000
discussion used to happen with my own

2186
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,239
team that hey you know there's a

2187
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,320
competition product they launch

2188
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:41,199
they have 500 fivestar exact ratings. Uh

2189
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:43,120
we have five and in that in that

2190
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:45,520
unfortunately if two people don't like

2191
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:48,880
initially and they review your rating is

2192
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:51,520
say 2.53 how to sell this product. You

2193
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,880
then just need to trust in the process

2194
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,960
that hey you know we have spent 2 years

2195
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,760
in this product. We have done a lot of

2196
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,760
trials. We know eventually large number

2197
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,040
of people will like it. Give it time.

2198
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,040
It'll happen. It'll happen. It'll

2199
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:06,000
happen. And one day it'll happen. If it

2200
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,440
does not okay you know it actually is

2201
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,960
more important because you know what is

2202
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,719
not working just go and fix it one day

2203
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,679
you know your ratings will show what the

2204
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:18,800
product is it actually is a true mirror

2205
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:20,480
to your own R&D team also to your old

2206
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,199
self also in terms of how good or bad

2207
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,320
your product are right second is when

2208
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,400
you say you know competition will flood

2209
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,199
your comment sections and all we have

2210
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:31,440
seen so many examples say no something

2211
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,639
else I'll tell you right where say maybe

2212
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,560
a content creator

2213
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,920
just because we were not endorsing or

2214
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:41,360
paying bashed our product against the

2215
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,840
competition and then I can go and see

2216
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,400
they will have maybe 100 500 comment

2217
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,080
majority will say this is working for me

2218
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,679
and sometime people say oh we are

2219
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,360
sending bots we are sending our own

2220
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,480
people to write comment we never did

2221
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,719
that but with time you start to see that

2222
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:59,520
you know again if you have large number

2223
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:01,520
of people who know what you are doing

2224
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,600
who believe in what what you have been

2225
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,960
in this entire process and if your

2226
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,560
product work they will support you. So

2227
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,159
there are again if there are 10 bad

2228
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,679
people there are 90 good people also you

2229
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,199
need to just trust on 90 and just

2230
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,440
continue to do it right. Very

2231
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:18,480
interesting. But tell me something

2232
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:20,000
skincare as a category plays out very

2233
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,440
strangely when it comes to Amazon

2234
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,120
reviews. Yeah. Why? Because Amazon asks

2235
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,600
you for a review after you get the

2236
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,600
product. Yeah. But the person who is

2237
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:32,800
receiving this product has to use your

2238
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,880
product for at least 15 to 30 days to be

2239
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:37,840
able to give a

2240
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,960
databacked review.

2241
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,040
So how is Amazon review relevant for

2242
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,880
you? How can I gauge the relevance or

2243
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,159
quality of your product by looking at

2244
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,360
Amazon review? Because even if

2245
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:50,360
somebody's giving you a one star

2246
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,639
review,

2247
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,800
they received the product, they used it

2248
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:59,920
once and they're giving you a review the

2249
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,320
next day. So how does Amazon review make

2250
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,679
sense for your category? No, on the paid

2251
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,760
one or the organic one you're talking

2252
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:09,440
organic one. I'm organic. See once you

2253
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:11,840
product Amazon ask for review. So u as a

2254
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:15,040
brand you can trigger your email for

2255
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,920
review request bases what you think is

2256
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,920
the right time for your product like in

2257
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,239
our case we send email to customer after

2258
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,320
21 28 days and that gets reflected on

2259
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:26,400
Amazon. Yeah. Yeah. So after 21 days

2260
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,000
you'll get a email that hey you know you

2261
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,600
purchase this product give a review. So

2262
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,719
as a brand you can actually configure

2263
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,320
that. Uh I know my product is not a

2264
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,960
instant gratification because I'm

2265
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,800
solving some concerns. So not sending

2266
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,560
after 2 days and sending after 20 was

2267
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,199
more appropriate for me. So that is how

2268
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,600
you can just all plan. Got it. Moit. Now

2269
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:47,920
I want to go deeper into how to build a

2270
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,080
skincare brand. Firstly you spoke about

2271
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,400
manufacturing. Tell me how much does it

2272
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,159
cost to set up a manufacturing plant if

2273
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,600
you want to manufacture skincare

2274
01:29:54,159 --> 01:30:00,320
products. So uh see we started without

2275
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:03,920
lot of capital and we were bootstrapped

2276
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:07,600
right. For how long? Uh one and a half

2277
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:09,600
year. Yeah. So we created a very very

2278
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,320
basic infrastructure.

2279
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:15,040
Uh that level of infrastructure you can

2280
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:17,199
start anywhere between

2281
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:21,280
25 to 30 lakh. What are you saying?

2282
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah. Okay. Uh and how we manage it

2283
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,520
large part of that was lease. So we

2284
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,360
never invested in land. We never

2285
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,600
invested in building. You can find that

2286
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,920
in lease. Uh the only thing that matter

2287
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:36,400
is then your mixers and your filling

2288
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,679
equipment. Right. Uh so prioritize

2289
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,520
depending on how much money you would

2290
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,679
want to invest

2291
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:44,880
into those equipment which you think are

2292
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:46,880
very very critical like mixers and see

2293
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,040
again your mixers are the most important

2294
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,320
part of it which is a heart right uh

2295
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:53,679
even if you are doing and then filling

2296
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,920
uh even if you're doing say packing

2297
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,199
manually by say putting bottles into the

2298
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,040
cartons and all and doing all those

2299
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:01,040
manually initially it's okay because you

2300
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,600
don't have volumes right you don't need

2301
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:05,520
say auto packing machines and You don't

2302
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,199
need all the infrastructure. Lot of

2303
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,360
other thing also can be very manual

2304
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,520
initially. So you can just break it down

2305
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,440
into which processes with the right

2306
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,840
people you can run manually by still

2307
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,920
owning the you know quality and which

2308
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,639
processes you need to invest because

2309
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:24,000
that defines where the product is. Once

2310
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:26,400
you cross your first level and you'd

2311
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,239
want to upgrade then you can put maybe

2312
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,719
some more money. M so after when minim I

2313
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:34,400
said you know was in October 2020 till

2314
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,320
then we were running with this small

2315
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:41,040
setup of 3050 lakh uh the second plant

2316
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:43,360
when we created was after almost a year

2317
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,520
when we started getting closer to 100 cr

2318
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:49,120
of revenue we were doing some 7 or 8 cr

2319
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:52,480
a month wow uh then we nested around

2320
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:54,000
1820 K 1820 crores

2321
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,560
this was large scale this was large

2322
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,360
scale because that was then created to

2323
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,440
have you know gave us some 500 K of

2324
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,239
Raven Run rate where we still operate.

2325
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,560
Great. So you found the gap in the

2326
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:08,239
market to be functional skincare

2327
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:11,040
products.

2328
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:13,840
You designed and manufactured functional

2329
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,040
skincare products like face serum and

2330
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,679
how many products did you initially

2331
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,040
start with? Face serum. Six product. Six

2332
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,560
products. Yeah. Can you name those

2333
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,880
products if it's not? It was. Yeah.

2334
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:27,280
Yeah. It was salicylic acid, vitamin C,

2335
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,880
nioinamide,

2336
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,960
uh,

2337
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:36,639
retinol

2338
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:38,880
and I think fifth would be

2339
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,040
tanexamic acid if I'm not wrong. Okay,

2340
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,719
these six products were solving for

2341
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:45,679
which are the top three problems of

2342
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,360
skincare. All these were distinct. So

2343
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,760
for every unique problem, we just

2344
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,440
created one then. So like salisic was

2345
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,719
for acne. So if you're dealing with acne

2346
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,760
just use that product that will be

2347
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:57,920
helpful. Retinol was for like aging.

2348
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,480
Vitamin C is for brightening.

2349
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,960
Nyasinamide is for oily skin. Tennisamic

2350
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:05,440
is for pigmentation. So we just found

2351
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,560
five or six unique needs. Each of these

2352
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,000
need were just solved through one

2353
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,560
particular product. Apart from that

2354
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,400
content creator influx that you got, how

2355
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,159
did you then educate your customers and

2356
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,560
go ahead apart from your own content

2357
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:19,120
too? Because content doesn't scale

2358
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,639
instantly, right? You went from 0 to 100

2359
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,520
crores in about 8 months if I'm not

2360
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:26,320
wrong. So when did that hockey stick

2361
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:30,239
growth happen? See for us it was a very

2362
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:32,320
on a unique story. So like every month

2363
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:34,880
we were adding 1 cr in revenue. So like

2364
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,480
first month was one run rate then two

2365
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,080
then three then four. It never became

2366
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:41,840
like you know we stayed on one and then

2367
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:44,000
one day it shot up right. Uh though very

2368
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:46,080
mindfully we were adding channels in it.

2369
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,280
So first 3 month we knew this was

2370
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:51,520
primary D2C without any other channel.

2371
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:54,960
uh after 3 month when we had lot of

2372
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:57,040
comfort that people are liking the

2373
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,239
product there's a good repeat and

2374
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,560
retention and we also understand basis

2375
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:05,440
all the queries email DMs what they're

2376
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,679
getting uh what challenges they have in

2377
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,679
finding the right product also because

2378
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,400
on my own site I can offer a lot of

2379
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:14,719
support navigating it and answering

2380
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,880
questions I can't do it on a marketplace

2381
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,199
after three when we understood we then

2382
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,760
launch on Amazon and Then we stayed with

2383
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:23,440
Amazon for three more month. Uh once we

2384
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,840
had some comfort that okay whatever

2385
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:28,159
information we are creating and putting

2386
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,159
all those text that is helping people

2387
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:32,480
find the right product and whatever

2388
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:34,800
success we saw in terms of conversions,

2389
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,880
retentions and all some of that we can

2390
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,120
initially see because 3 month again is a

2391
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,480
very short period of time and whether in

2392
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,639
those segment are product are becoming

2393
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:45,600
popular or not. After that then we added

2394
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:47,920
Nika. So for the first 8 months I think

2395
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,639
these were the three just channel uh

2396
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:53,920
focus was largely on

2397
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:56,080
uh our own content and then we were

2398
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,880
working very closely with our customers

2399
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:02,560
because they were anyways the uh early

2400
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:05,360
movers and evangelist. Can we work with

2401
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:08,320
them to create out of UGC? So how to

2402
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:10,400
nurture that community? How to help them

2403
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:13,600
create that content? What can be some

2404
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,920
motivators for them? Uh so like you know

2405
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,679
if we see some stories if we see certain

2406
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,760
post where they're talking about it we

2407
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,280
will just go take their permission see

2408
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,440
if we they're allow we are allowed to

2409
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:25,920
repost it and people are happy to do

2410
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:27,920
that right uh we don't used to edit

2411
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,239
anything so whatever you have written

2412
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,719
we'll clearly go and publish that added

2413
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:34,800
lot of trust in new users because I can

2414
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:37,280
see some authentic stories right that

2415
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,000
also

2416
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,159
gave a motivation to other that if I'll

2417
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,280
also create authentic brand listen to

2418
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:46,880
me, right? And my content can also be

2419
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,480
part of their page. So some of those

2420
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,800
small small things. So see again UGC is

2421
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,120
very interesting but it is very

2422
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,520
challenging also how you can ask you

2423
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:58,880
know people to create content for you. I

2424
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,760
faced a lot of problem with that because

2425
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,920
we have a course called the

2426
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,639
communication masterass. Bro people have

2427
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,480
gotten promotion they've gotten great

2428
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,480
jobs and we're not talking about

2429
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,400
ordinary promotions or ordinary jobs.

2430
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:12,480
People have gone from 12 lakhs to 18

2431
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:14,080
lakhs in package because of the

2432
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,600
communication masterass. And this is the

2433
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,199
reason why I wanted to talk to you about

2434
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,239
motivators.

2435
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:21,679
How do I motivate people to give me a

2436
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:23,760
great testimonial? Because I'll tell you

2437
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,199
what is a challenge. Challenge is

2438
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,360
they've achieved this growth. They're

2439
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:29,600
very happy to share it with you and

2440
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:33,840
that's when we ask can you please create

2441
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:36,560
a video. Now in most cases they don't

2442
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,400
feel like the video is good enough. as a

2443
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,320
result they refrain from sharing the

2444
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,360
video or sometimes they hesitate and

2445
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,880
then they share the video and they say

2446
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,560
oh you know what please don't put it out

2447
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,239
because I don't look good in the video

2448
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,080
so when you encounter problems like

2449
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:50,159
these how do you solve these problems

2450
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:52,480
what were your initial motivators not

2451
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:54,320
when you started publishing but before

2452
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,400
you started doing this on a large scale

2453
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,840
before you became a big brand how did

2454
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,560
you motivate your customers to put out

2455
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,560
content the thing you need to understand

2456
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,480
actually what is the value for your

2457
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:08,639
customers to create the content right

2458
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:12,239
and you know every time if I'm endorsing

2459
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:14,080
something it has my credibility right

2460
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:16,560
and even if I'm you know talking a small

2461
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,800
group of four people who are around me

2462
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:21,360
if I share something which has no social

2463
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,679
currency attached to it is a useless

2464
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,639
conversation right so say if today I'll

2465
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,960
say oh do you know chat GPT right uh

2466
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:31,920
you'll not think highly of me because by

2467
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:36,000
now you already know about it but say

2468
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:39,199
the day maybe grog was introduced use or

2469
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,880
say now there's a you know new AI model

2470
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:42,960
which not too many people are aware

2471
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,560
about it. If I tell you some of those

2472
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,480
information, you'll feel oh I know about

2473
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,400
this industry a lot more than you and

2474
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:51,040
you'll have you know you'll think that

2475
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,320
maybe I'm an expert in this and every

2476
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,760
group will have certain people who are

2477
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,440
expert in their own category you know

2478
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,119
some will have lot of information about

2479
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:59,920
say investing some will have lot of

2480
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:01,920
hands-on experience about you know

2481
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,520
phones and all I know what all latest

2482
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,639
tech and other thing are there some will

2483
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,840
have certain other interest and they

2484
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,159
will share information which you think

2485
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,199
is always very insightful so you're

2486
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,719
saying that you have to give them

2487
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,960
something very interesting to share.

2488
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:16,400
Exactly. But if you were in my place and

2489
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,840
you had to do this for communication

2490
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,760
masterclass, communication is not

2491
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,679
something that's very new and people

2492
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,600
don't want to share their salary jumps.

2493
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,760
Bro, I went from 12 lakhs to 18 lakhs

2494
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,520
because they want to be private about it

2495
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,639
and it looks like bragging and then they

2496
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,840
think they don't look good enough in

2497
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:31,280
front of the camera because obviously

2498
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,639
you'll be awkward because this is your

2499
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,840
first content that you're putting out,

2500
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,719
right? So in those cases, how would you

2501
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:41,840
solve this problem? No, I think uh you

2502
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,840
can maybe look at the content certain

2503
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,080
unique part of the content that others

2504
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:50,000
don't cover which can be some

2505
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:52,560
interesting value ad for to the person

2506
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,679
who's listening. So if I say hey you

2507
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,480
know I've gone through this particular

2508
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:58,000
content class which maybe talk about

2509
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,679
this one aspect which is very

2510
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,440
interesting and engaging and I found

2511
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,600
this example which I just want to share.

2512
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,119
Hm bro that's exactly what we do and in

2513
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,000
fact the limited pieces of content that

2514
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:10,320
we've gotten are contents that people

2515
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,520
make because they wanted to complete the

2516
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,639
assignment. For example, we have an

2517
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,480
assignment where you have to speak in

2518
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,639
front of the camera for about 1 minute

2519
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,480
explaining a business strategy. People

2520
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,679
post to that content but then in that

2521
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,920
content there is no communication

2522
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,760
masterass. It's just content. So how do

2523
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,880
you plug communication masterclass in?

2524
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:28,480
No. So see always think like a customer.

2525
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:32,400
When was the last time you did an

2526
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:34,560
endorsement of a brand and why? Um this

2527
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,400
podcast is by not in podcast with your

2528
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,560
to your own friends bro I do it all the

2529
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,800
time because because you found something

2530
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,800
which is cool a worthy sharing worth

2531
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,440
sharing right so I think you know in

2532
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,199
your own content just figure out that

2533
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,679
these are certain part which are very

2534
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:52,000
cool which can be very interesting for a

2535
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,960
person sharing it

2536
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,679
but even you know just casually uh like

2537
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,440
even if we watch a movie

2538
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:01,600
I don't want to recommend a movie which

2539
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,040
I think probably you'll not like it

2540
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,880
because you will think oh I have a bad

2541
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,760
taste. I only want to recommend movies

2542
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,199
which I think oh this is definitely good

2543
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,040
and something you may not be even aware

2544
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,800
of that oh I have found something a good

2545
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,960
documentary on Netflix which is very

2546
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,360
cool very insightful and all I'll

2547
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,480
definitely tell you because I I'll brag

2548
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,239
about it because that will build you

2549
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,639
know uh again it's a good social

2550
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:26,159
currency if I tell you all the cool and

2551
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:28,000
new things you will feel I'm smart right

2552
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:30,320
so can you build those levers into the

2553
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,360
product if today someone will say hey

2554
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:35,520
you know I'm using a vitamin C it has no

2555
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:38,159
smartness today, right? Because world

2556
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,320
has already moved from that to something

2557
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:42,880
very different today, right? What is

2558
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:45,280
that new thing that you're bringing and

2559
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,760
can that be easily informed to people

2560
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,080
and some of the initial customers would

2561
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,679
like to talk about it?

2562
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,080
Great. So, you're saying that you should

2563
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:57,040
find something bragworthy. Worthy of

2564
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:58,400
sharing. Yeah. Worthy of sharing. If it

2565
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,080
qualifies as bragworthy, it's great

2566
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,920
because they'll anyways brag about it.

2567
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,600
Something worthy of sharing that is not

2568
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,159
conventional. That doesn't make it look

2569
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,280
like an endorsement but a testimonial

2570
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:10,800
which is authentic but is insightful

2571
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,119
enough for other people to find it

2572
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,800
interesting. Yeah. Got it. And in your

2573
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:16,320
case what was that? So in our case

2574
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,040
actually there were two things right. So

2575
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,560
one was the entire

2576
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:25,280
ingredient and their concentration in

2577
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:27,040
the science right uh like 2020 if you go

2578
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,679
and talk to people and ask them hey what

2579
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:33,280
nias is majority will say I've never

2580
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:37,119
heard of this word right. So for some

2581
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:40,639
this was important. Uh that was a time

2582
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:42,800
lot of content was created both by the

2583
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,760
brand where we were doing it by

2584
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,920
consumers by even content creators also

2585
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,679
uh without any paid endorsement because

2586
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,800
you know their consumers are asking hey

2587
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,560
you know while of course you're doing

2588
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,639
this content can you tell me what is

2589
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,920
nice because I can see some brands are

2590
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,960
selling this product. So of course they

2591
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,560
will have to create content because

2592
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,679
their customers are asking for it their

2593
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:05,440
viewers asking for it right. So that was

2594
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:07,920
one. Second is on the result. So again

2595
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,199
in our product that was second hook. If

2596
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,920
I'm going through certain some

2597
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:13,600
challenges and if I feel certain

2598
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,360
solution that I'm using for the market

2599
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,239
and maybe I'm using three product say

2600
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,679
one from us and it is really helping I

2601
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,960
would really want to share my story

2602
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,239
because I know someone else is also

2603
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,719
struggling in their life and it can

2604
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:26,480
meaningful for them also. So both the

2605
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,480
thing helped initially for us. So you're

2606
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:31,199
saying that social currency is what

2607
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,440
makes you go viral amongst peers. In

2608
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:34,880
fact, now that you're saying this, it's

2609
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,239
making a lot of sense to me because I

2610
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:37,440
read this book called Contagious. Have

2611
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:39,199
you read this book? Contagious.

2612
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:42,960
Contagious speaks about this pineapple

2613
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:44,560
example. This fruit could be different.

2614
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,280
But then this book speaks about an

2615
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:49,119
example whereby an uncle cutting

2616
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:51,440
pineapple

2617
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:54,080
went viral on the internet. Okay? And

2618
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,480
this was way back when WhatsApp was not

2619
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,800
so prevalent. This video got about 30

2620
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:01,760
million views. It was on every single

2621
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:04,159
website.

2622
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:06,400
Now, if I tell you this, does this make

2623
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:08,239
sense to you that an uncle cutting

2624
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,400
pineapple is going viral on the internet

2625
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:12,320
and every single media house is

2626
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,679
publishing about this uncle and this

2627
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:16,560
video is everywhere. Does it make sense

2628
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,760
to you? No. Right. But then the reason

2629
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:22,239
why it went viral was because the uncle

2630
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,600
taught the world how to cut a pineapple

2631
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:27,679
in 6 seconds. So it was a high utility

2632
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,199
product. Right now it's making sense,

2633
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:32,560
right? How would you cut a pineapple in

2634
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:34,800
6 seconds? So when people saw it, they

2635
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,239
wanted to share it out to the world

2636
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,440
saying this is how you can cut pineapple

2637
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:39,360
in 6 seconds because they found it

2638
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:41,280
interesting. It's almost like uncles

2639
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,800
sharing WhatsApp forwards because they

2640
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,040
find the news to be very interesting.

2641
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,360
See again because someone in my group

2642
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:48,960
will feel oh wow this person knows more

2643
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,159
than me or this is something that he

2644
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,719
share. He always shares some cool

2645
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,239
things. So that is currency. You need to

2646
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,080
build those into the product. In fact,

2647
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:57,840
this makes sense with our content as

2648
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,040
well. You know, I see a lot of people

2649
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,800
who say, "Oh, you know what, bro? I

2650
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,280
watch your content." And I ask them,

2651
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,119
"What do you do with this content?"

2652
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:08,080
They tell me that your content makes us

2653
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:09,440
look smart in parties. So, when we go to

2654
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,280
a party and somebody's talking about

2655
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,600
making India, I know why it's failing.

2656
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:15,600
I'll tell you why along with stats. If

2657
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,360
somebody goes to a party and uh they

2658
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,600
have to answer the question, what's

2659
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,000
happening with ODC? they would give

2660
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,639
people a very very databacked reply

2661
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
which makes them look like a genius and

2662
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,440
uh now people have started telling me

2663
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,119
that you know I went to this party I

2664
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,320
spoke about ONDC and as it turns out

2665
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:33,320
everybody had watched your video so they

2666
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,320
said

2667
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,360
in fact we heard stories where people

2668
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:39,119
have actually copy pasted our entire

2669
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,000
business case study with their MBA

2670
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:43,520
assignment and the teacher was like dude

2671
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,360
I do you think you're the only one who's

2672
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,560
watching YouTube

2673
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:51,040
so they get caught now um unfortunately

2674
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:53,040
So what you're saying makes so much

2675
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:55,360
sense, man. So if you have to make

2676
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,440
something go viral organically, you have

2677
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:00,080
to make sure that it is bragworthy and

2678
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,760
it is worthy of a social currency which

2679
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,280
will then prompt other people to share

2680
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,960
it. In your case, you actually turned

2681
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,880
your disadvantage into an advantage

2682
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,760
because you were producing products

2683
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,679
which are hard to pronounce, right? Let

2684
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:17,040
alone explain. But then because it was

2685
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,280
cool and it became social currency in

2686
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:22,320
the sense that it could benefit somebody

2687
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:24,159
else, people naturally tend to share it.

2688
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,440
And from what I can imagine, if there

2689
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:27,760
are two friends sitting over here and

2690
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,119
you know Kunala often says that if your

2691
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,800
product is great, two people sitting at

2692
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:32,480
the dinner table should be able to have

2693
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,480
a conversation about your product where

2694
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:37,280
one person tells the other person that

2695
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:38,800
this is a cool product that I found. So

2696
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:42,080
I'm imagining this and you can correct

2697
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:44,159
me if I'm wrong that

2698
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:46,320
if I used a product of yours which is

2699
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:47,760
helping me get rid of acne and I see a

2700
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,360
friend of mine who's also encountering

2701
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,880
the same problem. I would use this as

2702
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:52,400
social currency and recommend this

2703
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,920
product to him so that he gets results

2704
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,679
and eventually he'll have newfound

2705
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,400
respect for me and that's how this

2706
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,719
scales. Does that make sense? So it can

2707
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,000
happen in multiple manner. So one of

2708
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,000
course you know the person is using the

2709
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,560
same product you can have a conversation

2710
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,480
or if you think the product can be

2711
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,800
relevant for this person also I can say

2712
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:13,199
hey you know I started using a new

2713
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:16,000
product from this brand and this is what

2714
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:17,679
this brand sell and offer if I know you

2715
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,040
are interested in this conversation

2716
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:22,719
right and you feel oh this is something

2717
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:24,000
cool and worthy of sharing uh or maybe

2718
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:25,520
if I know you are going through certain

2719
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,760
challenges and because of which you will

2720
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,080
find some benefits and you took this to

2721
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:33,760
social media using UGC so it was one of

2722
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:37,920
on steroids. Oh wow. Beautiful. Did you

2723
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:40,639
go offline? We started a lot later. So

2724
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,320
after one and a half two year uh that's

2725
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:44,480
when we started offline. So we had

2726
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:47,600
honestly you know uh a number in our

2727
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:50,239
mind that maybe once we'll get say 40 50

2728
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,679
retailers writing an email asking for a

2729
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:53,520
product that's when we'll feel maybe we

2730
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:56,400
are ready for it. Oh wow. Did you get

2731
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,560
those emails? Yeah we did. Wonderful.

2732
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,800
Tell me something Mohit. Um what I find

2733
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,360
very interesting about your business is

2734
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,719
that you started with six products. Six.

2735
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,600
Usually people say you know start with

2736
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,440
one and they would never start with six

2737
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,080
unless there's a common ingredient or

2738
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:13,760
common set of ingredients. Did you have

2739
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,119
common set of ingredients for these six

2740
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,639
products or were these six products

2741
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:18,880
completely different from each other?

2742
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,679
No. So the subcategory was same because

2743
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,719
these were all face serum. Format was

2744
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:26,320
same. It was again all serum. Uh

2745
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:28,400
ingredient in each of these were

2746
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,920
different. the hero ingredient was

2747
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,920
different. Of course, you know, the base

2748
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,760
ingredient of using water, certain

2749
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:37,760
solvents and all would be very largely

2750
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,119
similar also. Uh but these we started

2751
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,280
with the philosophy that okay know we'd

2752
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:44,000
want to target four five larger problem

2753
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:47,360
that people have so that there's a

2754
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:51,520
larger relativity to it. Uh see even now

2755
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:53,520
after almost 5 year we have some 50 odd

2756
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,199
product in our portfolio. So we never

2757
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,560
use product as a growth hack that you

2758
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:58,480
know will generate continue to generate

2759
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,119
more and more. We always felt that you

2760
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,360
know if certain product solve those

2761
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,560
needs it can be those you know classic

2762
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,880
product that can stay in the market for

2763
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,280
5 10 years till the time the tech is

2764
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:12,480
disrupted and I have to maybe you know

2765
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:14,159
upgrade my own product. Understood. Can

2766
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:16,159
you walk me through the unit economics

2767
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:17,360
of these products? I mean if six

2768
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:18,639
products have vastly different unit

2769
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,080
economics then we can talk about them

2770
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:21,520
but then if they have similar unit

2771
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,719
economics we can talk about them in

2772
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,040
general. It was largely similar. Uh the

2773
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,800
pricing may be different. Uh but

2774
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:30,639
percentage wise it'll be very

2775
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,679
similarish. Okay. Can you break this

2776
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:36,880
down for me? So uh I think MRP was

2777
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:39,119
closer to 600. Some would be maybe 549,

2778
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:43,679
some would 649 or you can use 600

2779
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:46,960
broadly for that. Uh when we say cogs,

2780
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:49,920
we again made that change. We always

2781
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,920
wanted to spend more into the product

2782
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,679
and we felt if you do that we'll have to

2783
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:56,400
spend lesser in marketing. Can you

2784
01:48:53,679 --> 01:49:01,040
explain Cox in brief? Yeah. So cost of

2785
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:06,800
goods uh sold and in that you include

2786
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:09,119
your making cost which is both your raw

2787
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,600
material and packaging material. Also it

2788
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:14,239
contain the basic overhead of factory

2789
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,560
your workers and all. And then it also

2790
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:19,280
include logistic so that you're able to

2791
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,880
get that good from a manufacturer to

2792
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,119
your own warehouse and all right so then

2793
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,199
these broadly things have been included

2794
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:29,280
while a lot company would be working on

2795
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:32,239
some 80 85% gross margin we were happy

2796
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:35,280
to work at 70%. So your cogs was uh 30

2797
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:37,760
30. Okay. So 600 rupees product though

2798
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:41,600
it is. So if your product costed 600

2799
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:43,760
rupees then your cogs was 200. Yeah. 180

2800
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,159
to 200 we were putting into the product

2801
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:48,159
and in that a very small percentage was

2802
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:49,920
going into the packaging material

2803
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:52,800
largely was into what is inside the

2804
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,679
packaging. So for that we started just

2805
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:58,080
using you know the farmer grade bottle

2806
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:01,040
some basic paper packaging and all. So

2807
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:02,960
negligible percentage always went into

2808
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:05,760
the the packaging. How much would that

2809
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:08,880
be just in case? Yeah, packaging would

2810
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:11,280
be less than 4 5%. 4 5%. Okay. Yeah.

2811
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,560
Take care. Majority was into then uh the

2812
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:17,119
product itself, right? Then you'll have

2813
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:20,239
the next uh cost which is your

2814
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:22,719
distribution cost. Uh so there you'll

2815
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:25,520
have your marketplaces, their selling

2816
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:28,719
fees and all those thing, right?

2817
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:31,280
U initially it was 26 for certain

2818
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:34,080
marketplaces blended now for us it comes

2819
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:35,600
to closer to 15 odd person 15 odd% so it

2820
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:38,080
decreases with time yeah yeah so like on

2821
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:40,960
D2C I don't have a selling fee on my own

2822
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:44,639
platform right uh then there are certain

2823
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:47,199
platforms or certain partners who buy

2824
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,719
outright and don't charge a fee which is

2825
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:50,320
basically inventory model inventory

2826
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:54,320
model so like can you explain inventory

2827
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:57,119
model yeah so like in Amazon I have to

2828
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:59,520
send my goods to Amazon warehouse

2829
01:50:57,119 --> 01:51:01,440
whenever a customer buy Amazon will ship

2830
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,920
it. So actually I'm just using their

2831
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:06,719
platform payment gateway and warehousing

2832
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:10,320
and logistic services right when goods

2833
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:14,000
are sold to a customer Amazon will pay

2834
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,520
that amount minus the fee right and that

2835
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,119
fee will take into consideration all

2836
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,800
those thing which is what we call as

2837
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:21,040
which is fulfilled which is what we call

2838
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,480
selling fee. Second model when we say

2839
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,560
inventory is a model in which someone

2840
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:27,360
will buy outright. So say in case of

2841
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,280
Nika, Nika will buy a product outright.

2842
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:31,679
So instead of say 100 rupee which is

2843
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:34,560
MRP, Nika will pay 100 minus certain

2844
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:36,800
percentage, I'll sell it for that amount

2845
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,239
and then there's no cost. Every cost of

2846
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,440
warehousing and all has been taken care

2847
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:44,000
by Nika. So it basically depend where in

2848
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,320
your P&L the cost has been impacted.

2849
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,679
What would that threshold be in the P&L?

2850
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:49,520
Because if you have to go from

2851
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,800
marketplace model to an inventory model,

2852
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,159
you have to be a large brand. That's the

2853
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,760
notion that is out there in the market.

2854
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:58,159
But my question is how large do you have

2855
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,000
to be? No, I think actually that is not

2856
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:03,280
a case that you need to be a large brand

2857
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,199
for inventory. Uh

2858
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:10,000
some partners work on inventory model

2859
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:12,239
and even at a smaller stage they still

2860
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,760
onboard you on inventory. Your initial

2861
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:16,080
purchase orders can be for a lower

2862
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,639
value. With time that percentage will

2863
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:21,040
increase. Both the models will have its

2864
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,360
own and pros and con but that is how you

2865
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:24,960
just learn and grow with time right okay

2866
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:27,760
because the way I'm looking at it is

2867
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,599
that if Nika is opting for an inventory

2868
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,599
model with you they're taking a big risk

2869
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:34,239
by actually buying products upfront from

2870
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:37,360
you now to be able to do that they need

2871
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:40,880
to measure certain parameters to gauge

2872
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:43,440
if you are worthy of that or not

2873
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:46,400
in that you would have maybe repeat

2874
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:49,520
rates your margins and how many

2875
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:53,199
customers you So my question is

2876
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:56,320
what would be those qualifying factors

2877
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:59,760
that enabled you to be an inventory

2878
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:02,320
model partner for Nika? So uh again see

2879
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:04,880
Nika till the time we don't have a data

2880
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:07,119
and I'm just thinking how they would be

2881
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,639
planning their entire thing. uh in our

2882
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:10,000
case they would have started with what

2883
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:13,040
kind of searches we are getting on their

2884
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,480
platform right so say every day how many

2885
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,239
people are searching minimalist theorems

2886
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:18,239
and all basis that I can broadly

2887
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:19,679
estimate what kind of sale I can

2888
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:22,719
generate because these many search

2889
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:25,119
queries I have for your brand uh now

2890
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:26,800
I'll make maybe a first order on a very

2891
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:28,880
conservative side so if I know there are

2892
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:31,840
10,000 searches that happen in a month

2893
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,159
probably 3 4,000 will at least convert

2894
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,920
so even if I make an order of 3,000

2895
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:38,960
product see if I can assume in a month

2896
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:40,239
also I'll be able to sell right if no

2897
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,400
maybe in 2 month I'll be sell because

2898
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:45,040
the shelf life is 18 24 months so

2899
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:48,639
there's a still long period right now

2900
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:50,560
say in the first month you get a sale of

2901
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:52,320
maybe 3,000 sold in less than a month

2902
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,639
then second month maybe they will start

2903
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:57,599
with 5,000 unit 6,000 unit then they

2904
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:59,040
will eventually increase more to the

2905
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,960
point where they think that if they are

2906
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:04,159
comfortable holding 45 to 60 days of

2907
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:07,599
inventory what is that number is so that

2908
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:11,040
process can anywhere be between a month

2909
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:15,440
to 6 month. Beautiful. Let's come back

2910
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:18,400
to your unit economics. 200 rupees cogs,

2911
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,560
30 rupees packaging cost assuming 5% of

2912
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:23,360
600 rupees

2913
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,679
150 rupees assuming 25% is your

2914
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:28,159
distribution fees and then do you have

2915
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:30,000
any other cost attached? No. So then

2916
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:32,560
your third large part would be on your

2917
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,400
marketing cost which is performance,

2918
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,639
right? So whatever ads you're running on

2919
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,800
your own site or Amazon and all there's

2920
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,480
a cost attached to it. That is the third

2921
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:45,440
largest cost. In our case that has been

2922
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:47,920
closer to 25%. 25%. Yeah.

2923
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:50,800
After that you'll have your people cost

2924
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,560
in your own what was the people cost? Uh

2925
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:57,199
large part of the work was being managed

2926
01:54:52,560 --> 01:55:01,679
by me and Rahul the co-ounders. Then we

2927
01:54:57,199 --> 01:55:04,560
roped in lot of folks uh at a operations

2928
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,400
work. So we were largely involved into

2929
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,639
everything uh because again I said you

2930
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,639
know we were bootstabbed and we were not

2931
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,080
sure we can pay salaries or not. Uh so

2932
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:14,719
we never want to hire till the time we

2933
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:16,159
have we have confirmation or maybe

2934
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,880
confidence that you know I can at least

2935
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:20,320
pay for 2 years right. Uh few hiring

2936
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:22,960
that happened initially was largely into

2937
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:24,800
R&D only that okay whatever our own

2938
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:26,239
capital we have even if we hire someone

2939
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,679
we can pay them 2 year you know we can

2940
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:32,080
survive. So people cost would be

2941
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,760
four or 5%, because again uh as a

2942
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:35,520
founders we were not taking salaries.

2943
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,440
Got it. Did you have any other cost

2944
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:38,960
attached? Uh overheads would be

2945
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,520
negligible and then we were just left

2946
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:45,040
with I beta. So I think first year we

2947
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,040
were somewhere around 10 15%a. Can you

2948
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:49,440
tell me in terms of gross and net

2949
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,440
margins? So gross was 70% because 30%

2950
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:54,719
was cogs right. Okay. And you were left

2951
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:56,560
eventually with net of what? 25 26% is

2952
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:59,280
taxes because we never had you know

2953
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:01,520
interest or any other thing the plant

2954
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,960
was very small as said 30 35 like we

2955
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:06,880
invested the depreciation was also very

2956
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:10,960
limited so after ITA was largely taxes

2957
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:12,880
and the profit after tax got it

2958
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,880
understood so would you recommend this

2959
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,119
to be a standard playbook to enter

2960
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:20,560
skincare initially because you know when

2961
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:23,760
people look at a 70% cross they assume

2962
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:27,520
that it's a cakewalk

2963
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:31,360
but then 70% gross you're left with

2964
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:33,760
barely 10 to 12% net right and gross or

2965
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:36,000
net difference that's where everything

2966
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,679
gets misleading so my question is if

2967
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,400
someone were to launch a skincare brand

2968
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:43,840
today what should be a healthy margin

2969
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:45,520
that they should keep for gross so that

2970
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,400
they can consider it to be feasible to

2971
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,639
enter the market I think the biggest

2972
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:52,239
piece in this which is not controlling

2973
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,080
valuable by a lot of people is the

2974
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:58,159
marketing cost is the marketing cost.

2975
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:59,679
Okay. So you need to figure out again uh

2976
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:01,679
can you control the marketing spend

2977
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,080
because everything else is controllable

2978
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:06,560
it can be fixed uh even for a lot of

2979
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:08,639
large companies marketing cost even for

2980
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:11,119
public companies and all right uh it can

2981
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:13,920
be anywhere closer to 40%. and they have

2982
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,599
been in losses for a very long time. Uh

2983
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,560
even large scale D2C company will have

2984
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:22,320
any between 35 to 40% maybe more than

2985
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:24,400
that right. Uh so whatever growth margin

2986
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,520
you can shrink if you're unable to

2987
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:30,000
manage marketing that become a challenge

2988
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:33,760
and uh how you can then break marketing

2989
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,159
also. So there are two thing right the

2990
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:39,440
overall marketing spend and cost of new

2991
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:41,040
user acquisition right

2992
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:43,119
new user acquisition cost will continue

2993
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,800
to increase because platforms are

2994
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:48,000
becoming more competitive more and more

2995
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:51,040
brands are jumping into it so that very

2996
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,840
very hardly will ever go down. How the

2997
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:56,960
total cost can remains lower is because

2998
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:58,719
of your returning and referrals. So

2999
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,400
again, you know, if you're pouring more

3000
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,920
and more water into your bucket, but if

3001
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:03,920
the bucket is leaking, you'll continue

3002
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,080
to have to pour more. But if you're able

3003
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:08,639
to retain, if you think large number of

3004
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,400
customers are able to stay

3005
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:12,880
and they also bring lot of new

3006
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,800
customers, even at a higher marketing

3007
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:19,199
acquisition cost, you're able to control

3008
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:21,119
your overall uh marketing cost. So I

3009
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:23,280
guess that is the most important part

3010
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:25,840
where I would want people to focus on.

3011
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:27,199
other thing eventually you'll figure out

3012
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,560
which then brings us back to the first

3013
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:31,199
thing that we spoke about which is

3014
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,880
result result and differentiation yeah

3015
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:35,119
see uh you may not have buying power

3016
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,480
initially and you're paying a premium to

3017
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:37,760
a supplier for certain ingredient

3018
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,159
because someone else has more buying

3019
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,760
power

3020
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:44,960
because that cost is 30 even if you're

3021
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:47,360
paying say 5 6% or maybe 10% premium

3022
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:50,159
eventually that will be maybe 2% more

3023
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:51,840
right uh your team cost can be again

3024
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:55,280
manageable because you can do the heavy

3025
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:56,960
lifting um you know your distribution

3026
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,480
cost largely will remain same what is

3027
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:01,520
industry is Amazon will ask you the same

3028
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:03,840
pay versus someone else also uh if

3029
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:06,800
you're able to retain get more

3030
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,320
references because initially u you don't

3031
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,960
have a target that okay tomorrow I would

3032
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:12,800
want to do 5 cr of monthly revenue I

3033
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:16,159
mean start with what makes sense for you

3034
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:17,840
right put only that much capital and

3035
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:20,960
actually your marketing cost initiation

3036
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,880
is much lower uh it's never linear cost

3037
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:25,840
of adding a new customer with time only

3038
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,679
increases. So initially for us it was

3039
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,239
not even 25%. It was much lower than

3040
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:33,040
that. So

3041
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:34,639
other part of your acquisition which is

3042
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:36,800
retention and referral that should kick

3043
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:40,000
in. So just look at that very closely

3044
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:42,480
and that only give a sign of PMF.

3045
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,320
Uh lot of time what I've seen is people

3046
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:49,360
confuse initial sale with PMF. Yeah. See

3047
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:50,880
there's a thin line between sales and

3048
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:54,639
PMF.

3049
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:59,040
I create a product

3050
01:59:54,639 --> 02:00:01,280
there are so many type of customers

3051
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:03,920
something will appeal to someone right

3052
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:05,360
and by spending marketing amount I will

3053
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,760
be able to get some initial customers

3054
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:11,480
also that is how you make some initial

3055
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:11,480
sales right

3056
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:17,360
for a PMF uh you know it's always

3057
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:19,840
important to look at some qualitative

3058
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,440
parameters attached around it right and

3059
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,960
you how you can differentiate between

3060
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:26,480
those

3061
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,639
how excited I was with the launch. So

3062
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:30,560
see I try a lot of new products customer

3063
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:33,520
for example I see something I have

3064
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:36,400
purchased it uh and I'm not very excited

3065
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:39,679
about it will I come back again maybe

3066
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:42,239
the answer is no uh does it justify the

3067
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:44,000
PMF maybe no I got the first sale but I

3068
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:46,719
don't think it's a PMF but if you talk

3069
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,560
to the customer customer feel very happy

3070
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:49,760
that oh I was just waiting for it thanks

3071
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,119
so much for launching this product and

3072
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:53,920
all you can gauge some of the

3073
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:56,719
conversation right uh am I willing to

3074
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:59,360
refer to a friend of mine

3075
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:01,920
If the answer again is yes, uh you know

3076
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:04,239
again the the

3077
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,760
time for that must be much larger. Uh

3078
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:07,360
will I be coming back and buying more

3079
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,719
from you? And if I can some of those

3080
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:11,840
sign then again kind of shows

3081
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:13,440
stickiness. So I think these four or

3082
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:16,000
five thing initially can be hard to

3083
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:19,360
quantify but you can measure by having a

3084
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,920
lot of conversation. So one said you

3085
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,880
know how excited I am with the launch my

3086
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,719
likely to refer and likely to come back

3087
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,880
and these three number we used to

3088
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:30,320
measure very very closely. How did he

3089
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:33,360
measure this? Like see repeat is very

3090
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:36,800
easy. Repeat is very easy. Very easy. Uh

3091
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:39,119
referrals uh to some extent easy if

3092
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:41,040
you're able to give maybe a discount

3093
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:42,400
code or something. We never did that in

3094
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:44,400
our case because we felt that you know

3095
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,920
people don't like referring product

3096
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,440
because you're getting 100p off. It

3097
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,199
always feel there's a intent behind it.

3098
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:53,280
Right? Uh so how to do it? Uh you can

3099
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:55,679
always talk to some customer and then

3100
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:57,679
try to exool it. So today if I know I

3101
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:01,199
have 100 new customers and I'm talking

3102
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:04,880
to 20 out of that six are saying oh I

3103
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:06,880
came to this site because someone else

3104
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:08,560
referred you know maybe 30% are coming

3105
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,480
through referral so you'll have to just

3106
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,719
extrapolate just keep doing it very

3107
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:14,239
regularly initially and if you think

3108
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:17,679
that every time the number is very

3109
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:19,199
similar it's then just a a data which

3110
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:20,159
kind of makes sense and beyond a certain

3111
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,360
model you can actually give it to a

3112
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:22,960
product owner who can actually measure

3113
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:26,080
this for you professionally right yeah

3114
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:28,480
exactly I I I'm talking about year one

3115
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,320
that is a time founders do most of the

3116
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,440
work right like I mean for the first one

3117
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:33,360
month we were doing the entire customer

3118
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,880
service thing uh replying to email

3119
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,840
talking to customers replying everything

3120
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:40,239
right uh so I think those thing again

3121
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,239
some are quantitative some are you have

3122
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:43,360
to extrapolate by those conversation but

3123
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:44,719
there's a way you can figure out to

3124
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:48,000
measure for yourself yeah so it's

3125
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:50,159
excitement referrals and retention I

3126
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,960
would also put in result over here how

3127
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:55,440
many people got a result because that

3128
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:57,599
eventually will fuel referrals right

3129
02:02:55,440 --> 02:03:00,239
eventually result into retention. So

3130
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:04,800
excitement, referrals, retention and

3131
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:07,440
result. So yeah, you can say that uh see

3132
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,360
result if you know people may say hey I

3133
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:11,360
like the product. If they're not coming

3134
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:13,520
back uh you don't know how to measure

3135
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:16,320
that. Uh if they're coming back

3136
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:18,400
referring you can assume results are

3137
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:21,520
coming out of the product. Uh at times

3138
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:23,840
people are nicer. uh I will not say bad

3139
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,199
about a you know someone. So if a brand

3140
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,560
is calling me that hey you know you have

3141
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:28,560
been using a product if I know I don't

3142
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,400
like the product I will not be very

3143
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:34,560
critical about it I will say hey it's

3144
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:36,320
good right but if I do not purchase the

3145
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:40,000
product again once I'm consume the

3146
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:43,199
product the answer of that I should not

3147
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,360
judge it on its face value right uh so I

3148
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:47,920
think those parameter kind of quantify

3149
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,199
it so mo if you were to understand the

3150
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,239
difference between a rockstar and a

3151
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:54,000
non-rostar I'm assuming that when you

3152
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:55,760
built your organization ization you had

3153
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,400
several people whom you had to let go

3154
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,400
and eventually as a founder you have a

3155
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,599
certain acumen to be able to identify

3156
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:05,599
rockstars and a non- rockstar

3157
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:07,599
and I've realized that every founder has

3158
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:09,599
a different set of attributes that they

3159
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:11,520
check for my question is what are your

3160
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,440
attributes that will help you understand

3161
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:16,080
that this person is an A player and this

3162
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,480
person is a B player so I think as you

3163
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:20,400
mentioned you have to figure out what

3164
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:21,599
attributes are important for you because

3165
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,400
people with those attribute will

3166
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:27,040
flourish others might not find it you

3167
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,880
know great place to work in our case it

3168
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:31,040
was one culture because again you know

3169
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:32,960
we have been talking about values so

3170
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:35,920
someone who we know can align with our

3171
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,920
values is a very very important part uh

3172
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,520
even if a rockstar but does not align

3173
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,599
with the value we'll always have those

3174
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:43,840
conflicts culture as in what was taught

3175
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:47,040
to them at home yeah the culture of our

3176
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:48,639
brand which is say transparency honesty

3177
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:51,599
and all those thing right so you need to

3178
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:54,480
be culturally aligned with those even

3179
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:57,280
for our own team you know when you say

3180
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:59,360
hey people come first be more respectful

3181
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:01,599
uh those are very important thing for us

3182
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:04,159
you know I don't want a rockstar to be

3183
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:06,080
nasty with others irrespective what he

3184
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:07,840
or she may be doing it right so those

3185
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:10,000
things we know are very important right

3186
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:12,560
so that is the first parameter uh which

3187
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,320
we learn with time that you know finding

3188
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,800
people who align with some of those

3189
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:18,639
values which we find important in a

3190
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,199
rockstar

3191
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:24,400
second is then ownership

3192
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:26,960
u you We again felt that you know we are

3193
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:29,599
not the type of people who would want to

3194
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:31,440
in tell people that hey do these things

3195
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,719
at some point in time they need to take

3196
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:36,000
their ownership they need to take their

3197
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:38,320
own decision right uh it's very easy to

3198
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,679
put the problem in front of people and

3199
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:42,320
say hey these are the five problem let

3200
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:44,639
me know how this need to be solved uh or

3201
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:46,320
you can come that hey these are five

3202
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:48,400
problem for each of these these are the

3203
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,639
thing that I think we can do the

3204
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:52,480
approach is very different uh the one

3205
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:55,119
who can come with approach we you know

3206
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:57,760
eventually do well in our system right

3207
02:05:55,119 --> 02:06:00,159
uh the first may do better in some some

3208
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:04,000
other places but you have to figure out

3209
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:06,400
what works and then third is uh as I

3210
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:09,040
said overindexing on talent then

3211
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:13,280
experience because we always felt that

3212
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:14,960
you know they have less to unlearn and

3213
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,800
always think from first principle

3214
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:18,400
because they are outsiders just like us

3215
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,560
as in you would get somebody supremely

3216
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:22,159
talented with less experience rather

3217
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,760
than getting somebody with a very vast

3218
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:25,599
experience and supremely talented

3219
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,520
because from what you're saying I am

3220
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:29,679
able to make out that you see somebody

3221
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:31,920
with a lot of experience with a person

3222
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,920
who might also have a lot of baggage.

3223
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,400
Yeah. See uh moldability is very

3224
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,719
important part that you know I can I

3225
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:41,040
come and absorb in your system right

3226
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:43,440
work in your own ways. uh if you have

3227
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:46,800
seen too many thing in your past career

3228
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:49,199
and all you will feel this work and this

3229
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,560
does not and sometime people find it

3230
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:53,520
very challenging that you know my own

3231
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:55,760
norms if I say hey are wrong and we are

3232
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:57,360
creating a different way of working my

3233
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,880
playbook is very different we don't do

3234
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:02,960
these things uh getting that commitment

3235
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,320
uh become challenging and in a small

3236
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,159
team you need to have high level of

3237
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:08,880
commitment correct so it's learning plus

3238
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:10,400
unlearning if I were to put it that way

3239
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,239
unlearning first and and learning

3240
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,880
unlearning first and then learning.

3241
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:17,040
Okay. Do you have any other pointers?

3242
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,960
No, I think honestly these are certain

3243
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,639
thing that we follow. Got it. My next

3244
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,760
question to you is if I were to put you

3245
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:25,760
in a room with a bunch of candidates and

3246
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:29,679
you were to check for these three

3247
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:31,440
attributes culture, ownership and um

3248
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,119
unlearning.

3249
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,599
How do you gauge that with three

3250
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:38,159
questions? So one question actually not

3251
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:43,440
even three that I ask is what decision I

3252
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:47,119
have taken in past which I think uh were

3253
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:49,199
not right and bases my own experiences

3254
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:52,719
if I have to go back how will I change

3255
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:55,679
those decisions. Uh it help you test two

3256
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:57,199
three thing. One is my humility to

3257
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:59,520
accept that I have make made some

3258
02:07:57,199 --> 02:08:04,000
mistake and that is again very important

3259
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:07,360
in our office. uh second is

3260
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,719
whether I'm able to learn new thing

3261
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,639
depending on my own experience or I

3262
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,199
again follow

3263
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:14,960
what you know I've been doing it right

3264
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:16,320
uh sometime people have very theoryical

3265
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:18,079
answers to it yeah that's what I was

3266
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:22,320
about you know right I mean you can read

3267
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:24,239
a lot of those in uh basic

3268
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:26,639
articles and all you know how to manage

3269
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:29,280
but actually if you go a little deeper

3270
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,280
okay what was the challenge uh what why

3271
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:34,159
it happened what was the thesis behind

3272
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:37,360
it why you took this step. Ask five

3273
02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:38,800
numbers. If today you have to do it, why

3274
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:40,560
uh what do you think those numbers will

3275
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:43,440
change? You can see whether that is a

3276
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,880
theoretical artificial answer or that is

3277
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:47,119
like something which is very very deep

3278
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:49,920
and profound and from there you can

3279
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:53,360
judge whether I learned something or not

3280
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:56,800
or that is just a HR kind of a question.

3281
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:58,719
So it's one broad question which is if

3282
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:01,760
you were to go back in time and figure

3283
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:04,239
out one bad decision or one bad project

3284
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,560
that you executed

3285
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:08,000
why was it bad why was the decision

3286
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,199
wrong and if you were to go back and

3287
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,880
correct it what would you do and once

3288
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:15,360
you go deeper into this you'll be able

3289
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,520
to gauge ownership culture and the

3290
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:20,719
ability to learn correct I think the

3291
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:22,400
second again that I try is uh if you

3292
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,480
replace your manager today wherever

3293
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:26,159
you're working what three new things or

3294
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:28,320
three different thing that you'll do

3295
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:29,920
that also help you understand in the

3296
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:33,199
system how much I understand about that

3297
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:36,639
business and if I am put in a different

3298
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:39,199
role uh how I think about it given a

3299
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:42,639
choice between two people extremely

3300
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:44,560
creative but not disciplined

3301
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:48,079
not so creative but very disciplined

3302
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:50,639
whom would you pick disciplined why

3303
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:52,400
again I said you know certain attribute

3304
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:55,440
you have to see culturally what work for

3305
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:58,960
you. Uh and at times honestly these are

3306
02:09:55,440 --> 02:10:03,199
not either or. Uh if someone is very

3307
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:05,119
disciplined but very low in talent. Uh

3308
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:07,280
and I'm not willing to learn that again

3309
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:09,840
can be a challenge for the team. You

3310
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,440
know I'm hoping you mean few percentage

3311
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,520
here and there. Yeah. Assuming that they

3312
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:17,040
fit in all these qualities like culture,

3313
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:20,800
ownership and the discipline because can

3314
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:24,000
I bank on you or not? Right. um uh

3315
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:25,679
dependency dependency so see again we

3316
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,280
are very old school in terms of how we

3317
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:28,560
operate but that's not old school I

3318
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,760
would say that is timeless because

3319
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:32,239
everything that you've mentioned is not

3320
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:36,000
old school it's timeless I was coming on

3321
02:10:32,239 --> 02:10:38,639
say even uh like we operate from Jaipur

3322
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,119
which is not a very busy city so travel

3323
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:42,880
time from home to office is not a lot so

3324
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:44,639
we have

3325
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:46,320
everyday office where people come which

3326
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:47,920
is 5 days we don't have a lot of work

3327
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:50,560
from home because again you know we have

3328
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:52,880
seen at least in newer company you

3329
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,239
brainstorm and work on a lot of problems

3330
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:56,480
and as a team you come with some

3331
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:58,239
solutions right uh if I know I'm not

3332
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,920
part of those meeting I'm missing those

3333
02:10:58,239 --> 02:11:03,199
ones because I think I'm better than

3334
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:04,560
others as a team you can't operate uh

3335
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:05,760
which is why I said you know I would

3336
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,520
prefer to work with someone more

3337
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:10,719
disciplined which not just me the team

3338
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:13,040
can bank on do you believe great teams

3339
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:15,760
can be built out of work from home I

3340
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:20,079
think interpersonal connectivity being

3341
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:23,119
in the same environment help a thought

3342
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:24,960
uh you start to lose bit of a touch with

3343
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:28,400
people

3344
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:31,520
you know I think I have most of my

3345
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:35,040
friends from my office because you know

3346
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:36,639
you spend a lot of time you build a

3347
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:40,639
relationship

3348
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:42,320
uh your support for them both personal

3349
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:45,040
professional increases a lot because of

3350
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,320
those relationship uh sometime those

3351
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:49,199
relationship are very difficult to

3352
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:51,840
create virtually and then My intent for

3353
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:53,760
that not just for my team for a other

3354
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,159
team also because you know again teams

3355
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,239
collaborate work closely you have a lot

3356
02:11:56,159 --> 02:12:00,639
of empathy for others work also you even

3357
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:03,599
have a understanding of their work uh

3358
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:06,320
like I give you example say if I'm in

3359
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:09,520
the marketing team and I want my product

3360
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:11,760
to be delivered to a customer right u

3361
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:14,159
knowing how supply chain work knowing

3362
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,159
what kind of their challenges have right

3363
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:17,840
you'll always have those empathy and as

3364
02:12:16,159 --> 02:12:20,079
a team you can figure out a way in which

3365
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,599
can be win-win for both otherwise it

3366
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:23,440
become times a blame game that you know

3367
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,520
I wanted this but this team is not

3368
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:27,679
working or vice versa so it's empathy

3369
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:29,360
compassion and collaboration

3370
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:31,760
perfect that's very interesting thank

3371
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:33,599
you so much for spending such high

3372
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:37,199
quality time with me moit it was a

3373
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:38,719
pleasure to have you here and u I'm just

3374
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:40,400
taking back so many things I mean I say

3375
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:42,639
this to all the great people who have

3376
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:44,480
been into the podcast and I love this

3377
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,000
conversation especially because I

3378
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:50,400
resonate with so many things that you

3379
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:52,320
said um at such a level that you know if

3380
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:54,560
in fact the beautiful story is that both

3381
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,239
of us we started somewhere around 2020

3382
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:59,119
right we we actually started a business

3383
02:12:56,239 --> 02:13:01,199
in 2019 you guys started in 2020 and it

3384
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:03,119
is so

3385
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:05,119
it is so soothing to see such a

3386
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:08,239
wonderful growth story because sticking

3387
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:09,920
to ethics is one thing and making it big

3388
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:11,840
by sticking to ethics is another thing

3389
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:13,360
altogether and everything that you

02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:15,520

more popular and you're way more richer
