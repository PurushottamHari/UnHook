You sold 1,000 products in 3 days of your launch. Yeah, that is crazy. Those who don't know me, we are a skincare brand. They decided to start a company in the middle of co and decided to get into the beauty and personal care. 100 cr of revenue. We were doing some seven or eight cr a month. When did that hockey stick growth happen? Minimalist raised 110 crore rupees in series A funding round. Clinical as a word has been misused a lot. Right. uh and they have data like 80% success rate, 98% success rate. No research will say that serum will be a big industry in India. What are you saying? If you look at some of the most successful brands, I'll not name them but you will understand. Like you said, they're all based on marketing facade. 50 the thing that brands are promoting, there's hardly any data. What is the difference in behavior that you've seen between men and women when it comes to skincare? Someone were to launch a skincare brand today, what should be a healthy margin that they should keep for gross so that they can consider it to be feasible to enter the market. So I think the biggest piece in this which is not controllable by a lot of people. Now when you're going against funded competitors and they pour in that funding into spoiling your reputation, that's a disaster, right? protecting that is very important because consumerism key is there a real problem that you're solving.

People, this is a conversation that I had with Mohit Yadav who is the founder of minimalist. Now if you think about it, in the skincare category, there are multiple brands, but minimalist is by far the most successful brand in India. And skincare as a category has always been crowded before and after minimalist. But even then, Mohit ended up doing something so magical that he took minimalist from 0 to a 3,000 cr valuation in just about 5 years. And that says that minimalist as a business has something very very magical to teach all of us. So if you're somebody who's building in the skincare or beauty category, please watch this podcast very very carefully because it has been designed to act as a step-by-step guide to help you excel in these categories. And I just hope that this podcast helps you build a millionoll brand. Thank you so much for watching and now on to the episode. Mit, I am deeply interested to understand the story of minimalist for multiple reasons. A you started out of Jaipur. Most people would start out of Bangalore or Mumbai. Okay. B I read some stat which said and you can correct me if if this is wrong. You sold 1,000 products in 3 days of your launch. Yeah, that is crazy. And in fact I am educated about skinare because of my wife. Had she not been there face wash from there I've become an evolved species who now uses vitamin C vitamin E and so on and so forth. Now this is the case 2025. Today I see a lot of people around me who are educated about the skincare routine. They may choose to follow it, they may not choose to follow it. But then the education is there and the hardest thing to do in the market is education. It's not customer acquisition because if a customer is educated about it, you can acquire customers. But then going back to 2020 or 2019 when you started and that too from Jaipur, what exactly prompted you to get into skincare? Because back then when it comes to awareness it was significantly lesser right. So how did you decide to enter this market? So before minimalist we were actually running a different brand called free will. Okay. And there we were doing some personalized hair care product and honestly we started that completely from tech and product angle that you know we come from tech industry we know some bit of programming and coding and if we can create personalized solutions for individual we can do better in product. So, say brands are selling four different variants. If I have 400 or 4,000 which are uniquely tailored for a particular individual's need, then I'm hoping the product will do better. What did Free Will do? So, Free Will was doing personalized hair care. Can you explain this in depth? You know, depending on your hair type, your lifestyle and your goals. Okay. We will ask some 25 28 different questions and based on those parameters create a product from scratch and the entire formulation was written through a program. So my system will algorithm will say that okay which ingredient and what percentage should be added into the product bases the question that you filled and then we'll create every product from scratch ship to the customer. So it's like completely tailored made for you. So that was the idea. Uh so we rolled in some formulators from US and other places and India team was largely into programming and coding. So it was a tech company not a CPG, FMCG or or a beauty company right and we ran it for almost one and a half two year and in that period honestly we met lot of suppliers in India lot of folks even globally also and uh few thing you know as an outsider when you are introduced to the to the industry you kind of see all those you know good bad side of it right and uh we felt that you know most companies when you sit uh look from outside feels like you know bigger companies larger you know R&D teams and all bigger promises also but in honesty what actually goes into the product is driven largely by marketing and branding uh and a small team of 10 15 20 people can actually create a better product. Can you give me an example like don't take the name of brands but then give me an example of such kind of product. So okay uh say brightening as a category right there are some clinically proven solutions which work on brightening. Vitamin C says one such ingredient when used in a certain concentration it give desired outcome law as such does not require the minimum percentage of that product to be used for those claims. So say if I have.1% vitamin C I can still call it a brightening product and someone is giving 10 15% vitamin C also can still call it a brightening product right both are brightening uh you know regulators will ask that are for the claim what is the support you will say I'm using vitamin C they will not test the validity concentrations and all it's okay about it right and whenever some new thing come lot of time your basic product is same you just play with those minor concentrations which just revolve around the the brand or the claims you're taking right and we felt that is not how the product should be created second is how they are even market to people so again you know if I know I'm not using the right concentration claiming it to be a brightening product claiming it to be something else again we felt this is how it should not be right uh you know there are many product which are absolutely very different in terms of what they offer. So say it'll have fragrance of rose and sold as maybe rose extract or something sensorally you will feel oh I can sense it has the fragrance and all but it's just a fragrance there's no rose extract and all right so a lot of those thing uh were like an eye opener for us also and we felt that you know customers are not should not be treated like that but how did you discover this this is a very technical problem right so when you actually talk to a lot of suppliers and vendors uh We used to start visiting a lot of expose the constant question people used to ask what is your marketing story that you're looking at okay not your ingredients exactly right and I okay you know we are here to solve like that time we working on hair care that how to work on a say hair fall I don't have a story I don't even care whether this ingredient come from Brazilian rainforest come from African come from Korea how does it matter Does it work or does it not? Right? And if you say it work, do you have clinical data or study to prove? Trust me, 90% of those have no real data. And you can if you'll think now as a consumer, you know, every time you will see a different trend come, brand will say, "Oh, we found some revolutionary ingredient." It stays in market for 2 year and then it go away and something else again is in market. For example, if Amazon rainforest is something that's in everybody's mind, can you expect a big brand to say, "Oh, you know what? We have extracts and minerals taken from the Amazon rainforest." You can you can by putting trace amount of it, right? You don't have to put in the same concentration like you know I think for a while even for hair loss in India onion and onion rated B become a fat. Uh if you'll actually see a lot of data there's none. There are hardly any clinical studies or research done on that and after two year it becomes something else. Right? If something is actually revolutionary deliver what it promises there's no need for any brand to change those stories every two year. Correct. Right. Then it'll be a different story. Then it'll be different story and then the cycle continue to go on and on and on. Right. And also the celebrities will keep changing. Yeah. And if you'll see actually on the pharmaceutical those product some of those ingredient continue for a very long time. Like say if you go and talk to a dermat and say if you're dealing with acne uh two three solution doctor have been prescribing for a long time one is salicylic one is benzol peroxide I don't know how many decades these toilet have been sold how many clinical studies have been done on that they have results on certain concentration right so you'll find lot of that data if you create a product you know what outcome you'll get anything Other than that uh with 50 other things that brands are promoting there's hardly any data. So again you know we were outsiders we did not know how industry work and we felt that you know what can be our superpower. Uh my superpower is not creating a new trend. I don't think we can do that. uh our superpower is not a branding or brand story that you know hey I know I can say something which people would want and I can continue to sell through those stories. We felt we have been very functional throughout our life. Okay. And that maybe because of our upbringing, because of the city where we come from, maybe a lot of other factors, maybe just because we were outsiders also. And we felt there would be some customers like us who just wanted to buy a product because it's solved, right? So again like you know if I know I'm dealing with ene every day in the morning, my only concern is what should I apply just to solve this. I don't then care you know where this Indian is coming at. I don't dream next day oh what if I have a different ingredient which can solve this acne right I mean just sol it and move on. What if I have Brazilian extracts on my face? Exactly. I mean you feel that you know there are so many thing that goes in your life just solve this part so that I can do something else in my life. I mean I don't have like five hour every day to just think about it. And we felt that you know can we create a functional brand which work on clinical proven solutions and then which is transparent you give what it is uh it's just starting with the belief that there would be some people like us who would want their skin care to be like this so resultoriented products that's it correct and when I say resultoriented uh what we internally call it clinically proven because clinically proven will give result oriented. Funnily enough, clinically proven, clinical as a word has been misused a lot, right? Absolutely. But tell me something Mo, before we get into skincare, I'm just asking this out of curiosity because I've been seeing a lot of brands pop up lately which often claim to solve hair fall. Yeah. And they have data like 80% success rate, 98% success rate. Now, I just wanted to understand because we might have a founder over here who's claiming to solve hairful. But before that I just want to understand from you can you really solve hair fall and can you really solve a baldness? There are some solutions and depending on the complexity of the problem some of those solutions might work for you. So someone who is dealing with say a very normal hair fall the problem may have initiated you even find product which are OTC over the counter without prescription that you can buy and you can start your you know routine with that. Then on the level two there are some farmer product also where you have minoxidil minoxidil based product uh they also have lot of data around it. Uh then the third is if you have some deficiencies which then can be solved in a different manner. So depending again see uh no one solution can work for every individual and then depending on the type of problem you have uh you can start with something which is more milder which is like say over the counter and if it is not working the best is to consult a doctor figure out what exactly the changes you need to do and then look at the solutions. M can it be solved? The answer is yes. It may not be a hit and dry always. I mean it is a hit and dry always. Correct. It may not be. I mean if you go and talk to a dumbat or someone you can just skip the hit and try. So a lot of time I have seen people that you know I'll keep on trying multiple product and then you feel oh this is working this is not working and then at times you also at time you give up on it right that okay I've tried 50 solutions it's not working and sometime you know topical product can only do so much if you have certain other deficiencies you need to see it in a more holistic manner so again you know I never felt that skinincare will be skin care separate ely or wellness in a different category or say farmer in a different one end of the day it'll all converge in a particular manner and it should be a very holistic wellness this is how individual should look at it and then bases it how my solution should also come is hair fall dependent largely on genetics some part of it yes it can be those challenges also uh apart from that you know your exposure environment can also be a factor again I'm saying you know the severity It can be different. So you're saying that the problem is more complex than we think. Yeah. You can't have a one solution fits all. True. Okay. So if somebody is let's say encountering hair fall, what exactly should that person's approach be? Should it be to look for the best products in the market because then they'll have to go by marketing or are there certain products by default that people can use which will solve their problem or should they just go and consult somebody? I think first thing which is very easy now to be honest like educate yourself and even if you are not able to find right content there are dermat who don't sell product or do brand endorsement and again given internet you don't have to even follow some dermat which is on your own city you can even follow someone sitting in US UK some other places right who don't have any interest or any you know uh partnership chip uh from a particular brand right second is when you follow any GPT you can even check that okay which ingredient which basic thing right uh if a basic level of awareness or knowledge does not exist you will be taken for right by brands got it so you think that the first step should be to find the root cause of your problem it could be nutrition deficiency and then get educated with some ingredient also like you know uh if you would read about minoxid There's a lot of data on minoxidil uh which is a prescription based product. On non-minidal there are ingredient like you know redenzil, procapill and other those also if you're aware then the third step would be finding a product right and in those rather than going with the marketing claims and all just turn the label see whether it contain those ingredient and if it does in what concentration so like you know we're talking about vitamin C uh putting a.1% vitamin C won't solve your problem if you know what is the desired percentage page and then select certain product based this research you'll always find better outcome. Got it? So it's research reasons and then products. Yeah. Most people actually go the other way around. They first go to products then they see if they consist of the right ingredients and then they look for reasoning once the products don't give results and then eventually then they start doing research as to why aren't these products working out in the first place. See you're consuming something right? I mean u consumption does not happen only with something that you're eating. Even applying topically is also a way of consumption. Uh don't blindly follow anything and again I'll even say for our own brand you know question ask you know what it does what it contain get some education and then only trust brands. Got it. Beautiful. Now let's come back to skincare. As you mentioned there was a lot of facade that was going on in the market because of which you realize that most products that exist in the market are not functional products. They're just marketing gimmicks who just do not give out concrete results. Results might be visible here and there but that's quite perception based. But they don't give out tangible results. And that is when you realize that okay there is a gap in the market where if you can design a product that can give out results then regardless of how much marketing budget you have you'll be able to scale. Was that the thesis? Absolutely. Okay. Then during that time, give me an outlook of the skincare market of India back then on the basis of awareness and TAM or data in case if you have any and then we can get deeper into it. See, we never started with TAM for the category because say our first few product were face serums. Okay. And face serum was very new in India. Face serum. What is a face serum and how is it different from other products? So the form factor is different. So say a moisturizer is more of a imulsion or cream. A serum is uh in a lay manage if I have to explain uh more like a a liquid based product. Uh so the objective of that is to deliver the ingredient to you know the receptors and also let it work right. Uh so the format is different and that is how we started. If I go back and look at all the research of 2019, no research will say that serum will be a big industry in India, right? Because uh the challenge with most reports is they give you data of things which already happened or where they are today. Very few report can tell you where things will be. And at times you have to you know have a gut feel or a hunch or something that okay you know I think this will be big because again people are becoming more aware there's high level of understanding about these ingredients you can even see how things are you know shaping up globally and basis that do you think that will be relevant in India or not so that is how we also started so not with the time and all okay any observation that you particularly made which inspired you to get into skincare so The journey was actually pivot from free will. So you said I I told you right we were working on free will. We were doing hair care and around that time we were thinking of creating a personalized range of skincare also. Uh challenge with personalization is distribution because I'm creating every product from scratch. I am not able to leverage retail. I'm also not able to leverage the marketplaces and other channel because in those cases unity they have a product which is already in their warehouses and around that time of course we all were impacted by co so we had some 3 4 month in which we took a step back it gave us some time to think how we should launch this category and one idea that we had is why can't we create problem specific product let people buy more and want to create their own personalization that also solve our distribution issue which we had with personalization. Oh, that's beautiful bro. Problem specific product. Can you give me an example? Yeah. So, uh say what you're doing in personalization is uh and specifically to say skincare. Say you have two requirement that I have some pigmentation mark and then maybe I'm 30 plus I also need some solution for aging right I can then create a product which contain both the solutions in a bottle. Second could be I have two product now. One is very specific to pigmentation, one is very specific for aging. You can buy both the product you can use as a layering or maybe one in the morning, one at night and through that you can create your own personalized routine. And if we are able to identify say 10 15 unique problems, it can be different combinations can work for different people and that is how they can create their own you know uh routine or programs. Got it. But with that we are able to use every marketplace and all the offline channels also for distribution. So that was the thesis behind launching minimalist. Now if I have to go back and encounter a challenge I'm imagining that you're calling a product a face serum, right? Or were you calling it something else? Face serum. So minimalist face serum. Okay. Now as a customer if I were to go back to 2019 2019, right? If I if I have to go back to 2019 and then I encounter a face serum, I don't know what to do with it. I don't what kind of problem is it going to solve for me? And you did not have a big fat marketing budget either. So how did you convince the customer that this is phase zero and it can be used for a BC problems? See I think at a very early stage and again this is my personal belief right uh you need those 5 10,000 people who can make sense of it right you should be everything for someone and something for everyone so creating a product which is like you know a small set of people are really looking forward in the market to have so for those small set of customers minimalist probably was everything Okay. Right. That you know I'm looking for solution which are clinically proven. I'm looking for these serums. I was looking for say salis with 2%. Because I'm like very evolved in skinare and I'm very knowledgeable consumer right and this exactly fit into the kind of product I was looking at. Hm which was face serum which was face serum versus trying to look at a much larger time where different segment of customers just feel oh there's one more brand I don't feel very excited about it which is like okay you know it's okay that you know the hundreds and one brand or whatever it is right so that was our thought that if we look at customer in different parame uh the early movers Those who know about the segment, those who know those concentrations pretty well because even in serum the first four or five were actually sold with the ingredient name. So the product were 2% salicylic acid or say 10 10% nioinamide. So that is how we were selling it. Not by acne serum or a whitening serum or something else. These were sold on ingredient specifically like retinol 0.3%. Right? And we knew these people will know about it. Who who are these people? So if I were to understand the spectrum of early mos, if you go from early moss to late majority in the tech domain, you know who are the early movers, right? And if I were to map them out amongst a population of 1.4 billion, I would usually categorize them as teenagers who are really excited to try gadgets. Then I would look at all the tech geeks who go to these tech conferences where they are by default early moers because of their profession and then I can go and sell a software product to them or maybe I can go and sell a gadget to a kid. It's very easy to identify the early moss for tech. Similarly when it comes to protein a person going to the gym is aware about whey protein he's aware about casein. So I can find my subset of customers over there at the gym. Mhm. Now what I'm not able to wrap my head around is how on earth did you find the early mos skincare? How would you go and find that subset? Would it be with the dermats or would it be a specific place that you go to or was that you know through performance if you can find that particular niche who are extremely aware? How did you go about it? See first few months was not driven by performance because again as you rightly mentioned it is very very difficult to find those customers right because there's no one particular group uh and even if you work with datmat and then the dermat will maybe inform three or four of his patient and the cycle will just continue to go on for a very long time right uh you need to Find one people who are dealing with some problems, right? And that can happen through searches, right? Uh second is from that segment there would be some who would be consuming content and are aware about some of these solutions. For example, look uh if I don't have a skin concern, my probability of that time, I'm saying 2019, uh knowing what salisake or retinel is is very low because I'm not very invested into it. Uh so usually the one who is dealing with those challenges would be doing some research. Correct. Uh so that is how basically the initial journey started. So surge for us become important part and the first few were also the product that we launched were also very problem specific. Uh so again you know your painkillers versus vitamin right. Uh now we have a lot of product which are maintenance good to have and all initial some were bases three or four problem which we felt are very prominent in India. Okay like so acne is one so if you're a teenager large percentage customers do go through it those challenges. Second is again pigmentation. Uh which again is a a big problem in India. Uh aging I will not call a problem but you know beyond it's a perceived problem. Uh and then your skin type. So you know you may have either very d oily skin. So that is how the first four or five product were designed. Perfect. So let's say you understood that the largest tab let's say exists for acne because it's very commonly visible and you can actually understand the customer better. And then you've got your products like retinol and salicylic acid. Now how did you find those customers and how did you sell it to them? Yeah. So we started our journey through our own social media page and we feel that you know we can create lot of educational content and through which we can of course create awareness eventually 100 customers will come if they're happy they will tell maybe 200 more and then the cycle will continue to go on. Right? Uh so you know one content creator just found the brand. She did a story or some post in her community section on YouTube uh that hey you know I came across this brand. The product looked promising and I'll just give it a try. That's it. Okay. She had a very engaged community. So those 100 to 200 people came from her page. Oh wow. Some of them become our customers. Right. Then UGC started to kick in uh because yeah so they were early movers so they started posting on their own page that you know oh I am trying this product maybe after a week or two week once I use the product I'll let you know right uh but those in their own group some of them again were the early movers early adopters because you know if you're able to reach out to them then it's a it become the battle right uh then the next set of 200 people would have came from their post or their stories without even trying the product now because all this happened in a period of what 2 to 3 days. Okay. Yeah. So first 500 or maybe thousand people just came from this particular uh virality. One person found out 100 tried and then they posted as a story that I'm trying and another 4 500 tried from there and they started following our page and all and that is how our journey started. Got it. So we were probably lucky that people found us uh very easily without spending a lot of money in marketing. Uh but the second set of growth actually came from these people. So after 15 days, after 21 days once they tagged the product and they felt that this is legit, this is working that build a lot of confidence in the second set of customers. So you essentially got hold of two campaigns for free. One is I'm trying this product and the other is I've seen results. Is that correct? Yeah. Wow, that's beautiful. By the way, guys, uh UGC is user generated content. What this means is that this content doesn't have to come from a creator or a celebrity. It can just be produced by ordinary people. But then the word of mouth spreads and then other people begin to create similar content which eventually becomes your user generated content. Okay, not from a celebrity, not from a creator, just an ordinary user. Okay. So once this happened then you got an massive influx. Is it correct? Yeah. Beautiful. Actually uh UGC is something that you use till today. M so initially for the 3 month you know we had a plan that we will only work with community because we want to show real results and real outcome and uh we don't want anyone endorsing the product without trying it. Uh look there are a lot of good content creators but large majority follow a script and they will endorse anything that the brand will ask them to do it without even using the product right and we feel that will not be right for a brand uh and when we started again you know while clinical proven solution one part of it second was again when we spoke about the transparency and honesty with whom we need to work with customer and we thought that we'll not do it uh let us also to see whether the product working or not. So first three or four month that was the plan and you know we started getting a lot of email DMs from a customer that hey you know one thing that I like love about the brand is your honesty on the content part that you don't give lot of PR packages you don't give endorsement you don't work with content creators on paid partnerships please don't change it okay and we felt that this means so much for people this is exactly what we should do so Even till now, our paid partnership would have been like four or five in the entire 5 year period. But bro, what I think is I actually disagree with that because if you're a great product, you should market the hell out of your products. Why? Because if you don't do that, we will see other brands who are not authentic, who do not produce results, then engage in this marketing facade because of which they'll end up capturing your market share and you will be doing a disservice to your potential customers by not marketing your products. I may be a little old school in this. So see what I believe is one see given now uh everyone is on social media. So everyone is a content creator. Um if today we say ship some 20 30,000 product a day or maybe more than that large part of that are on social media already. They may have lesser number of followers but their opinion is highly regarded in that group. Okay. Right. Versus say a content creator with maybe a million followers or so. M if we can tap in large number of those customers who actually become our evangelist the cumulative effect of that would be lot more as a impact than a paid endorsement. Okay. But the cumulative impact of that plus paid endorsement will snowball it right. It will uh we again I said you know we were never as such against paid partnership. Uh like we did some and in those cases mandate was very clear that you know use the product and be authentic about it share what you like and also share what you don't like about it. uh not many follow this mandate right I mean and you can clearly see that it's very sugarcoated oh I love this product this changed my life and all those things and we felt that you know we are not we're doing disservice to a customer because you know they are relying on a particular opinion while in marketing sense uh it work if I think primarily from consumer side it is actually not right and you know all the things that are telling you that why we started thinking the brands are not you know honest with the customers and all following the same thing will not make us any different than the other with whom we felt you know uh were not and second is again you know if you look at finite versus infinite mindset u we don't have to win skincare as a category like a 3 month you know there's a good saying that you know you earn trust just in drop and leave it in bucket or whatever. Right? So you know it take lot of time to build trust. True. And one wrong thing and your entire reputation is like gone. Whatever effort that you put in two to three year uh every time say a story is on a social media which is even legit people will take it with a pinch of salt that is it true or not. Yeah. uh we don't have that challenge today because they never did it and with time if a product deliver the result see people are vocal uh at least in architecture we have seen that so if the snowball is there if there's a large number of returning customers eventually you'll grow and I think we are a good example of of you know those practices so you know if you stay true to the values if you actually give some value to a customer and people are really nice to give it back multiffold. Yeah, that's actually very interesting. In fact, bro, the reason why I asked you this question is because India has a very socialistic mindset saying, "Oh, please don't do paid marketing." There is a very big problem that we have with paid marketing. Essentially, people have a problem with false marketing, not paid marketing. But because all false marketing is paid marketing, they put it under the same bucket. It's hard to differentiate. Yeah, it's hard to differentiate because I was having this conversation with Nikl and uh you know Zeroded often says that we don't spend on marketing. I said you're doing a bad job by not spending a lot on marketing because if you look at Zeroda they do things that are so counterintuitive. In fact, Zerodha loses money in some cases by introducing new features. For example, they've got a feature called the nudge. So if there's a stock split, people tend to go people tend to go and buy that stock because they think ar 1,200 rupees stock I'm getting it at 300 rupees. But the moment you make that transaction, you are into a soup. Zeroda will make money because Zeroda makes money per transaction, right? But eventually the investor loses money. So they've got a feature called nudge. Every time something like a stock split happens and investors go and investors try and buy that particular stock there's a nudge which comes up and says you know this company has recently gone through a stock split so you should educate yourself before buying the stock and in most cases after reading that people don't buy the stock similarly if there is a lot of telegram flooding that is happening for a particular stock zeroda has an intelligence team they don't make money out of it they have an intelligence team they tell their investors that this stock is being heavily marketed on telegram groups so you should reconsider buying the stock and here's some information to educate yourself after that you may choose to or not choose to buy that stock now these are features back in the day when Zeroda introduced these features other companies did not take this approach why because they would lose money because every user is going to give you some money that's obviously very less but then once that compounds to a million users That's a lot of money and considering the fact that they are competitors by investing heavily into IPL ads and several other things. I said that you are doing a disservice to your potential customers by not marketing these products because if you market these products people will come to Zeroda. Once they come to Zeroda they can actually save some money. So Nikil said yeah that's actually a good thing. It's just that no marketing has been stuck with us. So now we have this reluctance to market our products and the problem that I had with that socialist comment saying that oh please don't engage in paid marketing bro the same thing happened with us as well. Um we were just about to do a sponsored deal. We have a very strict due diligence procedure. Back then it was not that strict but we still did as much as we can but now our due diligence process is very strict. We think a 100 times before endorsing any product. In fact, even before we call any guest, we do a lot of due diligence before we call any guest. In fact, we say no to 1 cr worth of deals per month, by the way. So when we do that, what we've understood is that in spite of doing all of this, when you endorse a particular brand that one random subscriber doesn't agree with or that one random subscriber has had a bad experience with, they would just put out a lot of hate, which then creates a ripple effect. So I always wanted to tell subscribers that A just because we're endorsing a product doesn't mean 100% of the subscribers will have a great experience. B endorsement is not a bad thing. False endorsement is a bad thing. So understand the lines properly because in India like I said socialistic approach anything that has been done to make money is a bad thing. That's not how it works. There is capitalism, there is crony capitalism and there is conscious capitalism. In fact, if you do the right thing and then you make money, that person should be making the maximum amount of money because that way the world will be a better place. Like Zeroda today makes about what 2,000 odd crores in profits. The world is a better place because of them. Because if you look at any great company in the D2C category starting from whole truth to all of the brands, Zeroda has an investment and they all have this license to do the right thing even if it means slowing down of revenue because Zeroda calls itself. I mean, rain matter calls itself a perennial investor. We'll stick with you forever even if it means defying the odds of investment which is where you know my counterargument came in that if you're so good you should market the hell out of your products. Yeah. So you know as you said at times it's tricky because you know you stuck in your own thoughts that I was not doing this so generally I should not. Uh second is in your own example when you said you know one customer or subscriber felt offended and all but majority still agrees with you and they can see the honest in you right which is more important uh you cannot be loved by 100% people there would be some exceptions and all and see the third part is uh while you would want to do the right marketing you also need to figure out people who are aligned with your values and thing. So say there's a content creator and the person do 10 endorsement. Out of those 10, eight are false endorsements. While you are right and you are saying all the good or bad about it, the minute this person doing start do the doing the endorsement, right? People will also put you in the same bucket in which the other eight are. And for them it is very difficult to understand that this out of those 10 is legit, eight other are not. Uh so associating yourself with particular segment you always feel it can be challenging. Uh and if you're doing say content partnership you have to do it in hundreds and thousands. M we still do some as I said. So we work with some dermats and we do a lot of education content. We also work with our PR firm and they curatively shortlist some journalist who get our product without a mandate to write anything about us. If they lie, they'll write about it. If they don't, they will they'll mention that I don't like anything about it. Right? So, we do it in bits and pieces. But then you have to work a lot in terms of having the voice uh and how closely we can work with the customers that you know can I create lot of UGC so that whatever noise someone is creating by doing a lot of paid conversation or paid content can I have the same through customers and that only happen if you're able to give lot to them. So we always stick in creating a lot of educational part. Uh we even repost some of the success stories that people share with us by even tagging them very selectively. Uh all the faces that you see on our site on our page are real customers. They are not models, right? And we even give credit that hey this is a person. So you can go in and see this person will have 200 followers. It's not a content creator or a celebrity. So if you continue to do the right thing see eventually people figure out and that trust is very difficult to buy overnight and you know again the compounding of that in 5 7 10 years is massive. Yeah. You know every time somebody in fact we often keep having this debate over here about ethics and you know marketing ethics because you're being ethical but you need to tell people today that oh you know what guys we're ethical so you know please consider us to be a little different than the other people that you are comparing us with. So when it comes to people eventually figuring out the problem that I often have and the question that I often ask myself is what if that eventually is 50 years because if you look at some of the most successful brands I'll not name them but you will understand like you said they're all based on marketing facade like some of the soft drinking brands that we have in the market today are based on marketing facade and they've been marketed as the source of several superstars energy. Yeah, you know what I'm saying, right? I know. Mo, the one thing that I want to touch upon and then we'll move on to skincare and we'll go deeper into it is about influencers. There's a D2C wave that's going on and even large companies have started to use creators and influencers to promote their product. Now, as a brand, I want to understand how do you think and to a large extent you've already told me that if you find an influencer to be authentic, you would engage with them. But my question is, how do you gauge authenticity? Because if a creator has about 500 posts, you can't have an idea about all the brands that they're endorsing. You can't have an idea about the reasoning behind their endorsement. Sometimes it might be authentic, but you might just disagree with them. So, it's quite subjective, right? So, when you give a brief to your team about choosing creators, what exactly are the attributes that you ask them to look for? And B, how do they execute it? So you can't look at all 500 but you can very easily look at last five or 10 and that will give you a good flavor about areas they are talking about and does that align with your brand idea philosophy or not right and for every campaign also you need to have a very clear guideline or a mandate or something that you want to achieve. uh do you need a product endorsement or do you need someone to create education content basis that customers can make informed decision. See as a brand we always overindex on education and if I know the person has depth on a particular subject and they can create some content which can be relevant for people because you know the way maybe we are creating content is not easy for everyone to understand and adding your personal flavors and own examples can make it easier for users. Right? So that is how we always looked at it. But it can vary depending on one your brand goal and also your overall brand personality. Got it. So let's talk about minimalist. Let's talk about one of your early brand goals. Your early brand goals would be education. So I'm assuming you would stick with dermats and not fashion creators. Correct. You would get Dermats to use scientific persuasion to talk about your product. Yeah. whether that's good or bad, both of them put together and then you'll put that message out. But now let's say you want to put out a mass outburst and that's where you'll have to use fashion creators. How do you gauge a fashion creator's authenticity? See uh if you think your first part is done where awareness is there in people and now you just need endorsement or certain content which is large number people are able to consume a very simpler word right u and again I said see if you're able to see last few post if you think in those cases you know any endorsement the person has done still has some honesty to it and you can gauge honesty basis you know I'm sharing good or bad both about it right and I have a opinion and not every other pose that I do is just a paid partnership so some of those smaller thing you can see and again uh I will not say those are must have uh it need to align with your own personal views also it need to align with your own brand views also so organic versus inorganic content less paid marketing and more organic content so if you see 10 posts If two are paid posts and eight are organic that's a green flag for you. Correct. See as a brand actually we don't do paid partnership even now. So even now we only do UGC. Uh even though we know we can spend budget but we don't do it. Uh some stories that we started doing now because again how can we uh reach out to larger users. You said we do testimonials. So we actually invite customers to our studio, ask them to share their honest journey with the brand, how they discovered, which product they're using, you know, any learnings that others can use and post those on our YouTube and then promote those. So there are ways in which you can figure out what works for you and what is right for you. U we have always been on organic not on inorganic but someone looking at inorganic I think these are certain traits that you can follow. So Mohit in 2020 2020 was a strange year because it was one of the gold rush years of the Indian startup ecosystem where every Tom Dick and Harry was getting millions of dollars in funding. But the problem with authenticity is that it cannot be solved with funding and you cannot gain success because of funding by sticking to authenticity. Authenticity by nature is slow. It will result into compounding but then it takes time but during that time since you are not the only skincare brand in the market. How did you manage to stay authentic and what are the challenges that you faced? Because if I were to be your competitor and I know that Mohit is not going to engage with fashion creators I will go out there in the market even though you have a better product than mine. I would go out there and put my message out there and become a better known product. And as we all know the brutal truth of the startup ecosystem is that best products don't win in the market. The best known products win in the market. Did you face this challenge? And if yes, how did you encounter it? See uh I think one we I said we started with the category which was very differentiated. So all the large companies are focusing on certain trends uh which were say either natural and all those stories we stick to the ingredient we stick to a format which was serum which was not very crowded right so that at least two good six seven months give us some space to breathe uh competition catch up when they know there's a success story till and no one even care what this brand is right and when they know their success stories by them then you have a 6 month head start uh and you have a community which know your brand so I think the first big aspect whenever someone is starting up you know start in a segment which is less crowded blue ocean yeah and start with a again a differentiation which is not like hey I'm 10% better I always say internally we need to be like 10 times better If you cannot stand out in both that you know my outcome is significantly better than the other solutions that you have in the market and then I'm starting in certain category which are not very crowded people care they listen they notice and that basically can give you the initial push that you need which money cannot buy so in short you're saying results speak that's it yeah so results will come uh but again I said you know results for us was in a category which was lesser crowded So it was not very competitive. So while larger brands were fighting in certain spaces, we were in a very opposite space. So everyone was saying that hey you know I'll go with natural and we were saying oh I have chemicals, I have acids. Uh people saying my product contain you know sensorial part good fragrances and all those thing. We said all our product without fragrance right. Uh you have beautiful packaging and we have like boring plain black and white. uh that people never knew can be a playbook to create a good brand or big brand. So it was a very unique playbook that we followed. No one else was doing anything in that by the time people felt oh this can be very interesting this is becoming big and this can be a good trend. Uh we had 6 month some startup after that started following up but even large companies can't create anything in 6 month. we will need maybe an year or two year 2 years later if you're not able to pull it off then something is wrong with your execution uh so I think initial decision that we took help us a lot did you go to South Korea to do your market research we did and what did you find out we did that very late okay so yeah I was in Korea just last year yeah yeah see again when I said the initial thesis was always about following some indid and practices which are wellknown and clinically proven. Oh, so you don't have to go to South Korea to understand. I don't have to create a trend. I said that today say snail m something is popular but we always see that okay is there enough data for it and if the okay what is the end goal of rating a product and that is how what we work right so if I have to work on say aging what are the most potent solution for aging today then the answer would be say retinol and now molecules like retinol uh if so do I have to solve aging or do I have to give say a snail mucin? If your choices are very clear that which brand you are creating, I think the answer also become very clear. H very interesting. In fact, two stories that I actually remember are uh you know be under the hood until the giants discover that there is an opportunity. The founder of VBA sauce, he built a 1,000 cr company, bro. And he was like I just hope nobody figures this out. And then Forbes came and did a story on him and everybody figured out that there is a huge market opportunity which is uh quite interesting. In fact tell me something today if an entrepreneur wants to get into skincare which expo in South Korea should entrepreneurs visit to understand what's going to happen in the skincare industry in India 5 years down the line. See there are two expos uh and these expos happen in different part of the world. One is incosmetic. Second is cosmoproof. So this is a one where lot of suppliers will come with new molecules discoveries in certain ingredient. So this is mostly for your procurement supplier labs and all. Cosmoprof is a event where you'll have your ODMs and these partner. What do you mean by ODM? So there are two type of companies right? one who create their own product and they have their own manufacturing uh like how we work. So we have our own labs, we have our our R&D. So we look at these you know solutions, we buy ingredient, we create our own product. Uh then on other side there are third party manufacturers and they do a lot of research. They have their in-house team and they also do a lot of end to-end manufacturing and all which is white labeling. which is white labeling and you will find a lot of these people also in event like Cosmograph right so both are relevant uh one is largely on the scientific part of it ingredient molecules and all I think we visit those events more often because that align with our overall product philosophy and how we create product second is these cosmopro kind of event where you have OBMs ODMs and all And there actually you can see certain trends. U so if there are 100 people and you can see that three or four solutions everyone is selling you can you can clearly see that oh this probably will become popular right you can just get some vibes of it. Uh and some of those initial hints can be important for you to understand will that trend be relevant in India or not. Uh but if you just marry that with some data and see uh whether those ingredient and over oral formulation make sense or not uh it can be important rather than plainly buying a marketing story. You have to apply some of your own work on that. Did you outsource your manufacturing or did you do it in house? We do it in house. But why not outsource manufacturing? Because if you can have R&D in-house then you have control over the formulation and if you outsource manufacturing you don't have the headache of high capex and maintenance and in India setting up a manufacturing plant is a big headache. So why not take the convenient route of keeping R&D in-house and keep manufacturing outsourced. There are two challenges. uh one see just like any startup when we also started we never had the volumes with us that I can go to a big manufacturer and can get my product you know I need say thousand bottles 5,000 bottles and all uh bigger companies won't work for us and whosoever will work probably their infrastructure will not be as good as what I require so quality to great uh you know uh manner will be questionable Second, if you become bigger and later you want to outsource your manufacturing, uh you are sharing the entire foundation with a third party and you know what exactly I would want in my product. So you're not able to protect your IP. Can't you have like a legal clause that can protect you from that? There's ways in which you can manage that part and it's very easy, right? So we always feel that you know if we are investing so much into R&D and creating our own IP, we would want to protect that. Got it. But tell me something. You mentioned that all the ingredients are pretty basic. You can use Google search to find them out and now you're telling me that the formulation is very very important. So is it a secret or is it general knowledge? So the general knowledge is the ingredient and the percentage and we won't disclose that very transparently. So I I'll give you example of say vitamin C, right? Now there are multiple forms of vitamin C also from you know ethilelescorbic to other variants and you need to see in terms of purity of that and stability of that and then again the R&D will come into play. So even if you're disclosing it that which form of vitamin C I'm using next is where you are sourcing. So there are multiple vendors in bases their material they are different specifications also like you know uh we publicly disclose I can share like we buy nasamide from a company Netherlands it's called lonza right and in nasamide you have impurities which create irritation we tested a lot of suppliers from other countries also their impurity content was slightly higher this company has the lowest impurity content while their RM is four times expensive but we are okay with it because of this particular part. So then finding the right supply is also very important. The last part of it say I'm creating this nas with 10% concentration right uh end of the day the objective is not to give nas in 10% objective is to ensure it actually deliver the result that you would want it to right the kind of solvents you're using so that it penetrate in your skin and work on the receptor that is very important part so that 90% people don't know right so say if I mix nasin and water apply on my skin it'll just stay on top of my skin. It won't do what it is supposed to do. M it will not seep in your sink. Correct. Okay. So, which solvent I'm using? How I am mixing the product? Uh we even quote an ISM with certain solvent to ensure better bioavailability. So, sometime these word become our marketing work that hey we have bioavailable product and all but the science behind that is slightly more deeper. Then which secondary technology we are using along with it. What kind of clinical studies we have done with it. So honestly for even one particular serum where we know the form factor we have created 20 30 different product whenever we launch a new one it still take anywhere between 12 to 24 month and protecting that is very important because that is anyways the only edge you have with someone else. Got it. So in the skincare domain the moat is IP. In our case we always wanted that to be a moat. uh see there can be still some companies who can start with marketing first approach and their mode can be better marketing you need to figure out which game you would want to play which you think you can win so sustainable mode you're saying is IP I always feel it's IP got it mo what exactly is the difference in behavior that you've seen between men and women with skincare because I'll tell you what my limited data says I don't want to put in a lot of efforts into skincare. I'll just get the first lotion that I get now whether that's Dove or Cetaphil or if it's white, if it's smooth, that's enough for me. I will apply. If it's fragrant, it's even better for me. In fact, recently I was told that it's actually a bad thing. I still don't know why, but that's the maximum I knew about skincare until very recently. So, I would just take the first thing that I get, apply, and leave. But if you look at my wife, she will first start with face wash. Then she will apply vitamin C. Then she will apply moisturizer. Then she will apply sunscreen. And then she will start applying a concealer. And then it ends with uh fixer. Then it ends with a fixer. And then there is also a reverse routine that I discovered that if you have to now wash your face, you can't just wash your face apparently. You have to then use a makeup remover tissue paper. But apparently that is dangerous because it consists of certain ingredients. I'm sure even she doesn't know about it. But she's told that it is dangerous. And uh there's a makeup remover that comes in and you're supposed to apply that and then you know you can get rid of all the bad ingredients from your skin. And then a few days ago when I was at my friend's place, Apura's place, she told me that there is a method called double cleansing. So two questions. Where does it end? Where does it end? consumerism key. Is there a real problem that you're solving? Yeah. My answer to this would be don't fix what is not broken. So if you don't have any skin concerns and challenges, why you need to reinvent what is working for you? Even if those two step which is say cleansing and a moisturizer that's okay. uh just that someone is following five step you don't have to mindlessly follow those five step so I think one people need to mindful what is right for them and if someone is following five 7 10 step there's no need for that right and I think the last step which I think is very important is sunscreen so what do you call prevention is better than cure so if you're able to prevent lot of solutions you don't need at later stages right I think these two I'll say are important anything in between that you apply which is any serum or any the product do only if you think your skin need that solution right so so say so if you don't have concerns of pigmentation and all you don't need to follow a lot of pigmentation product if you don't think you know you have uh dark spots and all sometime you know following vitamin C for brightening and all if that is not a desired goal that you have there's no need for it right keep it simple uh if If you are new just start with maybe beyond these two product is said you know cleansing and moisturizer maybe sunscreen just start with maybe adding one product at a time again uh we see a lot of customers who sometime come and say that hey I would want to buy five product and all this is not a sprint that tomorrow I'll apply all the product my problems will go away uh it's more of a marathon it's more of a discipline right just start adding one product see what it does uh if after that you feel there's a need for one more mindful fully add one more speaking of results and discipline I've seen that the patience level in men is very less when it comes to results with skincare whereas with women it's infinite I mean half of the women don't even have the problems that they're trying to solve for and that's the case with several other things one of them being skincare where they would just keep on following the skincare routine until in fact forever but when it comes to men if we see a 3% difference on our face by applying three different products. After a certain point, we would give up because we are not great observers of change on our face. Women are very sharp observers of what's happening to their face. We are not very sharp observers. At the same time, we don't have the patience to follow that routine and then expect something to happen and then see that happen and then decide on okay, are we going to keep using these products or are we supposed to add one more or subtract one more? So first of all, let's talk about the composition of your customers. How many of them are what percentage of your customers are men and what percentage of your customers are women? So before that one, see, I know we are coming at so I'll not generalize. M uh are they 100% generalized so you will find both the kind of you know uh behaviors in both genders will you find them in equal proportions again we have not quantified that so I can't answer whether that is like 50/50 in both or certain percentage in both uh but you'll still find again you know so given uh you have asked this question so I don't want to start with generalizing for everything else I'll give you data guys. But for this, it's just my bias. So, same same with me also. Yeah. Uh in terms of our customer uh split, 70% would be women, 30% now for us is also men. Uh because as a brand, we always stay gender neutral which actually what skincare is. uh so I think all those skincare claim that you see for men for women and all those thing again are just marketing stories and all uh it doesn't work very differently our needs are different so the skin type and properties in men are slightly different than women so we have a slightly thicker skin compared to women so you know our hydration level our aging and all are slightly different uh but say if someone is looking for a solution for aging like say retinol retinol are the one which work for both end of the day you're buying it even if you'll see men's skin care for aging turn the bottle see the label it'll have the same ingredient that will have for women also correct but going by data what is the difference in behavior that you've seen between men and women when it comes to skincare and how do you address that as a brand because your messaging has to be different your perceived results have to be different and your story has to be different so being a genderneutral brand addressing both men and women for something like skincare where both these customers have vastly different behaviors. Let's talk about the difference in behavior and then let's talk about how do you address the challenge that comes with it. So what's the difference in behavior that you've noticed from your data? No, I think uh there has been anyways a taboo associated with skincare in specific men right and uh one we were not very open in talking to others that hey I have a skincare um and you know you would have seen a lot of campaigns of other brands you know mocking men using a skincare and all so that was always the case which is changing people are talking about it and if you know sitting here I'll say hey I have a skincare you'll not judge me right so that changing. Uh second is of course you know the steps in men are lesser compared to women and lot of that are also more functional right and then third is the needs also a little different as I said that you know uh see the requirement of certain product in women because of lot of factors are again very different between men. Can you say this again? What is very different between men and women? Well, like I said, you know, uh, our skin textures and thickness are different between men and women. So, say women will have thinner skin because of which you'll start to see some of the aging signs maybe little early compared to men, right? So, maybe because of that their need for certain product would be slightly earlier compared to men, right? Uh there are certain some of those thing. uh see how we communicate when I say is always more about a product properties and an outcome you can expect from a product we never sell that say for a women these are the 10 15 product you should buy or for a man hey buy just these three right uh say for a cleanser if you have say sensitive skin this is what we have or if you're oily we have a product that is relevant for both now say as a men if you have a need for oily or acne prone on skin you will be able to relate to that communication you'll buy and even if you're a woman you'll able to relate to it because it is more factual basis that you can figure you can see that okay now beyond this cleanser I'm now looking for a moisturizer can I figure out something from a portfolio again very easily because everything is more datadriven and functional so we never face that challenge because we never promoted oursel very heavily as a women or promoted maybe certain steps certain routines which are different for both Got it. So you are more problem oriented rather than gender oriented. Is that correct? Absolutely. And regardless of whether this person is a man or a woman, Yeah. if they have a problem, they can come to minimalist. Correct. Was that your communication strategy? Exactly. Very very functional. Okay. So if I were to summarize what you just said, you said that skin types are different, results expected are different. And while amongst men it is largely a taboo, amongst women it's a flex. So it's easier to sell it to a woman as compared to a man. And like you mentioned that you because you're general neutral, you focus solely on functionality. But the one question that I often had is when you can increase your TAM by being general neutral, why do brands stick with oh we are for women and we are for men. Why do they stick to one particular category? Because when they do that, they're practically shrinking their TAM, right? One, you're able to create a niche in a growing segment. So, tomorrow we say that, hey, we have now a brand which is minimalist men created only for men. We can have a bigger pie of men from that particular brand because lot of customers will feel, oh, this is more relevant for me. Uh on a gender neutral, I still have to educate you that hey, you know, skin is same. It's no different right uh sometime if you're not aware you'll go to a shelf you'll see five product one is minimalist then next to it you'll see a brand ABC for men you'll most likely feel that is more relevant for me uh so in a long run we always feel because people are becoming more aware more knowledgeable uh doing right thing will help and will win uh but sometime again you know we have a large set of users from top to the bottom of the pyramid depending on which segment you're also going after the bottom is also pretty large and that will take like decades as you rightly mentioned before they understand what have been what they have been buying is just a marketing story. Got it. So you're saying that resonance is a major factor. Yeah. If a brand says that I'm only for women, they strike a better chord with women as compared to a brand that says I am both for men and women. But that makes your job even more difficult. Then why not start with women and then introduce minimalist men because you know that both products are the same. You can tell the customers that both products are the same. It's just the look and feel of both the products are completely different. Wouldn't this be an easier way to penetrate the market? I mean there's nothing wrong with that, right? See, one if you would have started with say skincare for women and then tomorrow I'm also launching something for men. I'm creating a lot of content that hey why this is for women and again if going back uh on the principles and the values see every decision that we take always goes through these two filters clinically proven and transparent if this is not transparent this is not honest and I'm lying about certain thing just because it suit my proposition that is wrong and we felt we don't want to do that as much as I appreciate that there's also an easier way out you don't have to spec specifically say that this is only for women. You just need to have women ambassadors endorsing your brand and people will assume that this is for women. You can use branding and design language to strike a better call with women without saying that this is only for women, right? And same is the case with men as well. But then I'm talking about this from a business standpoint because you entered a market which was extremely challenging and when you have so many challenges in fact you started with zero investment eventually you raised money right so speaking about it from a market viability standpoint customer desiraability standpoint it is easier to start with one category and then extend into the other without actually putting out something misleading. For example, if I have women ambassadors who endorse my brand, I don't have to say that this product is only for women automatically because thinking fast and slow, Daniel Carnean system one, system two, the monkey brain is going to assume that this is meant only for women and they'll buy that product. You could have struck a better chord with women in a much easier manner and that could have got you inside the market. See anyways you know if you look at the overall industry split uh and I really don't have the data but I'm sure 65 to 70% of the consumers in skincare is anyways women correct right and initially also all our messaging image that you mentioned was largely towards women so while we were not calling it a women or men related brand image was 70% women maybe 25 30% men and that is how we also positioned ourself without explicitly calling calling it men or women. uh you gave example of two brand and you said you know you're using certafil and I'm sure that is equally popular in both the genders right you don't see certafil women and men so even if brands take a genderneutral position there's a way to attract both uh you gave example of dove right again a very very iconic brand love it uh they again are popular amongst both the genders so that is also one way of building it so they are in both the path you need to figure out which path you'd want to And again you know my own personal experiences and learning u see eventually it's not about all the right thing that you do it's also about how many less or wrong decision you have taken in the journey right and every decision which is calling it a women or men using endorsement from content creator doing something else has a repercussion and these are like either or kind of a thing, right? Whether you're this or do this, you can't do both. Mhm. It is very surprising how long-term you thinking when you are not a big brand. It's quite interesting because when you're a very large brand, you tend to think long-term because you're here in this game for the next 30 years. But when you're a very small brand, the natural instinct of an entrepreneur is to always survive and to get a foot at the door. But then somehow brother you are you are but actually if you don't think for 10 years see again I'll not lie that you know we have been thinking 30 50 years right but if I don't even think for 10 year I can't build a big brand that's a very big window though 10 years because you know nal raan says something very very interesting he says that the greatest entrepreneurs are often the ones who don't ever want to exit their business and every time they pick something they always have a very clear reasoning about how this is going to play out in the next 10 and they just tend to do it instinctively right for example I told you about the zeroda decision right to put nudge over there and I've had this conversation with Nikil and Nithan also why did you do this he said you know this is just beneficial they never thought it to be a big deal because for them this was beneficial and that's it they never thought uh you know we're losing out on revenue because they said 10 years down the line we don't want people to find out that there could have been a feature and we missed out on that and this happened quite instinctively a lot of them are not able to articulate that but the way you articulating everything I'm able to understand that every single pillar of foundation that you've laid is a foundation that will reap benefits for the next two decades whether this is about being gender neutral focusing on functionality focusing on authenticity because you and I we both know D2C brands that are today billiond dollar companies through paid partnerships which which are not very authentic right but they've been able to do that because they choose the easier route but then it's so difficult to choose the harder route and somehow from this conversation I'm able to make out that you somehow always choose to do things the harder way my question is what exactly is that driving factor which is consistently pushing you to do things the harder way again it might honestly look very hard initially Eventually it become very obvious to you. See eventually you have seen the result. No when I say eventually I'm not saying you know 5 year 10 year or so right? Our journey has been only for 5 year. uh like you know a lot of time when you think about how you take decisions, how to you know ask your team to take decision right u you need to have certain processes or certain values on which teams are taking decision and again you know minimally started because of our own discomfort with the way brands have been selling their product so it started with very clear philosophy when I say that you know hey be like honest honest honest and you can't be selectively honest M uh then take every decision which is right for a customer because you know I have been a customer and I was like pissed with the way I was treated u when it come to my own brand I can't sit on the fence and say oh this is suiting my particular agenda I should do it but then I'll say wrong things about five other brand if today I don't have trust in food someone should fix it there are some brands which are fixing it right but you know if those brand also become very selective that okay today that is suiting my agenda. Uh will that be right for customers? No. Right? And again, you know, there are a lot of supporters who support those businesses just because they're honest. But what I'm trying to figure out is what exactly happened in your life so profoundly that is pushing you to be so ethical. I'll give you my experience and you'll be able to you'll be able to tell me what happened in your case. In my case, it's very simple. I just don't have a good night's sleep if I do something even remotely wrong. So I just don't do it because I know for a fact that if I do it today I'll keep thinking about it. Even if it is debatable I just won't do it. So for me it makes a huge difference that night. Similarly when I asked Nan the same question he told me that you know tomorrow if there's one random guy who pops up and says that you know because of this feature of yours I lost money. I don't want that story. So um the potential for being found guilty for something that is quite debatable is also something that Nathan avoids. Okay, you get what I'm saying right? Even if it is remotely possible that because of one of Zeroda's feature an investor loses money and he comes and tells Nathan that bro I lost money because of you. He doesn't want that. He doesn't want that on his um on his record of deeds. Similarly, my question to you is what exactly happened so profoundly in your life which is pushing you to do things the hard way even though you are in a market which has cutthroat competition. Yeah. So there were two things right. Uh so one see again that was largely related to our upbringing. So I was born in a very low-inccome family and you know growing up around that time uh there are certain things that your parents always tell you right and my father used to say always that you know don't do anything wrong right and there's a karma it'll come back and all if you see some wrong thing happening around your family neighborhood and all he'll always say that don't worry you know karma so there's someone who is watching you right I don't know I you So that you know that is how we we grew up. So that always stay in back of the mind. I think second is uh see at some point in time you also think as a founder how your team should function right and I felt that you know I if we say that oh we have a value which is being transparent and honest it can't be a value written on a wall somewhere. Yeah. uh and if they see it every day that we come in a room we decide everything which suit our agenda and then tomorrow I'm doing a town hall and saying hey be honest and all those thing that is a BS you don't want to be a hypocrite you don't want to be a hypocrite uh but the good thing is if you start following some of those practices the kind of impact it has on people that is insanely positive uh like after our one year you know we did like a company ENPS or something right and we had both a set of c people some said hey I'm very happy some said I'm completely unhappy okay uh because maybe I'm not happy with my manager which is a usual thing maybe I think you know your policies per some of those thing can be better and there are always certain challenges which you know you need to fix there was one question which we ask in that questionnaire that you know do you feel proud to be part of NIM list you know the answer for that was 100% not a single person said no oh wow that's amazing that was amazing that was the moment I felt that okay you know we are creating something which we know we can be proud of m u we talking you know giving examples of D2C uh for D2C being on marketplace is very important now for marketplaces your rating reviews are very important you know there's an entire industry You can pay 20 30 rupee to get a fivestar review, right? Does it help? It does. There's a category for this. It's called online reputation management. And when I heard about it, it was very strange and scary. Like tomorrow, I could be building a D2C brand and my competitor could flood my comment section, correct? With absolutely terrible comments and that could result into a loss for my company. Now when you're going against funded competitors and they pour in that funding into spoiling your reputation that's a disaster right no so see you need to believe in two things one again what you're doing uh on that and like talking about the reviews and online management uh we never purchase even single review ever and every time the discussion used to happen with my own team that hey you know there's a competition product they launch they have 500 fivestar exact ratings. Uh we have five and in that in that unfortunately if two people don't like initially and they review your rating is say 2.53 how to sell this product. You then just need to trust in the process that hey you know we have spent 2 years in this product. We have done a lot of trials. We know eventually large number of people will like it. Give it time. It'll happen. It'll happen. It'll happen. And one day it'll happen. If it does not okay you know it actually is more important because you know what is not working just go and fix it one day you know your ratings will show what the product is it actually is a true mirror to your own R&D team also to your old self also in terms of how good or bad your product are right second is when you say you know competition will flood your comment sections and all we have seen so many examples say no something else I'll tell you right where say maybe a content creator just because we were not endorsing or paying bashed our product against the competition and then I can go and see they will have maybe 100 500 comment majority will say this is working for me and sometime people say oh we are sending bots we are sending our own people to write comment we never did that but with time you start to see that you know again if you have large number of people who know what you are doing who believe in what what you have been in this entire process and if your product work they will support you. So there are again if there are 10 bad people there are 90 good people also you need to just trust on 90 and just continue to do it right. Very interesting. But tell me something skincare as a category plays out very strangely when it comes to Amazon reviews. Yeah. Why? Because Amazon asks you for a review after you get the product. Yeah. But the person who is receiving this product has to use your product for at least 15 to 30 days to be able to give a databacked review. So how is Amazon review relevant for you? How can I gauge the relevance or quality of your product by looking at Amazon review? Because even if somebody's giving you a one star review, they received the product, they used it once and they're giving you a review the next day. So how does Amazon review make sense for your category? No, on the paid one or the organic one you're talking organic one. I'm organic. See once you product Amazon ask for review. So u as a brand you can trigger your email for review request bases what you think is the right time for your product like in our case we send email to customer after 21 28 days and that gets reflected on Amazon. Yeah. Yeah. So after 21 days you'll get a email that hey you know you purchase this product give a review. So as a brand you can actually configure that. Uh I know my product is not a instant gratification because I'm solving some concerns. So not sending after 2 days and sending after 20 was more appropriate for me. So that is how you can just all plan. Got it. Moit. Now I want to go deeper into how to build a skincare brand. Firstly you spoke about manufacturing. Tell me how much does it cost to set up a manufacturing plant if you want to manufacture skincare products. So uh see we started without lot of capital and we were bootstrapped right. For how long? Uh one and a half year. Yeah. So we created a very very basic infrastructure. Uh that level of infrastructure you can start anywhere between 25 to 30 lakh. What are you saying? Yeah. Okay. Uh and how we manage it large part of that was lease. So we never invested in land. We never invested in building. You can find that in lease. Uh the only thing that matter is then your mixers and your filling equipment. Right. Uh so prioritize depending on how much money you would want to invest into those equipment which you think are very very critical like mixers and see again your mixers are the most important part of it which is a heart right uh even if you are doing and then filling uh even if you're doing say packing manually by say putting bottles into the cartons and all and doing all those manually initially it's okay because you don't have volumes right you don't need say auto packing machines and You don't need all the infrastructure. Lot of other thing also can be very manual initially. So you can just break it down into which processes with the right people you can run manually by still owning the you know quality and which processes you need to invest because that defines where the product is. Once you cross your first level and you'd want to upgrade then you can put maybe some more money. M so after when minim I said you know was in October 2020 till then we were running with this small setup of 3050 lakh uh the second plant when we created was after almost a year when we started getting closer to 100 cr of revenue we were doing some 7 or 8 cr a month wow uh then we nested around 1820 K 1820 crores this was large scale this was large scale because that was then created to have you know gave us some 500 K of Raven Run rate where we still operate. Great. So you found the gap in the market to be functional skincare products. You designed and manufactured functional skincare products like face serum and how many products did you initially start with? Face serum. Six product. Six products. Yeah. Can you name those products if it's not? It was. Yeah. Yeah. It was salicylic acid, vitamin C, nioinamide, uh, retinol and I think fifth would be tanexamic acid if I'm not wrong. Okay, these six products were solving for which are the top three problems of skincare. All these were distinct. So for every unique problem, we just created one then. So like salisic was for acne. So if you're dealing with acne just use that product that will be helpful. Retinol was for like aging. Vitamin C is for brightening. Nyasinamide is for oily skin. Tennisamic is for pigmentation. So we just found five or six unique needs. Each of these need were just solved through one particular product. Apart from that content creator influx that you got, how did you then educate your customers and go ahead apart from your own content too? Because content doesn't scale instantly, right? You went from 0 to 100 crores in about 8 months if I'm not wrong. So when did that hockey stick growth happen? See for us it was a very on a unique story. So like every month we were adding 1 cr in revenue. So like first month was one run rate then two then three then four. It never became like you know we stayed on one and then one day it shot up right. Uh though very mindfully we were adding channels in it. So first 3 month we knew this was primary D2C without any other channel. uh after 3 month when we had lot of comfort that people are liking the product there's a good repeat and retention and we also understand basis all the queries email DMs what they're getting uh what challenges they have in finding the right product also because on my own site I can offer a lot of support navigating it and answering questions I can't do it on a marketplace after three when we understood we then launch on Amazon and Then we stayed with Amazon for three more month. Uh once we had some comfort that okay whatever information we are creating and putting all those text that is helping people find the right product and whatever success we saw in terms of conversions, retentions and all some of that we can initially see because 3 month again is a very short period of time and whether in those segment are product are becoming popular or not. After that then we added Nika. So for the first 8 months I think these were the three just channel uh focus was largely on uh our own content and then we were working very closely with our customers because they were anyways the uh early movers and evangelist. Can we work with them to create out of UGC? So how to nurture that community? How to help them create that content? What can be some motivators for them? Uh so like you know if we see some stories if we see certain post where they're talking about it we will just go take their permission see if we they're allow we are allowed to repost it and people are happy to do that right uh we don't used to edit anything so whatever you have written we'll clearly go and publish that added lot of trust in new users because I can see some authentic stories right that also gave a motivation to other that if I'll also create authentic brand listen to me, right? And my content can also be part of their page. So some of those small small things. So see again UGC is very interesting but it is very challenging also how you can ask you know people to create content for you. I faced a lot of problem with that because we have a course called the communication masterass. Bro people have gotten promotion they've gotten great jobs and we're not talking about ordinary promotions or ordinary jobs. People have gone from 12 lakhs to 18 lakhs in package because of the communication masterass. And this is the reason why I wanted to talk to you about motivators. How do I motivate people to give me a great testimonial? Because I'll tell you what is a challenge. Challenge is they've achieved this growth. They're very happy to share it with you and that's when we ask can you please create a video. Now in most cases they don't feel like the video is good enough. as a result they refrain from sharing the video or sometimes they hesitate and then they share the video and they say oh you know what please don't put it out because I don't look good in the video so when you encounter problems like these how do you solve these problems what were your initial motivators not when you started publishing but before you started doing this on a large scale before you became a big brand how did you motivate your customers to put out content the thing you need to understand actually what is the value for your customers to create the content right and you know every time if I'm endorsing something it has my credibility right and even if I'm you know talking a small group of four people who are around me if I share something which has no social currency attached to it is a useless conversation right so say if today I'll say oh do you know chat GPT right uh you'll not think highly of me because by now you already know about it but say the day maybe grog was introduced use or say now there's a you know new AI model which not too many people are aware about it. If I tell you some of those information, you'll feel oh I know about this industry a lot more than you and you'll have you know you'll think that maybe I'm an expert in this and every group will have certain people who are expert in their own category you know some will have lot of information about say investing some will have lot of hands-on experience about you know phones and all I know what all latest tech and other thing are there some will have certain other interest and they will share information which you think is always very insightful so you're saying that you have to give them something very interesting to share. Exactly. But if you were in my place and you had to do this for communication masterclass, communication is not something that's very new and people don't want to share their salary jumps. Bro, I went from 12 lakhs to 18 lakhs because they want to be private about it and it looks like bragging and then they think they don't look good enough in front of the camera because obviously you'll be awkward because this is your first content that you're putting out, right? So in those cases, how would you solve this problem? No, I think uh you can maybe look at the content certain unique part of the content that others don't cover which can be some interesting value ad for to the person who's listening. So if I say hey you know I've gone through this particular content class which maybe talk about this one aspect which is very interesting and engaging and I found this example which I just want to share. Hm bro that's exactly what we do and in fact the limited pieces of content that we've gotten are contents that people make because they wanted to complete the assignment. For example, we have an assignment where you have to speak in front of the camera for about 1 minute explaining a business strategy. People post to that content but then in that content there is no communication masterass. It's just content. So how do you plug communication masterclass in? No. So see always think like a customer. When was the last time you did an endorsement of a brand and why? Um this podcast is by not in podcast with your to your own friends bro I do it all the time because because you found something which is cool a worthy sharing worth sharing right so I think you know in your own content just figure out that these are certain part which are very cool which can be very interesting for a person sharing it but even you know just casually uh like even if we watch a movie I don't want to recommend a movie which I think probably you'll not like it because you will think oh I have a bad taste. I only want to recommend movies which I think oh this is definitely good and something you may not be even aware of that oh I have found something a good documentary on Netflix which is very cool very insightful and all I'll definitely tell you because I I'll brag about it because that will build you know uh again it's a good social currency if I tell you all the cool and new things you will feel I'm smart right so can you build those levers into the product if today someone will say hey you know I'm using a vitamin C it has no smartness today, right? Because world has already moved from that to something very different today, right? What is that new thing that you're bringing and can that be easily informed to people and some of the initial customers would like to talk about it? Great. So, you're saying that you should find something bragworthy. Worthy of sharing. Yeah. Worthy of sharing. If it qualifies as bragworthy, it's great because they'll anyways brag about it. Something worthy of sharing that is not conventional. That doesn't make it look like an endorsement but a testimonial which is authentic but is insightful enough for other people to find it interesting. Yeah. Got it. And in your case what was that? So in our case actually there were two things right. So one was the entire ingredient and their concentration in the science right uh like 2020 if you go and talk to people and ask them hey what nias is majority will say I've never heard of this word right. So for some this was important. Uh that was a time lot of content was created both by the brand where we were doing it by consumers by even content creators also uh without any paid endorsement because you know their consumers are asking hey you know while of course you're doing this content can you tell me what is nice because I can see some brands are selling this product. So of course they will have to create content because their customers are asking for it their viewers asking for it right. So that was one. Second is on the result. So again in our product that was second hook. If I'm going through certain some challenges and if I feel certain solution that I'm using for the market and maybe I'm using three product say one from us and it is really helping I would really want to share my story because I know someone else is also struggling in their life and it can meaningful for them also. So both the thing helped initially for us. So you're saying that social currency is what makes you go viral amongst peers. In fact, now that you're saying this, it's making a lot of sense to me because I read this book called Contagious. Have you read this book? Contagious. Contagious speaks about this pineapple example. This fruit could be different. But then this book speaks about an example whereby an uncle cutting pineapple went viral on the internet. Okay? And this was way back when WhatsApp was not so prevalent. This video got about 30 million views. It was on every single website. Now, if I tell you this, does this make sense to you that an uncle cutting pineapple is going viral on the internet and every single media house is publishing about this uncle and this video is everywhere. Does it make sense to you? No. Right. But then the reason why it went viral was because the uncle taught the world how to cut a pineapple in 6 seconds. So it was a high utility product. Right now it's making sense, right? How would you cut a pineapple in 6 seconds? So when people saw it, they wanted to share it out to the world saying this is how you can cut pineapple in 6 seconds because they found it interesting. It's almost like uncles sharing WhatsApp forwards because they find the news to be very interesting. See again because someone in my group will feel oh wow this person knows more than me or this is something that he share. He always shares some cool things. So that is currency. You need to build those into the product. In fact, this makes sense with our content as well. You know, I see a lot of people who say, "Oh, you know what, bro? I watch your content." And I ask them, "What do you do with this content?" They tell me that your content makes us look smart in parties. So, when we go to a party and somebody's talking about making India, I know why it's failing. I'll tell you why along with stats. If somebody goes to a party and uh they have to answer the question, what's happening with ODC? they would give people a very very databacked reply which makes them look like a genius and uh now people have started telling me that you know I went to this party I spoke about ONDC and as it turns out everybody had watched your video so they said in fact we heard stories where people have actually copy pasted our entire business case study with their MBA assignment and the teacher was like dude I do you think you're the only one who's watching YouTube so they get caught now um unfortunately So what you're saying makes so much sense, man. So if you have to make something go viral organically, you have to make sure that it is bragworthy and it is worthy of a social currency which will then prompt other people to share it. In your case, you actually turned your disadvantage into an advantage because you were producing products which are hard to pronounce, right? Let alone explain. But then because it was cool and it became social currency in the sense that it could benefit somebody else, people naturally tend to share it. And from what I can imagine, if there are two friends sitting over here and you know Kunala often says that if your product is great, two people sitting at the dinner table should be able to have a conversation about your product where one person tells the other person that this is a cool product that I found. So I'm imagining this and you can correct me if I'm wrong that if I used a product of yours which is helping me get rid of acne and I see a friend of mine who's also encountering the same problem. I would use this as social currency and recommend this product to him so that he gets results and eventually he'll have newfound respect for me and that's how this scales. Does that make sense? So it can happen in multiple manner. So one of course you know the person is using the same product you can have a conversation or if you think the product can be relevant for this person also I can say hey you know I started using a new product from this brand and this is what this brand sell and offer if I know you are interested in this conversation right and you feel oh this is something cool and worthy of sharing uh or maybe if I know you are going through certain challenges and because of which you will find some benefits and you took this to social media using UGC so it was one of on steroids. Oh wow. Beautiful. Did you go offline? We started a lot later. So after one and a half two year uh that's when we started offline. So we had honestly you know uh a number in our mind that maybe once we'll get say 40 50 retailers writing an email asking for a product that's when we'll feel maybe we are ready for it. Oh wow. Did you get those emails? Yeah we did. Wonderful. Tell me something Mohit. Um what I find very interesting about your business is that you started with six products. Six. Usually people say you know start with one and they would never start with six unless there's a common ingredient or common set of ingredients. Did you have common set of ingredients for these six products or were these six products completely different from each other? No. So the subcategory was same because these were all face serum. Format was same. It was again all serum. Uh ingredient in each of these were different. the hero ingredient was different. Of course, you know, the base ingredient of using water, certain solvents and all would be very largely similar also. Uh but these we started with the philosophy that okay know we'd want to target four five larger problem that people have so that there's a larger relativity to it. Uh see even now after almost 5 year we have some 50 odd product in our portfolio. So we never use product as a growth hack that you know will generate continue to generate more and more. We always felt that you know if certain product solve those needs it can be those you know classic product that can stay in the market for 5 10 years till the time the tech is disrupted and I have to maybe you know upgrade my own product. Understood. Can you walk me through the unit economics of these products? I mean if six products have vastly different unit economics then we can talk about them but then if they have similar unit economics we can talk about them in general. It was largely similar. Uh the pricing may be different. Uh but percentage wise it'll be very similarish. Okay. Can you break this down for me? So uh I think MRP was closer to 600. Some would be maybe 549, some would 649 or you can use 600 broadly for that. Uh when we say cogs, we again made that change. We always wanted to spend more into the product and we felt if you do that we'll have to spend lesser in marketing. Can you explain Cox in brief? Yeah. So cost of goods uh sold and in that you include your making cost which is both your raw material and packaging material. Also it contain the basic overhead of factory your workers and all. And then it also include logistic so that you're able to get that good from a manufacturer to your own warehouse and all right so then these broadly things have been included while a lot company would be working on some 80 85% gross margin we were happy to work at 70%. So your cogs was uh 30 30. Okay. So 600 rupees product though it is. So if your product costed 600 rupees then your cogs was 200. Yeah. 180 to 200 we were putting into the product and in that a very small percentage was going into the packaging material largely was into what is inside the packaging. So for that we started just using you know the farmer grade bottle some basic paper packaging and all. So negligible percentage always went into the the packaging. How much would that be just in case? Yeah, packaging would be less than 4 5%. 4 5%. Okay. Yeah. Take care. Majority was into then uh the product itself, right? Then you'll have the next uh cost which is your distribution cost. Uh so there you'll have your marketplaces, their selling fees and all those thing, right? U initially it was 26 for certain marketplaces blended now for us it comes to closer to 15 odd person 15 odd% so it decreases with time yeah yeah so like on D2C I don't have a selling fee on my own platform right uh then there are certain platforms or certain partners who buy outright and don't charge a fee which is basically inventory model inventory model so like can you explain inventory model yeah so like in Amazon I have to send my goods to Amazon warehouse whenever a customer buy Amazon will ship it. So actually I'm just using their platform payment gateway and warehousing and logistic services right when goods are sold to a customer Amazon will pay that amount minus the fee right and that fee will take into consideration all those thing which is what we call as which is fulfilled which is what we call selling fee. Second model when we say inventory is a model in which someone will buy outright. So say in case of Nika, Nika will buy a product outright. So instead of say 100 rupee which is MRP, Nika will pay 100 minus certain percentage, I'll sell it for that amount and then there's no cost. Every cost of warehousing and all has been taken care by Nika. So it basically depend where in your P&L the cost has been impacted. What would that threshold be in the P&L? Because if you have to go from marketplace model to an inventory model, you have to be a large brand. That's the notion that is out there in the market. But my question is how large do you have to be? No, I think actually that is not a case that you need to be a large brand for inventory. Uh some partners work on inventory model and even at a smaller stage they still onboard you on inventory. Your initial purchase orders can be for a lower value. With time that percentage will increase. Both the models will have its own and pros and con but that is how you just learn and grow with time right okay because the way I'm looking at it is that if Nika is opting for an inventory model with you they're taking a big risk by actually buying products upfront from you now to be able to do that they need to measure certain parameters to gauge if you are worthy of that or not in that you would have maybe repeat rates your margins and how many customers you So my question is what would be those qualifying factors that enabled you to be an inventory model partner for Nika? So uh again see Nika till the time we don't have a data and I'm just thinking how they would be planning their entire thing. uh in our case they would have started with what kind of searches we are getting on their platform right so say every day how many people are searching minimalist theorems and all basis that I can broadly estimate what kind of sale I can generate because these many search queries I have for your brand uh now I'll make maybe a first order on a very conservative side so if I know there are 10,000 searches that happen in a month probably 3 4,000 will at least convert so even if I make an order of 3,000 product see if I can assume in a month also I'll be able to sell right if no maybe in 2 month I'll be sell because the shelf life is 18 24 months so there's a still long period right now say in the first month you get a sale of maybe 3,000 sold in less than a month then second month maybe they will start with 5,000 unit 6,000 unit then they will eventually increase more to the point where they think that if they are comfortable holding 45 to 60 days of inventory what is that number is so that process can anywhere be between a month to 6 month. Beautiful. Let's come back to your unit economics. 200 rupees cogs, 30 rupees packaging cost assuming 5% of 600 rupees 150 rupees assuming 25% is your distribution fees and then do you have any other cost attached? No. So then your third large part would be on your marketing cost which is performance, right? So whatever ads you're running on your own site or Amazon and all there's a cost attached to it. That is the third largest cost. In our case that has been closer to 25%. 25%. Yeah. After that you'll have your people cost in your own what was the people cost? Uh large part of the work was being managed by me and Rahul the co-ounders. Then we roped in lot of folks uh at a operations work. So we were largely involved into everything uh because again I said you know we were bootstabbed and we were not sure we can pay salaries or not. Uh so we never want to hire till the time we have we have confirmation or maybe confidence that you know I can at least pay for 2 years right. Uh few hiring that happened initially was largely into R&D only that okay whatever our own capital we have even if we hire someone we can pay them 2 year you know we can survive. So people cost would be four or 5%, because again uh as a founders we were not taking salaries. Got it. Did you have any other cost attached? Uh overheads would be negligible and then we were just left with I beta. So I think first year we were somewhere around 10 15%a. Can you tell me in terms of gross and net margins? So gross was 70% because 30% was cogs right. Okay. And you were left eventually with net of what? 25 26% is taxes because we never had you know interest or any other thing the plant was very small as said 30 35 like we invested the depreciation was also very limited so after ITA was largely taxes and the profit after tax got it understood so would you recommend this to be a standard playbook to enter skincare initially because you know when people look at a 70% cross they assume that it's a cakewalk but then 70% gross you're left with barely 10 to 12% net right and gross or net difference that's where everything gets misleading so my question is if someone were to launch a skincare brand today what should be a healthy margin that they should keep for gross so that they can consider it to be feasible to enter the market I think the biggest piece in this which is not controlling valuable by a lot of people is the marketing cost is the marketing cost. Okay. So you need to figure out again uh can you control the marketing spend because everything else is controllable it can be fixed uh even for a lot of large companies marketing cost even for public companies and all right uh it can be anywhere closer to 40%. and they have been in losses for a very long time. Uh even large scale D2C company will have any between 35 to 40% maybe more than that right. Uh so whatever growth margin you can shrink if you're unable to manage marketing that become a challenge and uh how you can then break marketing also. So there are two thing right the overall marketing spend and cost of new user acquisition right new user acquisition cost will continue to increase because platforms are becoming more competitive more and more brands are jumping into it so that very very hardly will ever go down. How the total cost can remains lower is because of your returning and referrals. So again, you know, if you're pouring more and more water into your bucket, but if the bucket is leaking, you'll continue to have to pour more. But if you're able to retain, if you think large number of customers are able to stay and they also bring lot of new customers, even at a higher marketing acquisition cost, you're able to control your overall uh marketing cost. So I guess that is the most important part where I would want people to focus on. other thing eventually you'll figure out which then brings us back to the first thing that we spoke about which is result result and differentiation yeah see uh you may not have buying power initially and you're paying a premium to a supplier for certain ingredient because someone else has more buying power because that cost is 30 even if you're paying say 5 6% or maybe 10% premium eventually that will be maybe 2% more right uh your team cost can be again manageable because you can do the heavy lifting um you know your distribution cost largely will remain same what is industry is Amazon will ask you the same pay versus someone else also uh if you're able to retain get more references because initially u you don't have a target that okay tomorrow I would want to do 5 cr of monthly revenue I mean start with what makes sense for you right put only that much capital and actually your marketing cost initiation is much lower uh it's never linear cost of adding a new customer with time only increases. So initially for us it was not even 25%. It was much lower than that. So other part of your acquisition which is retention and referral that should kick in. So just look at that very closely and that only give a sign of PMF. Uh lot of time what I've seen is people confuse initial sale with PMF. Yeah. See there's a thin line between sales and PMF. I create a product there are so many type of customers something will appeal to someone right and by spending marketing amount I will be able to get some initial customers also that is how you make some initial sales right for a PMF uh you know it's always important to look at some qualitative parameters attached around it right and you how you can differentiate between those how excited I was with the launch. So see I try a lot of new products customer for example I see something I have purchased it uh and I'm not very excited about it will I come back again maybe the answer is no uh does it justify the PMF maybe no I got the first sale but I don't think it's a PMF but if you talk to the customer customer feel very happy that oh I was just waiting for it thanks so much for launching this product and all you can gauge some of the conversation right uh am I willing to refer to a friend of mine If the answer again is yes, uh you know again the the time for that must be much larger. Uh will I be coming back and buying more from you? And if I can some of those sign then again kind of shows stickiness. So I think these four or five thing initially can be hard to quantify but you can measure by having a lot of conversation. So one said you know how excited I am with the launch my likely to refer and likely to come back and these three number we used to measure very very closely. How did he measure this? Like see repeat is very easy. Repeat is very easy. Very easy. Uh referrals uh to some extent easy if you're able to give maybe a discount code or something. We never did that in our case because we felt that you know people don't like referring product because you're getting 100p off. It always feel there's a intent behind it. Right? Uh so how to do it? Uh you can always talk to some customer and then try to exool it. So today if I know I have 100 new customers and I'm talking to 20 out of that six are saying oh I came to this site because someone else referred you know maybe 30% are coming through referral so you'll have to just extrapolate just keep doing it very regularly initially and if you think that every time the number is very similar it's then just a a data which kind of makes sense and beyond a certain model you can actually give it to a product owner who can actually measure this for you professionally right yeah exactly I I I'm talking about year one that is a time founders do most of the work right like I mean for the first one month we were doing the entire customer service thing uh replying to email talking to customers replying everything right uh so I think those thing again some are quantitative some are you have to extrapolate by those conversation but there's a way you can figure out to measure for yourself yeah so it's excitement referrals and retention I would also put in result over here how many people got a result because that eventually will fuel referrals right eventually result into retention. So excitement, referrals, retention and result. So yeah, you can say that uh see result if you know people may say hey I like the product. If they're not coming back uh you don't know how to measure that. Uh if they're coming back referring you can assume results are coming out of the product. Uh at times people are nicer. uh I will not say bad about a you know someone. So if a brand is calling me that hey you know you have been using a product if I know I don't like the product I will not be very critical about it I will say hey it's good right but if I do not purchase the product again once I'm consume the product the answer of that I should not judge it on its face value right uh so I think those parameter kind of quantify it so mo if you were to understand the difference between a rockstar and a non-rostar I'm assuming that when you built your organization ization you had several people whom you had to let go and eventually as a founder you have a certain acumen to be able to identify rockstars and a non- rockstar and I've realized that every founder has a different set of attributes that they check for my question is what are your attributes that will help you understand that this person is an A player and this person is a B player so I think as you mentioned you have to figure out what attributes are important for you because people with those attribute will flourish others might not find it you know great place to work in our case it was one culture because again you know we have been talking about values so someone who we know can align with our values is a very very important part uh even if a rockstar but does not align with the value we'll always have those conflicts culture as in what was taught to them at home yeah the culture of our brand which is say transparency honesty and all those thing right so you need to be culturally aligned with those even for our own team you know when you say hey people come first be more respectful uh those are very important thing for us you know I don't want a rockstar to be nasty with others irrespective what he or she may be doing it right so those things we know are very important right so that is the first parameter uh which we learn with time that you know finding people who align with some of those values which we find important in a rockstar second is then ownership u you We again felt that you know we are not the type of people who would want to in tell people that hey do these things at some point in time they need to take their ownership they need to take their own decision right uh it's very easy to put the problem in front of people and say hey these are the five problem let me know how this need to be solved uh or you can come that hey these are five problem for each of these these are the thing that I think we can do the approach is very different uh the one who can come with approach we you know eventually do well in our system right uh the first may do better in some some other places but you have to figure out what works and then third is uh as I said overindexing on talent then experience because we always felt that you know they have less to unlearn and always think from first principle because they are outsiders just like us as in you would get somebody supremely talented with less experience rather than getting somebody with a very vast experience and supremely talented because from what you're saying I am able to make out that you see somebody with a lot of experience with a person who might also have a lot of baggage. Yeah. See uh moldability is very important part that you know I can I come and absorb in your system right work in your own ways. uh if you have seen too many thing in your past career and all you will feel this work and this does not and sometime people find it very challenging that you know my own norms if I say hey are wrong and we are creating a different way of working my playbook is very different we don't do these things uh getting that commitment uh become challenging and in a small team you need to have high level of commitment correct so it's learning plus unlearning if I were to put it that way unlearning first and and learning unlearning first and then learning. Okay. Do you have any other pointers? No, I think honestly these are certain thing that we follow. Got it. My next question to you is if I were to put you in a room with a bunch of candidates and you were to check for these three attributes culture, ownership and um unlearning. How do you gauge that with three questions? So one question actually not even three that I ask is what decision I have taken in past which I think uh were not right and bases my own experiences if I have to go back how will I change those decisions. Uh it help you test two three thing. One is my humility to accept that I have make made some mistake and that is again very important in our office. uh second is whether I'm able to learn new thing depending on my own experience or I again follow what you know I've been doing it right uh sometime people have very theoryical answers to it yeah that's what I was about you know right I mean you can read a lot of those in uh basic articles and all you know how to manage but actually if you go a little deeper okay what was the challenge uh what why it happened what was the thesis behind it why you took this step. Ask five numbers. If today you have to do it, why uh what do you think those numbers will change? You can see whether that is a theoretical artificial answer or that is like something which is very very deep and profound and from there you can judge whether I learned something or not or that is just a HR kind of a question. So it's one broad question which is if you were to go back in time and figure out one bad decision or one bad project that you executed why was it bad why was the decision wrong and if you were to go back and correct it what would you do and once you go deeper into this you'll be able to gauge ownership culture and the ability to learn correct I think the second again that I try is uh if you replace your manager today wherever you're working what three new things or three different thing that you'll do that also help you understand in the system how much I understand about that business and if I am put in a different role uh how I think about it given a choice between two people extremely creative but not disciplined not so creative but very disciplined whom would you pick disciplined why again I said you know certain attribute you have to see culturally what work for you. Uh and at times honestly these are not either or. Uh if someone is very disciplined but very low in talent. Uh and I'm not willing to learn that again can be a challenge for the team. You know I'm hoping you mean few percentage here and there. Yeah. Assuming that they fit in all these qualities like culture, ownership and the discipline because can I bank on you or not? Right. um uh dependency dependency so see again we are very old school in terms of how we operate but that's not old school I would say that is timeless because everything that you've mentioned is not old school it's timeless I was coming on say even uh like we operate from Jaipur which is not a very busy city so travel time from home to office is not a lot so we have everyday office where people come which is 5 days we don't have a lot of work from home because again you know we have seen at least in newer company you brainstorm and work on a lot of problems and as a team you come with some solutions right uh if I know I'm not part of those meeting I'm missing those ones because I think I'm better than others as a team you can't operate uh which is why I said you know I would prefer to work with someone more disciplined which not just me the team can bank on do you believe great teams can be built out of work from home I think interpersonal connectivity being in the same environment help a thought uh you start to lose bit of a touch with people you know I think I have most of my friends from my office because you know you spend a lot of time you build a relationship uh your support for them both personal professional increases a lot because of those relationship uh sometime those relationship are very difficult to create virtually and then My intent for that not just for my team for a other team also because you know again teams collaborate work closely you have a lot of empathy for others work also you even have a understanding of their work uh like I give you example say if I'm in the marketing team and I want my product to be delivered to a customer right u knowing how supply chain work knowing what kind of their challenges have right you'll always have those empathy and as a team you can figure out a way in which can be win-win for both otherwise it become times a blame game that you know I wanted this but this team is not working or vice versa so it's empathy compassion and collaboration perfect that's very interesting thank you so much for spending such high quality time with me moit it was a pleasure to have you here and u I'm just taking back so many things I mean I say this to all the great people who have been into the podcast and I love this conversation especially because I resonate with so many things that you said um at such a level that you know if in fact the beautiful story is that both of us we started somewhere around 2020 right we we actually started a business in 2019 you guys started in 2020 and it is so it is so soothing to see such a wonderful growth story because sticking to ethics is one thing and making it big by sticking to ethics is another thing altogether and everything that you shared has been so wonderful I'm taking back so many things I think you are just very kind thanks for inviting I think though we started the journey at the same time but yeah I mean you are way more popular and you're way more richer bro. Yeah I think it's just about time but thank you so much. Thank you so much for being here. It was a pleasure. Thank you. [Music] [Music]
