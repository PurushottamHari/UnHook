00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
Prashant Dhawan. See, how can one

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
sleep at night in the presence of Nobel Prize nominee Donald Trump.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,320
Iran has suddenly

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,920
attacked American bases. Here, you

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,039
can see Operation Basharat al Fath,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,279
Iran has launched against USA, which was USA's

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080
operation, Operation Midnight Hammer,

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,480
under which USA attacked

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Iran's nuclear bases with B2 bomber, and in

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
response to that, Iran has started attacking American military bases.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,719
And it is being

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,200
said not one or two but four and perhaps

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
more than four countries which are bases of USA,

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
Iran is raining missiles on them.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,840
Here you will be able to see the visuals, these

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,840
visuals are from Doha, Qatar.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,359
[MUSIC]

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,359
[APPLAUSE]

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,920
Those are Iranian missiles up there.  They are heading

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,320
towards the American military bases.  Now

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
it is also seen that many Iranian missiles are being

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,680

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,200
intercepted on their way by USA's missile defense systems.  Till now when

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
I am recording the video.  Again here

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,799
you will have to see, in this video I will

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,520
cover the geopolitics of this attack,

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,080
how many American soldiers were killed or not in this attack,

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,400
where are the missiles

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
planted, its details will most likely be

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,960
properly revealed by morning or tomorrow afternoon

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
because Iran has attacked many countries.  I

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,439
will now show you on the map, this is

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
a humungous attack.  I would say Kiran is

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,240
taking a huge risk.  If the news came

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,479
that somewhere around 20 to 30 American soldiers

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
died.  At one place the missile defense

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,000
system did not work.  After that you

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
know and I know what the US will do to Tehran.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
And suddenly you will see that

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,840
those USA LIs, who till now were a little hesitant in

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,320
involving themselves in Iran, will

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
also get involved here under NATO's Article Five.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,280
For example,

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,840
recently we saw that UK said

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,480
they support USA.  But USA

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,520
's method is wrong.  They do not support this method of directly

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,319
sending a bomber and attacking in this manner.

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,640
If the

50
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,520
news comes tonight that US soldiers were killed in the attack this Rana is carrying out.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Then the entire

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
netto might get active.  In that case, it will

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,840

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,640
give a call of action to France, UK, US, everyone that come on, now the time has come to

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,040
launch a decisive attack on Iran.  And if that's your

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,840
question, okay, fine.

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,319
If we look at Asia, this is Iran.

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,480
What Iran is doing now is

59
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,800
that in the Middle East, apart from the countries like Kuwait and Qatar,

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Baren is also being mentioned.  Now there is a

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
complete list of which countries have

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,920
USA military bases which were attacked.

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,920
Its complete list will

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
come tonight.  But for now it is being said

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,760
that Iran has attacked four to five countries.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,480
It has Qatar, it has Kuwait, it has

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Bahrain and apart from that there is Iraq.  It is not known whether Iran has attacked the

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,120
USA base in Saudi Arabia

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
or not.

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
But Qatar has first

71
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,680
given a statement that our sovranity has been violeted.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
We will definitely give a befitting reply to Iran.  So

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,800
obviously here a question will come to your mind that the

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,159
USA's B2 bomber crossed the

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,879
entire Atlantic Ocean, crossed the African

76
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,400
continent and entered Iran and

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,120

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,480
dropped bunker buster bombs at Iran's nuclear sites.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
So why doesn't Iran directly attack mainland USA

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,879
?

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,159
Why are they attacking the USA military bases here

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,640
?  Its answer is very simple.

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,000
Suppose if Iran wanted to attack USA then

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
it would need an intercontinental ICBM

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
missile.  Intercontinental

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,640
ranging missile with range from 10 to

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,360
12,000 km.  If this happens then Iran will be

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,319
able to cause some damage to USA through pressure.  And the

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,519
most powerful and longest

90
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,159
range missile that Iran currently has a range of 2000 to

91
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,720
2500 km.  is around.  Here I

92
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,519
am talking about Sejal Missile.  This is a solid

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
fuel missile.  Iran has been using it since 2024.

94
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,400
And you can say

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,520
that this missile can hit some warships of Israel and US.

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,240
But Iran has

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,800
no means whatsoever to hit the mainland US.

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Yes, one thing Iran can do is activate

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
its sleeper cells, if any, in the USA, then through

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
terrorism etc., they can

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,680
attack here,

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
a lot of reports are being published about it in the USA, but for

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,960
now, Iran has only

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
one way to retaliate, that is to

106
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
attack the military bases of USA.  Now let me tell you how many US

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,560
military bases there are in the Middle East.

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199
Now here you will be

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
able to see that this is Iran and this

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,160
symbol that you are seeing is of an airbase.

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,960
This truck symbol that you

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,639
see here is an army base and

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,280
this is the symbol of the naval base here.  So the US has

114
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,680
built various types of bases

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,320
around Iran.  It is said that the main

116
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
comprehensive bases are eight to nine.

117
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,600
But they have many camps.  There,

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,600
2000 soldiers, 3000 soldiers of USA have made

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,039
proper preparations for

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,160
a major attack on Iran.  If the US wants or not, it can

121
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,400
literally destroy the entire Iran today.

122
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
It is that powerful.  And if Iran

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,280

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
starts attacking all the US bases, then India's

125
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
interests will also start getting hurt.

126
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,320
Now here you will say but how did we get

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,639
involved?  Remember, there are millions of Indians

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,759
working in the Middle East today.

129
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,000
In Saudi Arabia, in UAE, in Qatar.

130
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
You should visit Qatar sometime.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,440
You will find so many Indians here.

132
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,759
So if Iran attacks all these countries with the intention of targeting US bases

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560

134
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,160
and you know that many times when missiles are

135
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
fired and get intercepted in the air, then

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,919
many times their debris falls down and can fall on common people, so

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,840
in that case Indians will also

139
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,919
come in the danger zone.  So somewhere or the other

140
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
Iran will have to stop its attack.  Otherwise,

141
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,319
Iran will turn many countries in the entire region against

142
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
itself.  These people are already talking about

143
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
stopping the Strait of Hermos, and

144
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,759
both China and India are

145
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,080
very nervous about it.  So see, tonight is very

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,319
important.  I will closely follow

147
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
what developments take place and what happens.

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
Obviously I will bring an updated video for you in the morning.

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
And finally a

150
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,319
very important message for you all, India

151
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,440
needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have

152
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,280
seen that IITs of our country have also

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120

154
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
started offering certificate programs related to data science and the

155
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,560
reason for this is very simple.  The global

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,960
economy is now largely data driven.

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,280
Unless this company has the power of data, that

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
company cannot progress further.

159
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
And that is why you must have noticed that

160
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,479
almost every startup today wants a data

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,199
scientist and you have the opportunity to

162
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,080

163
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,960
make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a data

164
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,039
scientist yourself as a data scientist the

165
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
doors of the whole world are open for you.

166
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,160
You can work in any company like ICICI Bank, AC Express, Accenture

167
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,639
because frankly

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
you will find the requirement of Data Scientist everywhere.  And Careers

170
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,400
247 brings you our flagship

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,880
AI course.  We specifically

173
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,599
included generative AI here because today there is

174
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,160
no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and Machine

175
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
Learning cannot be mastered and

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
hence our online course will run for 6 months.  There

177
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,199
are 260 hours of live classes here.

178
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Just see what happens.  Most of the

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,759
courses that are available online these days are

180
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
offered by Google and Harvard for data science.

181
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
Mostly you will

182
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,199

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,240
tools do you need to learn?  You will be able to understand Pandas, Amazon,

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,639
Web Services, Jupiter properly

you are already working somewhere.  If you

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,480
want a better job, a better paying job, then

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,720
definitely you should do Data Science and

215
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
Machine Learning course.  It will really boost

216
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,920
your career.  And let me tell you that

217
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,519
mostly working professionals come to us.

218
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
Because the one who has not got a job yet

219
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,920
cannot understand what impact skilling

220
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,480
brings.  Who has worked somewhere once.

221
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,279
Only that person knows that the

222
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,519
more skilled you are the better you will be paid.

223
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
