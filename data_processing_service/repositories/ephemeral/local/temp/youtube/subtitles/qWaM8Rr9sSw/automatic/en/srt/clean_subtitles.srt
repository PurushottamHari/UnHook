Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. See, how can one sleep at night in the presence of Nobel Prize nominee Donald Trump. Iran has suddenly attacked American bases. Here, you can see Operation Basharat al Fath, Iran has launched against USA, which was USA's operation, Operation Midnight Hammer, under which USA attacked Iran's nuclear bases with B2 bomber, and in response to that, Iran has started attacking American military bases. And it is being said not one or two but four and perhaps more than four countries which are bases of USA, Iran is raining missiles on them. Here you will be able to see the visuals, these visuals are from Doha, Qatar. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] Those are Iranian missiles up there.  They are heading towards the American military bases.  Now it is also seen that many Iranian missiles are being intercepted on their way by USA's missile defense systems.  Till now when I am recording the video.  Again here you will have to see, in this video I will cover the geopolitics of this attack, how many American soldiers were killed or not in this attack, where are the missiles planted, its details will most likely be properly revealed by morning or tomorrow afternoon because Iran has attacked many countries.  I will now show you on the map, this is a humungous attack.  I would say Kiran is taking a huge risk.  If the news came that somewhere around 20 to 30 American soldiers died.  At one place the missile defense system did not work.  After that you know and I know what the US will do to Tehran. And suddenly you will see that those USA LIs, who till now were a little hesitant in involving themselves in Iran, will also get involved here under NATO's Article Five. For example, recently we saw that UK said they support USA.  But USA 's method is wrong.  They do not support this method of directly sending a bomber and attacking in this manner. If the news comes tonight that US soldiers were killed in the attack this Rana is carrying out. Then the entire netto might get active.  In that case, it will give a call of action to France, UK, US, everyone that come on, now the time has come to launch a decisive attack on Iran.  And if that's your question, okay, fine. If we look at Asia, this is Iran. What Iran is doing now is that in the Middle East, apart from the countries like Kuwait and Qatar, Baren is also being mentioned.  Now there is a complete list of which countries have USA military bases which were attacked. Its complete list will come tonight.  But for now it is being said that Iran has attacked four to five countries. It has Qatar, it has Kuwait, it has Bahrain and apart from that there is Iraq.  It is not known whether Iran has attacked the USA base in Saudi Arabia or not. But Qatar has first given a statement that our sovranity has been violeted. We will definitely give a befitting reply to Iran.  So obviously here a question will come to your mind that the USA's B2 bomber crossed the entire Atlantic Ocean, crossed the African continent and entered Iran and dropped bunker buster bombs at Iran's nuclear sites. So why doesn't Iran directly attack mainland USA ? Why are they attacking the USA military bases here ?  Its answer is very simple. Suppose if Iran wanted to attack USA then it would need an intercontinental ICBM missile.  Intercontinental ranging missile with range from 10 to 12,000 km.  If this happens then Iran will be able to cause some damage to USA through pressure.  And the most powerful and longest range missile that Iran currently has a range of 2000 to 2500 km.  is around.  Here I am talking about Sejal Missile.  This is a solid fuel missile.  Iran has been using it since 2024. And you can say that this missile can hit some warships of Israel and US. But Iran has no means whatsoever to hit the mainland US. Yes, one thing Iran can do is activate its sleeper cells, if any, in the USA, then through terrorism etc., they can attack here, a lot of reports are being published about it in the USA, but for now, Iran has only one way to retaliate, that is to attack the military bases of USA.  Now let me tell you how many US military bases there are in the Middle East. Now here you will be able to see that this is Iran and this symbol that you are seeing is of an airbase. This truck symbol that you see here is an army base and this is the symbol of the naval base here.  So the US has built various types of bases around Iran.  It is said that the main comprehensive bases are eight to nine. But they have many camps.  There, 2000 soldiers, 3000 soldiers of USA have made proper preparations for a major attack on Iran.  If the US wants or not, it can literally destroy the entire Iran today. It is that powerful.  And if Iran starts attacking all the US bases, then India's interests will also start getting hurt. Now here you will say but how did we get involved?  Remember, there are millions of Indians working in the Middle East today. In Saudi Arabia, in UAE, in Qatar. You should visit Qatar sometime. You will find so many Indians here. So if Iran attacks all these countries with the intention of targeting US bases and you know that many times when missiles are fired and get intercepted in the air, then many times their debris falls down and can fall on common people, so in that case Indians will also come in the danger zone.  So somewhere or the other Iran will have to stop its attack.  Otherwise, Iran will turn many countries in the entire region against itself.  These people are already talking about stopping the Strait of Hermos, and both China and India are very nervous about it.  So see, tonight is very important.  I will closely follow what developments take place and what happens. Obviously I will bring an updated video for you in the morning. And finally a very important message for you all, India needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have seen that IITs of our country have also started offering certificate programs related to data science and the reason for this is very simple.  The global economy is now largely data driven. Unless this company has the power of data, that company cannot progress further. And that is why you must have noticed that almost every startup today wants a data scientist and you have the opportunity to make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a data scientist yourself as a data scientist the doors of the whole world are open for you. You can work in any company like ICICI Bank, AC Express, Accenture because frankly you will find the requirement of Data Scientist everywhere.  And Careers 247 brings you our flagship Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative AI course.  We specifically included generative AI here because today there is no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and Machine Learning cannot be mastered and hence our online course will run for 6 months.  There are 260 hours of live classes here. Just see what happens.  Most of the courses that are available online these days are offered by Google and Harvard for data science. Mostly you will get pre-recorded classes and their quality is also not so good.  Where s when you get live classes.  You can talk to the teacher openly yourself.  Through a webcam or a microphone.  You will be able to ask the question immediately that when will this topic be taught in the syllabus?  What tools do you need to learn?  You will be able to understand Pandas, Amazon, Web Services, Jupiter properly and then of course, under this course, you will also do projects with us, which will help you properly understand how to actually use the skills. So, what do you do here? Simply go to the comment section of the video you are watching. You will find this link to Enroll Now in the comment section. Click here.

And by the way, let me tell you that if you are a working professional.  Right now you are already working somewhere.  If you want a better job, a better paying job, then definitely you should do Data Science and Machine Learning course.  It will really boost your career.  And let me tell you that mostly working professionals come to us. Because the one who has not got a job yet cannot understand what impact skilling brings.  Who has worked somewhere once. Only that person knows that the more skilled you are the better you will be paid. So our Data Science and Machine Learning Vi Gen course is starting very soon.  The first class will start in a few days. If you want to start your career in data science then join this course.  And on this note, the video ends.  Thank you for listening.  And as I always say, may God watch over
