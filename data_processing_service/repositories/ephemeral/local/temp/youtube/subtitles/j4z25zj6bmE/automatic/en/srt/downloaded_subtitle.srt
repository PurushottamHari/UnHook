1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
There's parts of your life where there's

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,759
these big question marks that I'm hoping

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,120
you can answer for me. Okay. But I want

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,639
the full truth. Now I'm nervous. Scooter

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,639
Braun is the man behind some of the

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,880
biggest stars in the music industry. And

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,880
he built one of the most disruptive

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
entertainment empires on the planet.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,880
I've never really said this out loud

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
until right now. At this age, I feel a

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
lot of guilt because I worked with so

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,000
many young artists and we were all kids

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
moving so fast and we all wanted to

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760
succeed so bad. And it wasn't until I

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
was 40 years old doing some intense

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,640
therapy that I realized I was so driven

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,879
by the fear that I wouldn't be enough.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,800
So, let's go back. As a kid growing up,

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
I wanted to prove that I could be more

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
than the privilege I was born with. And

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
I created this character, Scooter,

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
because I didn't think Scott could

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
achieve these things. That mask made me

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,520
absolutely relentless faking it till I

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
make it. Like, I had no right convincing

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
Justin and his mom to be on the first

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
plane they had ever been on and meet me.

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,039
So, what were they betting on? My

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
ignorance. But it was also realizing

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280
that so much of insecurity drives us and

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
makes us great. Like now that I'm here,

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
I can't fail because then everyone will

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
see that I shouldn't be here. So let's

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
go for it. And then had such extreme

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
success. The whole world thought I was

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
crushing it. But I had built this mask

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,040
so big. I didn't realize how far away

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
I'd gotten from the sky. So here I am

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,439
the top of my game. I wanted to kill

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,000
myself. I went to a very dark place and

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,640
I broke down crying because I spent so

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,840
much time trying to impress people who

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,880
didn't love me instead of realizing how

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,119
many people already

45
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,280
did. And I was so desperate to do the

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,280
thing I had never done before. What was

47
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,119
that? This has always blown my mind a

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
little bit. 53% of you that listen to

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
this show regularly haven't yet

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
subscribed to the show. So, could I ask

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,439
you for a favor before we start? If you

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
that, then I'll do everything in my

58

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,039
what we do. Thank you so much.

64
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,160
Scooter, when I look at your life and I

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,599
look at the things you've

66
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,200
achieved, so much of it makes sense. But

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
then there's this these other parts of

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,000
your life where there's these big

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
question marks that I'm hoping you can

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
answer for me. And maybe the earliest

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,080
question mark that remains in my head is

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
what it is that drives you? Because from

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,760
an exceedingly young age, there was this

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
dog in you. there was something for me

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,560
when I was going through the research.

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
It looked like a chip on your shoulder

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
or something to prove to someone. And so

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
that's really where I wanted to start. I

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,319
want to understand your earliest context

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,040
so I can understand the cauldron that

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,840
scooter was shaped in and the way that

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,160
that made the boy turned to a man. Big

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,560
question, but that's the um the starter

84
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,440
right burning question in my head. You

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,480
know, it's funny because you started by

86
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,480
asking Scooter, "What drives you?"

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
And it took me a long time to figure out

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,760
as an adult that it was actually Scott,

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,120
my real name, that was the real driver.

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
And I I really created this guy scooter

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
when I was an adult because I didn't

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
think Scott could achieve these things.

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,080
So I almost like created a mask. And it

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
wasn't until I was 40 years old doing

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,319
some intense therapy that I fell in love

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,319
with my name again and

97
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,920
realized the answer to your question,

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,799
which is part of it was shame of

99
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,200
why with my family's

100
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,200
background am I getting all this

101
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,440
privilege? My father's a refugee from

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
Hungary. My mother, her dad died when

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,840
she was 11, you know, and her mother

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
struggled to to raise them with family

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
help in the Catskill Mountains. My

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,680
grandparents were Holocaust survivors.

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,560
And here I am, first generation, born in

108
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,159
America, and I wanted to prove that I

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
could be more than the privilege I was

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,560
born with. And I so I had that chip on

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
my shoulder. I wanted to prove my value.

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
I wanted to prove I was worthy of this.

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,959
Who's told you you had to?

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,160
No one. I think, you know, as a kid

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,359
growing up, I read it that way because,

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
you know, you're hearing the stories of

117
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,880
the Holocaust and my dad every night

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
before he put me and my brother to bed

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,520
would say, "Hey, boys, you're different.

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,080
You're special. I hold you to a higher

121
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,840
standard." Every night before we went to

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,759
bed and we started to really believe him

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,160
of like, we need to hold ourselves to

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
this higher standard. We need to do

125
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,479
more. The idea of failing, the idea of

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
looking at my parents and and not

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
achieving it, that's what drove me. And

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,800
and years ago, I was on a podcast,

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
probably 10 years ago. I was doing a

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
podcast with Complex with this guy,

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
Noah. I watched it. Do you remember the

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
baseball analogy? I literally wrote it

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
down in my notes. Well, I will tell it

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,880
again, but I will tell you on your

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,960
podcast, the difference I hold today.

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay. They asked me what it takes to be

137
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,280
successful. And I made up this analogy

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
with baseball. And I said, "Imagine Sai

139
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
Young award winner CC Svathia at the

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
height of his career is in the middle of

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
Yankee Stadium and they invite everyone

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
to come hit a home run and they say you

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,720
get as many at bats as you want and

144
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,080
whoever hits the home run wins like the,

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,560
you know, billion dollars, million

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
dollars, whatever it is." And you can

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
imagine everyone flies in from all

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
around the world. People are fulfilling

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
for New York City. The line is crazy.

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
And I said, "The person who's successful

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,320
is not only the person who finally gets

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,919
up to the plate and swings and misses,

153
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
but stays at the plate." And now people

154
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
are saying, "Are you kidding me? There's

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
lines of millions of people waiting for

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
their turn and you're going to stay

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
there? You're going to stay there and

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
swing again and they swing again. And

159
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
then everyone's booing and they swing

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
again and they literally keep swinging

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
as everyone is booing them and booing

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,479
them and booing them for hours. They're

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
the most selfish person in the world.

164
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,120
You don't deserve to be here. Get off

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
that plate. This is not." And then they

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,759
finally hit that homer and everyone

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
cheers cuz oh my god they did it. And I

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,639
said that years ago and it wasn't until

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,280
recently that I realized there's one

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,600
difference in the story. I never

171
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
understood who the crowd was. I always

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
thought the crowd was being able to shut

173
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
out the outside noise. I always thought

174
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
the crowd was the naysayers and all the

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
people in your life who will tell you

176
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
you're never going to achieve anything.

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,319
And that's part of it. But the crowd,

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,639
all those people waiting in line is

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
actually you. That's what I never

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,520
realized till now. That that's the

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
difference. I always thought when people

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
asked me, "What drove you?" I thought it

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
was all the outside noise. I thought it

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
was the fear of failure, the fear of

185
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,600
letting them down, all these different

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
things. And it wasn't until recently

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,720
when I hit some hardships as an adult

188
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
and really had to look inward that I

189
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
realized everyone's got the same crowd

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
and everyone has their own issues and

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
everyone has their own stuff. And what

192
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
actually brings you to success and

193
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,919
self-worth and happiness is actually

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,039
understanding how to stand at that plate

195
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,160
and shut out the noise that's here. Not

196
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
the millions of people around. The

197
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
millions of people are in your head

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,960
screaming at you telling you you're not

199
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,800
enough. The deep deep lie from the most

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,319
confident people have it. So I'm glad I

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
get to finally publicly say the

202
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,599
difference because I've had it wrong all

203
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,240
these years.

204
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,000
And in that analogy, you talk about how

205
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
most people come up to the plate, they

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
swing once, they leave, they hear the

207
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,880
boo, they leave, they go back to their

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
sofa or wherever they're coming from,

209
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,840
some or or they swing two, three times,

210
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
everyone's telling they're selfish, and

211
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,919
they get, you know, oh my god. And

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,520
they're embarrassed and they leave. Mhm.

213
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,759
It takes a lot for someone to stand

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
there in the middle of the noise, shut

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
out the noise, and understand the

216
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,599
opportunity was given to me. I deserve

217
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,880
this. I'm going to keep swinging. Going

218
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,120
back to your early context, Scott. Yeah.

219
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,440
your dad, Irvin. Yeah. He sounds like

220
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
quite a tough guy. I was reading about

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
some of the things he was saying to you

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
when you were a kid and I was like,

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
"Dad, Jesus." Like when he called you a

224
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
liar. Yeah. That day and told you about

225
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,280
living with integrity, etc. My dad grew

226
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
up tough and it was almost like when

227
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
you're being raised by two people who

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
live through what they live through,

229
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,319
they were raising him for a world that

230
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,400
took everything away from them. They

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,360
were so loving, but they still raised

232
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,280
him that way. And then he was so loving,

233
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
but he still raised us really tough. And

234
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,879
I was the firstborn son, so I'm the

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
oldest of all our kid, all the kids. So

236
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
he was very tough on me. You're

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,960
referencing this time when I was I was

238
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,000
probably

239
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,680
14. And he uh he caught me in like a

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
white

241
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,320
lie. And usually he would punish me. And

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
his punishments could be severe, but

243
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
this time he just said, "Hey, come here.

244
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
I want to talk to you." It's not going

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,399
to be a punishment this time. I just

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
want you to know you got the gift for

247
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,519
Gab. You could talk your way out of

248
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
anything. And in life, I used to tell

249
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
you, if you lie, you're not going to be

250
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
successful. I want to tell you the

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
truth. You're so good at it. You might

252
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,200
be successful, but you're going to be a

253
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
liar. And I'll know you're a liar, and

254
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,680
you'll know you're a liar. So, do that

255
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,600
with what you want. And I was so beaten

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,160
down and ashamed because it wasn't like

257
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,920
raining down fists on me. It was just

258
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,160
like the guy I admired so much called me

259
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,680
a liar. And I walked away. I was messed

260
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,760
up. And I went back to him and I said,

261
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
"Dad, I want you to know I'm I'm not

262
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,680
going to lie. I'm going to be a man of

263
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,760
integrity. I'm Yeah, I could do that,

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,519
but I understand this opportunity what

265
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,320
you're saying." And he just looked at

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,760
me. He said, "Okay, good." And he walked

267
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,399
away. And it was one of the best lessons

268
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,680
ever, you know,

269
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,120
cuz he was right. Like you you can win

270
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,320
certain ways, but you're going to know

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
how do you how do you want to win? You

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,399
want to do it the right way. And um and

273
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,880
that that tough love, I'm appreciative

274
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,040
of it. You go to college. I went to

275
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,399
college. You went to college. Um you

276
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
started a business at college doing

277
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,560
events. Yeah. Well, I I started selling

278
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,480
fake IDs. That's what I started first.

279
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah. Yeah. I sold fake IDs cuz my

280
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
friend sold fake IDs and I thought he

281
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,800
had a bad business plan. So I was like,

282
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll market them, you make them. Um and

283
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,000
and quickly uh he broke my golden rule

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,160
of not keeping in touch with people we

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
sold to. So, I stopped immediately

286
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,160
because I didn't want to get caught. And

287
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
um I walked by a nightclub and said,

288
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,079
"How much would you give me if I brought

289
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
people here the next week?" And that was

290
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,640
the beginning of my Atlanta party

291
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
promotion days. Why did that succeed?

292
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
What is it about you as you look back in

293
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,880
hindsight, your skill set, your ability

294
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
that made your party promotion days so

295
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
successful, which eventually sort of

296
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,279
parlayed into music? But a combination

297
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,440
of things. I think one, uh I wasn't a

298
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
threat to the freshman girls. I had a

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
high school sweetheart at the time. I

300
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,360
was very committed to her. I was a

301
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
decently cute kid and I could dance.

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
Okay. So, I was a good person to go out

303
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
with and have fun. So, uh that was one

304
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
thing. Number two, I was playing sports.

305
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,000
So, I had a lot of friends in different,

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
you know, teams and different arenas.

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,079
And three, I was in the right place at

308
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,480
the right time. You know, I uh that

309
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
first party I threw was successful. And

310
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,040
at that first party, I was approached by

311
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
a guy named Jason Weaver. He's an actor

312
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,079
and he was in this old Michael Jackson

313
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
movie I used to watch as a kid where he

314
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,160
played young Michael. And he came in and

315
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
he said, "This is crazy." Cuz Atlanta at

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,880
that time was very segregated in the

317
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,240
club scene. So it was like if you were

318
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
black, you went to a party that, you

319
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
know, a club that played hip-hop and if

320
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
you were white, you went to a club they

321
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,200
played techno. But I didn't grow up in

322
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,519
the South and I wanted to listen to

323
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
hip-hop and rock and roll. And we played

324
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,000
that. And when Jason came in, he was so

325
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,839
fascinated to see a mixed crowd

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
listening to hip-hop that he was like,

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,440
"You want to see how the other half

328
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
lives?" And Jason brought me to a club

329
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
called Velvet Room on Tuesday nights in

330
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
Atlanta, Georgia. It was ran by a guy

331
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
named Alex Giddawan. Alex was so

332
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
fascinated to see me in the line. He

333
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
said, "You know, let this kid in here."

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
And Alex taught me how to promote. He

335
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
taught me what the value of the door

336
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
actually was, what I should be getting

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,920
from the bar. And I would start moving

338
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
my parties. And I would spend all my

339
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,200
money that I made on Thursday nights at

340
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,839
the college party on Alex's Tuesday

341
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,240
night meeting people, meeting rappers,

342
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
meeting singers, meeting different

343
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,760
people, faking it till I make it and

344
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,040
getting people to come back and forth

345
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
between my parties. And that's how I

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
started. That's how I met Germaine.

347
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,279
That's how I met Luda. That's we all

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
kind of came up together.

349
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,920
Relationships. Why did he give you a

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
foot up? So many people are early in

351
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
their careers and they're having these

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
chance encounters, but those those

353
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
aren't converting into a relationship.

354
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
And when I look at your life, there's

355
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
people you meet along the way who end up

356
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
being really, really pivotal. And it

357
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,519
appears to me as an objective observer

358
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,959
that you have an ability to form good

359
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,519
relationships, loyal, lasting

360
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,720
relationships with

361
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,360
people. One, I think it's important to

362
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,959
pay people respect. You know, I came

363
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,160
from a household where you respect your

364
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,519
elders. And when I was coming up, I was

365
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,279
19. So, I was very respectful of the

366
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
people that giving me an opportunity.

367
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,320
And I never forgot who helped me along

368
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,519
the way. I think the other thing that

369
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,959
was a big part of my philosophy was let

370
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
your work be the reason they want to

371
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,000
meet you. I didn't want to be that kid

372
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
who was going, "Hey, give me an

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,440
opportunity." And by the way, sometimes

374
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
that works. But I wanted them to see

375
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,720
what I was doing and then say, "Come

376
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,760
over here." I didn't approach Germaine

377
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,839
Dri to work at So Deaf. Germaine heard

378
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
about me in my parties and he met me and

379
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,240
he said, "You have more potential than

380
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
parties. Why don't you come work for

381
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,720
me?" I didn't approach, you know,

382
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
Ludicrous who was coming up as a rapper

383
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
and say, "Let me do that." I didn't a

384
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
lot of people in my life. I I never

385
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,639
really approached them. And then even as

386
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,920
my life changed and I got older, I made

387
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
a lot of relationships and I have a lot

388
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,560
of relationships now that I've never

389
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,800
done business with. And people go,

390
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
"Well, you have that. Why don't you?"

391
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,760
And it was because I never wanted anyone

392
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
to

393
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,639
feel probably my insecurities. I never

394
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,800
wanted anyone to feel like I needed

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,720
them. I never wanted to feel like a

396
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,959
user. It was like my own insecurities of

397
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,000
how they might see me. Mhm. But I think

398
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,920
on top of that, I

399
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,160
just it was that same old thing of never

400
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,000
wanting to be in a position where you're

401
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,279
begging somebody for something. I called

402
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,399
Jermaine and we spoke to him and I

403
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
listened to the recording again just

404
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,480
before you arrived. But what Jermaine

405
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,240
said in that voice recording is also

406
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,399
pretty similar to what your dad said,

407
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
which is they both saw something in you.

408
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
You're this young kid who doesn't have

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,880
an extensive track record of decades of

410
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,680
work, but they're all betting on you in

411
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
some way. As you look back on your life,

412
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,199
what were they betting on? Cuz they all

413
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,160
seem pretty sure that you had something.

414
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,720
My ignorance. Ignorance. I think I think

415
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,440
uh I No one told me I shouldn't be

416
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
there.

417
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
And he offered you a job for working at

418
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
his company which meant you had to drop

419
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,760
out of college. I didn't have to drop

420
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,680
out of college. I did because um I went

421
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
to work for Germaine and now I'm

422
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,399
traveling all the time. I'm still

423
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
throwing parties, you know, we're

424
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
gearing up for Usher's album. We're

425
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
doing this, we're doing that. I'm

426
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,320
working with the Young Bloodoods,

427
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,440
Anthony Hamilton. Like it's and I'm 19,

428
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,519
20 years old. And my grade point average

429
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,079
went from a 3 point something to a 1

430
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,320
point something. And they brought me in

431
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,279
on academic probation. And they said,

432
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,839
um, you know, what's going on with you?

433
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
Is there a drug problem? Are you being

434
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,720
abused? And I said, "No, no, no, no. I'm

435
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
an entrepreneur. I'm building this. I

436
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,120
want to build a record label. I'm

437
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
working for Jermaine Dupria." You know,

438
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,040
and this guy's looking at me like I'm

439
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,360
insane. And he's, this dean looks at me

440
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,680
at Emery and he says, "Uh, do you know

441
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
the story of Robert Woodruff?" And I

442
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
said, "You know Robert Woodruff?" He

443
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
goes, "Yeah, the founder of Coca-Cola,

444
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
the Woodruff Center, the largest

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,880
endowment in Emery." and he tells me

446
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,920
this amazing story of this entrepreneur

447
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,000
who created Coca-Cola who is the largest

448
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,560
endowment at our university. And I'm so

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,800
hyped. I'm like, "This guy gets me. He

450
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
gets me. He's going to help me. I'm

451
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
going to be at the school." And just

452
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,120
when my hopes are really high, he looks

453
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
at me, he goes, "You know what we're

454
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
going to do, right? Cuz we're going to

455
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
stop all the nonsense. You're going to

456
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
focus on school. You're going to get a

457
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,560
degree because the chance of you being

458
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,120
like Robert Woodruff without an Emory

459
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
degree is like one in a billion."

460
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
And the moment he said it, that's when I

461
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
dropped out of school. What did your

462
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
father say? Before you ask me about my

463
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,959
father, I want to ask you a question.

464
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,440
Okay. You made a face and you paused.

465
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah. Because you have your own story of

466
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
something happening like this. I just

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
have a a bias. I just have a real hate

468
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,279
for dream busters. Yet, every great

469
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,440
story we have of success, people tell of

470
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,079
that pivotal moment, whether it be this

471
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,839
dean or Michael Jordan being cut by his

472
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,240
coach, the varsity coach when he was

473
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,399
younger. Yeah. We all talk about the

474
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,120
dream buster as a catalyst to our

475
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,560
success. And you know, in life, I've I

476
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
kind of feel like everything even, you

477
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,480
know, it's like I have this tattoo amor

478
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,880
fati, you know, from Marcus Aurelius.

479
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,880
It's the a concept love of one's fate in

480
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,279
Latin. And it's this concept that you

481
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
have to love the sorrow as much as you

482
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,560
love the joy. You have to love the pain

483
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
as much as you love the success. You

484
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,680
know, it's if it wasn't for that, Dean,

485
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,120
I wouldn't have had that chip on my

486
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,399
shoulder in that moment. I would just

487
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
push you on the fact that like you hate

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,160
these dream busters, but I am so

489
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,720
grateful for them. I'm I'm grateful for

490
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,680
the dream busters. However, and this is

491
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,240
actually something I was talking to my

492
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,079
friends about in our group chat this

493
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,760
morning. Is it okay in your view to be

494
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,280
driven by haters?

495
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,079
It's so funny because if you're only

496
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,959
driven by haters, no. But I think that

497
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,559
everything plays its role at the time.

498
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,640
Like um Robert Green Mhm. he talks about

499
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,079
this idea of embracing your dark side.

500
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,559
And I think that there's truth in that.

501
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
Like you know, if if you continue to

502
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,400
fight something that's naturally inside

503
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
of you, you're going to really struggle

504
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
with it. If you can accept that's part

505
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,760
of you can use it as fuel and you can

506
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,840
move right through it. So yes, there are

507
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,480
things that drive me. My curiosity is a

508
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,080
big driver for for where I go. My

509
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
children now are a big driver for where

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,559
I go and how I live my life. The people

511
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,160
I love, the joy that I find, the

512
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,400
introspective voice that now I can go to

513
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,120
when I'm meditating or, you know,

514
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
working you on

515
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,080
myself, but doubt from someone who

516
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,799
dislikes me or doubt from a hater. I can

517
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
pretend like I'm zen as much as I want.

518
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,520
But if I'm being really honest with

519
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,559
myself sometimes that's the fuel that I

520
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,760
need. So I think if it's if it's solely

521
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,080
one thing it's not healthy. But I think

522
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
if you can admit you get fuel and

523
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
different influences from different

524
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
places and don't try and be ashamed of

525
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,600
the one that doesn't fit in your

526
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,760
narrative of how evolved you are. Yeah.

527
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,559
You know then it's okay.

528
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,280
You established SB Projects I believe

529
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,440
after leaving Germaine when you were 24

530
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,679
25 years old. 24. And I read that you'd

531
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
kind of have had this plan to sign three

532
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,480
different types of acts. Yeah. First one

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,760
Asher Roth who's a very famous rapper.

534
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Yeah. I wanted to sign three types of

535
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
acts and Asher fit the mold for one,

536
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
Justin for the other, and the other one

537
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,000
I never found. So Asher, for people that

538
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,679
don't know, is a very successful rapper.

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,799
Um, what was the mold you were trying to

540
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,600
fit? Eminem was a very big rappers, one

541
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,120
of the biggest rappers of all time. And

542
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,400
I was in college and I'm watching all

543
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,480
like these at the time these frat guys,

544
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,559
but they loved hip-hop. And I don't

545
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
think they had anyone who spoke to their

546
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,679
life. So I wanted a kid who could speak

547
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
to college life who had the skills to be

548
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,160
credible within the world of hip-hop.

549
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Why did you think you could find talent?

550
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
What did you believe? Ignorance.

551
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,440
Ignorance. Okay. I'm telling you, every

552
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,799
aspect of my life, if we talked about

553
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,160
every little thing that I've been in,

554
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
you said earlier, I've been in all these

555
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
different things and probably your

556
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,760
listeners have no idea what the hell I

557
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,039
am. So, they're like, what is he talking

558
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,360
about? But every time I put myself in

559
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,760
that next

560
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,240
arena, it's this why not me. I had no

561
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
right contacting Asher on MySpace. I

562
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,520
mean, at that point, I could say, okay,

563
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
I came from so deaf. I was the youngest

564
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,120
vice president music because of Germaine

565
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,720
when I was at SOFE. I was 20 years old.

566
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,160
So, I had the right, you know, some

567
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,880
credibility other people didn't have. I

568
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,960
definitely could do that. But to tell

569
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,640
him to drop out of college and move down

570
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,440
to Atlanta, Georgia for be the first

571
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
artist on my record label to, you know,

572
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,960
find Justin in Canada and convince his

573
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,799
mom and him to be on the first plane

574
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,919
they had ever been on to come down to

575
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,600
Atlanta and meet me. I mean, it it was I

576
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,520
was 25 years old, 24 years old. Like,

577
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,960
these are I was insane. Like, you know,

578
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,360
so interesting. When we talk about

579
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,520
belief, we we ask if you know Scooter,

580
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,280
did you have belief? But in your case,

581
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,039
you had the lack of limiting beliefs,

582
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,440
which shows up the same as having there

583
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,840
was just like nothing. It wasn't even

584
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,320
because I was so driven by also the fear

585
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,679
that I wouldn't be enough. That back

586
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,679
then I would have lied. I would have

587
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,039
said, "Oh, I had such a deep belief in

588
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,880
my in my conviction that I could do

589
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:39,280
it." It was partially that, but it was

590
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,280
also why not me? and no one told me I

591
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,880
can't be here. And also now that I'm

592
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,600
here, I can't fail because then everyone

593
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,799
will see that I shouldn't be here. And

594
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,679
so it was this this fear, excitement,

595
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,200
fear, excitement, conviction. That's why

596
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
I always tell people when I meet them as

597
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,120
young people, I'm like, "You don't have

598
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
kids. You can starve a little bit. Your

599
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
parents want you to go the easiest route

600
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,679
because they don't want to see you

601
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,000
suffer, but now is the time when you

602
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,480
should be suffering. If you want to go

603
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,520
for it, now's the time when you don't

604
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,120
have anyone to support where you can

605
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,760
really really go for it because later on

606
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,039
in life, you got to think about other

607
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:21,919
people. And back then, 19 years old to

608
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:25,120
24, I'm Let's go for it.

609
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,760
And the second artist that you signed,

610
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,240
it's called Justin Bieber. Who's Justin

611
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,799
Bieber? Justin Bieber. You were 26 years

612
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,760
old when you came across Justin. 25. 25.

613
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:42,240
And he was 12. 13. 13. Damn.

614
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,960
You discovered Justin by watching a a

615
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,960
Soick video by Yeah. Well, I saw a bunch

616
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
of videos from his church his mom had

617
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,360
posted and the one that moved me the

618
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
most was So Sick by

619
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,869
[Music]

620
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,920
[Music]

621
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,080
Neil and

622
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,120
I

623
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,840
sense you walked out the door. It's the

624
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,480
only way I hear your voice anymore. You

625
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,320
must have been asked this a gazillion

626
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,679
times, but the the actions you then took

627
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,679
based on seeing a kid on on a video are

628
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,679
bizarre.

629
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,880
Yeah, they are bizarre. Yeah, I like

630
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,039
Googled uh the background of of the

631
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,000
church to look up the businesses and

632
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,480
then called the regions of Canada school

633
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
boards to figure out where he was cuz

634
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,640
his mom had a different name than him

635
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
cuz her name was Mlette, his was Bieber.

636
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480
So, I went a little crazy to find him

637
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
within 24 hours. Once I saw him, I kind

638
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
of knew in person or No, I knew when I

639
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,120
saw online, I was like, "This is the kid

640
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I've been looking for." And I I felt the

641
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,240
same way about Asher. I mean, I

642
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,520
relentlessly kind of pursued both of

643
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,360
them. I had a clear vision to like what

644
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,600
I could do and what he was capable of.

645
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,679
And it was funny cuz no one believed me.

646
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
I mean, even after we met and we did the

647
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
deal and we started working together,

648
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,320
literally no one believed me. And

649
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,440
YouTube was not a big thing back then.

650
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,120
So when I took him from 60,000 views and

651
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,039
we took him to like 60 million, now he's

652
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
like one of the biggest YouTubers in the

653
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,679
world and everyone's like, "Yeah,

654
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
youtubers don't turn into musicians,

655
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
though." What were the first principles

656
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,039
that you saw in him? Like what were the

657
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,640
Cuz I when I think about having those

658
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,640
moments where my intuition just says yes

659
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,840
to something. Tone. Okay.

660
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,360
Charisma. Um it was

661
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,679
like he had incredible tone and he had

662
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,720
soul and he had charisma. He was doing

663
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
like there was one where there was an

664
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
instrumental and he was like jumping

665
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,880
around and I just believed in him

666
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,039
instantly and then when I met him he had

667
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,120
even more charisma. He was funny and I

668
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,919
was like all right this kid let's go.

669
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,280
And he was an athlete so he was

670
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,200
competitive. He was a very special

671
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,400
special talent and very unique

672
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,600
individual and uh those were special

673
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
times. And you flew in to meet him and

674
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,039
his mother? No, they flew to me. Oh,

675
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,280
okay. I talked to her for like an hour

676
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,840
and a half that night and uh first plane

677
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,520
ride they ever went on and I remember he

678
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,080
was so excited that there was a fridge

679
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,240
inside his hotel room.

680
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
His mother

681
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,520
said, "Speaking of you, Scooter really

682
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,200
believed in Justin from day one. He put

683
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,200
everything on the line for

684
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,559
us." And and they put it on the line for

685
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:33,279
me, too. You know, they believed in a

686
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:37,120
25year-old kid. and uh we were able to

687
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,279
achieve some amazing things and I'm very

688
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,159
proud of what we achieved and always

689
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,720
rooting for him.

690
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,240
How's your relationship with Justin now?

691
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,919
Um not the same that it was. I think you

692
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
know these things go eb and flows. I

693
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,679
think there comes a point where I

694
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,159
understand he probably wants to go on

695
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,640
and and show that he can do it. I mean,

696
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,200
we we worked together for so long and we

697
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
had such extreme

698
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,360
success and I think you get to a point

699
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,320
as a as a man where you want to show the

700
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,200
world you can do it on your own and uh I

701
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,440
completely respect that and I think at

702
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,520
this point that's what he's doing and

703
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,760
myself and and everyone from the old

704
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,919
team is rooting for him. But I stopped

705
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,279
managing two and a half years ago and

706
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,600
now I'm I'm a cheerleader from the side

707
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,640
and you know I I want everyone that I

708
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
worked with to do well. I think

709
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
sometimes when you walk away from

710
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,360
management I've heard managers which I

711
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,880
never understood they'd be like deep

712
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
down when behind closed doors they don't

713
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,760
want to see them do as well without them

714
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,159
is almost like you know them succeeding

715
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,159
is is tarnishing your legacy. Mhm.

716
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,640
Every artist that I worked with, I

717
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,159
believed in them because they were

718
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,320
great. And if they continue to be

719
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:00,559
great, I think that's the best testimony

720
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,559
to that belief. So to see Justin move

721
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,080
forward and succeed, to see Ariana, you

722
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,279
know, with what's happened with Wicked

723
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,279
in this past year, um to see Tori Kelly,

724
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,600
you know, to see everybody that I've

725
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,200
ever had a chance to work with, to see

726
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,039
them go on and do great things on their

727
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,480
own, it's awesome.

728
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,679
Is there anything that these individuals

729
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,000
have in common at all? These people that

730
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,400
pain. Pain. Yeah, I think it's pain.

731
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,880
Personally, I think

732
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,720
um to be able to convey emotions on the

733
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,919
level that it touches people around the

734
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,400
world, you have to understand emotions.

735
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,559
And I think um I think great

736
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,799
artists, great performers are able to

737
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,480
draw from different places. And

738
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,799
sometimes it's joy and sometimes it's

739
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,679
pain. Um and sometimes it's just a

740
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,240
natural god-given gift.

741
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,480
How important is hard work? Oh, it's

742
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,120
very important. I think especially in

743
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,039
the beginning. In the beginning, you're

744
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,039
stepping into a pool where everyone

745
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,159
talented wants to be seen and you have

746
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,679
to work incredibly

747
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,559
hard to break out of the noise. So, and

748
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
by the way, I don't think that's

749
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,159
particular to artists or music or film

750
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,720
or TV or anything I've done with

751
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,279
entertainment. I think that's every

752
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,600
business I've ever been a part of. The

753
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,320
first three to five years of any

754
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,760
business I've ever built in any arena or

755
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,520
worked with anyone who's ever achieved

756
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,760
anything great, those first three to

757
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,799
five years are the most important.

758
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,730
Sounds like something I said to my

759
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,840
girlfriend.

760
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,000
[Music]

761
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
Um, it sounds like, you know, same thing

762
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
with relationship. Maybe put in the

763
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,799
foundation those first three to five

764
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,600
years and really be there together. I I

765
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,799
really believe that. I

766
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,159
think you put in that time in the

767
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,840
beginning and you can break through the

768
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,240
noise and set a foundation for

769
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,679
everything else.

770
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
When I think about Justin's career, he

771
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,679
he had a a wobble um where he was

772
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,919
involved in lots of sort

773
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,600
of uh you know, it looked like he was

774
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,919
going through a bit of difficulty. And I

775
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,240
reflect on one of my friends, Liam

776
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,200
Payne, and who was on this podcast and

777
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,120
who's sadly passed away now, but he also

778
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,960
around the same age was thrown into the

779
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,200
public eye at a very young age. He

780
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
joined One Direction, went on the crazy

781
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,039
crazy wild roller coaster ride that is

782
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
One Direction. And he admitted on the

783
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,919
podcast that he struggled, he struggled

784
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,679
with addiction. He struggled with lots

785
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,559
of pain that he was dealing with. And

786
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
his story has is a an inspiring one

787
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,080
ultimately, but also a tragic one in

788
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,919
many

789
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:41,399
respects. Why does this happen to so

790
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,399
many young artists, childhood stars?

791
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,880
You know, when you ask me this

792
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,640
question, at this age, I feel a lot of

793
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,840
guilt. Um, I feel a lot of guilt because

794
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,159
I worked with so many young artists and

795
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,960
like I told you, I hadn't taken the time

796
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,520
to look at myself or

797
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,120
um do the therapy myself until I was

798
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,880
older.

799
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,399
So I didn't understand at 25 years old,

800
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,000
at 27 years old, at 30 years

801
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,840
old

802
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,559
that they each were coming from very

803
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,240
unique backgrounds of their own stuff

804
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,120
with their own families and their own

805
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,600
childhoods and growing up this way and

806
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,039
being seen by the whole world and being

807
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,279
judged by the whole world at a very

808
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,360
young age. And I think it's two things.

809
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,640
I think one, human beings are not made

810
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,120
to be worshiped. I think we're made to

811
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,600
serve. And I think that when we worship

812
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,600
human beings, it changes something

813
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,840
within us. It it messes us up a little

814
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,679
bit because that's not what we're built

815
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,399
for. And I think that can be very

816
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,480
confusing. And I think being able to

817
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,320
transcend the childhood of, you know,

818
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,360
people cheering your name and and

819
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
everything else at that level and get to

820
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,799
the place where the artists I've worked

821
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,399
with are where they are in healthy

822
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,159
relationships and and with their

823
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,679
families and and still working through

824
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,039
stuff, but like having a human

825
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,200
experience, I think it's a testament to

826
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,039
their strength. So, I think that's part

827
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
of it. I just think the nature of of

828
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,760
being on that stage, you know, that

829
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,279
young and people chanting your name and

830
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,080
I didn't realize that till, you know, I

831
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,480
got older. The other side of it is I

832
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,240
never understood even without me. I

833
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,000
didn't have that childhood yet. I

834
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,080
broke. And what I think also is

835
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,520
important is um I don't think we

836
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,120
can push everything. I think adversity

837
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,720
is important. We can't just talk about

838
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,200
mental health and say adversity

839
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,559
shouldn't exist. But I do think I

840
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,480
understand the importance now

841
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,640
of of really putting in the time to make

842
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,399
sure mental health is addressed and that

843
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,279
we have an outlet to speak to someone

844
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,320
outside of the crew. Um, and there's a

845
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,760
lot of things that I learned within

846
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,200
myself that I wish I knew back

847
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,520
then. I met those One Direction kids

848
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,600
when they started. They came to LA and

849
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,440
actually the whole group cuz Nyall

850
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,640
reached out to me. They came to my house

851
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,000
to hang out in the backyard when they

852
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,279
were first starting before they really

853
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,080
blew up, like their first US visit to

854
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:15,840
LA. And I met Liam back

855
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,640
then. And I met the excited young kid

856
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,159
with the with the

857
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,559
voice. Yet each one of them has had a

858
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,840
different experience. Each one of them

859
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,960
has had a

860
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,120
different story of perseverance and

861
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,600
tragedy. Um, and that's the thing. It's

862
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,399
like with kids like you just never know

863
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,840
what the cocktail is going to make of

864
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:42,640
life. Um, and I

865
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,880
think I think you know that idea of

866
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,679
we're not made to be woripped. That can

867
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,200
play funny things on the mind.

868
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,519
The brain isn't even developed until

869
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,480
you're 25, they tell me. So I don't even

870
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,600
know if mine's developed at 43. But I've

871
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,039
sat here with so many neuroscientists

872
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
that have said that to me and it and

873
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,880
also addiction scientists that say the

874
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,480
brain is still learning and building it

875
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
sort of like dopamine receptors and

876
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,240
stuff. So Liam was telling me that he he

877
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,399
was up on stage in front of 100 odd

878
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,919
thousand people in

879
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:11,360
Dubai. Huge adrenaline rush, huge surge

880
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,799
of dopamine. Then they drive him back to

881
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,159
his hotel and he was like they lock the

882
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,320
door and it's just me in there with the

883
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,840
mini bar and then the the next day it's

884
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
the exact same thing. Stage, car, hotel

885
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,519
and without the stage you were looking

886
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,480
for that dopamine hit. Yeah. No, it's

887
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,519
it's

888
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,200
uh like I said, it's I'm very proud

889
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,120
of the job that we did and how much we

890
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,240
cared and how much the team cared for

891
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,600
all the years that we did

892
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,679
it. But it doesn't mean I don't look

893
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,360
back and wish that I knew what I know

894
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,360
now. How would you have been different?

895
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,080
I think I would have had a therapist on

896
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,360
the road for all of us.

897
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,480
like you know I think that's the biggest

898
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,000
difference. I think I would have slowed

899
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,640
down all of us. I think I made would

900
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,159
have made every single one of us stop

901
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,120
and do that hour, you know, because we

902
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,080
were all kids and we were all moving so

903
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,399
fast and we all wanted to succeed so bad

904
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
and we all

905
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:14,080
wanted the excitement and we wanted to

906
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,519
make kids dreams come true and bring

907
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,760
them down from the upper decks to put

908
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,840
them in the front row and, you know, to

909
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,240
help Justin get that number one and, you

910
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
know, to help Ariana do this and we all

911
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
wanted it and we we're excited and we

912
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,919
were doing something that was so unique

913
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,919
and everyone in the world was so excited

914
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,519
for us, you know, oh my gosh, you guys

915
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,120
are a part of this. This is so

916
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,519
cool. I didn't

917
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,880
know I didn't know to go inward for the

918
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,440
dopamine

919
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,519
hit. And I wish I would have known that

920
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,120
and been able to share it back then.

921
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,880
when Justin ultimately said that he

922
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,240
wanted to kind of go it alone and do it

923
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,200
himself. Does that hurt? No, not at that

924
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,080
point I think I was also at that point,

925
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,519
you know, at at that point it had been a

926
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,559
couple years where I knew I wanted to do

927
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,520
something else and I I wanted to find

928
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,599
out who I was. I wanted to experiment

929
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,040
with, you know, a different career and

930
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,320
we were both communicating enough with

931
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,440
each other. Everyone the writing was on

932
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,280
the wall. How many clients Oh god, that

933
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,480
we would know a lot. Cuz when I was

934
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,839
doing my research, I was like, "No,

935
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,320
surely not." Karly Ray Jeepson and then

936
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,079
um Martin

937
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,960
Garrick's Kanye.

938
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,639
Yeah. Can you give me the top 10 off the

939
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
top of your head that you worked? I

940
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
would never say a top 10. A good manager

941
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,760
knows how to do that, but I got I got to

942
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,119
work with a lot of incredible artists a

943
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,240
long time. I mean, from Zack Brown band

944
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,079
to Black IPs to Justin to Ariana to, you

945
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,079
know, Martin Garrick's we signed um

946
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,919
while he was at Club Med with his

947
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,599
parents. We contacted him because he had

948
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,000
the song Animals and we heard it. Um to

949
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,400
Dan and Sheay to I mean just to so many

950
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,520
over the years. It was pretty incredible

951
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,079
to be a part and so close to so many

952
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,400
incredible stories, you know, and to

953
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,800
see, you know, going to a coffee shop to

954
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,440
see Tory Kelly sing to seeing her walk

955
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,240
on a Grammy stage. It just I got to see

956
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,599
really incredible moments in people's

957
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,320
lives to you know Demi telling me I want

958
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,680
to sing the national anthem at the Super

959
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,520
Bowl you know and showing me a tweet

960
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,480
that she wrote this years ago to seeing

961
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,200
her actually perform you know you know

962
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,320
uh at the Super Bowl you know so

963
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,760
it's it's just been a really cool

964
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
experience but I got to see it in so

965
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
many different arenas and and you're

966
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,800
only there for a flash right you have

967
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,320
this little tiny small moment here a

968
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,920
little tiny small moment

969
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,680
But to get to witness so many different

970
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,359
rides, it's a really cool thing. And I

971
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,760
remember as a kid, I heard this great

972
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,920
saying, don't just read stories, try to

973
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
be a part of them. Try to be a story.

974
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,839
And I think I've always tried to take

975
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,440
that into my life. Crazy. Crazy. Why? I

976
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,520
was I was there was a second ago when

977
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,599
you were talking and I was just I

978
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,920
stepped into your body for a second and

979
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,640
I ran the highlight reel of your life

980
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,560
just as Justin's um sort of manager and

981
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,400
I was thinking God like the places you

982
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,040
must have been and the things you must

983
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
have seen just as his manager let alone

984
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,400
working with all of these other great

985
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,680
artists. It's not just a lifetime of

986
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,599
experience. It's multiple

987
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,560
lifetimes of fortune to get to even see

988
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,240
those things. I met a guy years ago and

989
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,240
um I'll name drop here. So I I got

990
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,880
invited to meet Charlie Munger. Oh yeah.

991
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,359
The investor. Yeah. And everyone was

992
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,520
asking him questions about business and

993
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,599
I asked him a question about life. And

994
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,640
afterwards his guy contacted me. He

995
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,160
goes, "Charlie liked your question. He

996
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,440
wants you to meet this other guy that he

997
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,280
really likes who's a brilliant

998
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
businessman. And I meet this other

999
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,960
gentleman and he tells me he's a

1000
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,359
statistician by trade. And the reason

1001
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,200
he's excited to meet me is cuz people in

1002
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,320
my world who are part of so many

1003
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,440
different stories live in dog

1004
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,839
ears because they get to be a part of

1005
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,280
kind of so many other people's things.

1006
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,839
Yeah. Um but it's uh it's a unique

1007
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
thing. But I told you

1008
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,760
it the biggest lesson I learned from all

1009
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,079
of

1010
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,359
it is that at one point in my life I

1011
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,160
received so much praise and then the

1012
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,000
next

1013
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,800
moment without me expecting it I

1014
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,320
received so much

1015
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,599
hate.

1016
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,680
And on the other side of all these

1017
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,760
experiences I've come to learn that both

1018
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,520
were not deserved.

1019
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,240
The people who were praising me did not

1020
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,079
know me and the people who hated me did

1021
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,640
not know me. And it's like one of my

1022
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,240
favorite uh I saw Tom Hanks say this on

1023
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,000
like an actor's table one time. He goes,

1024
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,520
"This too shall pass." You remember

1025
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,200
that? Yeah. Yeah. It's so great. He's

1026
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,880
like, "You think you're killing it? This

1027
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,240
too shall pass." He's like, "You think

1028
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
it's going to be hard? This too shall

1029
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,160
pass." Like it's true. So what do you

1030
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,560
anchor in then if so much is transient

1031
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
at this point in life generally? What

1032
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,680
what does one anchor in? If everything

1033
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,040
is transient, if you know this two, you

1034
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,760
don't have kids yet. I have a major

1035
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,160
anchor and three kids. Major anchor.

1036
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,599
What if you don't have kids? If you

1037
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
don't have kids, that's when you should

1038
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,359
definitely do the selfwork cuz your

1039
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,680
anchor's you. And and the truth is I've

1040
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,400
really gotten to a beautiful place of I

1041
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,640
fully expect to be misunderstood in the

1042
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,200
future. I expect tomorrow something can

1043
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,839
happen where especially because my life

1044
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,359
has been somewhat in the public eye. You

1045
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,520
get misunderstood all the time. People

1046
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,040
make up stories. They twist things.

1047
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,880
Someone's hurt. It comes out this way,

1048
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,160
that way. I could get pulled into this

1049
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,839
stuff. It's happened to me already. And

1050
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,839
so, I've come to terms with that. What

1051
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,839
I've realized is being on the other side

1052
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,960
of it already happening to me. All it

1053
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,079
does is end up making room for something

1054
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,160
else. So, for me, what anchors me

1055
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,839
is I no longer think I'm in control, but

1056
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,720
I think I'm participating in one hell of

1057
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,079
a game. I can't control the outcome. I'm

1058
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,520
Steph Curry and LeBron could be at the

1059
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,280
height of their game, but even they

1060
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,480
can't control the game. they can

1061
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,320
influence it. And so that for me it was

1062
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,000
like the first half of my life was I'm

1063
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,760
manifesting. I'm manifesting. I'm doing

1064
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,440
this that youthful energy. And then you

1065
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
turn 40 and this stuff happens and you

1066
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,920
start the other half of your life.

1067
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
You're like, you know, Michael Singer, I

1068
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,720
need to surrender. You know, you had

1069
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,320
their surrender experiment, you know,

1070
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,320
like everything surrender. And then I

1071
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,640
realized there's a balance. There's this

1072
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,800
balance

1073
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,359
of I'm participating in an incredible

1074
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,480
game and I can bring what I bring to the

1075
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,800
table and I'm not going to be able to

1076
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,960
control this game, but maybe I should

1077
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,200
start enjoying the game a little bit.

1078
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm out here. I'm participating. That's

1079
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,320
pretty freaking cool. And I

1080
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,599
think that is what anchors me at this

1081
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,960
point that I have no idea what the next

1082
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,280
5 to 10 years of my life are going to

1083
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,720
look like. I used to think I did. Now I

1084
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,400
know it can change like that. And I

1085
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,680
think I'm excited for love in the

1086
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,119
future. I'm excited for adventure. I'm

1087
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,040
not looking forward to the pain, but I

1088
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,560
know if it comes, there's a reason for

1089
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,920
it.

1090
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,040
So, tell me about a an artist that you

1091
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,400
believed in. You don't have to name

1092
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
them, of course, but an artist you

1093
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,119
believed in you were wrong about

1094
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,160
something you really just your first

1095
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,160
principles were off. And in hindsight, I

1096
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,880
had an

1097
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,480
artist who

1098
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,960
was honestly maybe the most talented

1099
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,400
artist I ever signed. His name was

1100
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,880
Spencer Lee.

1101
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,240
And Spencer Lee got brought to me by a

1102
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,000
buddy of mine named Freddy. Uh, and we

1103
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,359
did a deal for Spencer and Dave

1104
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Appleton, who I told you about, my buddy

1105
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,320
was trying to handle in management. And

1106
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,079
Dave started calling me saying, "Hey,

1107
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,880
there's some real addiction issues here

1108
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,200
and we're really struggling." And we put

1109
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,800
him into rehab. And then he wrote one of

1110
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,280
the most incredible songs, River

1111
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,280
Water. River

1112
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,079
Water. Send away my worries, please.

1113
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,269
[Music]

1114
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:14,200
River, take me

1115
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:21,880
down. Show me the dreams that I never

1116
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:26,000
[Music]

1117
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,280
found about addiction. And when he got

1118
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,720
out, we thought, okay, he's going to be

1119
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,079
clean and everything great. We made this

1120
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
video and we started getting going. We

1121
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,240
made the Spencer Lee Band and we started

1122
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,480
putting him out there like paying for

1123
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,839
everything to kind of get it going and

1124
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,880
he started doing festivals and we

1125
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,040
started getting phone calls of like,

1126
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,440
hey, people are coming to see this

1127
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,319
insane talent with this voice

1128
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:54,079
and he went uh back to drugs and

1129
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:56,880
um he overdosed last year and uh he's no

1130
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,960
longer with us. And we got the news cuz

1131
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,800
his grandmother, who's the sweetest, she

1132
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,640
called to say thank you for trying and

1133
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,920
everything else. And that was the love

1134
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:10,119
of her life and she lost him. And

1135
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,359
um that one I got wrong

1136
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,800
because I thought, you know, maybe if we

1137
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,640
get the records right, if we get the

1138
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,240
music, if he gets on the road, you know,

1139
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,000
he gets out of rehab, like, you know,

1140
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,119
this would be enough. It's one of the

1141
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,480
biggest tragedies cuz I I can't tell you

1142
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,640
how good he was. I mean, he just a

1143
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,160
special special talent. You listen to

1144
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,280
this guy's records. Sometimes I always

1145
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,880
say I want to like reach out to his

1146
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,440
family and be like, let's just release

1147
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,920
the records like the ones that I have

1148
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,240
that the world's never

1149
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,720
heard and I, you know, I all the money

1150
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,920
should go to, you know, a cause, you

1151
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,440
know, to help people in a similar

1152
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,160
situation. I wish we could do that. I'd

1153
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,599
love to get permission to do that. Um

1154
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,680
cuz he was one of the most special

1155
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,760
talents I ever came across. They don't

1156
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,160
want to release the records.

1157
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,160
It's complicated.

1158
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,720
Last week I was in New York interviewing

1159
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,000
one of the world's leading addiction

1160
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,319
experts. And if for anyone that hasn't

1161
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,160
been through addiction, it's a very

1162
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,880
confusing thing to observe. Because as

1163
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,800
an onlooker, you just go just stop that.

1164
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,680
You're self-destructing. But if you've

1165
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
had friends that have dealt with

1166
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,880
addiction, you realize that it's not an

1167
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,119
attempt to self-destruct. It's like an

1168
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,480
attempt to

1169
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah. Yeah, it's like it's maybe the

1170
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,800
last attempt to do the opposite to

1171
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,480
survive to survive from something. When

1172
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,400
I was dealing with addiction with

1173
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,119
someone I managed, um someone I really

1174
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,359
respect told me about Alenon, uh Alanon

1175
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,000
is for a support. It's like AA but for

1176
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,079
the families and they recommend I go and

1177
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,839
I went to two Alanon meetings and it was

1178
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,319
very helpful at the time and one of the

1179
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,119
things I learned there was one this

1180
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,880
concept of it is not your fault. you

1181
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,240
this is not about you that you have to

1182
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,839
love them where they're at. You can you

1183
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,319
know but the biggest thing I really

1184
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,480
learned was be a rock you know like this

1185
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,800
person said to

1186
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,079
me home doesn't move around home is a

1187
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,800
constant place that someone can come

1188
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,119
back to. If someone beats addiction it

1189
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,040
is because of them. You know they've

1190
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,200
made that choice and they deserve the

1191
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,640
credit. But if you want to be helpful

1192
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,240
this person said just try to be a

1193
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,319
constant place. They know that no matter

1194
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,920
what at the end they can come back and

1195
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,119
they and you'll be waiting.

1196
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,400
Understanding your story, you stuck

1197
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
around with Justin when he went through

1198
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,119
his his difficult times and people were

1199
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,200
calling for you to drop him and

1200
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,119
to maybe move on. Yeah, I think it was

1201
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,560
an interesting time. But like I said, if

1202
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,079
someone beats that, they deserve the

1203
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,800
credit. So I don't I don't deserve any

1204
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,480
credit in that. He does. You ended up

1205
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,400
posting that post on your Instagram

1206
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,079
which sent a ton of headlines around the

1207
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,079
world saying that you were quitting

1208
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,599
music management. 23 years after 23

1209
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,079
years. There was a little bit of a

1210
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,880
question mark though because I think you

1211
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,079
referenced in something you'd posted

1212
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,960
that part of your inspiration or a

1213
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,560
catalyst was a particular

1214
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,599
artist had decided that they wanted to

1215
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,040
go their own way. Yeah. Who was that? I

1216
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,160
prefer not to say like there's a bunch

1217
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,880
of legal stuff around that everything

1218
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,280
else but uh she

1219
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,880
uh she informed me and I respected the

1220
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,280
hell out of it that she was she felt

1221
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,560
that way and uh but I had had that

1222
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,079
conversation with others too and and

1223
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,520
um I wrote I mean I wrote it all in 23

1224
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,760
years. The reason I posted that at the

1225
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,599
time was I had already made the decision

1226
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,560
a year prior but I'd never talked about

1227
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,760
it. And you know, when you're running a

1228
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,040
big company, there's all these, you

1229
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,119
know, legal things. And we had to wait

1230
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,680
till everything was in order and then I

1231
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,040
could say it. And um and they were like,

1232
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,960
"Well, you've already been out of it for

1233
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,359
a year. Why say it now?" And I just felt

1234
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,119
I need to say it for me, but I also need

1235
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,319
to say it so I hold myself accountable

1236
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,760
not to ever go back. Okay. And I, you

1237
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,319
know, it was way too long. It was like

1238
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,480
10 slides on Instagram. No, it was

1239
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,760
incredible. But it was uh I appreciate

1240
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,960
you saying that, but it was from the

1241
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,079
heart. And I remember waking up, posting

1242
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,160
it, and then just like falling down

1243
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,760
because I was like, "Oh my god, like

1244
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,640
this thing I've been doing since I was

1245
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,319
19 is now over." And what I wrote in

1246
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,359
there is the truth. My entire adult

1247
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,240
life, that's all I had known. So not

1248
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,079
being in that situation, I didn't know

1249
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,319
what a normal adult life was like. I

1250
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,040
didn't know you could have a weekend.

1251
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,800
Like I didn't know, you know, like

1252
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,440
that's what it was. I was on call all

1253
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,720
the time for 23 years. And it wasn't

1254
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,480
one, it was a lot. And um finding out

1255
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,720
what a normal adult life was like was

1256
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,079
pretty wild to me and also really

1257
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,240
interesting. But I don't I had some of

1258
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,240
the most incredible memories and I'm

1259
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,520
very grateful. But if you remember, do

1260
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,040
you remember the Barry Gordy quote at

1261
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,440
the end? No, I don't. Barry Gordy is the

1262
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,920
founder of Mottown Records. Barry Gordy

1263
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,720
is a kid from Detroit. Michael Jackson's

1264
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,440
theater play. Barry Gordy. Correct. Yes.

1265
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,280
So before Barry Gordy, black musicians

1266
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
would make incredible music and a white

1267
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,200
person could come along and just cover

1268
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,319
it and make it

1269
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:00,000
theirs. And Barry Gordy took that back

1270
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,800
and gave us Mottown Records and changed

1271
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,440
the entire music industry. And I was at

1272
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,839
a dinner and Barry Gordy was placed next

1273
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,079
to me and I was just like freaking out.

1274
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:13,720
Barry Gordy sit next to me and we start

1275
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:16,000
talking and this is years

1276
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,640
before he said, "I'm going to tell you a

1277
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,280
story and you're going to need it one

1278
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,040
day." And boy was he

1279
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,880
right. And he said, "You know, do you

1280
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,160
know what the Mottown 25 was?" And I

1281
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,839
said, "Absolutely. It was the first time

1282
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,040
Michael Jackson did the Moonwalk, Diana

1283
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,720
Ross." And he's like, "Oh, you really

1284
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,079
are a Mottown fan." I was like, "Yeah."

1285
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,839
And he said, "Well, do you know I didn't

1286
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,520
want to go?" I said, "What?" He goes,

1287
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,599
"Yeah, I didn't want to go." At the

1288
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,359
time, Michael had left for CBS records.

1289
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,839
Diana had left for CBS records and

1290
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,440
everyone was saying that I took their

1291
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:44,720
publishing and I was like the bad guy

1292
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,240
for all these people that I had

1293
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,079
supported and lifted and like I was so

1294
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,599
angry and I didn't want to go. I said,

1295
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,640
"What changed?" He goes, "My family made

1296
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,760
me go." And I said, "Yeah, cuz I

1297
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,359
remember you were in the balcony and I

1298
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,280
kept cutting to you." And he goes, "You

1299
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,960
know, the first I get there and Diana

1300
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,560
Ross is hosting. Michael's going to

1301
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,680
perform. He's the biggest thing in the

1302
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,520
world. I'm I'm mad." But as the night

1303
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,440
went on, I suddenly realized little

1304
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,839
Barry from Detroit would have lost his

1305
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,079
mind knowing this was coming. He said,

1306
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,839
"Young man, it will never end the way

1307
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,640
you want it to, but it doesn't mean it

1308
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,920
didn't

1309
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,720
happen." And I didn't know how much I

1310
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,480
needed that in the years to come. You

1311
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,240
can plan it. You can try and control it

1312
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,839
as much as you want, but Barry God was

1313
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,359
right. It will never end the way you

1314
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,440
wanted unless you're Derek Jeter on the

1315
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:34,160
Yankees, but or you know, you're messy.

1316
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,359
But um but most of us it's not going to

1317
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,400
end the way we wanted. However, it

1318
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:42,240
happened and how cool is that? Like how

1319
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,280
cool is that that like we get to do this

1320
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,400
and get to have this life and I thought

1321
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,800
that's the way I wanted to end 23 years

1322
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,280
because the me stopping managing and

1323
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,040
ending managing and it didn't end the

1324
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,720
way I necessarily wanted. I would have

1325
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,000
wanted a giant concert where all the

1326
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,400
artists come out, we celebrate

1327
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,480
everything we did together. and ended

1328
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,800
pretty abruptly of like, "Oh, this is

1329
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,880
it." And some want to leave and some

1330
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,800
want to stay and yeah, I'm done. I don't

1331
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,000
want to do this

1332
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,440
anymore. And some people understood it

1333
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,440
and other people didn't. But it happened

1334
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,920
and no one could ever take that away.

1335
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,440
Did you ever feel betrayed? Oh, of

1336
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,200
course. But I'm sure that goes both

1337
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,880
ways. Like as much as I felt betrayed,

1338
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,720
like music business can be

1339
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,839
heartbreaking. Management can be

1340
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,559
heartbreaking. If you watch David

1341
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,000
Geffin's documentary, he says uh

1342
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,040
management is like move the mountain

1343
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
over here and they say it was supposed

1344
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,800
to be there, you know, but like but at

1345
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,960
the same time it must be heartbreaking

1346
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,319
the other way. It's such an

1347
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,559
interdependent relationship and it's

1348
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:47,839
such I don't I you know the people

1349
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,440
always say stay on your side of the

1350
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,280
street. I try to do that. It's easier

1351
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,960
for me to move on with my life and be

1352
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,720
happy by staying on my side of the

1353
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,640
street. So yeah, I've definitely felt

1354
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,839
betrayed a hundred times. I've

1355
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,480
definitely felt misunderstood so many

1356
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:04,240
times, but I also try to give empathy of

1357
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,920
if someone is doing this to me, they

1358
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,839
must be hurting for some reason. And

1359
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,319
maybe I did play a role in it, even if I

1360
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,160
don't know I did, you know.

1361
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:17,520
So, do you feel betrayed? Yes.

1362
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,520
Especially in a job of service. Yeah.

1363
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,160
But yeah, you're right. We all do have a

1364
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,920
preconception of how how the run will

1365
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,119
end. Man, we're all the protagonists in

1366
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,119
our own story.

1367
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,400
Now that there's been some space between

1368
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,920
that decision. Yeah. 2 and a half years.

1369
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
2 and 1/2 years since that decision.

1370
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,920
Wow. 2 and 1/2 years. Wow. It feels like

1371
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,680
it was 6 months ago. Well, it was 2 and

1372
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,880
1/2 years for me. Okay. It's been

1373
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,800
probably a year and a half since I

1374
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,640
probably posted that. Okay. You've had

1375
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,559
some space since that decision. Correct

1376
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,680
decision? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Even high

1377
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,119
conviction now that it was the right

1378
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,119
thing. Yeah. And like I said, it

1379
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,319
happened. In hindsight, it was what it

1380
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,920
was supposed to be at the time it was

1381
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,240
supposed to be. I think the reason why I

1382
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,319
wrote 23 years and why I quit I wouldn't

1383
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,160
say I quit when I retired and stopped

1384
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,240
doing that when I moved on. How about

1385
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,319
that? When I moved on to something else

1386
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,160
was because what exactly what I wrote it

1387
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:11,839
was I was too afraid to find out who I

1388
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,160
was without it for so long that I

1389
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,480
probably should have left earlier. But I

1390
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,680
finally got to a point where I realized

1391
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,640
either you do it now or something you're

1392
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,800
going to have to learn the hard way

1393
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,960
again, you know? So, it was time

1394
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,240
and it was time for some of the most

1395
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,599
amazing artists that I worked with to

1396
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,800
also spread their wings and do their own

1397
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,720
thing. I think B2B marketeers keep

1398
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,359
making this mistake. They're chasing

1399
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,359
volume instead of quality. And when you

1400
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,960
try to be seen by more people instead of

1401
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,800
the right people, all you're doing is

1402
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,880
making noise. But that noise rarely

1403
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,040
shifts the needle. And it's often quite

1404
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,559
expensive. And I know as there was a

1405
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,000
time in my career where I kept making

1406
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,240
this mistake that many of you will be

1407
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,079
making it too. Eventually I started

1408
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,599
posting ads on our show sponsors

1409
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,520
platform LinkedIn. And that's when

1410
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,599
things started to change. I put that

1411
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,440
change down to a few critical things.

1412
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,440
One of them being that LinkedIn was then

1413
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,680
and still is today the platform where

1414
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,760
decision makers go to not only to think

1415
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,280
and learn but also to buy. And when you

1416
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,960
market your business there, you're

1417
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,200
putting it right in front of people who

1418
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,040
actually have the power to say yes. and

1419
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,200
you can target them by job title,

1420
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,960
industry, and company size. It's simply

1421
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,200
a sharper way to spend your marketing

1422
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,359
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how

1423
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,680
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try, and

1424
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,599
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit

1425
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,480
to get you started. If you visit

1426
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,480
linkedin.com/dary, you can claim that

1427
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,119
right now. That's

1428
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,119
linkedin.com/diary. You sold your

1429
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,480
company for $1.1 billion. That's what I

1430
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,319
read.

1431
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,079
You can't confirm or deny, but that's

1432
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,680
publicly traded, so I can confirm, but I

1433
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,040
don't like talking about it. Okay. You

1434
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,160
sold your company for $1.1 billion,

1435
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,599
which I don't think people realize. It's

1436
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,400
a [ __ ] lot of money.

1437
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:55,119
Um, at 39 years old, roughly, I was

1438
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,599
about to turn 40. You talk about laying

1439
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,160
on the beach. Yeah. With your belly out.

1440
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,839
Yeah. I mean with a significant amount

1441
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,160
of money in your bank account without

1442
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,000
the

1443
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,640
same job that's sort of demanding your

1444
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,680
time seven days a

1445
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,040
week. A lot of people are scared of

1446
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,880
that. Lot not not the money but the gap,

1447
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,720
the uncertainty, the space.

1448
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,960
Honestly, the timing of when it happened

1449
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,960
for

1450
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,520
me, I was in such a place, like I said,

1451
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,240
of surrender that I really wasn't

1452
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,000
looking at it as like achievement or

1453
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,240
money or something like that. I more

1454
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,319
looked at it as what are you going to do

1455
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,520
now? Are you going to try and control?

1456
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,280
Are you going to participate? Like I

1457
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,760
told you earlier and I started to just

1458
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,680
be curious for the first time instead of

1459
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,079
I love this idea of a competitive mind

1460
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,559
versus cur a curious and creative mind.

1461
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,200
Mhm. A competitive mind is what I had

1462
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,400
and it is where I was of there's always

1463
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,839
something finite when you're

1464
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,520
competitive. You know, it's going to

1465
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,079
finish. There's going to be an outcome

1466
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,559
and then what? But when you're operating

1467
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,559
from a curious and creative mind,

1468
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,000
there's no

1469
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,839
end. You can just continue to create.

1470
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,480
You continue to build. And I want I want

1471
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,640
to be in that place in my life now of

1472
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,240
what how big can I think? I saw this

1473
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,000
Jeff Bezos interview the other day and

1474
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,000
he just said one of the biggest curses

1475
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,680
of an entrepreneur is not thinking big

1476
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,040
enough, you know, and I think, you know,

1477
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,359
think big. You know, you only get one

1478
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,400
ride around this thing. Think big, have

1479
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:32,880
fun, love your friends, love your

1480
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:36,160
family, dance, laugh, cry, you know, do

1481
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,319
all the things and get to know yourself

1482
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,160
more and more every single day.

1483
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,079
Just before that time, we have this

1484
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,079
whole Taylor Swift incident. What

1485
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,079
happened?

1486
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,359
Is this the moment you're talking about

1487
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,960
where you received Bad Press? Oh, Bad

1488
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,839
Press. Yeah. Yeah. That was That's the

1489
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,880
When I bought Big Machine, I thought I

1490
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,240
was going to work with all the artists

1491
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,880
on Big Machine. I thought it was going

1492
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,680
to be like an exciting thing. I knew

1493
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,200
that Taylor, she and I had only met

1494
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,680
three times, I think, in my life, three

1495
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,000
or four times. And one of the times it

1496
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,440
was years earlier. It was really a great

1497
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,520
engagement. She invited me to private

1498
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,599
party and we we we respected each other.

1499
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,119
We had a great engagement. In between

1500
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,880
that time since I'd seen her last, I

1501
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,240
started managing Kanye West. I managed

1502
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,520
Justin Bieber. I knew she didn't get

1503
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,359
along with them. I had a feeling, this

1504
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,480
is where my arrogance came in. I had a

1505
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,240
feeling she probably didn't like me

1506
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,160
because I managed them, but I thought

1507
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,640
that once this announcement happened,

1508
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,640
she would talk to me, see who I am, and

1509
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,640
we would work together.

1510
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,000
and the announcement came out and I'm

1511
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,079
calling Scott Borchetta and saying,

1512
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,680
"Hey, send me her number. I'm I just

1513
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,079
talked to Thomas Rhett and he's excited

1514
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,520
and I just talked to, you know, uh,

1515
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,280
this, you know, this person and they're

1516
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,160
excited and I'm calling, you know,

1517
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,760
Florida Georgia line next and oh, and

1518
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,720
then this Tumblr comes out and it says

1519
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,240
all this stuff and I was just like

1520
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,119
shocked."

1521
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,720
Um,

1522
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,559
and it's it's been five, six years. I

1523
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,599
don't need to go back into it, but what

1524
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:09,359
I can tell you is everything in life is

1525
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,119
a gift. Having that experience allows me

1526
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,880
to have empathy for the people I worked

1527
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,160
with who I would always say, "Yeah, I

1528
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,680
understand." But I never knew what it

1529
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,680
was like to be on the global stage like

1530
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,000
that. I never knew what criticism like

1531
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,000
that felt like. And like I told you, the

1532
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,839
biggest gift that I got from that was

1533
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,599
understanding that all the praise I had

1534
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,760
received up until that

1535
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:32,240
moment was not deserved. And all the

1536
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,319
hate I got after that moment was not

1537
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,839
deserved because none of these people

1538
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:39,280
knew me. Yeah. She didn't know me. This

1539
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,599
person didn't know me. This person who

1540
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,599
met me three times, they didn't know me.

1541
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,520
I can show respect for all of them cuz I

1542
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:51,280
don't know them. So, I can love them

1543
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,280
where they're at. But the gift of

1544
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,319
pain was awareness.

1545
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,839
And the other part I was going through

1546
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,960
very something very personal shortly

1547
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,799
after I was going through the divorce,

1548
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,880
my marriage and all these different

1549
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:08,240
things. And it just felt like one after

1550
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,599
another. But I look back at those didn't

1551
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,880
things didn't happen. I I really think

1552
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,640
they're all gifts cuz when when

1553
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,160
something's fair, you don't respect it.

1554
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,480
When something happens to you that you

1555
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,400
feel is fair, you're just like, "Oh, I I

1556
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,000
I deserve that." And you move on. You

1557
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,079
feel justified because you saw it

1558
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,040
coming. When something happens to you

1559
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,079
that feels deeply unfair and you can't

1560
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,839
fix

1561
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,720
it, then you really got to look at

1562
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,880
everything and realize the role you

1563
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,319
played in this or maybe this or that or

1564
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,920
who do you want to be or how

1565
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:43,920
so I'm grateful. But how does one

1566
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
contend with an unfair world? And I use

1567
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,200
the word unfair as well because, you

1568
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,119
know, we've got investigative re

1569
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,599
researchers here who looked through

1570
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,760
everything relating to that particular

1571
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,880
deal. And then we also looked at what's

1572
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,319
written on the internet. And there's

1573
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,920
this great disparity between what

1574
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,440
actually happened and what people say

1575
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,480
happened. Yeah. And there's actually I

1576
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,839
think there's a documentary out there

1577
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,520
which goes into it in great detail which

1578
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,200
Andrew Schultz was talking talking about

1579
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,119
on a podcast which I saw. So I looked at

1580
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,640
that documentary as well. I mean look,

1581
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,839
I'm grateful for a couple things. One,

1582
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,119
my kids were really young when it

1583
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,359
happened, so they didn't feel it as

1584
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,960
much. Yeah. It was very hard at the

1585
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,119
time. It was hard on the marriage. It

1586
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,720
was hard on our family. You also

1587
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,720
threats. Yeah. But I also don't know

1588
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,280
what was being said on the other side,

1589
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,480
you know, cuz I never got to have the

1590
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,000
conversation, you know. So, I think when

1591
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,079
people aren't communicating and refusing

1592
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to communicate, a lot of things can get

1593
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,559
misconstrued and you, you know, I don't

1594
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,280
want to hold any hatred or like I we

1595
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,720
everyone moves on, you know. So, yes, I

1596
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:41,280
appreciate you saying that. I appreciate

1597
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,280
you actually doing the research, but for

1598
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,920
me, I choose to see it as a gift. I

1599
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,079
choose to see it as being able to have a

1600
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,079
perspective that very few people in the

1601
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:57,440
world have knowing what that's like, of

1602
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,160
feeling that on a global level. Pain.

1603
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,720
Yeah. And also just what does that mean

1604
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,040
in reality when you It just felt unfair.

1605
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,680
It felt like and but so much but of

1606
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,480
course of course it happened to me right

1607
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,760
of course because here I was thinking my

1608
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,640
value was from all this praise you know

1609
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,200
and I and everything was me making sure

1610
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,559
that I was living up to it and then this

1611
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,680
happens and it's unfair and I can't

1612
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,280
control it and of course the universe

1613
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,440
was like screaming at me like God's

1614
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:29,240
screaming at me like hey wake up you're

1615
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,680
not in control you can't navigate all of

1616
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,079
this you don't get to decide what your

1617
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,799
legacy is and you you just get to decide

1618
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,960
who you are on a daily basis and who you

1619
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,400
choose to see in yourself and how you

1620
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,319
treat the people that love you and the

1621
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,079
people you can actually interact with.

1622
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,640
Surrender,

1623
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,000
but surrender and participate, you know,

1624
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,839
that's the big thing for me. It's more

1625
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,480
than just surrender. It's surrender and

1626
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,880
participate and just enjoy the ride.

1627
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,119
That's why I got the tattoo. You know,

1628
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,119
it

1629
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:03,559
was I can't worry about everyone's niece

1630
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,200
being mad at

1631
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:09,280
me, you know, like, you know, it it's

1632
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,440
what I got to do is is show up for my

1633
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,079
niece, you know, and I got to show up

1634
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,240
for my friends and my family. And I wish

1635
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,079
everyone involved across the board,

1636
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,480
whether I know them or not, nothing but

1637
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,960
good wishes. When I say specifically

1638
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,920
that pain, people don't like think about

1639
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,000
how many people on earth have

1640
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,000
experienced such a thing. And if you if

1641
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,280
I could be a fly on the wall that is

1642
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,920
actually just has CCTV for eyes and I

1643
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,599
was watching you at that moment in time

1644
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,559
just for seven days I got to watch

1645
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,839
Scooter, what would I have seen?

1646
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,839
Like I said, at that point I hadn't

1647
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:44,400
really done the work. Okay. Um, so

1648
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:46,799
resistance, resistance, trying to

1649
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,960
navigate it, trying to understand it,

1650
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:53,160
trying to um figure out how to fix it.

1651
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,599
And then I couldn't, but then I did

1652
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,160
financially like I couldn't fix the

1653
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,839
relationship that I didn't have, but

1654
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,680
then I was able to figure out, okay, you

1655
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:05,359
know

1656
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:08,000
what, we will sell it. You know, in a in

1657
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,680
a world of streaming, re-records will

1658
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,200
only help the old catalog as much as

1659
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,680
they help the new catalog. both will get

1660
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,440
a bump. I presented that I showed you

1661
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,280
know how everyone can be a winner here

1662
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,240
and I was able to sell the catalog and I

1663
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,400
don't want to go into too much detail

1664
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,480
but I but I offered it. It's now come

1665
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,119
out very factually that I did offer it.

1666
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,559
There's evidence of that multiple times

1667
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,839
in that process. They said no. I sold to

1668
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,160
someone else and I washed my hands of it

1669
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,520
and moved

1670
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,960
on. And I actually sometimes look back

1671
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,119
to that and I go the universe was trying

1672
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,559
to teach me something and I navigated

1673
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,480
out of it. I found a way

1674
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:46,799
out. So then the universe went, "Oh man,

1675
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,720
we tried to tried to give you a warning

1676
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,160
sign. We tried to like you're you're

1677
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,319
sailing by in the Titanic and we're

1678
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,480
waving like iceberg."

1679
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,680
And then the universe said, "Okay, you

1680
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,839
really didn't pay attention and you

1681
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:02,240
still aren't doing the work.

1682
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:04,799
Marriage." Cuz that one got me. That one

1683
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:08,160
got me to pay attention. Losing my kids

1684
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,799
50% of the time, that one changed

1685
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,799
everything.

1686
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:15,440
and the

1687
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:18,359
world that still couldn't move me. I was

1688
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:22,440
still able to figure out the

1689
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:26,319
chessboard, but my kids and my

1690
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,960
marriage, that one rocked me and woke me

1691
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:30,599
up. What's really crazy is when I told

1692
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,640
you I did this Hoffman

1693
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:33,680
process, I won't tell you the process

1694
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,520
because you're not supposed to, but I

1695
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,799
can tell you at the end of the week, can

1696
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,319
you give it context for anyone that

1697
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,760
doesn't know the the Hoffman process is

1698
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:44,240
is one week, no phone, no email,

1699
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,000
um, intense work on your early childhood

1700
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,160
to understand why you are the way you

1701
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,200
are and give you tools to go out in the

1702
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,440
world and understand yourself. The

1703
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,520
reason I

1704
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,440
went October of 2020, my marriage was

1705
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,079
falling apart. The whole world thought I

1706
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,760
was crushing it. Ariana's crushing it.

1707
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,240
This Justin's cr all these people like

1708
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,079
we're on

1709
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:08,079
fire.

1710
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:10,559
And I had a suicidal thought for 20

1711
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,839
minutes where I was like, if my marriage

1712
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,680
is going to fall apart, I'm not going to

1713
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,920
be with my kids all the time. I can't

1714
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,640
control this. I'm not going to be this

1715
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,000
perfect image that I've presented to the

1716
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,240
world. And if I can't be this perfect

1717
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,319
image, I don't want to be here. And it

1718
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,440
went to a very dark place. And after 20

1719
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,359
minutes, I said, "What the hell was

1720
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,640
that? That's not me. I would never leave

1721
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,559
my kids. I don't want to like leave

1722
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,680
anybody. Like, what was that? And the

1723
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:37,119
next morning, I was on the set of a

1724
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,720
video shoot. And a friend of mine called

1725
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,200
and he said, you know, what's going on

1726
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,720
with you? And I told him I told him

1727
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,920
about that night before. He called me

1728
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,520
back with another friend and they said,

1729
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,319
you need to go to Hoffman. We did it. It

1730
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,599
changed our life. They told me that they

1731
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:52,480
could get me in in two weeks cuz there

1732
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:54,160
was a cancellation October 24th and that

1733
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,280
was the release of Ariana Grande's

1734
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,559
Dangerous Woman album. It was the

1735
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,799
busiest week of the year for me at work.

1736
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,480
And I started laughing in the parking

1737
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,760
lot of this video shoot. And she goes,

1738
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,160
"Do you want us to pick another week?" I

1739
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,880
said, "No." I said, "I've spent my whole

1740
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,119
life pursuing these things, doing this,

1741
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,920
choosing this, choosing scooter,

1742
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,319
choosing that life, choosing the

1743
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,960
clients, and I'm the top of my game.

1744
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:22,480
Yet, I wanted to kill myself last night.

1745
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,720
Something's got to change." And I chose

1746
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,799
to go to that place instead.

1747
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,799
And the hard stuff actually came after I

1748
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,319
got out of Hoffman. You know, I ended up

1749
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,480
going through a divorce. I ended up

1750
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:35,839
going through all this different stuff.

1751
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,520
But I never was depressed again. And the

1752
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,520
most interesting thing that happened on

1753
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:43,920
the other side of it is six years ago, I

1754
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,839
was biggest manager and the perfect

1755
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,520
marriage and you know, everything I

1756
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:50,079
touch turned to gold and there was no

1757
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,160
negative press about me ever. Six years

1758
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,760
later, I'm divorced. I don't manage

1759
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,000
anymore. I've had negative press and I

1760
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,200
couldn't be

1761
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,880
happier. It doesn't mean it doesn't eb

1762
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,000
and flow, but I get to be the dad I've

1763
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,440
always wanted to be and the friend I've

1764
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,960
always wanted to be. And it doesn't mean

1765
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,400
that things aren't going to go, you

1766
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,400
know, be hard and I'm going to say

1767
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,720
suffer more things and go through them,

1768
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,319
but I'm in a place that I understand a

1769
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,480
morati. It's like everything is a gift

1770
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:21,359
and I'm being super long- winded, but

1771
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,559
that's the story. that phone call the

1772
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:26,400
day after that to your friends. Yeah.

1773
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,400
Did you tell him the truth on the phone?

1774
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,079
The full truth? Yeah, I did. And what

1775
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,240
was that full truth that I had the night

1776
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,760
before thought about, you know, just

1777
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,920
shutting it all off. It wasn't even an

1778
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,920
idea that I wanted to die. I just wanted

1779
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,520
the noise in my head to go away. I

1780
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,079
wanted the failure, the disappointment,

1781
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,319
the fear. I was going to fail in my

1782
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:49,200
mind. I couldn't control it. I'd always

1783
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:52,799
been able to navigate out of failure and

1784
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,799
head towards success. A pit stop. But I

1785
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,920
had left what I found at Hoffman. I told

1786
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:00,559
you is my name, the inner child, the

1787
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,960
Scott. I had built this mask so big. I

1788
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,720
wanted to feel like me again. And I

1789
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,799
didn't realize how far away I'd gotten

1790
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,160
from that. Building up this armor,

1791
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:11,200
building up the mask. You know, I I want

1792
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,559
to tell you something funny. I usually

1793
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,760
don't say names in these things, but I

1794
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,400
want to give him credit cuz I think it's

1795
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,400
hilarious. Michael Rapino is the CEO of

1796
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,319
Live Nation. He's an amazing guy. I

1797
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,240
think he's one of the most impressive

1798
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,960
people in the entire entertainment

1799
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,280
industry because he wields so much

1800
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,520
power, but he also empowers other people

1801
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:33,599
so

1802
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:35,599
well. And after the divorce, after, you

1803
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,039
know, the big machine and and stuff that

1804
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,240
happened with that, all these different

1805
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,839
things. And you know what Michael told

1806
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,119
me? He goes, "I like you a lot more now

1807
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,319
cuz you seem human."

1808
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,079
you know, and he told me, he was like,

1809
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:47,680
"Before," he's like, "Nobody goes on

1810
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,039
like it's like this." He's like, you

1811
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,160
know, I just didn't, he goes, he goes,

1812
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,119
"I didn't think you were real. I thought

1813
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,039
you were full of shit." And he was

1814
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,440
right. I mean, it I didn't know myself

1815
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,359
cuz I had no reason to do so. And it

1816
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,240
wasn't until I had some real hardships

1817
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,720
and real pain and real scares and real

1818
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:07,119
rock bottom moments that I started

1819
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:10,640
looking at myself and started figuring

1820
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:12,640
out who I was. And then everyone got to

1821
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,920
know me. my best friends since I was 11

1822
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,520
years old. They're the people I hang out

1823
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,079
with the most. Um, two of them live out

1824
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,680
here, Mike and V. And I hang out with

1825
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,520
them all the time. And people who know

1826
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,359
me, they know these guys because they've

1827
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,359
been my friends since we were 12 years

1828
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:31,760
old, 11 years old. And Mike and Vuke

1829
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,760
told me at 40 years old when I was doing

1830
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,000
this work, "We've known you since you

1831
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,799
were 11 and this is the most we've ever

1832
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,640
known you."

1833
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,960
And I'm not surprised or insulted

1834
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:46,160
because they say you haven't changed but

1835
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,039
we didn't know you because I was always

1836
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,319
even to them

1837
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:51,640
presenting what I thought they needed me

1838
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,720
to be

1839
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,079
perfect and then I broke and then I said

1840
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,599
this happened and this happened when I

1841
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:02,079
was a kid. This was going on and this

1842
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,760
was and they were like we love you and I

1843
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,760
really became one of the boys for the

1844
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,119
first time in my life. I became one of

1845
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,920
the boys because the boys became

1846
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:11,280
vulnerable. I thought it was the

1847
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,559
opposite my whole life. I thought you

1848
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,480
had to be cool. You had to be tough to

1849
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,600
be one of the boys. And it was funny

1850
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,480
because they didn't all the

1851
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,400
achievements. Not only did they not give

1852
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,520
a [ __ ] about I probably lost touch with

1853
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,120
them more so. And when everything fell

1854
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,040
apart, they were the ones that were

1855
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,080
there, the ones who knew Scott, the ones

1856
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,839
who didn't care about any of it. And

1857
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,480
I've never really even said that out

1858
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,239
loud to this extent until right now. And

1859
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,719
I'm actually glad I get to say on here

1860
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:42,719
both their names because

1861
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:42,719
they

1862
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:50,640
damn they picked me up and in a really

1863
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,759
really tough time and a time where I

1864
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,920
couldn't even look at my own brothers

1865
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,880
cuz I was too

1866
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,480
ashamed and

1867
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,759
um and I never felt like one of the

1868
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,960
guys. Like I felt like I had those

1869
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,400
friends, but I just couldn't let them

1870
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,920
all the way in because I felt, well,

1871
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,759
maybe I'm smarter, maybe I'm this, maybe

1872
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,759
I need to be perfect. And it wasn't

1873
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,199
until I really hit rock bottom that I

1874
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,279
realized that they always had my back

1875
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,520
and I'd made all these stupid ideas in

1876
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,600
my head

1877
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:22,719
and they

1878
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:25,040
were they were there and they weren't

1879
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,480
there for Scooter, you know, they were

1880
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,400
there for Scott. And I see you getting a

1881
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,159
little emotional too because you

1882
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,480
probably have the same type of friends.

1883
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:34,920
So I'll I did it so you can do it too.

1884
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:37,960
What are their names? Well,

1885
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:41,920
Michael, Ash,

1886
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,199
Dom, Anthony, and Oliver. But they are

1887
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,560
they're the constant. They're the

1888
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:47,120
they're there through everything. The

1889
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,719
up, the down, the up, the down, the up,

1890
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,159
the down again. And they don't give a

1891
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,600
crap about any of this [ __ ] about

1892
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,759
anything. In fact, if your friends are

1893
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,199
like mine, they're brutal about this

1894
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:59,360
stuff.

1895
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:01,760
My friends rip me. Like if people saw

1896
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,400
the text messages between us, they would

1897
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,800
think we hate each other. Um, but we

1898
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,360
love each other deeply. And and the best

1899
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,840
part about the messages is the random,

1900
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,040
"Hey guys, I love you." You know? I It

1901
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,960
happens all the time. I'll get a phone

1902
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,080
call, I'll pick up, I'll just see Paul.

1903
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,159
Hey brother, I love you. Just want to

1904
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,480
call and tell you. I'm really grateful.

1905
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:22,320
Like I have so many different people I

1906
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,400
can name. And what was really

1907
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,640
interesting

1908
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,199
is before all this happened, I don't

1909
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,239
know if you can relate to this,

1910
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:34,440
but I spent so much

1911
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:36,760
time trying to impress people who didn't

1912
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:40,560
want to love

1913
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:43,520
me instead of realizing how many people

1914
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,800
already did.

1915
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,800
I was just thinking what a great shame

1916
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,400
it is that the amount of units of energy

1917
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,199
we exert on as you said like the

1918
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,800
external like the audience whereas when

1919
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,560
you ask me who would be there for me

1920
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,880
irrespective of what was going on in my

1921
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,560
life I can name them and then I ask

1922
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,320
myself how much energy and effort am I

1923
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,520
putting into these relationships and I'm

1924
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,320
embarrassed about how much energy and

1925
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,800
effort I'm putting into these

1926
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,920
relationships I'm like embarrassed by

1927
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,440
it and they'll still be there. Yeah.

1928
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,640
They don't care. Yeah. Yeah. And and

1929
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,920
that's the best part because when you do

1930
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,800
start putting your energy it becomes

1931
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,800
even more fun.

1932
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,199
It's really it's really um it's really

1933
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,800
difficult for me to understand and this

1934
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,520
is my naivity. The part that's difficult

1935
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,120
for me to understand is you family meant

1936
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,440
so much to you. Didn't don't you have a

1937
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,840
tattoo that says family?

1938
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,880
First one I was 18. You got a tattoo at

1939
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,440
18 about your future family. Correct. So

1940
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,920
family has been this like dream and

1941
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,840
ambition of yours. Mhm.

1942
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,320
So, it's surprising to me as someone who

1943
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,520
was naive in this

1944
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,480
context that some it had to be

1945
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,199
threatened for you to care enough to No,

1946
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,480
I cared. I just uh childhood trauma is a

1947
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,840
hell of a thing, man. Yeah. It's um and

1948
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,120
we all have it. That was the thing. The

1949
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,840
reason I didn't think I had it is

1950
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,120
because I had friends who, you know, had

1951
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
parents who were alcoholics. I had

1952
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,239
friends who had parents who this. So, I

1953
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,080
always thought, you know, both my

1954
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:08,400
parents are here. They love me. Like,

1955
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,679
the stuff I dealt with, that's not real.

1956
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,400
you know, I come from an immigrant

1957
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,239
family. Like, we can deal with this.

1958
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,800
Like, we're strong. You know, that's not

1959
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,880
real. And what I realized

1960
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:21,920
is everyone has trauma. That's the human

1961
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:24,640
experience. And the faster we value our

1962
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,080
own trauma and stop trying to downplay

1963
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,320
it because we don't think it equals

1964
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,800
someone else's, the more we can work on

1965
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,000
ourselves. Because all you get to do is

1966
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,920
work on yourself. You don't get to work

1967
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,679
on the other person. Yeah. Like, you can

1968
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,120
really only work on yourself. You can

1969
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,719
help the other person, but the work

1970
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:43,840
that's only here.

1971
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:48,239
And I think that I saw my life as

1972
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,719
perfect. So why change anything?

1973
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,159
And that's why you're smiling.

1974
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,760
Stop calling me out. Yeah, you're

1975
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,679
smiling. So true because you see your

1976
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,679
life as perfect and screaming at you.

1977
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,520
She's screaming at you and trying to and

1978
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,440
you can't see it. She's not screaming

1979
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,640
just yet. She is in her own way

1980
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,440
increasingly expressing to me and Yeah.

1981
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,760
in her own way that there

1982
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,040
is an issue. And I I'm going to be

1983
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,560
completely honest because this is why I

1984
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,760
started this podcast was the diary of a

1985
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,600
CEO. So this is what would be written in

1986
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,159
my

1987
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,280
diary. The alarm is getting louder and

1988
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,440
I'm still in a a state where I think

1989
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,440
I've got a a lot of time before the

1990
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,600
alarm is so loud that I can't fix it. I

1991
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,679
got you. I see you, buddy. Trust me. I

1992
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,880
see. And here's the funny thing. I don't

1993
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,440
want to go into detail cuz I have a lot

1994
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,440
of respect. We're family forever.

1995
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,760
It goes both ways. It's not like there

1996
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:40,719
was one thing happen. It both people

1997
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,800
have to play a role in where we got to.

1998
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,760
You know, things happen on, you know,

1999
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,880
both ways.

2000
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,280
However, Chris Rock says something

2001
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,840
really special. He goes, "Relationships

2002
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,120
are actually quite easy. You know, you

2003
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,040
ever try to pick up a couch with two

2004
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,400
people? No problem. Pick up a couch by

2005
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,760
yourself." And that was the thing. We we

2006
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,040
both went to pick up the couch at

2007
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,560
different times.

2008
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,159
And we were made to be amazing

2009
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,760
co-parents. We were made to come into

2010
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,280
each other's lives to help each other be

2011
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,199
better in different ways through the

2012
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,440
heartbreak of our relationship ending.

2013
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:16,280
And we were we were brought together to

2014
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,520
make three incredible

2015
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:21,640
souls. And now whoever gets me next is

2016
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,000
in for a

2017
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,400
treat cuz I'm a better version than I

2018
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,920
was before.

2019
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,400
And in hindsight, what are those warning

2020
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,080
signs for someone like me who might be

2021
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,679
the choices that you make that you

2022
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,000
justify? Oh, I got to do this because,

2023
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,840
you know, if I don't do this one, it

2024
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,360
could all fall apart. No, it isn't. Oh,

2025
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,960
God. You know, I if I don't if I don't

2026
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,760
stop everything I'm doing and choose

2027
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,679
this, it could all fall apart. Or, yeah,

2028
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,199
okay, you're saying this to me, but you

2029
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,560
don't really mean it because you don't

2030
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,920
understand what I'm going through

2031
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,679
because I'm in this grind. And I'm in

2032
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,080
this hunt that you no one can understand

2033
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:01,120
cuz only I can achieve this. You're

2034
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:04,239
smiling cuz you live it. Can I ask you

2035
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,400
some questions? Sure.

2036
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:08,800
How long have you guys been together? Uh

2037
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,280
6 years now.

2038
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,480
And why are you smiling so big? Cuz how

2039
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,000
many times have you made those choices?

2040
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,679
I know. I just justified [ __ ] And

2041
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,880
there's always going to I know logically

2042
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,640
there's always going to be something

2043
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,960
else. There's always there's never going

2044
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,480
to be a perfect time. So, I know

2045
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,920
logically that I have to pick imperfect

2046
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,520
moments. And do you guys want kids? Yes.

2047
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,040
Do you use that as an excuse? Well, the

2048
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,040
kids aren't here yet, so I need to grind

2049
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,040
now.

2050
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,320
I've I've I've certainly thought it as a

2051
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,760
way to justify to myself to

2052
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,440
self-rationalize. I don't think I've

2053
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,040
ever said that to her, but I have said

2054
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,480
to her I've said internally. Yeah, I've

2055
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,000
said it to myself internally. I've said

2056
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,320
to myself like this season of life up

2057
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,040
until I'm 35, I'm going to go for it.

2058
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,199
And then if I'm good. And then you know

2059
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,120
she's looking at you thinking, I want to

2060
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,480
be able to trust you to have children.

2061
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,280
Yeah. Yeah.

2062
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,080
Listen, a long time ago, someone really

2063
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,679
smart ran this little exercise with

2064
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:07,520
me and I wish I would have paid better

2065
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,840
attention to it other than just thinking

2066
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,120
it was a cool saying to like use in the

2067
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,280
office. He

2068
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:17,600
said, "If I told you someone you loved

2069
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,199
was sick and you had a billion dollars,

2070
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,120
how much of it would you spend to save

2071
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,480
them?"

2072
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,000
A billion dollars. Yeah. Correct. And he

2073
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:29,920
says, "Is your loved one, is she

2074
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,320
healthy? Does she love you? Is she here

2075
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,480
with you right now? Everything you're

2076
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,520
working to

2077
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,120
achieve with that perspective, you

2078
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,320
already have it." Yeah. And they said it

2079
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,520
to me, and it sounds great, and I'm

2080
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,120
seeing it on your face. You're a smart

2081
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,400
guy. It's logical. You're like, "Yeah, I

2082
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,320
get it." And then you're going to go

2083
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,120
repeat the same stuff because that's

2084
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,280
what we do. And what I realized when I

2085
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,840
went and did this work was it's not

2086
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:54,239
going to change between you and her or

2087
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,239
me and my ex. You know, that wasn't what

2088
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:58,400
it was about. It was actually something

2089
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:00,000
deeper deeper underlying that had

2090
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,800
nothing to do with the current

2091
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,640
relationship. It had to do with that lie

2092
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,679
that I'm not enough. That this person

2093
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,719
actually doesn't really love me unless I

2094
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,440
do this. Were you happy before the

2095
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,679
marriage fell apart? I think so. But I

2096
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,360
also didn't know who I was. I think I

2097
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,640
was happy because everyone in the world

2098
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,800
told me I was doing great and I thought

2099
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,159
that that was enough. And I I feel like

2100
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,640
looking back now, I feel like I was

2101
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:29,520
asleep at the wheel. I feel like I

2102
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,280
didn't know myself at the time and but I

2103
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,480
had so much success at such a young age.

2104
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,800
So everyone was telling me I was doing

2105
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,040
great. So I just chose to believe them.

2106
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,400
And it wasn't until I, you know, the

2107
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,400
foundation broke and there was nothing

2108
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,800
underneath it that I was like, "Oh [ __ ]

2109
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,840
I'm actually not happy." And I never

2110
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,199
knew. And it's like, I wouldn't go back

2111
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:51,040
to that before all the crap in a million

2112
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,760
years. I want to stay here cuz now I'm

2113
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,360
like, I'm I'm awake. What is the um the

2114
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,679
practical advice you would give me?

2115
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,280
Because you can identify where I'm at in

2116
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:02,320
your own story. So, what is the

2117
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,000
practical advice you'd give me now to

2118
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,480
avoid myself getting into a situation

2119
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,880
where one day I have regret because I

2120
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,960
didn't listen to the alarm? Couple

2121
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,800
things. Okay. Number one, turn the

2122
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,280
cameras off and go do some selfwork.

2123
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,520
Stop being nudged. Just go do it. Stop

2124
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,159
being, with all due respect, a [ __ ]

2125
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,719
Okay. I appreciate it. And um and my

2126
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:25,520
group chat. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it it's

2127
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,199
just there's no good time in the future.

2128
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,360
There's no when I get to 35, when I get

2129
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,199
to 36, when I get to 40, there's when I

2130
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,520
achieve

2131
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:35,199
this. Go do it. One to two weeks out of

2132
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,600
the year will not kill you. It will only

2133
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:39,040
make you stronger because what you're

2134
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,320
dealing with with what you're telling me

2135
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,840
has nothing to do with the two of you.

2136
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,520
It has more to do with your stuff. And

2137
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,000
she has to go do her stuff. You have to

2138
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,239
see if she wants to go do the same thing

2139
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,840
and and work on herself in the same way

2140
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:52,880
cuz it's a constant thing. The second

2141
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,719
thing is go on vacations together and

2142
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,560
when the kids come, go on vacate. That's

2143
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,000
something I think we we forgot to do. We

2144
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,199
did the vacations with the kids. We did

2145
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,719
the vacations with friends, but we

2146
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,560
didn't do vacations together because we

2147
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,440
were so we had three kids in 5 years.

2148
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,760
Yeah. And I think um you know that's

2149
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,199
something I think about. But then also

2150
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,520
just trust that like if it's supposed to

2151
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,600
be, it's supposed to be. My journey was

2152
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,520
supposed to be exactly the way it was.

2153
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,719
Even the when I found out things and she

2154
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,560
found out

2155
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:22,960
like about ourselves, it was exactly

2156
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,440
when we were supposed to find out. So, I

2157
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,199
just I'm a firm believer, you know,

2158
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,320
you're here to learn exactly what you're

2159
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,560
supposed to learn. Have you read Many

2160
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,400
Lives, Many Masters? No. By Brian Weiss.

2161
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,920
No.

2162
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,480
Easy, quick read on a weekend, you'll

2163
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,679
enjoy the hell of it. Um Brian Weiss was

2164
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,360
the head of psychology at University of

2165
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:43,760
Miami and he was recommended a nurse

2166
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,360
from the hospital. Would he see her? And

2167
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,239
he saw her and she had deep trauma and

2168
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,040
couldn't figure it out. So, he goes,

2169
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,840
"We're going to do hypnotic

2170
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,199
regression." She does hypnotic

2171
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,800
regression. She goes into something from

2172
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,560
like age 0 to six that she couldn't

2173
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,679
remember. Very traumatizing. He's like,

2174
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,280
"Oh, this will make a difference." She

2175
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,360
comes back the next week. It's even

2176
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,880
worse. That makes no sense to him. He

2177
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,840
does hypnotic regression again and she

2178
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,199
goes into a past life. He calls

2179
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,640
[ __ ] He does another hypnotic

2180
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,400
regression. She goes into another past

2181
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,000
life and he realizes her educational

2182
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,400
background could not know the things

2183
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,960
that she's saying that he's looking up.

2184
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,560
So, what happens is he just writes a

2185
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,199
book about this patient and how she

2186
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,239
changed his entire practice. And what

2187
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:24,159
was really interesting about it

2188
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:25,760
is it made me look at death differently

2189
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:28,000
and life differently. We're here to

2190
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,520
learn and then if we don't figure it

2191
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,040
out, we leave and we come back again.

2192
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,280
And if we learn that one, we come back

2193
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:36,239
and it's transitions and but it's never

2194
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,960
it's not ending. It's all about coming

2195
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,719
here to learn. But I feel like I have so

2196
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,480
much to learn and at least I know that

2197
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,159
and I'm such a mess and I'm figuring it

2198
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,000
out every single day that if Brian

2199
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:48,560
Weiss's book is right, I'm not going

2200
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,640
anywhere for a while.

2201
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,080
But it's a really amazing way to look.

2202
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,719
And what was interesting is when I told

2203
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,159
my mom had read it, when I told my dad,

2204
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,880
he actually goes, "Well, you know, we're

2205
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,560
Jews. We don't believe in

2206
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,600
reincarnation." And when I started

2207
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,600
studying Cabala, I realized that

2208
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,440
actually Cabala teaches reincarnation

2209
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,800
almost the exact same way this woman was

2210
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,600
describing it, which means

2211
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,199
Judeo-Christians actually believe in

2212
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,679
reincarnation, but many of us don't know

2213
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,679
it. Um, and it was just a really

2214
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,520
interesting way of looking at life. Do

2215
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,120
you believe in reincarnation? I do. You

2216
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,199
do? Yeah, I do. Especially reading this

2217
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,560
book and then studying Cabala. And I

2218
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:26,880
started studying Cabala about a year

2219
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:29,400
ago. Um, I like some of the principles

2220
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,560
I've learned from Cabala about this idea

2221
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:35,120
of being a

2222
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:38,159
custodian, that nothing is actually

2223
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:40,480
ours, but we're custodians. You know,

2224
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:43,440
that um, God, Hashem is what they say in

2225
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,440
Cabala. But um this idea that we're

2226
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,159
supposed to give 10% to charity but no

2227
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,320
more than 20, you know, because the

2228
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,679
belief if God is giving you this, he's

2229
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,600
asking you to hold on to it because he

2230
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,600
has a purpose for you. But if he chooses

2231
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,280
to take it away, you should be just as

2232
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,760
joyful because it was never yours in the

2233
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,120
first place. You are a custodian. And I

2234
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,360
think that's a really great way of

2235
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,719
looking at materials, looking at life,

2236
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,400
and understanding, like I said,

2237
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,120
participating. And I'm getting to play

2238
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,400
in this game. But you have your moments,

2239
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,400
right?

2240
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,880
Yeah. Still today because you're someone

2241
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,639
that's done so much work. So it's it's

2242
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,400
interesting speaking to you because

2243
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,520
you're someone that I would seek advice

2244
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,880
on in everything in my life, but you

2245
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,040
still have work left to do. You said

2246
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,080
there I still have things left to learn.

2247
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,120
Well, I think I have a lot of things

2248
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,400
left to learn. I find

2249
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,560
myself sometimes needing to defend

2250
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:36,000
myself, sometimes not defending myself

2251
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,159
when I should. I feel like sometimes I

2252
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,800
feel misunderstood or not loved. And you

2253
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,080
I I've you know had that moment and then

2254
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,280
even on the other side there's times

2255
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,560
where you feel like oh you're doing all

2256
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,719
this work and people see you as someone

2257
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,880
who's done the work and then you don't

2258
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,679
want to be seen as someone who's failing

2259
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,880
at that work and the truth is that's all

2260
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,880
part of the process. It's like a

2261
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:58,760
constant surrender to your your human

2262
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:01,040
experience. The work for me

2263
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,280
is life is going to throw the things you

2264
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,880
need at you. So, like I said, tomorrow

2265
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,639
something could happen that, you know,

2266
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,719
I'm being ridiculed again and I'm having

2267
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,000
to learn again, you know, or a praise

2268
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,280
could come and I'm having to learn how

2269
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,480
to handle that. Like, I don't know what

2270
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,040
tomorrow is going to bring. It's always

2271
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,880
a new experiment. But it's almost as if

2272
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,280
like when you're doing this work, people

2273
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,600
call it, it's as you're swimming in the

2274
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:24,560
waves and now you have the skills to get

2275
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,239
through the wave. The waves still come,

2276
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,600
but you're just going through them

2277
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:31,280
differently. Do you wish they wouldn't

2278
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,760
come? Hell no. That's life. You know, I

2279
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:36,639
I

2280
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:40,000
asked you said I'd accompany Ithaca.

2281
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:41,280
Do you know where it comes from? No. So,

2282
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,840
some people think they're like, "Oh,

2283
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:48,320
Ithaca, New York." No. It comes from a

2284
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,239
poem by Kafi. Um, I asked David Geffen

2285
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,920
uh years

2286
01:23:49,239 --> 01:23:55,040
ago with his extraordinary life and

2287
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,520
career. When did he feel like it was

2288
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,880
like

2289
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,159
enough? I was 30 years old when I met

2290
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,199
him. And I asked him that question. the

2291
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,600
first meal we ever had. And he looked at

2292
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:07,280
me and he said, "That's not how life

2293
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,040
works. It goes up and down this." He

2294
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,000
goes, "I want you to read a poem." And

2295
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,520
he gives me Ithaca by

2296
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Kafi.

2297
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,880
And I named my holding company. I had SB

2298
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,159
projects, but then when I did the

2299
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,080
holding company and started doing other

2300
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,920
things, too. I named it after this poem

2301
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,080
because I was so moved by it. And the

2302
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,679
concept of the poem of Ithaca is you're

2303
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,920
on the way to the island of Ithaca in

2304
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,440
the Greek islands. And along the way,

2305
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,679
you're going to see so many different

2306
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,960
things and you're going to meet scholars

2307
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,239
and you're going to, you know, learn

2308
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,840
wisdom and all these different things.

2309
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:38,239
And when you find Ithaca, finally, if

2310
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,760
you find her poor, she did not fool you

2311
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:43,360
because it was never about the

2312
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,480
destination. Always about the journey.

2313
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:49,760
And I think right now, if there if I get

2314
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:51,440
to this end game with you, like that's

2315
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,719
no fun. Then it's over. So like, keep

2316
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:56,400
the waves coming. Bad skin. I've had it

2317
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,159
and I'm sure many of you listening have

2318
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,760
had it too or maybe you have it right

2319
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:02,960
now. I know how draining it can be,

2320
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,199
especially if you're in a job where

2321
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,320
you're presenting often like I am. So,

2322
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,320
let me tell you about something that's

2323
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,639
helped both my partner and me and my

2324
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,760
sister, which is red light therapy. I

2325
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,920
only got into this a couple of years

2326
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,760
ago, but I wish I'd known a little bit

2327
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,920
sooner. I've been using our show

2328
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,920
sponsors Bon Chargers infrared sauna

2329
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,840
blanket for a while now, but I just got

2330
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,679
hold of their red light therapy mask as

2331
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,760
well. Red light has been proven to have

2332
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,760
so many benefits for the body. Like any

2333
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,679
area of your skin that's exposed will

2334
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,159
see a reduction in scarring, wrinkles,

2335
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:34,159
and even blemishes. It also helps with

2336
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,760
complexion. It boosts collagen, and it

2337
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,520
does that by targeting the upper layers

2338
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,679
of your skin. And Bon Charge ships

2339
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,520

2347
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,320
made the biggest investment I've ever

2348
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:02,560
made in a company because of my

2349
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,639
girlfriend. I came home one night and my

2350
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,880
lovely girlfriend was up at 1:00 a.m. in

2351
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:09,520
the morning pulling her hair out as she

2352
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,000
tried to piece together her own online

2353
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,920
store for her business. And in that

2354
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,080
moment, I remembered an email I'd had

2355
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,800
from a guy called John, the founder of

2356
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,800
Stanto, our new sponsor and a company

2357
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,880
I've invested incredibly heavily in. And

2358
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,080
Stanto helps creators to sell digital

2359
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,159
products, courses, coaching, and

2360
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,960
memberships all through a simple

2361
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:30,800
customizable link in bio system. And it

2362
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,719
handles everything, payments, bookings,

2363
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,960
emails, community engagement, and even

2364
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:38,480
links with Shopify. And I believe in it

2365
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,159
so much that I'm going to launch a Stan

2366
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,120
challenge. And as part of this

2367
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:44,480
challenge, I'm going to give away

2368
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,840

trial of Stanto if you use that link.

2375
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:01,440
Your next move could quite frankly

2376
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,679
change everything. I I told Daniel E

2377
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:07,199
that I was interviewing you a couple of

2378
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,320
months ago and he sat me down in his LA

2379
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:10,400
office and was like, I've got to tell

2380
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,080
you a story about that Scooter Bron guy.

2381
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,239
I've got to tell you something. He said

2382
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,239
that when he made the Forbes under 30

2383
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:18,560
list when he was a young man in I think

2384
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:20,000
Stockholm, Sweden, he said he randomly

2385
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,760
got a phone call out of the blue from

2386
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,679
you and you had decided to call

2387
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,199
everybody on the Forbes 30 under 30

2388
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,639
billboard. Oh, the billboard. It was

2389
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:30,800
Billboard 30 under 30. I thought it was

2390
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:32,239
foot Forbes and you decided to call all

2391
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:35,040
every single person on the list just to

2392
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:38,400
introduce yourself. Yeah. I when I heard

2393
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:40,800
that I thought [ __ ] wow.

2394
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,920
You don't want to know why? Why? Cuz

2395
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,840
every single time I met someone very

2396
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:48,159
accomplished and

2397
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,600
successful and they wanted to help me,

2398
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,880
they'd say, "Well, who are you trying to

2399
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,280
reach?" And they'd say, "Oh my gosh,

2400
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,719
I've known them for 20 years, 30 years."

2401
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:58,800
And they would pick up the phone call.

2402
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,639
And their power was in relationship that

2403
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,320
was

2404
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:04,239
expansive and and long and they knew

2405
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,560
each other from the beginning, not that

2406
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:09,560
they had met some powerful club at the

2407
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:12,199
end. And what I realized

2408
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:16,800
was the real power is in

2409
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:18,960
community and I wanted to know my peers.

2410
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,719
I wanted to grow with them that we

2411
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,159
didn't need to go and find someone who

2412
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,600
already had it. We needed to support

2413
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,920
each other. How old were you when you

2414
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:30,000
did that? 27. So you were 27 and you

2415
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:32,159
called everybody on that list. Yeah.

2416
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,480
Such a cool thing to do. So many people

2417
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:37,120
are now going to go do that, but it's

2418
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,040
such a cool thing to do. By the way, I

2419
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:42,320
am an early investor in Spotify because

2420
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:43,679
of that phone call. He was just I'm sure

2421
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,600
he told you this. He was just a company

2422
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,440
in Sweden. He didn't tell me this part.

2423
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,040
Oh, yeah. He was just When I called him,

2424
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,639
he was, you know, they were talking

2425
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:55,600
about this new thing, Spotify, but it

2426
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:57,199
was in Sweden. And we met and I tried to

2427
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,040
get in right away after we met cuz I was

2428
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,719
like what is this and he didn't let me

2429
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,960
in at first and then you know I went and

2430
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,800
met Shaq you know. Oh Shaq good friend

2431
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,880
of mine. I met Shaq in London. We walked

2432
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,920
around and then Da Wallik was like

2433
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,840
advising them and um I ended up getting

2434
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,239
to be a significant you know investor at

2435
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,800
that point in my life in this you know

2436
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:19,360
new young company Spotify and I have not

2437
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,760
sold a share in probably 18 years. You

2438
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,520
haven't sold a [ __ ]

2439
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:26,320
No, I'm a firm believer in that company

2440
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:29,120
and I'm a firm believer in Daniel. And I

2441
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,600
and I think listen, I hear all the time

2442
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:34,239
where people are like, "Oh, look, you

2443
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,639
know, this is so unfair." Daniel Ek with

2444
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:38,960
his bravery and his

2445
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:41,440
foresight saved the music industry. He

2446
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,159
gave value to our industry again. He

2447
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:46,400
found a way to make us go from going in

2448
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:49,040
one direction to the most successful

2449
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:51,040
we've ever been. And I don't think

2450
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,360
people realize that and give him enough

2451
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,800
credit for what he did. People don't

2452
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,880
understand the machine. They just think,

2453
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,560
well, record sales went away and now

2454
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,239
we've got this streaming fee and it's

2455
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,920
lower. So, what is the context we're

2456
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:04,480
missing there? What did he what did that

2457
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:07,120
company do? It gave value to our

2458
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:09,040
business. It gave, you know, uh,

2459
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:11,920
multiples on publishing and masters that

2460
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:13,600
we had never seen before because now

2461
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,840
everyone's music can be heard and heard

2462
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,600
for a long time. You know, at the time

2463
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,960
Daniel came along, all I would hear

2464
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,440
going in the music business is, "Man,

2465
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,000
you missed the 80s and 90s. Sorry, kid.

2466
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:27,040
You know, this business is going down."

2467
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,679
You know, and Daniel with streaming made

2468
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,520
it so that, you know, these these major

2469
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,920
labels and these independent companies

2470
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,280
and, you know, these artists are able to

2471
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,520
do things they've never been able to do

2472
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,880
before. One on bringing that amount of

2473
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:43,360
revenue to our business, but two, also

2474
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,760
bringing our global community together.

2475
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:50,239
And uh and that was Daniel's foresight

2476
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:51,679
and his vision and his uh I mean he

2477
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,840
didn't have any relationships. He didn't

2478
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,960
know the major labels. Crazy, isn't it?

2479
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:59,920
You know, he he he saved the music

2480
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,199
industry. And I think now that you know

2481
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,800
he's the biggest thing in the music

2482
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:05,840
industry. It's easy to point at him as

2483
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,960
like the big bad. Oh, and yes, he's

2484
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,800
always trying to innovate and change,

2485
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,400
but he has brought more money back into

2486
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,840
our industry than we ever thought would

2487
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:16,080
be there. and um and I'm grateful to him

2488
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:19,600
and I think he he saved a lot of

2489
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:21,120
careers. I also would like to add a

2490
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,120
couple of words to that just to say what

2491
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:27,280
an unbelievably humble, smart, kind

2492
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,120
human being he is. It's an impossible

2493
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,560
story for it for to do what he did out

2494
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,560
of Stockholm as well, not Silicon

2495
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,080
Valley, and for it to be the dominant

2496
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,440
platform and still to be the best

2497
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,360
platform even as a podcast. It's my

2498
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,920
favorite platform by far. and they've

2499
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,040
just decided in the last 2 to 3 months,

2500
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,040
which is actually why I was over at

2501
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,480
Spotify's office to meet him, that

2502
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,600
they're going to start paying podcasters

2503
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,360
revenue that we've never been paid

2504
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,440
before. They're going to cut us in on

2505
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,120
the Spotify membership fee, which means

2506
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,639
that again, it's going to fuel this

2507
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,400
whole industry. Apple aren't paying us

2508
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,800
anything, but Spotify have decided to

2509
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,159
pay podcasters who upload on video,

2510
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,719
which is going to mean that people can

2511
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:02,840
quit their jobs and and focus. Daniel's

2512
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:06,239
a very innovative guy

2513
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,880
and I remember him as the kid I called

2514
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:10,480
on that list and who when he came to the

2515
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,800
United States a couple weeks later

2516
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,960
played me in ping pong eight times, you

2517
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:18,000
know, and that's how we became friends.

2518
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,880
And um he's incredibly humble,

2519
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,679
incredibly smart, incredibly

2520
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,920
hardworking, and he has changed a lot of

2521
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,760
people's lives.

2522
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,280
What's next for you, Scooter? Should I

2523
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,800
call you Scott or Scooter? Either one.

2524
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,360
And I'm proud of both now. Okay. I'm

2525
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:36,080
going to call you Scott. Okay. What's

2526
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:38,000
what is next in if we sit here in 10

2527
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:40,800
years time? Do you have any idea what

2528
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,159
that chapter looked like or do you have

2529
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,280
any idea what would have had to have

2530
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,360
happened for you to consider it a

2531
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:47,320
success?

2532
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:50,159
The only thing I want to make sure is

2533
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,840
that you know I stay I want to be the

2534
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:53,600
father to my children, right? That I

2535
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,800
that I want to be that I continue that

2536
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,000
that's the thing like that's the one

2537
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,520
consistent thing. I want to make sure

2538
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,280
that I put them first, that they are my

2539
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,199
priority because I get them until

2540
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,480
they're 18 and then, you know, they're

2541
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,159
going to be like, "Dad, we're out."

2542
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,760
Yeah. Um, and I'm still going to

2543
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:08,480
obviously look forward to the next

2544
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,400
chapter. But, um, I got 10 years of

2545
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,679
that. I think something I'm excited

2546
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,360
about the next chapter is like, what

2547
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,239
does love look like? What does

2548
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:18,400
relationship look like? Um, and then I'm

2549
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:20,560
excited to be a rookie again and try new

2550
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,360
things and get into industries cuz I I

2551
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,440
said to you before we started

2552
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:27,040
taping, you know, you asked me about AI

2553
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,560
and I said, I feel like we're in the

2554
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,760
beginning of an industrial revolution

2555
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,280
and a cold war at the same time, but

2556
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,639
there's just so much opportunity because

2557
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,000
things are shifting and things are

2558
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:39,120
moving and we're becoming a more

2559
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,719
productive society because like you,

2560
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,639
I've gotten to see some of the things

2561
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:45,760
that are coming on the technology side

2562
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,960
and it's mind-blowing what's coming and

2563
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,719
it's mind-blowing what's already

2564
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,360
happening that people a lot of people

2565
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:54,280
don't even realize and the innovation is

2566
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:56,719
going to get faster and faster and

2567
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,560
faster and I think the one thing that

2568
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:02,440
will never go away is humans want for

2569
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:04,400
taste for human error for

2570
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:07,840
experiences you know if anything during

2571
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:10,080
co we saw national parks explode people

2572
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,199
had time for experiences I think AI is

2573
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,040
going to make us more productive we're

2574
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,960
going to have more time for experiences

2575
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,400
and I'm excited for And I'm excited for

2576
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,920
what that world looks like. And I think

2577
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,880
there will always be growing pains when

2578
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,480
there's change. But on the other side,

2579
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,400
societies have always been measured by

2580
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,560
productivity, not by wealth. How

2581
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,080
productive is that society? We're about

2582
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,239
to be the most productive society we've

2583
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:32,080
ever been. It's quite it is quite scary,

2584
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:33,840
but it's also extremely exciting. And I

2585
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,440
think I think both responses are quite

2586
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,960
natural. I think excitement is often

2587
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:40,159
present where fear is. And um I the

2588
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,239
choice that I'm personally just making

2589
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:44,320
is to lean in and to mess around and to

2590
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,600
learn. When we spoke earlier, you were

2591
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,480
telling me that you'll stay up all night

2592
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,239
long like learning how to code with AI

2593
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,920
and you're trying to understand all the

2594
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:53,199
AI tools that are in front of us so you

2595
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,120
can kind of be first because you feel

2596
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,199
like, you know, you weren't at the right

2597
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:59,920
place in the.com boom and you want to

2598
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:03,840
make sure that you're in there.

2599
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:06,560
Can I ask you what you consider success?

2600
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,239
Is it you don't want to miss out? Like

2601
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,000
what what is the success? Why do you

2602
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:12,159
feel like you want to not miss out? What

2603
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,679
do you want to be first to? If you if

2604
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,600
you achieve something on the other side

2605
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,679
because you actually master AI and you

2606
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,440
are one of the first, what are you

2607
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:23,159
hoping happens? So, I think I'm trying

2608
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:28,960
I'm running from a fear and the fear

2609
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:30,960
is I'm 32 now and I've I've been playing

2610
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,880
at the frontier my whole life. So like

2611
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,480
my first business was in social media. I

2612
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,080
rode that wave into sure. It changed my

2613
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,679
life. I was relevant. It made me feel

2614
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,040
great. I built on on that frontier as

2615
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,239
the wave came into shore. Then the

2616
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,080
blockchain came around. started a

2617
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:43,679
company called Third Webb, valued $160

2618
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,600
million. Amazing. I was on the frontier.

2619
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,840
Then this AI thing comes along and it

2620
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,080
feels like the wave is coming in and I'm

2621
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,360
I've got a surfboard and I've got to

2622
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,800
decide whether I want to take this wave

2623
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:55,360
or not. And if I I feel like if I miss

2624
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,800
the wave, if I'm not involved, if I'm

2625
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:01,719
not building there,

2626
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:04,320
then it's quite existential. It's like

2627
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:06,880
then I don't know what can happen. And I

2628
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,120
don't like that. I don't like the

2629
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,880
unknown. And it goes back to many things

2630
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,880
we talked about, but I Do you ever swim

2631
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,800
in the ocean?

2632
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,560
Yes. I'm not the best swimmer in the

2633
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,800
world. I'm saying But you'll go in the

2634
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,159
ocean. Yeah. Not just in the beach. Will

2635
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,320
you go out in the ocean and get in the

2636
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:23,920
water? If I have my floating vest on cuz

2637
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,960
I can't I can't swim. Which is

2638
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,199
interesting though. You'll get in

2639
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,960
though. Yeah. Yeah.

2640
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:30,960
100%. I have a a top I wear to go in.

2641
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,639
No, I understand that. But I I find that

2642
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,679
interesting only because the ocean is a

2643
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,719
place where you have absolutely no

2644
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:37,760
control. Mhm. You know, it's the ocean

2645
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,679
can do what we want. You don't know

2646
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,800
what's in there. You know, a lot of

2647
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,320
people like I see when they want

2648
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,880
control. I realized there were years

2649
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:46,480
that I kind of just didn't swim in the

2650
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,920
ocean. I swim on the beach, but I didn't

2651
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:50,000
really want to go into the ocean because

2652
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,440
I didn't have control out there, you

2653
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,639
know? I didn't know what was in there. I

2654
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,080
didn't know what could get me. I didn't

2655
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,320
like I couldn't see it coming. I

2656
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,920
couldn't control the outcome. And you

2657
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,480
talk a lot about this like the need for

2658
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,719
control that makes you feel

2659
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:04,560
uncomfortable. But you are also a very

2660
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:07,440
big risk taker. I mean, you're 32 years

2661
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,880
old. You've achieved all this. You're

2662
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,560
pushing yourself to find out more.

2663
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,639
You're defying all the odds. You got the

2664
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,080
kid from home who's still talking crap

2665
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:16,880
because, you know, look at everything

2666
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,880
you're doing. And and I I guess I'm I'm

2667
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,159
intrigued

2668
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,960
because one, you don't give yourself the

2669
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:24,080
credit of how much you go into the

2670
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:27,040
unknown. It's almost like you do it out

2671
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:29,760
of fear and necessity, but I'm really

2672
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:32,239
pushing you on like what does success

2673
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,440
look like for you? Because you're on the

2674
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:35,199
surfboard. You keep surfing. I'm trying

2675
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,480
to figure out like where where is what

2676
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:41,199
is success to you? Is

2677
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:43,199
it you're you're 90 years old and you're

2678
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:44,960
looking back at your life. What are the

2679
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,400
things that you could not live without?

2680
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,560
You'd be disappointed if they weren't

2681
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:50,080
there.

2682
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,600
I imagine it's going to be my kids. I

2683
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,080
imagine it's going to be my relationship

2684
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,320
with my partner. I think that's the

2685
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,520
going back to this sounds like a crazy

2686
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,960
thing to say, but if there was a button

2687
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,159
on the table and I had to press it to

2688
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,760
kill myself or my partner, I'd press it

2689
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:03,119
to kill myself. And that was a really

2690
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,880
clarifying thought for me because I was

2691
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,800
like, I would literally take my I'd give

2692
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:10,480
my life to save this person, this other

2693
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:15,080
human being, my nieces, my brother, um

2694
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:15,080
my fam, my f my my family.

2695
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:21,199
I'm confused because you haven't named

2696
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:23,280
all the achievements of AI. Hello.

2697
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,800
Hello. You haven't named, you know, all

2698
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:28,880
the things that you think you need to

2699
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:30,480
do. You know, the um Ithaca. Yeah. Part

2700
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,159
of what I think makes the journey

2701
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,679
exciting is being like slightly

2702
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:35,920
terrified and having something that

2703
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,840
consumes you and that challenges you and

2704
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,440
that scares you a little bit and and

2705
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,920
building and experimenting and leaning

2706
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:43,679
in. Like when I was a kid in my bedroom,

2707
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,520
I'd turn my bunk bed into a business.

2708
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,400
It'd be a salon one week and then the

2709
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,239
next week I'd be dismantling my

2710
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,560
brother's radio and trying to sell the

2711
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:54,239
parts and like so I've always been

2712
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,199
extremely curious, extremely

2713
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:59,360
experimental. I've always tried to build

2714
01:38:56,199 --> 01:39:01,280
things. So I think that's my fun, but I

2715
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,400
also I these days the more I've done

2716
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:05,119
this podcast, the more I've learned to

2717
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:07,360
like question myself, question what I'm

2718
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:08,880
saying. Listen, I think you're an

2719
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,360
incredibly intriguing guy. That's why I

2720
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,880
wanted to meet you. And and I love how

2721
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,800
much you push yourself and you question

2722
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,480
things. But I find it very interesting

2723
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:20,080
that when I asked you about your 90s and

2724
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:22,080
when you look back, you name things that

2725
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,520
are very attainable to you cuz you found

2726
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,480
someone that loves you and you love

2727
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,400
them. Yeah. And then when we're talking

2728
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:31,520
throughout this entire

2729
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,600
conversation, it seems that when you

2730
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,719
actually open about your personal life,

2731
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,560
you spend a lot of your time avoiding

2732
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,560
that thing.

2733
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,560
and focusing on all these others that

2734
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:46,239
make you feel worthy to experience that

2735
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,760
thing. And I I guess like what I'm just

2736
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:50,239
trying to say to you, for as smart a guy

2737
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,760
as you are, this is coming from someone

2738
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:54,239
who literally suffered from the same

2739
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:57,280
thing.

2740
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:59,600
The thing that you want the most at 90,

2741
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,920
you got

2742
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:06,320
true. The building in your room and the

2743
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:08,080
building with AI should be just fun. H

2744
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,600
it shouldn't be terrifying anymore. It

2745
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,679
should be fun because the terrifying

2746
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,320
thing is turning 90 and not having the

2747
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:16,600
thing you really

2748
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:18,199
want. That's when I woke

2749
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,119
up.

2750
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:22,800
And so what does that mean for me? And

2751
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:24,000
what what for anyone that can resonate

2752
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,760
with that? What does that mean that they

2753
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,800
should do? I know you said like turn off

2754
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:30,000
the cameras and but can you do both? I

2755
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,600
don't know. I think everyone's journey

2756
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,119
is different. I think everyone

2757
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,560
experiences things in a different way.

2758
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,679
Some people are able to, like you talked

2759
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,239
about with addiction, some people are

2760
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,840
able to say just stop and other people

2761
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,199
can't. And other people have to go

2762
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,719
through a different process to get

2763
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:44,080
there. So I'm trying to understand the

2764
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:45,520
balance though. Like how do I know if

2765
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,600
I've got the balance right in that? I

2766
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,520
hate that word because uh someone I

2767
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,920
really admired said to me, harmonize,

2768
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,280
you know. Um so how do I know if Jeff

2769
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,280
Bezos was the one who said it? He was

2770
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:57,040
like, don't balance things, harmonize.

2771
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,040
Why why weigh things that you love

2772
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:02,320
against each other? You love building in

2773
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:05,679
your room. You love learning things and

2774
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,199
building things. You love that. You love

2775
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,760
your partner and you want to build a

2776
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:12,360
family with her one day. It's not about

2777
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,800
balance. It's about putting them

2778
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:16,320
together. Bring her into every aspect of

2779
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,480
it. Bring her into the fears that you

2780
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,080
have with this. Bring her into, you

2781
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,679
know, that's what I I you know, I didn't

2782
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,000
know that. You know, it's it's bring

2783
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:26,480
every aspect of your life together and

2784
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,480
share and let them be with the up and

2785
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,080
downs and you do do the up and downs and

2786
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,760
kind of go across the board. And then

2787
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:34,320
also, like I said, do the work to find

2788
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,320
out why you ask all these questions, but

2789
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,159
still with all the nudging that's

2790
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:39,520
happened, do the work to find out why

2791
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:42,000
you're so afraid to actually turn off

2792
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,159
the camera and just do it. So, are you

2793
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,159
saying then to get out of like

2794
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:47,840
competition and get into that curiosity

2795
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:49,679
that you described? You said about these

2796
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,719
two states that you can invest in. Look,

2797
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:54,320
I I think being competitive is always a

2798
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,040
beautiful thing if used in the right

2799
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:59,760
way. I love that. But I will say to you,

2800
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,600
when you talk to me about where the AI

2801
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,000
staying up at night, we're building your

2802
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,880
company came from, it was a kid building

2803
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,520
in his room. Mhm. That kid wasn't

2804
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:12,600
competing with anyone. He was having fun

2805
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,760
in his room. He was

2806
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:17,040
building. That's when you're at your

2807
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,199
best. It's when you're actually just

2808
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,119
building for the joy of building. And I

2809
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,800
think along the way, based on our fears,

2810
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,159
based on the I'm not enough, based on

2811
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,560
all these different things, we start to

2812
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:28,800
take that thing that brought us joy and

2813
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:31,040
we start to think if I don't crush it

2814
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,400
now that people are watching me do it,

2815
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:36,000
I'm not good at it.

2816
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:38,480
And you're asking me for like this

2817
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,760
question is almost if it's like advice.

2818
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:44,159
I'm trying to figure it out the same

2819
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:46,800
time you are. Yeah. You know, so I guess

2820
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:48,000
I'll pose it back to you. You've done

2821
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,000
research. Do you know a little bit about

2822
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,119
my

2823
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,239
life? What would you say to me? What

2824
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:55,199
should I be doing next? What do you

2825
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,199
think I should be nudged to

2826
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:06,560
do? I think what you're what you've done

2827
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,360
today is some of the most valuable work

2828
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,600
that you can do. And what I say today, I

2829
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:13,600
mean, is as you've sat here and the

2830
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,960
vulnerability that you've expressed, the

2831
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,920
honesty, the nuance to certain points, I

2832
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,119
think it's one of the most important

2833
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,320
things you can do because many of us

2834
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:23,280
don't get to climb up to the top of the

2835
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,360
mountain top and see what's up there.

2836
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,920
And you're choosing to go up there and

2837
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,119
then shout back down about your

2838
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:30,560
marriage, about business, about your

2839
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,159
mental health, and everything in between

2840
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,840
about mistakes you've made, injustices,

2841
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,199
all these kinds of things. probably one

2842
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,199
of the most powerful things you can do

2843
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:38,639
because as you you've identified

2844
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:41,760
there'll be a couple of kids, maybe me

2845
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:43,520
being one, who will not have to be

2846
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,199
burnt, not have to hit the rock bottom

2847
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,960
to learn the lesson. And there's

2848
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:48,600
actually very few people I do this for a

2849
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,800
living. There's very few people that

2850
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:52,719
have both that experience and the

2851
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,679
ability to articulate it in a way that

2852
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,920
is resonant in terms of this next season

2853
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:59,560
of your

2854
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:01,760
life. I mean, you're doing so much well.

2855
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,280
Like it was so nice actually hearing you

2856
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,560
on the phone to your kids yesterday when

2857
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,159
they came over and it was like dad I

2858
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,600
want a pencil or whatever he was saying

2859
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,199
and you were like Stephen you said to me

2860
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,239
I've got a you hung up the phone and you

2861
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,920
you addressed your kid you called me

2862
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:13,520
back in 10 seconds and I thought there

2863
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,199
was something really special and telling

2864
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,840
that you were willing to end a phone

2865
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:19,199
call with someone and put the phone away

2866
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,040
and immediately be present with your

2867
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:22,239
child to have a conversation with him to

2868
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,280
have a conversation then call me back

2869
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,639
straight away most people don't do that

2870
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:27,119
so I thought okay he's really this

2871
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:30,159
really means a lot to him in this season

2872
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:32,880
you know when when you just said me what

2873
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:34,719
I did here today. Yeah,

2874
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,400
I smiled cuz I was being really honest

2875
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,719
with myself and I really appreciated you

2876
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,480
saying that. But I also smiled cuz I was

2877
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:43,360
being honest with myself of how funny it

2878
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,360
is that when I leave

2879
01:44:43,639 --> 01:44:48,560
here, all I've been doing lately when

2880
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,520
I'm away from my kids is thinking of

2881
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:53,119
what do I build

2882
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,480
next so I can show my value. I'm going

2883
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,760
back to that old habit because I'm

2884
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,520
excited to build something else. But

2885
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:00,000
when I'm being really deep honest with

2886
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,679
myself, really going deep, it comes from

2887
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,480
this place of well, if I can do it

2888
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:08,719
again, then I'll show them.

2889
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,199
This time will be the one that I'm happy

2890
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,639
about. This time, like it's that same

2891
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:13,760
old thing that comes every single time.

2892
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:16,800
And I still want to build something

2893
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,000
because I get joy out of that. But same

2894
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,800
while I'm giving you this advice, when

2895
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,199
you said that to me, I went, "Oh

2896
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:25,360
man, he's right. This is the most

2897
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:27,600
valuable thing I could probably do." But

2898
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:31,239
the reason I don't do it is because deep

2899
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:34,800
down I feel not worthy of it. I feel

2900
01:45:31,239 --> 01:45:36,560
like who am I to tell anybody anything?

2901
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,960
You know, all of us, we feel like a

2902
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:41,199
fraud when we're giving any kind of

2903
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:43,440
advice. And that creeps up in me. And I

2904
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:46,080
I get to this very if I'm being very

2905
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:47,679
vulnerable, it gets to this place of I

2906
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,080
don't even want to say, "Oh, thank you

2907
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:51,199
for saying that." at first because I'm

2908
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,520
like, "Well, if someone's watching,

2909
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:55,639
they'll be like this arrogant guy or you

2910
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:59,280
get all the voices coming back in your

2911
01:45:55,639 --> 01:45:59,280
head." But the truth

2912
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:05,199
is, I want to go and build something

2913
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:09,280
next. I want to fall in love again. I

2914
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:10,960
want to be present for my children.

2915
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:14,000
And I want to be someone who can give

2916
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:16,560
advice from a place of wisdom and be

2917
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,760
proud that I give it but also receive it

2918
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,600
because I've learned just as much

2919
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:23,840
talking to you. And what I will tell you

2920
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,679
is you are way ahead of the game at 32

2921
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:28,159
compared to where I was. Thank you. And

2922
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,159
I had a lot of success at 32, but I

2923
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:31,520
wasn't asking these questions and I

2924
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:34,400
wasn't pushing myself the way you did.

2925
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,080
And I think it is an incredibly cool

2926
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:38,719
thing that this is what you get to do as

2927
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:40,679
a career cuz I think you get to help a

2928
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:43,840
lot of people.

2929
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:45,440
Um, and don't ever lose sight of the

2930
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,159
fact that the kid who was building in

2931
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:50,239
his room is now building in a lot of

2932
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:52,000
other people's rooms and it's really

2933
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:54,000
impressive. Thank you. That means an

2934
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,760
awful lot coming from you.

2935
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,880
I've been extremely excited by this

2936
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,719
conversation and I've been telling

2937
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,440
everybody in our team because of the

2938
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:04,000
conversations we have on the phone and I

2939
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,280
knew that if those conversations are any

2940
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,119
reflection of the conversation we'd have

2941
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,800
on my show it would be really pivotal

2942
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,750
for me and it has been. It's been the

2943
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,040
nicest punch in the face.

2944
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:16,880
[Laughter]

2945
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:18,119
Me too. Right. You know, people have

2946
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,800
probably wonder

2947
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:24,239
why

2948
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:26,000
I say all this stuff in public, but um

2949
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:27,840
what an unbelievable opportunity it is

2950
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,600
to meet someone like you and get to get

2951
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,920
to learn from you genuinely to get to

2952
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,960
learn from you. Like what an

2953
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,719
unbelievablely crazy thing from this kid

2954
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,520
from Botswana to get to meet someone

2955
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,280
like you and learn from you to the point

2956
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,040
that my life has a chance of being

2957
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,639
better than I've spoken to you. and then

2958
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,000
to get to share that with people who I

2959
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:45,199
know are struggling with the same [ __ ]

2960
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,760
who are contending with the same

2961
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:48,960
battles. So that is why I I make the

2962
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,840
decision to have these conversations in

2963
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,360
the way that I do. And um by the way, I

2964
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,800
just want just cuz I struggle with

2965
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,280
giving myself credit. I wanted to say

2966
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:00,400
this to

2967
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:03,679
you, the kid from Basana is teaching me

2968
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:05,080
as well. The kid from Cascap, you know,

2969
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:09,080
it's

2970
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:11,360
uh as much as like that's an incredible

2971
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:13,199
thing, I wanted to come on here because

2972
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:15,199
I've listened to your podcast before and

2973
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:17,840
I've been one of those listeners who

2974
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:20,719
grew and learned from it. So, thank you

2975
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:22,560
honestly and continue to give yourself

2976
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,639
the credit you deserve and continue to

2977
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,239
ask the questions. I do want to blow a

2978
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:27,679
little bit of smoke up your ass for

2979
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:30,400
something else that you've done because

2980
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:32,159
I don't think people have the all of

2981
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,080
this information, but when I looked at

2982
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:35,920
the breadth of philanthropic work that

2983
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,440
you've done, whether it's the support

2984
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,080
you gave to Manchester, which is the

2985
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,800
city that I consider my my hometown

2986
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:46,080
after the um Ariana attack. Ah, oh my

2987
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:48,159
god, you got a B on your arm. But all

2988
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,679
these other foundations, the list of

2989
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:52,800
philanthropic work that you've done is

2990
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,159
so long that I that I would have to we'd

2991
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,280
have to do another podcast just to go

2992
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,639
through all of these things. And you

2993
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,080
don't talk about it publicly. I don't

2994
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:59,920
see you posting about it all the time.

2995
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,679
So for me, that's always indicated that

2996
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,199
you're doing it for the right reasons,

2997
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,320
but it's incredible. So thank you for

2998
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,480
doing that as well. And you deserve

2999
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,400
credit that you never you never get for

3000
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:10,960
doing all of these things. And this

3001
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:12,239
inspired me as well because sometimes I

3002
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,719
think as entrepreneurs we can fall into

3003
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:16,800
the trap of thinking we we cut down the

3004
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:20,000
forest then donate to the bees. You

3005
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,199
know, my mom is the reason um she as I

3006
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,360
started building in college, she said,

3007
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:26,080
"Just promise me, you know, you'll do

3008
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:30,159
Sedaka, which is charity within our our

3009
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:32,239
culture to give back." And I basically

3010
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:34,400
said, "Every aspect of my business will

3011
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:35,760
have a give back component." And Shauna

3012
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,199
Neep, who runs our family foundation,

3013
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,760
like our job is to make the money, her

3014
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:41,199
job is to help me give it away. And um

3015
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,199
and sometimes it's with money, sometimes

3016
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:45,520
it's with effort. But I've met so many

3017
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:47,440
incredible heroes, unsung heroes in all

3018
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,480
this work. Um, people who really

3019
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:52,239
dedicate full-time their lives to this.

3020
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:53,760
And I really always I always say um my

3021
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:56,239
grandfather before he passed, he said,

3022
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,760
"If your glass is filling with water and

3023
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:00,159
you're one of the lucky people in this

3024
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,320
world that God continues to pour water

3025
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:04,080
into your glass, well, you better start

3026
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,679
pouring it into other people's glasses.

3027
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:08,800
Otherwise, it's just going to spill and

3028
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:10,880
make a mess." And I never forgot that.

3029
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,880
But even when you sold Hib, there was

3030
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,000
this tremendous amount of money that you

3031
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,600
turned around and gave to all the

3032
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
employees, which a lot of people don't

3033
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,400
know about. And you also gave money to

3034
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,760
several of your artists. And from what

3035
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,960
I've researched, tens of millions were

3036
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,840
given to your artists as well. And you

3037
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,280
could have kept all that money to

3038
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,639
yourself. So when I hear that someone's

3039
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,960
gone around and given that much money to

3040
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,719
264 of their employees and artists that

3041
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,639
have worked with them, you kind of get a

3042
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,840
picture of who the guy is. We have a

3043
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,440
closing tradition on this podcast where

3044
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,560
the last guest leaves a question for the

3045
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,400
next guest, not knowing who they're

3046
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:43,800
going to be leaving it for. And the

3047
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:43,800
question that has been left for you is

3048
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,080
now I'm nervous. Why do people always

3049
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:50,960
get nervous? It's like a lot of

3050
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:54,639
questions all day. The question left for

3051
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:56,960
you is if you could do one thing that

3052
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:59,360
fear of failure has kept you from doing,

3053
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,119
what would it be and why has it kept you

3054
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:06,270
from doing it? Man, if I could do one

3055
01:51:02,119 --> 01:51:09,489
thing, that's a really great question.

3056
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:09,489
[Music]

3057
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:16,800
Um, you know, at first I was thinking it

3058
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,920
would be like, oh, say sorry to somebody

3059
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,440
or this that, but I feel like I've

3060
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,800
gotten to do that with people in my life

3061
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,960
for the last couple years for things

3062
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,880
that like I wanted to kind of talk

3063
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,239
about. And some things you realize like

3064
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,800
it's just not the season for that. You

3065
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:30,480
know, it takes

3066
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:33,920
two. And I felt myself, it was almost

3067
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:37,520
the fear of saying this out loud. Um,

3068
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:41,440
write write a book. Oh, thank God. Yeah.

3069
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,960
I I've always uh I think it's it's my

3070
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,800
brother wrote a book, a really great one

3071
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,400
called The Promise of a Pencil, and it

3072
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,159
was a New York Times bestseller, and I

3073
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,840
was always like, "That's Adam's thing."

3074
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:51,840
And I've always wanted to write, but I

3075
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,199
always feel like my mind and, you know,

3076
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,480
the things I'm working on in myself, all

3077
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:56,480
these things, they change like every

3078
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:58,320
week. And I've always felt like deep

3079
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,920
down like, "Oh, yeah, you should write a

3080
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:02,159
book, but like you're really not going

3081
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,520
to write a great book if you do." And I

3082
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,960
think it's always held me back from

3083
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,960
actually just sitting down and doing it.

3084
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:09,920
I got goosebumps then because as in that

3085
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:11,840
silence for some bizarre reason I swear

3086
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,159
on my mother's I I was thinking I hope

3087
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,760
he says he's going to write a book. I

3088
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:16,800
swear to you that's what went through my

3089
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,000
mind. I went I hope he says he's going

3090
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,920
to write a book. That's why I went thank

3091
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,119
God. Well I didn't say I was going to

3092
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,960
write it. I said fear's been holding me

3093
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,400
back. But maybe maybe you'll turn off

3094
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,800
the camera and go in your nudge and this

3095
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:29,840
will be the nudge for me. Okay. Well, we

3096
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:32,400
hope you do, Scooter, because um I've

3097
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,000
been so shocked and blown away by your

3098
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,840
wisdom and your ability to articulate

3099
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,920
things and the stage of life that you've

3100
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,360
you've arrived at is for me as an

3101
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,880
objective observer just the perfect

3102
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:44,320
moment. I appreciate that and uh we'll

3103
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,000
keep doing the work together and this is

3104
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:48,239
the beginning of a great friendship and

3105
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,400
I'm really honored to be here and really

3106
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:51,679
happy for all your success. Thank you.

3107
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:55,199
The feeling is mutual. Thank you,

3108
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:56,800
brother. Thank you so much. Thank you.

3109
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:59,440

are never shown. We have the briefs that

3117
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:16,000

01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,520
conversation. We have clips we've never

3119
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,040
released. We have behindthe-scenes

3120
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,280
conversations with the guests and also

01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:26,400
released. and so much more. In the
