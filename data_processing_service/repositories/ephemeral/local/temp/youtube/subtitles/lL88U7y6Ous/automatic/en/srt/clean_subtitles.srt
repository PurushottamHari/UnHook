Thank you so much for your time sir. Um sir I want to start off with I think this might be one of the most interesting stories you were a part of. I'm sure you're part of several several interesting stories. Um take me back to February 2002 sir. What was happening to India and what was happening to you? Uh you are making me go to 2002. I will take you further back. Okay. Let's let me tell you from something from 1999. Okay, which is not new to anybody. Everybody knows what happened in 1999. Cargill conflict was what was there in 1999. G sir. So in 1999 when this conflict broke up I was you know somewhere in south. So initial part of that being in air force and being a transport pilot little bit things we did connected to the conflict you can say. However, very soon things change and we have something known as staff college you know there where we learn about military studies and things like that. So I it's a selective course you appear you know what do you call it uh for entrance exam and things like that and then selected army navy air force officers go there so I was selected for that so I moved out to Wellington that is near right so 1999 conflict was on somewhere in north and we were in south cooling our hills in the hills right So after this staff college there is something known as choice posting that's why now you'll realize why I'm taking you to 99 okay right so uh that choice posting is given provided there is a vacancy also yeah choice posting that is a place that is a kind of a course which is quite considered a kind of a career course okay so they do give you so I Being me I asked for Chandigat. Okay. Why Chandigat will be your question. Chandigat is a you know uh biggest place for transport SC and it not only biggest it is one of the most operational transport base of Indian air force. Why? Because entire north sector is being looked after by that place. So that is the importance of Chandigar. And when you are speaking to me if you don't know what is air force station chandigar then you don't know me. So I in the beginning only mentioned that fair right. So I asked for chandigar. got Chandigar 2001 somewhere in August September I was there and uh as I reached there in 1999 Cargill conflict cargill airfield was not available right reasons were there like number one the runway was not available it is too close proximity to Pakistan right it's surrounded by hills as any airfield in Himalayas right Okay, when we come to this first we are going to speak about that that what is the difference between a airfield at Delhi and airfield in Himalayas. So that will come when we reach the point right as of now I'll tell you I reached there and I was given a task to operationalize this car airfield once again because we did feel little bit of problem during the conflict that if this airfield was available things would have been better airfield carg but inactive and you were tasked to reoperationalize it because uh there was a kind of a you know water body moving along the runway. They put some pipes and things like that. But over the period of what happens is nonuse also makes the thing go bad. Haha sir. So exactly this happened to the airfield. Take. So I was tasked to go talk to the engineers and that airfield that time was with civilians. We have two types. Airfield man by civilians. Airfield man by military. Air Force person. Right. Air Force person. Right. Not military. Exactly. Uh now army has very few but they are small helicopter you mostly air force right. So I went there then there was discussion how this should be brought up and things like that and things started moving. So somewhere in 2001 only I think August September I did a a trial landing there after the runway was made serviceable right thereafter I went once again. Now we should talk about what is Cargill all about. Why why why it's so different or difficult or challenging or a lot of words are used for the Cargill air base. Air base any any air base for that matter. We are going to speak quite a bit about Himalayan airfields. Huh? Can you pull up Cargill Air Base here? Yes sir please. So we can uh surely talk about it first as of now. Right. So all these airfields firstly you have to understand that in in you have only you don't have plane area there right and if you look at the runway you normally require at least 3 km distance flat land yes sir and not only flat land flat land to make the airfield right then you require something to for that aircraft to fly from there at an angle of some degrees to come to the runway key. It cannot be like this. Yes. It can't be vertical. It has to be from a distance you have to get to a point where you are 000 height. So it's a nice steady. Right. Gradual decline. Gradual decline. Right. Right. Right. Okay. So you have to have some space below before also and after also. So I said 3 km runway another 10 10 km either side. Right. So something like as open space finding an Himalay is a very difficult thing. Right. So when I land at Delhi and when I land at Cargill, it is a different ball game all together. You would say Delhi is a lot easier. Why? Because it is in planes. Yeah. It's geography. Cargill is surrounded by huge mountains. Okay. Right. To add to the degree of difficulty, Pakistan ports are very close by. So those guys are also trying to do funny games. Rightly so. So what do you do to land at such places is you come over at that airfield okay above the airfield to Delhi I have used instruments also and I have come and landed there in hills instrument don't help you much so it cannot be a computerized landing you cannot because it's not a gradual planned activity okay computer requires something very very planned the rate of descent has to be accurate it has to be some constant factor there right there's No consistency, no constant factor in this activity. So you come overhead of the airfield and kind of a do a spiral descent they call it, right? And establish yourself finally nicely with the parameters desired on finals that is some distance 10 to 15 km away from the runway. So it's a tricky business in short. Plus add to the issues weather ever changing weather winds are strong if it is snowing then visibility is lower okay right proximity to the line of control as I told you right okay and there are other elements okay like to establish at the correct path at correct place you have done lot of circus and now after that circus you are wanting to get stabilize that aircraft and again reconentrate on a activity which is known as landing. Let me tell you in aviation there are two more most important things. One is takeoff and second is landing. In between part is you can say a bit cooler. Okay. Right. But these are critical areas. Okay. This you do too well and things fall in place. So because of this I had made out certain parameters how to go how to land. So we call it something known as SOP that is standard operating procedures right. So I made that airfield was earlier used but was not used for long. So all these new things which are to you have to collect intelligence how the neighbor of us might behave behave look at the aspect of us opening and operationalizing math. So you have to you have to know that right right. So that was done, everything was done and I did a landing I think April first one and the second one was in August right then I told you them few things like what more repairs required things like that and somewhere in uh on 19th Feb 2002 from 99 now we can move there came the day when I was told that that airfield has to be inaugurated now inauguration means you know all organiz have their own way of doing things. Right. Right. So there is a little bit of pump and show little bit of gathering of people. Okay. Because it was a thing which was the whole country was looking at when it is going to likely to be done. So rightly my boss had decided to be there. My boss means I am in I am Chandigat. Chandigar is comes under western air command. All this area is a western command. So my boss was there. So he decided to be in the aircraft and with me and to go go there and nice it gives a nice feeling to a I was a wing commander then. Okay. So hope you and your viewers know a little bit about rank. I can tell you a difference between a marshall and a wing commander is four ranks. Okay. Okay. that will be easier and better right so you see the difference right and he's my boss he's not my boss direct I have a boss known as commanding officer who has a boss who is air officer commanding who has a boss who is known as saso and then his boss is so my yes it is super boss super boss so my super boss had decided that I will go with chafka so a man my super Super boss is not qualified on this aircraft. Get it straight. Okay. He may be a fighter pilot. He may have flown. Okay. He may be award winner. He may be gallantry award winner all. But when aircraft changes, let me tell you things change. And here there is a change of fighter to transports. Big change. Big change. Right. You can say it is a a gradient. What seniority of people sitting together also makes a difference to CRM that is cockpit resource management. If there is a very high ranking guy and a very low ranking guy, what will be the tendency? You know, yeah. One will it's for all organization. Right. Right. Right. He's a boss and you are the subordinate and solo. So he's going to talk about his experience, his knowledge which may be outdated. Let me tell you, huh that a fact of life. These are fact of life. I also grew and retired as a Marshall. So I know it. So it's not a matter of how much how many stars I'm putting on my shoulders. It is more whether I'm connected to that activity of flying. Right? So me and my boss said it was decided that uh Chaveer will be the captain and captain means two things we do. I sign for the aircraft. I sign for the aircraft means now anything going wrong right for the aircraft is my responsibility because authority and responsibility go together right so there is somebody five ranks sitting above me who is my super boss but once I enter the aircraft I am the responsible person you are the captain yes sir and this is what is the biggest thing in any aircraft whether it is a ship it is a aircraft and in civil, commercial, air force, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere. So things are clear now. Yes sir. That I'm the captain but my boss is boss. Yes. Right. Right. So we I positioned at Delhi. Right. Right. Quick briefing was done. Okay. Now let me tell you it was August 2001 when I last went there. Right. And then they did some repairs. I must have gone on ground there to check. But again flying wise I'm going there and in Himalayas flying is very tricky. High mountains the instruments like GPS and all misbehave at times not very accurate. So your eyeball is the best best judge. Yes sir. If you see you believe that is why you come overhead and do that activity right? So we went there weather was quite okay not too bad as it should have should be in Feb. Feb it is snows that place so lot of snowing so white all over right little bit of clouding above which was also white so there's a phenomena something known as white out everything is white on the ground above also in the sky is all cloudy white going so there is kind of a white ball in which you are entering it's a white ball Okay. So we fly basically looking at the horizon. Right. Right. Right. Right. Horizon. So you require some reference. So it is horizon. With this ball formed it's a bite round. So you are not very sure where is the horizon now. So you go undo instruments and the degree of difficulty increases. Yes. That's it. Firstly high hills. So you're flying at certain height. Okay. Visibility not too good. closer to the border then you have to go over it so degree of degree and you are landing at 10,000 so power output of the aircraft and many many other things so it's a difficult activity in short challenging but we are used to it it's a military operation so we do it our way right so we went as usual that day I had go had to go from Delhi to overlay then turn left that day we continued continued uh now what has happened is as I was navigating I just looked to the left and I felt uh oh something not up to it why I'm seeing the cargill town slightly to the left h cargill town is a small place okay it's not like Delhi that you can see from the glow from here or see the place from far off and I told you the weather conditions anyway anyway so I looked at life left and I said oh there's something oh there cargle town oh let's turn left we are slightly to the right of track that was as I put on bang to the left that was kind of a third now how do you explain the third [Music] So we call it thud something banged. Normally what happens is birds can be there. Okay. So we thought uh something like that maybe but as I was thinking what it could be my cockpit flashed with lot of lights. We have a system emergency system okay which has got a master warning. It's a amber colored big light. It starts flashing and in your ears you can hear a Russian girl telling you in emergency use a girl. Yeah. It's Russian calm you down. Whether you calm down or not is not up to you. At least let no it's not up to you and you don't but anyway they have tried. Isn't it? Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. So the girl started saying right engine on fire right engine on fire. And now the right engine fire warning starts blinking. Okay. So you know these emergencies in a pilot's life are quite they are known as critical emergencies and you wake me up from a sleep I will tell you the action they are by rote because they cannot be delayed. Actions cannot be delayed. So I quickly looked at the parameters and I knew I have some problem with the right engine. So in a transport aircraft you have to shut down the engine. Now32 the aircraft we are talking about is a twin engine aircraft two engines. So if you shut down one still you can fly but under few restrictions. We'll talk about them as we go ahead. All right. So first thing you have to do is something happens to the engine you have to shut the engine because there is a propeller right. Mhm. It creates drag and creates more problem in the aircraft. So we call it something known as feathering it. That means take the propeller in a direction of the wind so that least resistance it gives to the wind and just rotate slowly. Got it. Got it. Got it. No drag. No drag to less issues. Less issues. So I feathered the aircraft and I realized it is a fire. So there is a drill. We have fire extinguishers. We have engine fire extinguisher. We have wing fire extinguisher. We have other fire extinguishers. So we fire from inside. But you have to switch off the engine. Otherwise, the fire extinguisher entire damn thing will wreck the engine. No, it will blow off by the wind. Ah, okay. Fire extinguisher has to go to the fire, right? If the propeller is proper is rotating, it will just go out. Say, so I have stopped the propeller. So that is not going to happen. I operated the fire and I quickly told my flight engineer to go behind and see how much is the fire. M. So while he was going I was doing other actions like switching of fuel, switching of oil to that engine because these are inflammable things right. He came running he says now fire has spread to the wing. But what had happened is when I sent him few actions I had not done. So I was now sure key there will be easing of the fire. So I sent him again. Now this time he got the good news because I have switched off the oil and fuel. He says now only fumes are coming. So while I am doing all these actions I was turning to the left as I told you because I saw Cargill town right. Okay. Right. So slightly short of Cargill town is Cargill airfield. So we kept turning left. Now your viewers need to know one thing that a twin engine aircraft it is if it is flying at level 240 which we by flying and then descending then it cannot maintain 240 on single engine. So it has to come down. It is known as drift down. Aa it's a natural process. You have no choice because it was sustaining that height with two engines. Now you have means bas common sense but here there is a problem in Himalayas you can't go down because there are mountains below so it's a tricky situation once again so for that tricky situation to resolve we have something known as emergency procedures known as escape routes means if something like this happens and the aircraft has to be brought back to some other is you follow the escape route. What is escape route? You get into valleys. Now normally you don't fly into valleys because some are very narrow, navigation is difficult, confusing, there are some blind valleys, lot of issues but these are designated ones. So you get down it is scary. No no valley. [Music] it's a field also and actually at some places it is like that also okay and plus you have a emergency let me tell you that yeah yeah you must be scared for life yeah so you are pressurized and here there is one more pressure that the gentleman to left is not uh what do you call uh trained on this type and he's my super boss so his inputs are coming galore okay but I know whether they they are to be taken or not right right so I am talking to you today means I have not taken his instructions simple as that right I follow because I am I'm the boss right right the captain I explained you in the aircraft I am the boss and I have to behave like Right. Very easily said difficult to do especially fis. Okay. Hierarchal thing you know better. Yes. It's not some corporate that you can do little panga and change your job tomorrow. No sir not for me. Right. But you know when such things comes you are trained for that. Military people are good at it and I am basically like that. Okay. as you talk to me more you will come to know it's a kind of a your own value system personality traits whatever you call it so I ignored flew for 31 minutes and brought the aircraft back to Lei oh you brought it back to Lelay yes this is one of the only aircraft up till now in the history of Indian air force which had had a single engine were not if there I don't know our history maintenance is pretty bad let me tell M okay that's why I have written a book on all this so that at least when people next time think about it they know that somebody has already done this. Mhm. So this must be the first. Okay. And 31 minutes is a long long long long time for being in a escape route on a single engine with one engine switched off because of fire. The reoccurrence is not totally out of the question. Scratched out. Yes sir. Yeah. So I landed there. You cannot you have to land. It is a must land situation. Why? Because now you have only one engine. If you have two engine if your landing is not coming up. Okay. At times at airfields happen newspaper right? He came bounced and went out and passengers were scared. Here there is no choice. You can't bounce and can't go because you have only one engine. You don't have takeoff. You don't have that power. Right. So it's a must land situation. In that must land also inputs are coming but I know how to do it. So I have come land. Okay. Different parameters are there as I landed brought the aircraft in the dispersal and we came down. Now what we have thought in the cockpit when I'm doing all this action it is a okay hit the nail on the head. Right. Okay. But you will very soon know no you haven't. It's not chia. Let's see. Let's see. You you are listening to a story now. Right. Right. Right. Okay. For you it is story for me it is lifetime act action right okay I'm today we are sitting in front of each other and talking because it I did it that way right right yes sir so it be so stories are somebody's you know for somebody it is a story for somebody it is a lifeline right for me it was one came out of the cockpit there was a inquisitiveness rightly so because what happened why when we came out we saw so right wing below Oh fuselage there was a small hole and that engine is above the aircraft in this there's nothing secret about it right so from there it went went came came out from the engine right engine so when it came whatever it was when it came out it made a bigger hole. Oh wow. So this was a smaller hole maybe of uh uh 10 1 ft there. when it came out it was 3 to 4 ft di okay so it had ribbed the right engine and it was a clear indication it's a missile and not chidia so we were fired upon by some missile and I'm assuming this was Pakistani missile of course because there's nobody else there nobody else there it can't be our people doing such big mistake impossible out of question they know how to identify they know the programs they know all that is this missile. Did you find debris of this missile? No, no. The debris and all you don't find because I am in hills. Okay. Where it has happened is thick jungle nothing. They won't stick to the body of the No, no, no. It it is it has gone like a projectile and just cross. Please understand. It's a kinetic energy. Pure kinetic energy. So here comes the interesting thing. This missile or any other missile which is shoulder fired has got two fuses. Some may have three, four. Let's talk about this right so what these two fuses do one is known as heat seeking other is impact heat seeking means wherever maximum heat of that aircraft is emitted it lands up that side where will be that common sense exhaust exhaust not even engine exhaust because there the heat is been thrown out right moment is coming through the exhaust it enters the exhaust and blasts right if that doesn't work. That fuse may not work. Depends on angle of fire, where it hit all all crazy things. Too technical to go on now. Yeah. But that is enough for us. Second is impact. So now it will hit somewhere. As it hits that body, it will blast. Understood? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On impact the fuse will then why in my aircraft it went like a projectile. Why? Both have failed. Uh so sometimes such a good thing should happen so that you and me can speak. Sir God can listen to uh Chave's Praar incidents. Right. Right. Your name is Praar. Your action is Praar. Absolutely sir. Today I'm proud of my name sir. But what a coincidence because this would have been if it would have blown up there would be a different story or remains no story. No story right basically because then it would have gone into secrecy that doesn't remain story if such things happens and let me assure you it would have been Cargill too it would have begun again why is sitting on the left your super boss he's the head of the western command yes sir it is not a joke okay so aircraft coming back was a good thing okay so what how how do we achieve how we have reached here right the excellent training of Indian air force Indian air force pilots whether it's any fleet transport helicopters fighters okay I am in Indian air force so I'm not saying so your Sindur has again proved it are one of the best in the world I just want to know sir what happens to okay if a civilian like myself somebody who's fairly courageous somebody who's thought of which is to not say much but I could take care of myself but if I was in a plane like this I would probably be sweating profusely but I know the armed forces are trained very differently what is going through your mind when something like this happens or another soldier another flight pilot what is going through the mind of somebody when this happens you'll be surprised nothing other than what I have to do so I have to that is what saves us Right. Critical emergencies as I mentioned last time when we were discussing I said you wake me up from asleep I will just blabber out the answer. You just I will just blabber out the answer and my hands will move. Such such is the grilling in me for this critical emergencies as we call them. Do you and fire is one of the most critical emergencies. Now see the circumstances closer to the Pakistan border. In the hills where I cannot go down, cannot go up. Okay. Right. Super boss on board. Wow. Okay. And fire on the engine. Luckily fire elsewhere you can't afford now. Right. If there is pressure, this is pressure. Like if you think about it, I wonder sirim for training this. See so we talk like this like I if I'm an instructor you are my pupil right I will tell you prahar your left hinges are on fire now do your thing cut you do simulation simulation in simulation you do quite a few actual also like you have to switch off the engine so you have to say here I switch off the left engine so I will give you this emergency at a decent place where there is no danger and you can practice actual switch off of the engine got my Got it. Got it. Got it. So that is why instructor's importance is so much because he's also catering for the mistake of that bugger who is sitting on the left. Right. Right. Right. Right. He is controlling the aircraft. He's supervising the aircraft. He's responsible for aircraft. He's the man who has authorized himself for the aircraft. So it's he's all What about crash landing sir? Crash landings trainings or SOPs? Yeah. You know crash landing a term is not a very uh right term because crash and landing are the opposite. Exactly. Exactly. So crash landing and huh and transport aircraft especially we try and bring back the aircraft as much as possible. And in this case I'm telling you you did why? Because you have to do the actions of fire drill immediately. Otherwise if the thing spreads that left wing right wing in my case will just snap off burn off and snap off and then it's over. So then your airplane disbalance. No it's over. That's there no discussion. There's no discussion. But sir for instance crashing be simulate training. Yeah but that is not mean in the manner in which you actually but yes do you do you are on finals you say this this has happened to you. you do that and how when does a pilot think ejecting is the only because last one of the last options now we are mixing two things yes we are right I agree I am talking about for transport aircraft transport we are talking ejection is only in fighter aircraft yes sir I know I'm I'm asking about fighter so but what is the common thing both are thinking of the same thing to bring the aircraft back to safety however both have got their red lines different. Where I will stop is slightly ahead. Where he will stop is slightly behind. As in that they are because because he has a aircraft which has capability wise is different. Aerodynamically it is different. It has his lift capabilities are lesser. He distance he can travel without engine is different. He has got a jet engine. I have got a travel of engine. many many complications but I told you commonity is we will try and bring that damn thing right tight it's a it's a purely curiosity question sir uh you may not have a specific opinion about it but I'm just trying to wonder what is happening to somebody like a captain Abhinandan when he has to eject like what is the training he's getting boss you can get you you might have to eject in opposition territory you might get stuck there what are you allowed to say how are you allowed to conduct yourself because the videos we saw of him a very graceful conduct regardless of the pressure around him. What is that like in the air force? It is critical emergency once again answer is same right for me critical is this. Yes, for him critical is this also. So it's all taped up here what to say what not to say and there are no way you can take out anything more than that and international law is there. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That also gives you protection. Whether rogue country like Pakistan does it or not is a different issue. Completely separate matter more. So we are trained that much. Got it. More. Talk to me about operation zindu sir because I'm work in media. So I keep very narratives etc. And the Pakistani people are delusional is no there's no second guessing it. I don't say this to dump on them. But realistic fact of life. Part of that narrative is air force key superiority over Indian air force key superiority is proven delusion no doubt but shed light on exactly how would you compare you faced the Pakistani air force in your time in service you faced it you are probably very abressed with what happens these days how do you compare Indian air force and Pakistani air force you know if you make comparisons you know there it's a continuous process let me tell you as I told you earlier also aviation is one part of uh the whole thing which is ever improvising, ever improving, ever advancing. Okay. So this cat and mouse game sometimes Pakistanis may have better equipment, sometimes we may have better equipment. However, I believe and not because I am from Indian Air Force. I believe it and the whole world believes that the man behind the machine that matters. Interesting. And let's as proud Indians be very clear about one thing that in India that man behind machine is one of the fantastic guy whose training is superb. His you know attitude towards work is different and its patriotism is way way way beyond any others. I'm not comparing here. I'm just telling about what as a Indian I feel. Right. Okay. So these three aspects are much much more important which were shown in Sindur again not only for pilots but for the people who were behind the radars the air defense system of ours. those ones who were firing the missiles, those one who were looking at the radar signatures and identifying the Pakistani drones or aircrafts and retaliating. So that is also man behind machine. Yeah, he's not a pilot. No, but let me tell you his training is also so good that what machine you're using is a very very disciplined aspect. Yes, I agree. We should modernize, we should get better. Okay, we are authorized to get better. But why I'm telling you this point is that we do with what we have and compensate with our skill where the machine lacks one. Got it? But but we are not way behind. Yes, there are problems. We are a democratic country. It is not like China or communism that you just order uh when the question of gun and bread comes, you don't say guns. M you said we say bread. Yes. Right. Right. Right. Right. So if we have to say bread and still have to consider your secretary and have guns then this is the via media and which we are adopted very well. Our army is one of the best army which can operate in mountains. Interesting. Let me assure you that our air force is one of the best air force especially probably high altitude air forces. Not only high altitude our pilots, fighter pilots are one of the best in the world which has been proven time and again in international excise. We are not I am not saying I'm sitting here I am from a FOS so I am not saying so you can go through Google it read about international excise and you will find their people saying so interesting okay and after Sindur there's a chap who I forget the name now if I recollect I will tell you Cooper I think okay he's a specialist he's a specialist in warfare okay and he's from US and his interview was taken I think by NDTV or one of the channels I'm not very sure which you can check you being from media right he very clearly tells there that what has happened in Synindur I will tell in one sentence okay Indian air force has won hands down right this is a statement then he goes on explaining for 45 minutes what that means why why he's saying so but let me tell you just because Chafer is from air force is not saying so it is fact of life so when you compare with Pakist Pakistan. Okay. Uh that comparison itself is not uh worth it is is will be my blunt answer. I understand blunt answer because the very things which are work behind the machine are are more more important and more more better off than what we keep discussing about. Very interesting. Um sir speak to me a little bit about na crop of pilots young pilots. I'm sure you interact with them. How are they different from pilots of your time? Uh let me tell you no major difference. Okay. Okay. The aircrafts have changed. The aircrafts have changed. Okay. What I had what I flew. Okay. When I was uh moving out of air force, I brought this aircraft in. Why I say I? I was a part of it. Right. I was in airord at that time looking after the transport fleet. So C130, C17s have come my time. M okay so I know I've been in the cockpit I have not flown them but I in the cockpit fed the aircraft from US and uh UK sitting in the cockpit so I know the machine is different it's modern avionics is good it's easier but it is complicated you know you are relying too much on technology then you have to be prepared that much for the failures your technical failure means absolute failure right and when I talked about you know cargill. Mhm. Okay. Then we move to Synindur but so I'll take you back to Cargill. I will say Cargill kind of thing happens in uh every 30 years more than that. Not many go through such things. Right. Okay. Yes. I am the one who which have who has seen a kind of the lowest of what a pilot sees, right? And the highest what a pilot sees. And that's why I believe in one thing which I keep telling time and again that and it is applicable to all all your listeners whether he's in a corporate he's a bank he's a teacher whatever he is that failure is not fatal success is not final is the courage that matters which makes you continue what you are doing and my story tells you that here is a man who has gone through a missile attack. Okay. His boss is super boss is in the cockpit. You know what happens thereafter. Organizations all are same. Okay. Uh leadership I have learned from what not to do also. So that will suffice. Yeah. That you don't only learn from what to do. Yes. There's a misnomer. Okay. Yes. The person sitting in front of you can tell you. You can even learn from what not to do by observing it. Right. He did it. tomorrow when I become a boss should I right no I didn't like it so I should not do it don't do that to others which you yourself would like others to do it to you so mine is from failure that is in uh military terms displeasure to gallantry is my story okay so displeasure you have heard failure you have heard now we move on to gallantry yes okay and that is equally interesting but it is on a different border now this thing of uh from Pakistan border yes I have moved to China border and you know how how I was a wing commander I told you this thing happened organization let me tell you one before moving to all for everybody no organization is bad organization we keep cribbing everybody you me everybody says organization they don't do I am a firm believer and I have been through it so I can tell you with lot of assurance organization is always good and that is why you saw wing commander chafikar having a dreaded thing like this accident and retiring as a air marshal right right it has to be a just organization then only it is possible okay there are people few who may be not up to it so I had my own problems. Okay. But organization was very fair to me in that I will tell you I was put back as flight commander of the same Chandigaren served there post accident even I was captain of their I took responsibility for the accident because that is my job authority responsibility. I said yes but navigational error I will not because there is a long story that we wouldn't go through. So then uh they requested I told them only one thing. Yes, I know organization is good but I will just like to have a break break from this whole thing now to just come out of it. So give me some posting which really I can work well and so they asked me request. So I requested my hometown Nagpur and in NCC because I had this point of view you know how much you bring up more youngsters in life things will be much much better for this country. Agreed. Okay. I believe in it until I believe that's why I'm in front of you coming from Napur to Delhi and talking about why because I have a passion for this. Okay. what society gave me up till now I'm going to give back to society full way. So then I went to a place uh my rank was due. I was a wing commander. Now I was to become group captain. I knew displeasure of my career problem but I still cleared. Okay. So I went to one place known as Agra. It's a big transport base in Asia. I was chief operation officer there. Right from there I was posted to East. East I had done two tenures already. So you know [Laughter] only knows whether they know or not it's left to them. Yes. So then they posted me too. Me being me I don't take things you know just I always say no no so I represent it. I said why you are doing this 6 months my boss got posted out so 6 months they said chief operation officer has to stay a big base lot of foreign aircraft and all come so I stayed there on 1st of Jan 2008 I was posted to Chandigar back again where I had the accident right look at the organization how just it is right as commanding officer of another squadron which is positioned there I took over on first Jan 2008 and now my super boss last story super boss my super boss was you know wrong things you should not and right things you Right. My boss was air marshal Barbbora who is no more. Okay. Late air marshal Barbbora. He took over on 1st Jan 2008 as WAC CNC and I took over as CEO one of the Scots. Right. So he came in to our place in Feb. Sir I have a question. Um I just want to know I think it is the movies but the very aspect of flying a fighter plane is uh glamorized. Is it actually like this when you're sitting in? Is it that fast and the geforce and what is it like? Stupid question. No no no it's not stupid. It's quite genuine. It's quite good. Okay let me tell you when you are driving in a car right? If you are at 100 kilometers or you are 80 kilometers, can you make out? Barely. Same. Answer is same. So just huh. Okay. Answer is same. It's not the speed. It's not the thing. It's the question of occupancy. Huh? In fighters, you are a single occupant of the cockpit. Your workload is going to be more high. Your speeds are higher. you are uh because of acceleration the G forces which are acting on you are more. So the job definitely requires some additional thing because of which the very selection is also looked into that way. Physiological G. Okay. Psychomoot motor skills. Okay. Reflexes. Okay. And tolerance to the whole thing. And you are alone in the cockpit. You have to do what you Yes. The ground forces are helping you out. Radars are there. Support is more not like a transport aircraft. You're not going trans transatlantic. You are within your but yes things are there which differentiate. But the requirements are different in transport flying. As I told you, CRM is a very important aspect. How to deal with people. Mhm. Right. Right. Right. Okay. You can't be say navigator you don't know I'm doing this right. No. Mhm. You have to take all inputs. Finally, you will decide as a captain. But there he's all alone and his job is to kill. Right. Let's face the fact of life. Me, I was posted on 1st Jan 2008. My boss Major was posted on 2008 1st Jan. We met in Feb. Okay. Right. And we have a system. If a boss comes, you tell him about your things like that how nice it is going. Same like any corporate. Yeah. He was a very dynamic person, a leader how he should be. or chafer can tell it dun because he has seen seen both types. Okay. So here is a man. I told him sir I have a something to present to you more after this routine briefing. He said yeah go ahead. So I told him sir there is a airfield near China border name is Dawat Guli. It's very close to border. So not that in the thick of war and all it will be useful but it is will be useful. It is highest airfield in the world. Aa it is the highest airfield in the world. It is just 2 and a half km from China border. Okay. And all these years we were not going looking that side because you know Chinese that psychic psyche of this other than 65 we didn't do much. So tactical action. So he says okay present. So what I presented him I will tell you in short quickly because time I think is going to be premium. Number one, no air no aircraft in the world can land beyond 13,500 and switch off his engines. No sir oxygen very as you keep going up the partial pressure oxygen oxygen but within one square meters the amount of oxygen is going to reduce. Right. 16,700 45% oxygen 32,000 34,000 so it becomes so 16,700 00 ft. There is no aircraft in the world which was to land there. Yes. Question will be that will come later. No. Second problem. Huh? I want to know right now. No. Second problem closer to China border very close to China border. And let me tell you China something they have developed a you know huge net of railways and roads which is well known all the border everywhere. We have none. Till then we had none. Right. This airfield was there somewhere in 1962. Somebody landed there once. Okay. It is not as I operational. No, it was not because one earthquake came. [Music] China border close number surrounding hills. So it's a bowel literally like this the bowel and the base of the bowel is airfield. Wow. Straight ahead as the crow flies 12 to 13 km is Kardungla Palas. Uh not Kardungla Karakuram pass. Okay. Karakuram. Huh. Okay. Right. Which south side is north is right. And this airfield was not being activated for last 50 years. Right. So why I told you these three reasons maneuvering is very very difficult there is China performance from sea level to what height you can operate. Graph temperature no temperature elevation and engine output landing. So as a military operation [Music] ground. This was Feb and present presentation. I will call a lot of people there expert each. So young now group captain of course right heaviness on the shoulder has increased right but rank difference boss was sitting as the chair soil expert was called now why this airfield is not only surrounded by mountains but it is katcha it's not concrete it is not concrete it is not bitamin why answer is sameteam Say helicopters 26.5,7 But okay, soil experts, aviation experts, then I will call the technical people and we will talk to AM32, OEM, original equipment manufacturer. captain airmil it is a civil agency by the way soil expert don't do it soilh Strength is not enough. [Music] Board of Physibility of some landing. Don't do it leadership. Now air marshall borrow just got up and he said chaffer will tell you why it should be done. M so the junior most officer in that forum went up and I told him I'm not a soil expert I will talk technical which I know okay and as a aviator but I'm very sure they are wrong I'm right as a military operation we should do it because it's a very strategically important point or watch my words if we try anytime that this airfield will have immense importance. Interesting. It is very next to Saksham Valley. Sichan glacier. East of that is DBO. Norththeast of that is Sakam Valley which has been handed over by Pakistan to China. And they are very interested in DBO area and those dlama and all that because they don't have route from Akai Chin to Sakam Valley. They have to go round about over DBO if they go will be able to stay in the back. Yes. [Applause] Got it. Got it. Very strategically important. It is known as roof of the world. Right. Okay. Five. Huh. And five cultures. So Pakistan, China, India. China sorry but Pakistan top because of and five cultures by the way okay Chinese central Asian okay Indian Afghani invala so many cultures so it is a very very strategically important important aspect right roof of the world it is known as right so I told him strategically important military operation we should do it so I explained him the graphs this that but I told him sir I am confident it can be done okay leader once again leadership in forge how it matters he got up and said I have heard all three have said no one has said yes mine is yes to it is three We are going ahead. We will plan it out. 31st May was the date decided between me and him. Nobody in between. All this hierarchal thing was removed. Okay. And as the leader, he said last time your boss was in the cockpit and you have trouble. This time your boss will be on board but will be sitting as passenger behind. M so to boost up your morale look at the leadership there I learned what not to do here I learned what to do and that is how I move diet that's why I keep telling youngsters keep watching what not to do also it helps you equally and here is a man we had to land there it's sub subzero temperature the temperature there is - 48 at times wow okay wow -48 - 48 So lack of oxygen. So I used to go there for you know inspection. So the c best part of it will come now and it was all because of army that such things can happen at that altitude 16,700. I wanted it to be compacted that soil because [Music] [Music] There these guys are army people. We dropped a roller center portion proper roller roller center. Why Q? If the guy who is posted there is posted only for 2 months and DBO if he has to change over he has to walk back 15 days to come to Lelay casualty and his average height which he's treading is 16,000 ft. They have to walk 15 days to come toic. Oh wow. So you would change the logistical dynamic. Logistical dynamics. Morale of the troop. Yeah. Okay. They are always aware. [Music] So if weather is bad and there is no connectivity with aircraft, these guys become you know psychologically depressed element that is their lifeline. Yes. So when weather is bad for 8 10 10 days at times even if we can't negotiate the weather if we just go over it and see whe [Music] 20 minutes so it would have changed everything. Yes, dynamics. But yes I told you geopolitical diplomatic China right Mhivawa all these matters were not and when two people leadership Udar there was one general Bharatwatch another very dynamic leader general army he is the one who made this all arrangements okay so Javan [Music] insp. screwdriverpetrol. It's our petrol, right? Our people, right? They they border that, right? Javan's army were less. It's proportionate, you can say. See the innocence of that boy 18, 19 years, right? I looked at him. I said, [Music] "Okay." So he also looked at me and he knew yes. So when I went back I told this to Babra and I said strategic importance this that now one more reason is addit personal personal that is and I said that boy smiled s looking at me. He just smiled. I said smile. I want to change that smile smirk into a very cute smile because he's a very young boy. So I said no moving back. And let me tell you very few people get this uh you know happiness happiness and opportunity incident 31st December 2008 when I landed there at 60 or something like that time. It was a world record. 31st December may 31st May right you said 3 oh sorry 31st May 31st May 2008 when I landed there. Uh we had carried you know a lot of maih and so how was the landing like basket? Oh that that we will come to that but let me tell you this boy right so that boy was standing at the exact place where I had told him to stand. Interesting because I told him we won't switch off. I told you running that boy was standing there remind you. Okay. I showed my boss. He said he is the boy. I indicated him. He came and a hamper was handed over to him and I changed that smirk to a nice cute smile and when I speak to it it is in front of me that smile. Wow. So sometimes you don't have require strategic reasons right very very normal simple things which we don't consider as if something very great also make you do things right and for me that boy is saying was that connectivity to I'll tell you how and all we'll tell you later. Yeah, I did a trial landing came back then I went went Barbara I knew Barbara leader so that we can change over the thing. So this okay you have to calculate. So first time when I took a load I had not decided to take passenger but then when we calculated in the air 45% oxygen less engine running temperature - 40 - 30 even in this moment. Yes sir. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. May 31st that is the temperature. Okay. It is a katcha katcha. So proper picking up dust heavy dust all around army people hats off to them in 20 minutes they used to upload more than three tons load wow that's operational tell you operational efficiency in hills that's why I say we are one of the best our army people are one of the best people in operating area or man behind the machine got it got Okay, let's take I am going to take 18 was the calculation. 18 people in in 30 seconds 18 got in. 30 seconds it took. Now they never knew I am going to take them but they got in. So when I took them to open the door they all came personally to thank me. This was the first guy first time I was taking these boys. Mhm. So they wanted to they are very innocent boys. So I was also happy I shook hand with each chap. When I look back just glance I said so I stopped one boy. I said so see the excitement in that man's life be sitting in air conditioned room have different definition of happiness right here is a happiness he's coming on leave without any luggage why because he doesn't have to walk for 15 days he's reaching in 20 minutes another thing Like that boy who satisfied me, I was so happy. You look one small activity by me has changed the complete complexion of that place. Right now, now he knows tomorrow if I fall sick, there will be a guy to pick me up, take me from here to straight Chandigar Hospital in one and a half hour and I'll be saved. Morale psychologically they were very very happy. That is why this action is considered and it was a tactical action done by a group captain. I was a group captain then proposed planned and executed. Why? Because of a leader like air marshall Babala right and and General Bharatch who helped in all this groundwork and the johnies who did that job. Okay. All was achievable because of these the team and the leadership. Yes. Yes. My I may have got shy chakra for that by the way. A yes. Right. And that shakra citation was written by my boss. Wow. Must be again first. Okay. Normally your unit sends it here. He said you don't have to bother what you're getting. You don't have to bother. That is my job. Leadership. Leadership. what to do is where I learned from this gentleman. He's Zumbbo but uh I still remember him with what off and another thing when we landed is what happened is as we were getting airborne he was the boss he got a information that they have called for flag meeting. You know what is flag meeting? No. You had DGMO meeting for Synindur right? Exactly same but at that border. Okay. So two major generals from each side meet right they call for each other. So this meeting was why you landed at DBO very stupid thing but you know China had you got used to it right? So they called for the meeting canceled it he canceled it they canceled it they only they again called it called for it after 3 hours again called called off. You know why? Why? DBO is our land. Landing there or not is our prerogative. We have done it. Yeah. But that thing which was over 50 55 years been reflected to them that India is like this. They thought we can question but when they realized no there is no d in this internationally or nationally they called it off. Ah I see. And it didn't end here. This was 31st May 2008. I landed 1st of or 2nd of June. You are Google people. You can Google it and you'll find that time foreign minister Pranab Mukharji had visited had to visit China on 3rd June. You can see in Google dates on 1st June I get a call night 11:00 that you have to reach Delhi and explain the DBO landing why you did it. Ah okay now let me tell you my chief is sitting there my CNC is sitting there there are air marshal there but they wanted me to go and explain to air why right okay and you know why it's a foreign minister I'm visiting is diplomatic right so he wanted very diplomatic and nice answers and I had convinced them my bosses by diplomacy only I told them two three things why I want to land at tomorrow My people when they drop if they have a emergency like single engine which I had right they have to put down the aircraft you can't get out of there so there is a place for them to put down pilot saved let the aircraft as it is was going so number two rotation of troops 15 days walking torture yes here it is possible 15 minutes right third casualty evocation yes that guy fourth the most important psychological He is sure that there will be somebody to pick me up if anything goes. Oh, I see. But a tactical action which I did and I was sure will be a strategic gain proved proved to be right in 2020. So to for today's youngsters I want to tell them whatever you do just do it. Don't keep asking for results. They may not come in your lifetime but that should not stop you in doing a job. I landed in DVO in 2008 as a tactical action. I surely knew it is a strategic results this is going to give which gave and what happened in near Pangong. So right in 2020 in 2020 they amassed their troops Chinese along the border. We had to pump in If in 2008 I had not landed there was no airfield there. Now C130 which has got four engines much safer. Okay. Landed did a lot of sorties pumped in the troops there and what happened thereafter in Galwan is well known to all. So my after my retirement 3 years later the whole country knew yes there was a strategic gain in this whole activity. M okay and more so that's why I mentioned to you so this is what is DBO story so this is from story displeasure to gallantry and I don't take the credit I give lot of credit to leadership both the side right okay arming and efforts both the side right okay and uh we keep talking about synergy synergy yap yap yap whole world keeps discussing. I never like that discussion because I have seen practically how synergic we are when it comes to a task. Got it. Okay. Yes. And I didn't stop at that because of that dynamic uh general Badwaj. I went on to open two more ALGs like this which were closed for 50 years. One is Fukche just south of Galwan in Sind Valley. Okay. Okay. And one new airfield at Nyoma which is you know from China's side if you go cross the laz synind river. Okay. There's only one valley which goes to lei from China side. That's a synindra valley. Yeah. And Lei is a very important place there. So if Chinese want to create some chaos they will always look at Lei. So we said strategically we should have some more one more in between. M so I started looking for it and you know why I did this to airfield because of my youngsters. Here comes the team after the success of DBO which was not thought to be likelihood. Okay. whole my gang of people the FOs the army this that nobody was sure that is it okay especially chafer doing it because what happened to him in Cargill was not forgotten right right but we did it and we realized my youngster said said this has been done now something more look for it you have a eye for it I said okay f check this time last time you didn't ask the government by the M army prepared the runway. My boss cleared me to land. I proposed, planned and executed and then told this time November 2008 May November. So like five six months and then I looked for another place known as Nyoma and they created a it was slightly difficult because river was passing close by so it was very sandy sir. Yes sir. [Music] So this is the story of displeasure also. So that's why I said in the beginning failure is not fatal. Success is not final. Courage to go on continues and I do that after retirement also because that is what I feel that success is not final. So it be let's continue what we are doing. So this is a new chapter in my life, right? Okay. And that is how we move on. I have one last question, sir. How long do you think we've been talking? Uh I don't know maybe uh I I'll tell you the problem. Okay. I have got too many stories. Number one. Right. Number two, I'm a QFI. Qi job is talk maximum so that when you are teaching them in the aircraft, you consume least time. So we are very talkative people. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Okay. Right. And third, which all know as you grow old. Okay. That time I used to question my you know uh destiny. Okay. Right. Why? But then I realized when I retired one quote I saw and I keep quoting it now very often because all these quotes which I am quoting you know they are related to me that's why I'm quoting otherwise I'm not a quote man right destiny is not matter of chance destiny is matter of choice so make choices and destiny will follow the right path I made the choice of going to DBO After a horrible accident at Cargill I made a decision choice of not going to eastern as a commanding officer and the rest is as they say is history. I was posted to Chandig and I did this landing of three airfields. So destiny is not matter of chance. Make right choices, right? And definitely it will get you what you want. And why not? And why not? Why not? Maybe late, maybe this thing, but it does. Well, sir, this has been an absolute pleasure. We've been talking for over 100 minutes. Oh, and if and no, but this is a test of how how well the conversation's been. That means the conversation has been very well. Thank you so much for your time. All your people feel same. So they'll tell you that I I cannot promise this. I know audiences. How did you like your stories and sir, thank you so much for sharing this. Thank you so much for the energy you bring. Thank you so much for your service and thank you so much for what you've done for the country. You're most welcome and because it should reach the people. Okay. A thing which not many defense people do. I have done that is putting down pen on paper and telling them that this is my story. My story is shades of blue. Right. It is because of blue uniform, blue skies and blues in my life. Okay. In that I have said talked about uh you know the behind the curtain story of Cargill that how organizational things work right. Okay. And I have written this just to tell the whole world that organization is never bad. If you are doing genuinely something organization will always do justice to you. It is some people you come across. Okay. And uh for that also I have got a quote. I always tell them that there will be some people in your life who may not do wrong to you. Okay. But don't forget to thank them because they are the one who who made you strong. That incident what not to do of Cargill made me strong to do DBO DBO right which brought me from displeasure to this. Well sir, so that is what I will end the quote and 100 minutes is quite a time. Okay. No sir, thank you so much for your time as as always. I enjoyed this. These were some amazing stories. first person.
