1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,440
Thank you so much for your time sir.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,519
Um sir I want to start off with

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,880
I think this might be one of the most

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
interesting stories you were a part of.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm sure you're part of several several

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,279
interesting stories. Um take me back to

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,039
February 2002 sir. What was happening to

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,840
India and what was happening to you?

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,320
Uh you are making me go to 2002. I will

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,119
take you further back. Okay. Let's let

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,599
me tell you from something from 1999.

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,239
Okay, which is not new to anybody.

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,719
Everybody knows what happened in 1999.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,320
Cargill conflict was what was there in

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,120
1999. G sir. So in 1999 when this

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,079
conflict broke up I was you know

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,239
somewhere in south. So initial part of

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
that being in air force and being a

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,600
transport pilot little bit things we did

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,920
connected to the conflict you can say.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,320
However, very soon things change and we

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
have something known as staff college

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
you know there where we learn about

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,960
military studies and things like that.

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,119
So I it's a selective course you appear

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,280
you know what do you call it uh for

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
entrance exam and things like that and

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
then selected army navy air force

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
officers go there so I was selected for

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,439
that so I moved out to Wellington that

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,040
is near

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,119
right so 1999 conflict was on somewhere

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,640
in north and we were in south cooling

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,960
our hills in the hills

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,880
right So after this staff college there

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
is something known as choice posting

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,040
that's why now you'll realize why I'm

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,040
taking you to 99 okay right so uh that

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
choice posting

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,399
is given provided there is a vacancy

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,720
also yeah choice posting

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,439
that is a place that is a kind of a

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,719
course which is quite considered a kind

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:06,960
of a career course okay so they do give

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,720
you so I Being me I asked for Chandigat.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,160
Okay. Why Chandigat will be your

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,560
question. Chandigat is a you know uh

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,520
biggest place for transport SC and it

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,000
not only biggest it is one of the most

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
operational transport base of Indian air

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
force. Why?

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,720
Because entire north sector is being

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
looked after by that place. So that is

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,959
the importance of Chandigar. And when

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
you are speaking to me if you don't know

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
what is air force station chandigar then

57
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,800
you don't know me. So I in the beginning

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,920
only mentioned that fair right. So I

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,440
asked for chandigar. got Chandigar 2001

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,599
somewhere in August September I was

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,560
there and uh as I reached there in 1999

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,640
Cargill conflict cargill airfield was

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
not available

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,000
right reasons were there like number one

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,920
the runway was not available it is too

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,200
close proximity to Pakistan right it's

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,080
surrounded by hills as any airfield in

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,599
Himalayas right Okay, when we come to

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
this first we are going to speak about

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,159
that that what is the difference between

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,800
a airfield at Delhi and airfield in

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,519
Himalayas. So that will come when we

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
reach the point right as of now I'll

74
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,480
tell you I reached there and I was given

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,280
a task to operationalize this car

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,599
airfield once again because we did feel

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,440
little bit of problem during the

78
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,360
conflict that if this airfield was

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,080
available things would have been better

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,440
airfield carg but inactive and you were

81
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,760
tasked to reoperationalize it

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,640
because uh

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,599
there was a kind of a you know water

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
body moving along the runway. They put

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
some pipes and things like that. But

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,959
over the period of

87
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,959
what happens is nonuse also makes the

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,680
thing go bad. Haha sir. So exactly this

89
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,640
happened to the airfield. Take. So I was

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
tasked to go talk to the engineers and

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,360
that airfield that time was with

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,440
civilians. We have two types. Airfield

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
man by civilians. Airfield man by

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
military. Air Force person. Right. Air

95
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,639
Force person. Right. Not military.

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
Exactly. Uh now army has very few but

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
they are small helicopter you mostly air

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,440
force right.

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,360
So I went there then there was

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
discussion how this should be brought up

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
and things like that and things started

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,000
moving.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,520
So somewhere in 2001 only I think August

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
September

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,040
I did a a trial landing there after the

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,639
runway was made serviceable

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
right

108
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,080
thereafter I went once again. Now we

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,440
should talk about what is Cargill all

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,639
about. Why why why it's so different or

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,120
difficult or challenging or a lot of

112
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
words are used for the Cargill air base.

113
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Air base any any air base for that

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
matter. We are going to speak quite a

115
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,800
bit about Himalayan airfields. Huh? Can

116
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
you pull up Cargill Air Base here? Yes

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,280
sir please. So we can uh surely talk

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,199
about it first as of now. Right.

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
So all these airfields firstly you have

120
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,120
to understand that in in

121
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,520
you have only

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
you don't have plane area there right

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,440
and if you look at the runway you

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,840
normally require at least 3 km distance

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,720
flat land yes sir and not only flat land

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,199
flat land to make the airfield right

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,840
then you require something to for that

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,039
aircraft to fly from there at an angle

129
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,199
of some degrees to come to the runway

130
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,840
key. It cannot be like this. Yes. It

131
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,320
can't be vertical. It has to be from a

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,680
distance you have to get to a point

133
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,360
where you are 000 height. So it's a nice

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,919
steady.

135
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,759
Right. Gradual decline. Gradual decline.

136
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,600
Right. Right. Right. Okay. So you have

137
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
to have some space below before also and

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,840
after also. So I said 3 km runway

139
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
another 10 10 km either side. Right. So

140
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
something like as open space finding an

141
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,199
Himalay is a very difficult thing.

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,680
Right. So when I land at Delhi and when

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
I land at Cargill, it is a different

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
ball game all together. You would say

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Delhi is a lot easier. Why? Because it

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,400
is in planes. Yeah. It's geography.

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,639
Cargill is surrounded by huge mountains.

148
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
Okay. Right. To add to the degree of

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,960
difficulty, Pakistan ports are very

150
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,039
close by. So those guys are also trying

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,520
to do funny games. Rightly so.

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,280
So what do you do to land at such places

153
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,680
is you come over at that airfield okay

154
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
above the airfield to Delhi I have used

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
instruments also and I have come and

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
landed there in hills instrument don't

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,400
help you much so it cannot be a

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,599
computerized landing you cannot because

159
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,440
it's not a gradual planned activity okay

160
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,080
computer requires something very very

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,319
planned the rate of descent has to be

162
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,160
accurate it has to be some constant

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,400
factor there right there's No

164
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
consistency, no constant factor in this

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,759
activity. So you come overhead of the

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,840
airfield and kind of a do a spiral

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,800
descent they call it, right? And

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,319
establish yourself finally nicely with

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,039
the parameters desired on finals that is

170
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,880
some distance 10 to 15 km away from the

171
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,759
runway.

172
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,120
So it's a tricky business in short. Plus

173
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,599
add to the issues weather ever changing

174
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,800
weather winds are strong if it is

175
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:47,199
snowing then visibility is lower okay

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:52,000
right proximity to the line of control

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:56,639
as I told you right okay and there are

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,280
other elements okay like to establish at

179
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,520
the correct path at correct place you

180
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,160
have done lot of circus and now after

181
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,960
that circus you are wanting to get

182
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,039
stabilize that aircraft and again

183
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,599
reconentrate on a activity which is

184
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440
known as landing. Let me tell you in

185
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
aviation there are two more most

186
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,759
important things. One is takeoff and

187
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,520
second is landing. In between part is

188
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,800
you can say a bit cooler. Okay. Right.

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,759
But these are critical areas. Okay. This

190
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,759
you do too well and things fall in

191
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,240
place.

192
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,479
So because of this I had made out

193
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,039
certain parameters how to go how to

194
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
land. So we call it something known as

195
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,399
SOP that is standard operating

196
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,959
procedures right. So I made that

197
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,160
airfield was earlier used but was not

198
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,240
used for long. So all these new things

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,080
which are to you have to collect

200
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,279
intelligence

201
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,880
how the

202
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,680
neighbor of us might behave behave look

203
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,440
at the aspect of us opening and

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
operationalizing

205
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,680
math. So you have to you have to know

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
that right right. So that was done,

207
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,080
everything was done and I did a landing

208
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,800
I think April first one and the second

209
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,200
one was in August right then I told you

210
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,080
them few things

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,320
like what more repairs required things

212
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,399
like that and somewhere in uh on 19th

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Feb 2002

214
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
from 99 now we can move there came the

215
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
day when I was told that that airfield

216
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,560
has to be inaugurated now inauguration

217
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,279
means you know all organiz

218
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,880
have their own way of doing things.

219
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,519
Right. Right. So there is a little bit

220
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,880
of pump and show little bit of gathering

221
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,040
of people. Okay. Because it was a thing

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,200
which was the whole country was looking

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,519
at when it is going to likely to be

224
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,040
done. So rightly my boss had decided to

225
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
be

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,120
there.

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,200
My boss means I am in I am Chandigat.

228
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Chandigar is comes under western air

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,959
command. All this area is a western

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,839
command. So my boss was there. So he

231
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,360
decided to be in the aircraft

232
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,839
and with me and to go go there and nice

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,920
it gives a nice feeling to a I was a

234
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,600
wing commander then. Okay. So hope you

235
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
and your viewers know a little bit about

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
rank. I can tell you a difference

237
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
between a marshall and a wing commander

238
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,800
is four ranks. Okay. Okay. that will be

239
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,600
easier and better right so you see the

240
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
difference right and he's my boss he's

241
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,680
not my boss direct I have a boss known

242
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,640
as commanding officer who has a boss who

243
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,200
is air officer commanding who has a boss

244
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,680
who is known as saso and then his boss

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,160
is so my yes it is super boss super boss

246
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,240
so my super boss had decided that I will

247
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,560
go with chafka so a man my super Super

248
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
boss is not qualified on this aircraft.

249
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,399
Get it straight. Okay. He may be a

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,279
fighter pilot. He may have flown. Okay.

251
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,079
He may be award winner. He may be

252
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,480
gallantry award winner all. But when

253
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,880
aircraft changes, let me tell you things

254
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
change. And here there is a change of

255
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,880
fighter to transports. Big change. Big

256
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,800
change. Right. You can say it is a

257
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,120
a gradient.

258
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,120
What seniority of people sitting

259
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,519
together also makes a difference to CRM

260
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,279
that is cockpit resource management. If

261
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
there is a very high ranking guy and a

262
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
very low ranking guy, what will be the

263
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,519
tendency? You know, yeah. One will it's

264
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
for all organization. Right. Right.

265
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,720
Right. He's a boss and you are the

266
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,079
subordinate and solo. So he's going to

267
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,200
talk about his experience, his knowledge

268
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,440
which may be outdated. Let me tell you,

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,920
huh that a fact of life. These are fact

270
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,880
of life. I also grew and retired as a

271
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,880
Marshall. So I know it. So it's not a

272
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
matter of how much how many stars I'm

273
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,200
putting on my shoulders. It is more

274
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,040
whether I'm connected to that activity

275
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,920
of flying. Right?

276
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,519
So me and my boss said it was decided

277
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,839
that uh Chaveer will be the captain and

278
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,160
captain means two things we do. I sign

279
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,320
for the aircraft.

280
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,800
I sign for the aircraft means now

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,920
anything going wrong right for the

282
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,800
aircraft is my responsibility because

283
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,880
authority and responsibility go together

284
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,440
right so there is somebody five ranks

285
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,560
sitting above me who is my super boss

286
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,200
but once I enter the aircraft

287
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,240
I am the responsible person you are the

288
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,440
captain yes sir and this is what is the

289
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:00,079
biggest thing in any aircraft whether it

290
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,560
is a ship it is a aircraft and in civil,

291
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,519
commercial, air force, anywhere,

292
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,079
anywhere, anywhere. So things are clear

293
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,279
now. Yes sir. That I'm the captain but

294
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,320
my boss is boss. Yes. Right. Right. So

295
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,600
we I positioned at Delhi. Right. Right.

296
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Quick briefing was done. Okay. Now let

297
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,279
me tell you it was August 2001 when I

298
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,959
last went there. Right. And then they

299
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,519
did some repairs. I must have gone on

300
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,680
ground there to check. But again flying

301
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,639
wise I'm going there and in Himalayas

302
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,560
flying is very tricky. High mountains

303
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,600
the instruments like GPS and all

304
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,200
misbehave at times not very accurate. So

305
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,519
your eyeball is the best best judge. Yes

306
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,760
sir. If you see you believe that is why

307
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,560
you come overhead and do that activity

308
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,839
right? So we went there weather was

309
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,560
quite okay not too bad as it should have

310
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,600
should be in Feb. Feb it is snows that

311
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:04,399
place so lot of snowing so white all

312
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,560
over right little bit of clouding above

313
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,680
which was also white so there's a

314
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,639
phenomena something known as white out

315
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,279
everything is white on the ground

316
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,360
above also in the sky is all cloudy

317
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,639
white going so there is kind of a white

318
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,600
ball in which you are entering it's a

319
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,760
white ball Okay.

320
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,000
So we fly basically looking at the

321
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,320
horizon. Right. Right. Right. Right.

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,560
Horizon. So you require some reference.

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,519
So it is horizon. With this ball formed

324
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,600
it's a bite round. So you are not very

325
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,320
sure where is the horizon now. So you go

326
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,199
undo instruments and the degree of

327
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,600
difficulty increases. Yes. That's it.

328
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,560
Firstly high hills. So you're flying at

329
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,160
certain height. Okay. Visibility not too

330
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,199
good. closer to the border then you have

331
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
to go over it so degree of degree and

332
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,360
you are landing at 10,000 so power

333
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,720
output of the aircraft and many many

334
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
other things so it's a difficult

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,360
activity in short challenging but we are

336
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,880
used to it it's a military operation so

337
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,920
we do it our way right

338
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,320
so we went as usual that day I had go

339
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,560
had to go from Delhi to overlay then

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,959
turn left that day we continued

341
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,320
continued uh now what has happened is

342
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,720
as I was navigating I just looked to the

343
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,839
left and I felt uh oh something not up

344
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,040
to it why I'm seeing the cargill town

345
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,440
slightly to the left h cargill town is a

346
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,760
small place okay it's not like Delhi

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,000
that you can see from the glow from here

348
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,800
or see the place from far off and I told

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,839
you the weather conditions anyway anyway

350
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,399
so I looked at life left and I said oh

351
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,040
there's something oh there cargle town

352
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,600
oh let's turn left we are slightly to

353
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,079
the right of track that was as I put on

354
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,759
bang to the left that was kind of a

355
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,759
third now how do you explain the third

356
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,830
[Music]

357
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,079
So we call it thud something banged.

358
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,680
Normally what happens is birds can be

359
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,759
there.

360
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,040
Okay. So we thought uh something like

361
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,320
that maybe but as I was thinking what it

362
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,560
could be my cockpit flashed with lot of

363
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
lights. We have a system emergency

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,120
system

365
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,279
okay which has got a master warning.

366
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,160
It's a amber colored big light. It

367
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,040
starts flashing and in your ears you can

368
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,240
hear a Russian girl telling you in

369
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,959
emergency use a girl. Yeah. It's Russian

370
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,519
calm you down. Whether you calm down or

371
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,240
not is not up to you. At least let no

372
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,000
it's not up to you and you don't but

373
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,319
anyway they have tried. Isn't it? Right.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Right. Right. Right. Right. So the girl

375
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,880
started saying

376
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,280
right engine on fire right engine on

377
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,039
fire. And now the right engine fire

378
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,160
warning starts blinking. Okay. So you

379
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,160
know these emergencies in a pilot's life

380
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,319
are quite they are known as critical

381
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,400
emergencies and you wake me up from a

382
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,880
sleep I will tell you the action they

383
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
are by rote because they cannot be

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,240
delayed. Actions cannot be delayed. So I

385
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,919
quickly looked at the parameters and I

386
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
knew I have some problem with the right

387
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,600
engine. So in a transport aircraft you

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,679
have to shut down the engine. Now32 the

389
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,960
aircraft we are talking about is a twin

390
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,840
engine aircraft two engines. So if you

391
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,799
shut down one still you can fly but

392
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,080
under few restrictions. We'll talk about

393
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,280
them as we go ahead. All right. So first

394
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,640
thing you have to do is something

395
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,559
happens to the engine you have to shut

396
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,720
the engine because there is a propeller

397
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,320
right. Mhm. It creates drag and creates

398
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
more problem in the aircraft. So we call

399
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,400
it something known as feathering it.

400
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,720
That means take the propeller in a

401
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,360
direction of the wind so that least

402
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,080
resistance it gives to the wind and just

403
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,559
rotate slowly. Got it. Got it. Got it.

404
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,440
No drag. No drag to less issues. Less

405
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,679
issues. So I feathered the aircraft and

406
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
I realized it is a fire. So there is a

407
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,679
drill. We have fire extinguishers. We

408
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,679
have engine fire extinguisher. We have

409
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,120
wing fire extinguisher. We have other

410
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
fire extinguishers. So we fire from

411
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
inside. But you have to switch off the

412
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,039
engine. Otherwise, the fire extinguisher

413
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
entire damn thing will wreck the engine.

414
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,360
No, it will blow off by the wind. Ah,

415
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,400
okay. Fire extinguisher has to go to the

416
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,720
fire, right? If the propeller is proper

417
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,200
is rotating, it will just go out. Say,

418
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,799
so I have stopped the propeller. So that

419
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,840
is not going to happen. I operated the

420
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,840
fire and I quickly told my flight

421
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,280
engineer to go behind and see how much

422
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,960
is the fire. M. So while he was going I

423
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,679
was doing other actions like switching

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,679
of fuel, switching of oil to that engine

425
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,320
because these are inflammable things

426
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,799
right. He came running he says now fire

427
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,799
has spread to the wing.

428
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,600
But what had happened is when I sent him

429
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:23,200
few actions I had not done. So I was now

430
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,679
sure key there will be easing of the

431
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,080
fire. So I sent him again. Now this time

432
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,400
he got the good news because I have

433
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,120
switched off the oil and fuel. He says

434
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,160
now only fumes are coming.

435
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,240
So while I am doing all these actions I

436
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,120
was turning to the left as I told you

437
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,440
because I saw Cargill town right. Okay.

438
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,880
Right. So

439
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
slightly short of Cargill town is

440
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Cargill airfield. So we kept turning

441
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,200
left. Now your viewers need to know one

442
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,160
thing that a twin engine aircraft it is

443
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,120
if it is flying at level 240 which we by

444
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,919
flying and then descending then it

445
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,240
cannot maintain 240

446
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,280
on single engine. So it has to come

447
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,240
down. It is known as drift down. Aa it's

448
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,000
a natural process. You have no choice

449
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,840
because it was sustaining that height

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
with two engines. Now you have means bas

451
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,280
common sense

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,280
but here there is a problem in Himalayas

453
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,760
you can't go down because there are

454
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,039
mountains below

455
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,960
so it's a tricky situation once again so

456
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,880
for that tricky situation to resolve we

457
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
have something known as emergency

458
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,840
procedures

459
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,120
known as escape routes means if

460
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
something like this happens and the

461
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,360
aircraft has to be brought back to some

462
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,400
other is

463
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,159
you follow the escape route.

464
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,640
What is escape route? You get into

465
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,799
valleys. Now normally you don't fly into

466
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
valleys because some are very narrow,

467
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,640
navigation is difficult, confusing,

468
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,600
there are some blind valleys, lot of

469
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,799
issues but these are designated ones. So

470
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,799
you get down it is scary.

471
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,929
No no valley.

472
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,929
[Music]

473
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,360
it's a field also and actually at some

474
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,200
places it is like that also okay and

475
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,360
plus you have a emergency let me tell

476
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,360
you that

477
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,919
yeah yeah you must be scared for life

478
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,080
yeah so you are pressurized and here

479
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,720
there is one more pressure that the

480
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,039
gentleman to left is

481
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,640
not uh what do you call uh trained on

482
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,360
this type and he's my super boss so his

483
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,159
inputs are coming galore

484
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,600
okay but I know whether they they are to

485
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,120
be taken or not right right so I am

486
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
talking to you today means I have not

487
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,520
taken his instructions simple as that

488
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,919
right I follow because I am I'm the boss

489
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,760
right right the captain I explained you

490
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
in the aircraft I am the boss and I have

491
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,880
to behave like Right. Very easily said

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,880
difficult to do especially fis. Okay.

493
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Hierarchal thing you know better. Yes.

494
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,200
It's not some corporate that you can do

495
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,880
little panga and change your job

496
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,799
tomorrow. No sir not for me. Right. But

497
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
you know when such things comes you are

498
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,840
trained for that. Military people are

499
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,919
good at it and I am basically like that.

500
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,960
Okay. as you talk to me more you will

501
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,919
come to know it's a kind of a your own

502
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,919
value system personality traits whatever

503
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:49,760
you call it so I ignored flew for 31

504
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:53,360
minutes and brought the aircraft back to

505
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,840
Lei oh you brought it back to Lelay yes

506
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,000
this is one of the only aircraft up till

507
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,159
now in the history of Indian air force

508
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
which had had a single engine were not

509
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
if there I don't know our history

510
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,760
maintenance is pretty bad let me tell M

511
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,039
okay that's why I have written a book on

512
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,640
all this so that at least when people

513
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,280
next time think about it they know that

514
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,760
somebody has already done this. Mhm. So

515
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,200
this must be the first. Okay. And 31

516
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,000
minutes is a long long long long time

517
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,919
for being in a escape route on a single

518
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,960
engine with one engine switched off

519
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,480
because of fire. The reoccurrence is not

520
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
totally

521
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,440
out of the question. Scratched out. Yes

522
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,840
sir. Yeah. So I landed there.

523
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,240
You cannot you have to land. It is a

524
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,240
must land situation. Why? Because now

525
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
you have only one engine. If you have

526
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,400
two engine if your landing is not coming

527
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,200
up. Okay. At times at airfields happen

528
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,000
newspaper right? He came bounced and

529
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,360
went out and passengers were scared.

530
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,799
Here there is no choice. You can't

531
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,200
bounce and can't go because you have

532
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,520
only one engine. You don't have takeoff.

533
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
You don't have that power. Right. So

534
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,200
it's a must land situation. In that must

535
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,159
land also inputs are coming but I know

536
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,480
how to do it. So I have come land. Okay.

537
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,320
Different parameters are there as I

538
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,039
landed brought the aircraft in the

539
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,720
dispersal and we came down. Now what we

540
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,520
have thought in the cockpit when I'm

541
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:23,039
doing all this action it is a

542
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,960
okay hit the nail on the head. Right.

543
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,480
Okay. But you will very soon know no you

544
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,840
haven't.

545
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,679
It's not chia. Let's see. Let's see. You

546
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,279
you are listening to a story now. Right.

547
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,080
Right. Right. Okay. For you it is story

548
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,000
for me it is lifetime act action right

549
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,279
okay I'm today we are sitting in front

550
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,840
of each other and talking because it I

551
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,679
did it that way right right yes sir so

552
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,440
it be so stories are somebody's you know

553
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,960
for somebody it is a story for somebody

554
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
it is a lifeline right for me it was one

555
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,400
came out of the cockpit there was a

556
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,840
inquisitiveness rightly so because what

557
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,600
happened why when we came out we saw so

558
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,840
right wing

559
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:09,279
below Oh fuselage there was a small hole

560
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,200
and that engine is above the aircraft in

561
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,559
this there's nothing secret about it

562
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,679
right so from there it went went came

563
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,600
came out from the engine right engine so

564
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,640
when it came whatever it was when it

565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,559
came out it made a bigger hole. Oh wow.

566
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,240
So this was a smaller hole maybe of uh

567
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,279
uh 10 1 ft there. when it came out it

568
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,360
was 3 to 4 ft di okay so it had ribbed

569
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
the right engine

570
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,640
and it was a clear indication it's a

571
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,159
missile and not chidia

572
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,840
so we were fired upon by some missile

573
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,080
and I'm assuming this was Pakistani

574
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,559
missile of course because there's nobody

575
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,559
else there nobody else there it can't be

576
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,039
our people doing such big mistake

577
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,279
impossible out of question they know how

578
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,440
to identify they know the programs they

579
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,200
know all that is this missile. Did you

580
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,720
find debris of this missile? No, no. The

581
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
debris and all you don't find because I

582
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,240
am in hills. Okay. Where it has happened

583
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
is thick jungle nothing. They won't

584
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,559
stick to the body of the No, no, no. It

585
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,480
it is it has gone like a projectile and

586
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,120
just cross. Please understand. It's a

587
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,159
kinetic energy. Pure kinetic energy. So

588
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,880
here comes the interesting thing. This

589
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,159
missile or any other missile which is

590
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,320
shoulder fired has got two fuses. Some

591
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,360
may have three, four. Let's talk about

592
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,480
this right so what these two fuses do

593
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,039
one is known as heat seeking other is

594
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,799
impact heat seeking means wherever

595
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,520
maximum heat of that aircraft is emitted

596
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,080
it lands up that side where will be that

597
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,480
common sense exhaust exhaust not even

598
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,799
engine exhaust because there the heat is

599
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,320
been thrown out right

600
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,200
moment is coming through the exhaust it

601
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,000
enters the exhaust and blasts right if

602
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,720
that doesn't work. That fuse may not

603
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,520
work. Depends on angle of fire, where it

604
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,600
hit all all crazy things. Too technical

605
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,720
to go on now. Yeah. But that is enough

606
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,919
for us. Second is impact. So now it will

607
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,480
hit somewhere. As it hits that body, it

608
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,640
will blast.

609
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,360
Understood? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On impact

610
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,159
the fuse will then why in my aircraft it

611
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,159
went like a projectile. Why? Both have

612
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,520
failed.

613
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,679
Uh so sometimes such a good thing should

614
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,159
happen so that you and me can speak. Sir

615
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,880
God can listen to uh Chave's Praar

616
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,279
incidents. Right. Right. Your name is

617
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Praar. Your action is Praar. Absolutely

618
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,320
sir. Today I'm proud of my name sir. But

619
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,919
what a coincidence because this would

620
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
have been if it would have blown up

621
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,520
there would be a different story or

622
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,279
remains no story. No story right

623
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,919
basically because then it would have

624
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,159
gone into secrecy that doesn't remain

625
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,080
story if such things happens and let me

626
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,880
assure you it would have been Cargill

627
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,919
too it would have begun again why is

628
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,760
sitting on the left your super boss he's

629
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,440
the head of the western command yes sir

630
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,640
it is not a joke okay so aircraft coming

631
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,200
back was a good thing okay so what how

632
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
how do we achieve how we have reached

633
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
here right the excellent training of

634
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,559
Indian air force

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,399
Indian air force pilots whether it's any

636
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,480
fleet transport helicopters fighters

637
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,960
okay I am in Indian air force so I'm not

638
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,559
saying so your Sindur has again proved

639
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,840
it are one of the best in the world I

640
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,559
just want to know sir what happens to

641
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,600
okay if a civilian like myself somebody

642
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,840
who's fairly courageous somebody who's

643
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,840
thought of

644
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,440
which is to not say much but I could

645
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,600
take care of myself but if I was in a

646
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,000
plane like this I would probably be

647
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,000
sweating profusely

648
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,919
but I know the armed forces are trained

649
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,600
very differently what is going through

650
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,840
your mind when something like this

651
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,000
happens or another soldier another

652
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,760
flight pilot what is going through the

653
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,480
mind of somebody when this happens

654
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,960
you'll be surprised nothing other than

655
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,559
what I have to do so I have to that is

656
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,480
what saves us Right. Critical

657
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,039
emergencies as I mentioned last time

658
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,360
when we were discussing I said you wake

659
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,520
me up from asleep I will just blabber

660
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,840
out the answer. You just I will just

661
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,559
blabber out the answer and my hands will

662
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,760
move. Such such is the grilling in me

663
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,399
for this critical emergencies as we call

664
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,480
them. Do you and fire is one of the most

665
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,320
critical emergencies. Now see the

666
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,120
circumstances closer to the Pakistan

667
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,159
border. In the hills where I cannot go

668
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:54,240
down, cannot go up. Okay. Right. Super

669
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,360
boss on board. Wow. Okay. And fire on

670
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,360
the engine. Luckily fire elsewhere you

671
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,600
can't afford now. Right. If there is

672
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,320
pressure, this is pressure. Like if you

673
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:09,440
think about it, I wonder sirim

674
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,480
for training this. See

675
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,559
so we talk like this like I if I'm an

676
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,880
instructor you are my pupil right I will

677
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,399
tell you prahar your left hinges are on

678
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,039
fire now do your thing cut you do

679
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,919
simulation simulation in simulation you

680
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,279
do quite a few actual also like you have

681
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,279
to switch off the engine so you have to

682
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,520
say here I switch off the left engine so

683
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,520
I will give you this emergency at a

684
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,279
decent place where there is no danger

685
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,679
and you can practice actual switch off

686
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,279
of the engine got my Got it. Got it. Got

687
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,200
it. So that is why instructor's

688
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,120
importance is so much because he's also

689
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
catering for the mistake of that bugger

690
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,000
who is sitting on the left. Right.

691
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,240
Right. Right. Right. He is controlling

692
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,799
the aircraft. He's supervising the

693
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,399
aircraft. He's responsible for aircraft.

694
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,159
He's the man who has authorized himself

695
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,399
for the aircraft. So it's he's all What

696
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,120
about crash landing sir? Crash landings

697
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,360
trainings or SOPs? Yeah. You know crash

698
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,960
landing a term is not a very uh right

699
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,600
term because crash and landing are the

700
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,960
opposite. Exactly. Exactly. So crash

701
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,120
landing and huh and transport aircraft

702
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
especially we try and bring back the

703
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,399
aircraft as much as possible. And in

704
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,279
this case I'm telling you you did why?

705
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:31,200
Because you have to do the actions

706
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:34,880
of fire drill immediately. Otherwise if

707
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,600
the thing spreads that left wing right

708
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,919
wing in my case will just snap off burn

709
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,919
off and snap off and then it's over. So

710
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,679
then your airplane disbalance. No it's

711
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,840
over. That's there no discussion.

712
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,880
There's no discussion. But sir for

713
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,000
instance crashing be simulate training.

714
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,200
Yeah but that is not mean in the manner

715
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,360
in which you actually but yes do you do

716
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,159
you are on finals you say this this has

717
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,720
happened to you. you do that and how

718
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
when does a pilot think ejecting is the

719
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,200
only because last one of the last

720
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,519
options now we are mixing two things yes

721
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,679
we are right I agree I am talking about

722
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,960
for transport aircraft transport we are

723
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,559
talking ejection is only in fighter

724
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,679
aircraft yes sir I know I'm I'm asking

725
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,279
about fighter so but what is the common

726
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,279
thing

727
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,080
both are thinking of the same thing to

728
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,519
bring the aircraft back to safety

729
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,120
however both have got their red lines

730
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,240
different.

731
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,039
Where I will stop is slightly ahead.

732
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,799
Where he will stop is slightly behind.

733
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,799
As in that they are because because he

734
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,600
has a aircraft which has capability wise

735
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,159
is different. Aerodynamically it is

736
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,480
different. It has his lift capabilities

737
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,480
are lesser. He distance he can travel

738
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,480
without engine is different. He has got

739
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,480
a jet engine. I have got a travel of

740
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,840
engine. many many complications but I

741
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,720
told you commonity is we will try and

742
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,880
bring that damn thing right tight it's a

743
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,159
it's a purely curiosity question sir uh

744
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,919
you may not have a specific opinion

745
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
about it but I'm just trying to wonder

746
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,279
what is happening to somebody like a

747
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,840
captain Abhinandan when he has to eject

748
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,840
like what is the training he's getting

749
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,919
boss you can get you you might have to

750
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
eject in opposition territory you might

751
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,279
get stuck there what are you allowed to

752
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,559
say how are you allowed to conduct

753
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,480
yourself because the videos we saw of

754
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,559
him a very graceful conduct regardless

755
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,399
of the pressure around him. What is that

756
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,640
like in the air force? It is critical

757
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,279
emergency once again answer is same

758
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,240
right for me critical is this. Yes, for

759
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,960
him critical is this also. So it's all

760
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,919
taped up here what to say what not to

761
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,200
say and there are no way you can take

762
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,799
out anything more than that

763
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,880
and international law is there. Yes.

764
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,519
Yes. Yes. Yes. That also gives you

765
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,200
protection. Whether rogue country like

766
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,360
Pakistan does it or not is a different

767
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,519
issue. Completely separate matter more.

768
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,720
So we are trained that much. Got it.

769
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,079
More. Talk to me about operation zindu

770
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,839
sir because I'm work in media. So I keep

771
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,720
very

772
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,639
narratives etc. And the Pakistani people

773
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,800
are delusional is no there's no second

774
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,159
guessing it. I don't say this to dump on

775
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,119
them. But realistic fact of life.

776
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,040
Part of that narrative is air force key

777
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,159
superiority over Indian air force key

778
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,919
superiority is proven delusion no doubt

779
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,000
but shed light on exactly how would you

780
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,839
compare you faced the Pakistani air

781
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,520
force in your time in service you faced

782
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,679
it you are probably very abressed with

783
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,119
what happens these days how do you

784
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,000
compare Indian air force and Pakistani

785
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,320
air force you know if you make

786
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,359
comparisons you know there it's a

787
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,520
continuous process let me tell you as I

788
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:57,680
told you earlier also aviation is one

789
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:01,040
part of uh the whole thing which is ever

790
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,640
improvising, ever improving, ever

791
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,839
advancing.

792
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,839
Okay. So this cat and mouse game

793
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,599
sometimes Pakistanis may have better

794
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,480
equipment, sometimes we may have better

795
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,640
equipment. However,

796
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
I believe and not because I am from

797
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,680
Indian Air Force. I believe it and the

798
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,160
whole world believes that the man behind

799
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,000
the machine that matters. Interesting.

800
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,680
And let's as proud Indians be very clear

801
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,160
about one thing that in India that man

802
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,160
behind machine is one of the fantastic

803
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,640
guy whose training is superb. His

804
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,119
you know attitude towards work is

805
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,880
different and its patriotism is way way

806
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,880
way beyond any others. I'm not comparing

807
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,839
here. I'm just telling about what as a

808
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,920
Indian I feel. Right. Okay. So these

809
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,599
three aspects are much much more

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,320
important which were shown in Sindur

811
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,079
again not only for pilots but for the

812
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,640
people who were behind the radars the

813
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,880
air defense system of ours. those ones

814
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,599
who were firing the missiles, those one

815
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,720
who were looking at the radar signatures

816
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,240
and identifying the Pakistani drones or

817
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,160
aircrafts and retaliating. So that is

818
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,480
also man behind machine. Yeah, he's not

819
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,200
a pilot. No, but let me tell you his

820
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,079
training is also so good that what

821
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,240
machine you're using is a very very

822
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,560
disciplined aspect. Yes, I agree. We

823
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,640
should modernize, we should get better.

824
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay, we are authorized to get better.

825
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,680
But why I'm telling you this point is

826
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,359
that we do with what we have and

827
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,200
compensate with our skill where the

828
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,520
machine lacks one. Got it? But but we

829
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,119
are not way behind. Yes, there are

830
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,520
problems. We are a democratic country.

831
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,240
It is not like China or communism that

832
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,119
you just order uh when the question of

833
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,880
gun and bread comes, you don't say guns.

834
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,079
M you said we say bread. Yes. Right.

835
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,800
Right. Right. Right. So if we have to

836
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,359
say bread and still have to consider

837
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,240
your secretary and have guns then this

838
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,200
is the via media and which we are

839
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,440
adopted very well. Our army is one of

840
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,520
the best army

841
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,160
which can operate in mountains.

842
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,560
Interesting. Let me assure you that our

843
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,000
air force is one of the best air force

844
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
especially probably high altitude air

845
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
forces. Not only high altitude our

846
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
pilots, fighter pilots are one of the

847
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,640
best in the world which has been proven

848
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,720
time and again in international excise.

849
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,960
We are not I am not saying I'm sitting

850
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,359
here I am from a FOS so I am not saying

851
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,520
so you can go through Google it

852
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,599
read about international excise and you

853
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,920
will find their people saying so

854
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,720
interesting okay and after Sindur

855
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,119
there's a chap who I forget the name now

856
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,880
if I recollect I will tell you Cooper I

857
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,160
think okay he's a specialist he's a

858
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,640
specialist in warfare okay and he's from

859
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,720
US and his interview was taken I think

860
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,560
by NDTV or one of the channels I'm not

861
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,800
very sure which you can check you being

862
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,000
from media right he very clearly tells

863
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:18,400
there that what has happened in Synindur

864
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,119
I will tell in one sentence okay Indian

865
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,800
air force has won hands down right this

866
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,800
is a statement then he goes on

867
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,040
explaining for 45 minutes what that

868
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,040
means why why he's saying so but let me

869
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,359
tell you just because Chafer is from air

870
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,680
force is not saying so it is fact of

871
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,280
life so when you compare with Pakist

872
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,480
Pakistan. Okay. Uh that comparison

873
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,280
itself is not uh worth it is is will be

874
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,480
my blunt answer. I understand blunt

875
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,599
answer because the very things which are

876
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,160
work behind the machine

877
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,240
are are more more important and more

878
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,040
more better off than what we keep

879
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,920
discussing about. Very interesting. Um

880
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,599
sir speak to me a little bit about na

881
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
crop of pilots young pilots. I'm sure

882
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,520
you interact with them. How are they

883
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,599
different from pilots of your time? Uh

884
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,599
let me tell you no major difference.

885
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,760
Okay. Okay. The aircrafts have changed.

886
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,160
The aircrafts have changed. Okay. What I

887
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,160
had what I flew. Okay. When I was uh

888
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,359
moving out of air force, I brought this

889
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,839
aircraft in. Why I say I? I was a part

890
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,119
of it. Right. I was in airord at that

891
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:33,119
time looking after the transport fleet.

892
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,440
So C130, C17s have come my time. M okay

893
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,440
so I know I've been in the cockpit I

894
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,839
have not flown them but I in the cockpit

895
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,440
fed the aircraft from US and uh UK

896
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,440
sitting in the cockpit so I know the

897
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,119
machine is different it's modern

898
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,680
avionics is good it's easier but it is

899
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,800
complicated you know you are relying too

900
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,480
much on technology then you have to be

901
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,320
prepared that much for the failures your

902
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,200
technical failure means absolute failure

903
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,599
right and when I talked about you know

904
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,200
cargill. Mhm. Okay. Then we move to

905
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,800
Synindur but so I'll take you back to

906
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:16,000
Cargill. I will say Cargill kind of

907
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,480
thing happens in uh every 30 years more

908
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,599
than that. Not many go through such

909
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,160
things. Right. Okay. Yes. I am the one

910
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,880
who which have who has seen a kind of

911
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,520
the lowest of what a pilot sees, right?

912
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,880
And the highest what a pilot sees. And

913
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,839
that's why I believe in one thing which

914
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,839
I keep telling time and again that and

915
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,839
it is applicable to all all your

916
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,160
listeners whether he's in a corporate

917
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,640
he's a bank he's a teacher whatever he

918
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:49,440
is that failure is not fatal

919
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:52,000
success is not final is the courage

920
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,320
that matters which makes you continue

921
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,119
what you are doing and my story tells

922
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,040
you that here is a man who has gone

923
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,040
through a missile attack. Okay. His boss

924
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,319
is super boss is in the cockpit. You

925
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,000
know what happens thereafter.

926
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,920
Organizations all are same. Okay. Uh

927
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,640
leadership I have learned from what not

928
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,160
to do also. So that will suffice. Yeah.

929
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,480
That

930
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,760
you don't only learn from what to do.

931
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,359
Yes. There's a misnomer. Okay. Yes. The

932
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,760
person sitting in front of you can tell

933
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,560
you. You can even learn from what not to

934
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,119
do by observing it. Right. He did it.

935
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,280
tomorrow when I become a boss should I

936
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,400
right no I didn't like it so I should

937
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,640
not do it don't do that to others which

938
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,880
you yourself would like others to do it

939
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,160
to you so mine is from failure that is

940
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,640
in uh military terms displeasure to

941
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,200
gallantry is my story

942
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,359
okay so displeasure you have heard

943
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,720
failure you have heard now we move on to

944
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,640
gallantry yes okay and that is equally

945
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,839
interesting but it is on a different

946
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,400
border now this

947
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,960
thing of uh from Pakistan border yes I

948
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,280
have moved to China border and you know

949
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,520
how how I was a wing commander I told

950
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,920
you this thing happened organization

951
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,040
let me tell you one before moving to all

952
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,319
for everybody no organization is bad

953
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,079
organization we keep cribbing everybody

954
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,319
you me everybody says organization they

955
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,079
don't do I am a firm believer and I have

956
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,400
been through it so I can tell you with

957
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,640
lot of assurance organization is always

958
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,880
good and that is why you saw wing

959
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,359
commander chafikar having a dreaded

960
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,480
thing like this accident and retiring as

961
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,359
a air marshal right right it has to be a

962
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,760
just organization then only it is

963
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:55,599
possible okay there are people few who

964
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,880
may be not up to it so I had my own

965
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,800
problems. Okay. But organization was

966
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,880
very fair to me in that I will tell you

967
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,040
I was put back as flight commander of

968
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,760
the same Chandigaren

969
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,680
served there post accident

970
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,440
even I was captain of their I took

971
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,520
responsibility for the accident because

972
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,920
that is my job authority responsibility.

973
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,079
I said yes but navigational error I will

974
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,079
not because there is a long story that

975
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,880
we wouldn't go through. So then uh they

976
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,720
requested I told them only one thing.

977
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,359
Yes, I know organization is good but I

978
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,040
will just like to have a break break

979
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,440
from this whole thing now to just come

980
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,960
out of it. So give me some posting which

981
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,880
really I can work well and so they asked

982
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,000
me request. So I requested my hometown

983
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,800
Nagpur and in NCC

984
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,359
because I had this point of view you

985
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,680
know how much you bring up more

986
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,599
youngsters in life things will be much

987
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,520
much better for this country. Agreed.

988
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,920
Okay. I believe in it until I believe

989
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,560
that's why I'm in front of you coming

990
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,119
from Napur to Delhi and talking about

991
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,079
why because I have a passion for this.

992
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,160
Okay. what society gave me up till now

993
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:22,720
I'm going to give back to society full

994
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:25,839
way. So then I went to a place uh

995
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,920
my rank was due. I was a wing commander.

996
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,520
Now I was to become group captain. I

997
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,240
knew displeasure of my career problem

998
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:37,040
but I still cleared. Okay. So I went to

999
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,800
one place known as Agra. It's a big

1000
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:44,319
transport base in Asia. I was chief

1001
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:50,160
operation officer there. Right from

1002
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:52,800
there I was posted to East.

1003
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,960
East I had done two tenures already. So

1004
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,960
you know

1005
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,720
[Laughter]

1006
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,280
only knows whether they know or not it's

1007
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,720
left to them. Yes. So then they posted

1008
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,760
me too. Me being me I don't take things

1009
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,800
you know just

1010
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,800
I always say no no

1011
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,359
so I represent it. I said

1012
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,280
why you are doing this

1013
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,200
6 months my boss got posted out so 6

1014
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,760
months they said chief operation officer

1015
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,160
has to stay a big base lot of foreign

1016
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:51,280
aircraft and all come so I stayed there

1017
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,359
on 1st of Jan 2008 I was posted to

1018
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,520
Chandigar back again where I had the

1019
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,319
accident right look at the organization

1020
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,800
how just it is right as commanding

1021
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,680
officer of another squadron which is

1022
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,839
positioned there I took over on first

1023
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,920
Jan 2008 and now my super boss last

1024
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,880
story

1025
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,599
super boss my super boss was

1026
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,839
you know wrong things you should not and

1027
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,200
right things you Right. My boss was air

1028
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:26,160
marshal Barbbora who is no more. Okay.

1029
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,240
Late air marshal Barbbora. He took over

1030
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:34,240
on 1st Jan 2008 as WAC CNC and I took

1031
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:38,160
over as CEO one of the Scots.

1032
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,160
Right. So he came in to our place in

1033
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,760
Feb.

1034
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:47,760
Sir I have a question. Um I just want to

1035
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:52,480
know I think it is the movies but the

1036
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,599
very aspect of flying a fighter plane is

1037
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,599
uh glamorized. Is it actually like this

1038
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,800
when you're sitting in? Is it that fast

1039
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,800
and the geforce and what is it like?

1040
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,720
Stupid question. No no no it's not

1041
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,000
stupid. It's quite genuine. It's quite

1042
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,240
good. Okay let me tell you when you are

1043
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,640
driving in a car right? If you are at

1044
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,000
100 kilometers or you are 80 kilometers,

1045
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,200
can you make out? Barely. Same. Answer

1046
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,200
is same. So just huh. Okay. Answer is

1047
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:27,760
same. It's not the speed. It's not the

1048
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:31,119
thing. It's the question of occupancy.

1049
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,400
Huh? In fighters, you are a single

1050
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:37,280
occupant of the cockpit. Your workload

1051
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,079
is going to be more high. Your speeds

1052
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,920
are higher. you are uh because of

1053
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,119
acceleration the G forces which are

1054
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,920
acting on you are more. So the job

1055
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,440
definitely requires some additional

1056
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,359
thing

1057
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,359
because of which the very selection is

1058
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:59,520
also looked into that way. Physiological

1059
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:01,520
G. Okay. Psychomoot motor skills. Okay.

1060
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,319
Reflexes.

1061
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Okay. And tolerance to the whole thing.

1062
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,359
And you are alone in the cockpit. You

1063
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,440
have to do what you Yes. The ground

1064
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,920
forces are helping you out. Radars are

1065
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,119
there. Support is more not like a

1066
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
transport aircraft. You're not going

1067
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,599
trans transatlantic. You are within your

1068
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,880
but yes things are there which

1069
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,440
differentiate. But the requirements are

1070
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,760
different in transport flying. As I told

1071
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,760
you, CRM is a very important aspect. How

1072
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,480
to deal with people. Mhm. Right. Right.

1073
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,040
Right. Okay. You can't be say navigator

1074
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,200
you don't know I'm doing this right. No.

1075
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,200
Mhm. You have to take all inputs.

1076
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,040
Finally, you will decide as a captain.

1077
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:48,160
But there he's all alone and his job is

1078
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:52,319
to kill. Right. Let's face the fact of

1079
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:56,079
life. Me, I was posted on 1st Jan 2008.

1080
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:59,680
My boss Major was posted on 2008 1st

1081
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,000
Jan. We met in Feb. Okay. Right. And we

1082
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,400
have a system. If a boss comes, you tell

1083
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
him about your things like that how nice

1084
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,000
it is going. Same like any corporate.

1085
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah.

1086
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,800
He was a very dynamic person, a leader

1087
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,319
how he should be. or chafer can tell it

1088
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:28,160
dun because he has seen seen both types.

1089
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:31,760
Okay. So here is a man. I told him sir I

1090
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,520
have a something to present to you more

1091
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,440
after this routine briefing. He said

1092
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,760
yeah go ahead. So I told him sir there

1093
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,800
is a airfield near China border name is

1094
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,640
Dawat Guli. It's very close to border.

1095
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,559
So not that in the thick of war and all

1096
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,400
it will be useful but it is will be

1097
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,680
useful. It is highest airfield in the

1098
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,680
world. Aa it is the highest airfield in

1099
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,880
the world. It is just 2 and a half km

1100
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,599
from China border. Okay. And all these

1101
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,640
years we were not going looking that

1102
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:04,240
side because you know Chinese that

1103
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:07,960
psychic psyche of this other than 65 we

1104
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,960
didn't do much. So

1105
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,760
tactical action.

1106
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,760
So he says okay present.

1107
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,880
So what I presented him I will tell you

1108
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,800
in short quickly because time I think is

1109
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,480
going to be premium.

1110
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,000
Number one, no air no aircraft in the

1111
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,800
world can land beyond 13,500

1112
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,760
and switch off his engines.

1113
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,520
No sir

1114
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,880
oxygen

1115
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,359
very as you keep going up the partial

1116
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,359
pressure oxygen

1117
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,119
oxygen

1118
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,359
but within one square meters the amount

1119
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,119
of oxygen is going to reduce. Right.

1120
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:10,920
16,700

1121
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,920
45% oxygen

1122
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,520
32,000 34,000

1123
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,119
so it becomes

1124
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:38,240
so 16,700 00 ft. There is no aircraft in

1125
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:41,280
the world which was to land there. Yes.

1126
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,040
Question will be

1127
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,520
that will come later. No. Second

1128
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,119
problem. Huh? I want to know right now.

1129
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,960
No.

1130
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,119
Second problem

1131
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,040
closer to China border very close to

1132
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,800
China border. And let me tell you China

1133
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,680
something they have developed a you know

1134
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,880
huge net of railways and roads which is

1135
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,960
well known all the border everywhere. We

1136
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,040
have none. Till then we had none. Right.

1137
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,040
This airfield was there somewhere in

1138
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,520
1962. Somebody landed there once. Okay.

1139
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,720
It is not

1140
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,440
as I operational. No, it was not because

1141
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,440
one earthquake came.

1142
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,709
[Music]

1143
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,119
China border close number

1144
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:08,480
surrounding hills.

1145
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,240
So it's a bowel literally like this the

1146
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,280
bowel and the base of the bowel is

1147
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,720
airfield. Wow. Straight ahead as the

1148
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,280
crow flies 12 to 13 km is Kardungla

1149
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,839
Palas. Uh not Kardungla

1150
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,160
Karakuram pass. Okay. Karakuram. Huh.

1151
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,240
Okay. Right. Which south side is north

1152
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,240
is right. And this airfield was not

1153
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,599
being activated for last 50 years.

1154
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,680
Right.

1155
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,319
So why I told you these three reasons

1156
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,319
maneuvering is very very difficult there

1157
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,319
is

1158
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,359
China

1159
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,720
performance

1160
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,200
from

1161
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,680
sea level to what height you can

1162
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,400
operate. Graph

1163
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,960
temperature

1164
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,960
no temperature elevation and engine

1165
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,960
output

1166
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,079
landing.

1167
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,960
So as a military operation

1168
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,800
[Music]

1169
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,960
ground.

1170
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:48,160
This was Feb and present presentation. I

1171
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,359
will call a lot of people there expert

1172
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,480
each. So young now group captain of

1173
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,760
course right heaviness on the shoulder

1174
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,119
has increased right but rank difference

1175
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,160
boss was sitting as the chair

1176
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,000
soil expert was called now why this

1177
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,559
airfield is not only surrounded by

1178
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,400
mountains but it is katcha it's not

1179
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:15,760
concrete it is not concrete it is not

1180
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,760
bitamin why answer is sameteam

1181
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,760
Say

1182
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,200
helicopters

1183
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,720
26.5,7

1184
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,960
But

1185
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,720
okay,

1186
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,079
soil experts,

1187
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,079
aviation experts,

1188
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:12,160
then I will call the technical people

1189
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:16,319
and we will talk to AM32, OEM,

1190
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,319
original equipment manufacturer.

1191
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,440
32

1192
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,640
captain

1193
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,119
airmil

1194
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:44,799
it is a civil agency by the way soil

1195
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,799
expert don't do it soilh Strength is not

1196
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,799
enough.

1197
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,270
[Music]

1198
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:04,839
Board of

1199
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,839
Physibility of some landing.

1200
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,400
Don't do it

1201
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,640
leadership. Now air marshall borrow just

1202
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,520
got up and he said chaffer will tell you

1203
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,880
why it should be done. M so the junior

1204
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,760
most officer in that forum went up and I

1205
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,440
told him I'm not a soil expert I will

1206
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,680
talk technical which I know okay and as

1207
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,079
a aviator but I'm very sure they are

1208
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,760
wrong I'm right as a military operation

1209
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:52,280
we should do it because it's a very

1210
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,280
strategically important point

1211
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,079
or

1212
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,440
watch my words if we try anytime that

1213
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,359
this airfield will have immense

1214
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,200
importance. Interesting. It is very next

1215
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:08,000
to Saksham Valley. Sichan glacier. East

1216
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,079
of that is DBO. Norththeast of that is

1217
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,760
Sakam Valley which has been handed over

1218
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,799
by Pakistan to China. And they are very

1219
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,640
interested in DBO area and those dlama

1220
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:22,000
and all that because they don't have

1221
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:25,760
route from Akai Chin to Sakam Valley.

1222
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They have to go round about over DBO if

1223
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,440
they go will be able to stay in the

1224
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,440
back.

1225
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Yes.

1226
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,840
[Applause]

1227
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,720
Got it. Got it. Very strategically

1228
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:52,680
important. It is known as roof of the

1229
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,680
world. Right.

1230
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,760
Okay. Five. Huh. And five cultures. So

1231
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,760
Pakistan, China, India.

1232
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,760
China

1233
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,440
sorry

1234
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,440
but

1235
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,599
Pakistan top because of

1236
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:22,160
and five cultures by the way okay

1237
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:25,599
Chinese central Asian okay Indian

1238
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,760
Afghani invala so many cultures so it is

1239
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,720
a very very strategically important

1240
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,640
important aspect right roof of the world

1241
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,480
it is known as right so I told him

1242
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,319
strategically important military

1243
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,040
operation

1244
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,280
we should do it so I explained him the

1245
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,520
graphs this that but I told him sir I am

1246
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,760
confident it can be done okay leader

00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,440
once again leadership in forge how it

1248
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,640
matters

2008

1254
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,119
was the date decided between me and him.

1255
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,119
Nobody in between. All this hierarchal

1256
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,640
thing was removed.

1257
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,599
Okay. And as the leader, he said last

1258
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,599
time your boss was in the cockpit and

1259
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,760
you have trouble. This time your boss

1260
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,559
will be on board but will be sitting as

1261
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,240
passenger behind. M so to boost up your

1262
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,319
morale

1263
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,240
look at the leadership

1264
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,480
there I learned what not to do here I

1265
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,160
learned what to do and that is how I

1266
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,000
move diet that's why I keep telling

1267
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,520
youngsters keep watching what not to do

1268
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,200
also it helps you equally and here is a

1269
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:45,200
man we had to land there it's sub

1270
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,559
subzero temperature the temperature

1271
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,960
there is - 48 at times wow okay wow

1272
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,400
-48 - 48

1273
01:00:52,960 --> 01:01:00,720
So lack of oxygen. So I used to go there

1274
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:05,040
for you know inspection. So the c best

1275
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:07,359
part of it will come now and it was all

1276
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,880
because of army that such things can

1277
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:16,040
happen at that altitude 16,700. I wanted

1278
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,040
it to be compacted that soil because

1279
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,489

1280
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:28,960
[Music]

1281
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:49,520
There these guys are army people.

1282
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:54,760
We dropped a roller center portion

1283
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,760
proper roller roller center.

1284
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,680
Why Q?

1285
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,400
If the guy who is posted there is posted

1286
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,799
only for 2 months and

1287
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,960
DBO

1288
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:22,040
if he has to change over he has to walk

1289
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,040
back 15 days to come to Lelay

1290
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,520
casualty

1291
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,559
and his average height which he's

1292
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:35,799
treading is 16,000 ft.

1293
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,799
They have to walk 15 days to come toic.

1294
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,040
Oh wow.

1295
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,240
So you would change the logistical

1296
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,960
dynamic. Logistical dynamics. Morale of

1297
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,960
the troop. Yeah. Okay. They are always

1298
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,960
aware.

1299
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,359
[Music]

1300
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:04,400
So if weather is bad and there is no

1301
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,240
connectivity with aircraft,

1302
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,119
these guys become you know

1303
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,119
psychologically depressed

1304
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,640
element

1305
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:23,039
that is their lifeline. Yes. So when

1306
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,960
weather is bad for 8 10 10 days at times

1307
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:31,960
even if we can't negotiate the weather

1308
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,960
if we just go over it and see whe

1309
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,359
[Music]

1310
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,799
20 minutes so it would have changed

1311
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,760
everything. Yes, dynamics. But yes I

1312
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:56,760
told you geopolitical

1313
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,760
diplomatic

1314
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,880
China

1315
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,720
right Mhivawa

1316
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:09,200
all these matters were not and when two

1317
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:12,079

1318
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,359
general Bharatwatch another very dynamic

1319
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:20,799
leader general army he is the one who

1320
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,799

right? They they border that, right?

1326
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:57,640
Javan's army were less. It's

1327
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,640
proportionate, you can say.

1328
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,440
See the innocence of that boy 18, 19

1329
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,440
years,

1330
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,559

[Music]

1332
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,760

1333
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:27,200
knew yes.

1334
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,359
So when I went back I told this to Babra

1335
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,000
and I said

1336
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:35,280

and I said that boy smiled s looking at

1340
01:05:52,559 --> 01:06:00,319

1341
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,000
to change that smile smirk into a very

1342
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,359
cute smile because he's a very young

1343
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,880

standing at the exact place where I had

1359
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:58,280
told him to stand. Interesting because I

1360
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,280

1361
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,720

hamper was handed over to him and I

1366
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,079
changed that smirk to a nice cute smile

1367
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,400
and when I speak to it it is in front of

1368
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,400

1369
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,400
don't have require strategic reasons

1370
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:43,119
right very very normal simple things

1371
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,599
which we don't consider as if something

1372
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:50,520
very great also make you do things right

1373
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,520
and for me that boy is saying

1374
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,079
was that connectivity to I'll tell you

1375
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,520
how and all we'll tell you later. Yeah,

1376
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:02,880
I did a trial landing came back

1378
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,880
leader

1379
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:20,440
so that we can change over the thing. So

1380
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,440
this okay

1381
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,359
you have to calculate. So first time

1382
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,640
when I took a load I had not decided to

1383
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,440
take passenger but then when we

1384
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,440
calculated in the air

1385
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:45,279
45% oxygen less engine running

1386
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,199
temperature - 40 - 30 even in this

1387
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,199
moment. Yes sir. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. May

1388
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:52,480
31st that is the temperature. Okay. It

1389
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:55,920
is a katcha katcha. So proper picking up

1390
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:59,120
dust heavy dust all around army people

1391
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:03,199
hats off to them in 20 minutes they used

1392
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,679
to upload more than three tons load wow

1393
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:08,640
that's operational tell you operational

1394
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,600
efficiency in hills that's why I say we

1395
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:15,440
are one of the best our army people are

1396
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:20,319
one of the best people in operating area

1397
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:23,920
or man behind the machine got it got

1398
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:27,199
Okay, let's take I am going to take 18

1399
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:31,359
was the calculation. 18 people in in 30

1400
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,960
seconds 18 got in. 30 seconds it took.

1401
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,159
Now they never knew I am going to take

1402
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,839
them but they got in. So when I took

1403
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,839
them to

1404
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:42,000
open the door

1405
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,640
they all came personally to thank me.

1406
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,279
This was the first guy first time I was

1407
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,839

1408
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:53,120

also happy I shook hand with each chap.

1410
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,840
When I look back just glance I said

1411
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,960
so I stopped one boy. I said

1412
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,520
so see the excitement in that man's life

1413
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:22,400
be sitting in air conditioned room have

1414
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,560
different definition of happiness right

1415
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,360
here is a happiness he's coming on leave

1416
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,440
without any luggage why because he

1417
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,320
doesn't have to walk for 15 days he's

1418
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:35,040
reaching in 20 minutes another thing

1419
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,960
Like that boy who satisfied me, I was so

1420
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:42,080
happy. You look one small activity by me

1421
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:45,440
has changed the complete complexion of

1422
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:48,159
that place. Right now, now he knows

1423
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:51,600
tomorrow if I fall sick, there will be a

1424
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:54,400
guy to pick me up, take me from here to

1425
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:59,040
straight Chandigar Hospital in one and a

1426
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:01,120
half hour and I'll be saved. Morale

1427
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,280
psychologically they were very very

1428
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,320
happy. That is why this action is

1429
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,640
considered and it was a tactical action

1430
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,880
done by a group captain. I was a group

1431
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,520
captain then proposed planned

1432
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,080
and executed.

1433
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,239
Why? Because of a leader like air

1434
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,600
marshall Babala

1435
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:26,320
right and and

1436
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,600
General Bharatch who helped in all this

1437
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,960
groundwork and the johnies who did that

1438
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,679

1439
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,320

Wow. Must be again first. Okay. Normally

1445
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,480
your unit sends it here. He said you

1446
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,159
don't have to bother what you're

1447
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,120
getting. You don't have to bother. That

1448
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:59,920
is my job. Leadership. Leadership. what

1449
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,800
to do is where I learned from this

1450
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:06,400
gentleman. He's Zumbbo but uh I still

1451
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,880
remember him with what off and

1452
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,840
another thing when we landed

1453
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,199
is what happened is as we were getting

1454
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:17,120
airborne he was the boss he got a

1455
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:19,679
information that they have called for

1456
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,320
flag meeting. You know what is flag

1457
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,640
meeting? No. You had DGMO meeting for

1458
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,120
Synindur right? Exactly same but at that

1459
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,679
border. Okay. So two major generals from

1460
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,360
each side meet right they call for each

1461
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,600
other.

1462
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,679
So this meeting was why you landed at

1463
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:41,679
DBO very stupid thing but you know China

1464
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,280
had you got used to it right?

1465
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,000
So they called for the meeting canceled

1466
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:48,800
it he canceled it they canceled it they

1467
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,080
only they again called it called for it

1468
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:55,199
after 3 hours again called called off.

1469
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:58,640
You know why? Why? DBO is our land.

1470
01:12:55,199 --> 01:13:01,520
Landing there or not is our prerogative.

1471
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,360
We have done it. Yeah. But that thing

1472
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,280
which was over 50 55 years been

1473
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,159
reflected to them that India is like

1474
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,080
this. They thought we can question but

1475
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,480
when they realized no there is no d in

1476
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,840
this internationally or nationally they

1477
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:21,360
called it off. Ah I see. And it didn't

1478
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,960
end here. This was 31st May 2008. I

1479
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,920
landed

1480
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,280
1st of or 2nd of June. You are Google

1481
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,560
people. You can Google it and you'll

1482
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:33,280
find that time foreign minister Pranab

1483
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:37,600
Mukharji had visited had to visit China

1484
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:40,640
on 3rd June. You can see in Google dates

1485
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:44,239
on 1st June I get a call night 11:00

1486
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:48,960
that you have to reach Delhi and explain

1487
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,880
the DBO landing why you did it. Ah okay

1488
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,520
now let me tell you my chief is sitting

1489
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:56,159
there my CNC is sitting there there are

1490
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,560
air marshal there but they wanted me to

1491
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,960
go and explain to air why right okay and

1492
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,360
you know why it's a foreign minister I'm

1493
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,560
visiting is diplomatic right so he

1494
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:12,400
wanted very diplomatic and nice answers

1495
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,400
and I had convinced them my bosses by

1496
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,800
diplomacy only I told them two three

1497
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,800
things why I want to land at tomorrow My

1498
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,719
people when they drop if they have a

1499
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,320
emergency like single engine which I had

1500
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,880
right they have to put down the aircraft

1501
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,360
you can't get out of there so there is a

1502
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,679
place for them to put down pilot saved

1503
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:33,679
let the aircraft as it is was going so

1504
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:36,560
number two rotation of troops 15 days

1505
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:39,600
walking torture yes here it is possible

1506
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:43,199
15 minutes right third casualty

1507
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,880
evocation yes that guy fourth the most

1508
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:47,040
important

1509
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,239
psychological

1510
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:52,640
He is sure that there will be somebody

1511
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:57,280
to pick me up if anything goes. Oh, I

1512
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:59,679
see. But a tactical action which I did

1513
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:04,800
and I was sure

1514
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:06,640
will be a strategic gain proved

1515
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,080
2008

1516
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:12,080
proved to be right in 2020. So to for

1517
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:15,360
today's youngsters I want to tell them

1518
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:18,080
whatever you do just do it. Don't keep

1519
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:20,560
asking for results. They may not come in

1520
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,440
your lifetime but that should not stop

1521
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:26,239
you in doing a job. I landed in DVO in

1522
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,640
2008 as a tactical action. I surely knew

1523
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:33,520
it is a strategic results this is going

1524
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:38,239
to give which gave and what happened in

1525
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:41,440
near Pangong. So right in 2020 in 2020

1526
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:44,320
they amassed their troops Chinese along

1527
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,440
the border. We had to pump in

1528
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:51,199
If in 2008 I had not landed there was no

1529
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:53,760
airfield there. Now C130

1530
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:57,440
which has got four engines much safer.

1531
01:15:53,760 --> 01:16:00,400
Okay. Landed did a lot of sorties pumped

1532
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,560
in the troops there and what happened

1533
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:05,600
thereafter in Galwan is well known to

1534
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:09,600
all. So

1535
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,760
my after my retirement 3 years later the

1536
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:15,600
whole country knew yes there was a

1537
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,760
strategic gain in this whole activity. M

1538
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,520
okay and more so that's why I mentioned

1539
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,040
to you

1540
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:27,679
so this is what is DBO story so this is

1541
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:31,920
from story displeasure to gallantry

1542
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:34,719
and I don't take the credit I give lot

1543
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:38,000
of credit to leadership both the side

1544
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:40,880
right okay arming and efforts both the

1545
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,159
side right okay and uh we keep talking

1546
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,719
about synergy synergy yap yap yap whole

1547
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,640
world keeps discussing.

1548
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,800
I never like that discussion because I

1549
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,600
have seen practically how synergic we

1550
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,679
are when it comes to a task. Got it.

1551
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,199
Okay. Yes. And I didn't stop at that

1552
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,800
because of that dynamic uh general

1553
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:04,239
Badwaj.

1554
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:07,120
I went on to open two more ALGs like

1555
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:10,159
this which were closed for 50 years.

1556
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,960
One is Fukche

1557
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:14,640
just south of Galwan in Sind Valley.

1558
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:19,040
Okay.

1559
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:21,600
Okay. And one new airfield at Nyoma

1560
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:26,640
which is you know from China's side if

1561
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:28,159
you go cross the laz synind river. Okay.

1562
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,400
There's only one valley which goes to

1563
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:32,159
lei from China side. That's a synindra

1564
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,920
valley. Yeah. And Lei is a very

1565
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,920
important place there. So if Chinese

1566
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,239
want to create some chaos they will

1567
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,000
always look at Lei. So we said

1568
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:43,440
strategically we should have some more

1569
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,360
one more in between. M so I started

1570
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,040
looking for it and you know why I did

1571
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:50,320
this to airfield because of my

1572
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:53,120
youngsters. Here comes the team

1573
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:57,760
after the success of DBO which was not

1574
01:17:53,120 --> 01:18:01,280
thought to be likelihood.

1575
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:04,640
Okay. whole my gang of people the FOs

1576
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:07,600
the army this that nobody was sure that

1577
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:10,080
is it okay especially chafer doing it

1578
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,800
because what happened to him in Cargill

1579
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:17,040
was not forgotten right right but we did

1580
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:19,760
it and we realized my youngster said

1581
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,880
said this has been done now something

1582
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:25,440
more look for it you have a eye for it I

1583
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,080
said okay f check this time last time

1584
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,400
you didn't ask the government by the M

1585
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,960
army prepared the runway. My boss

1586
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:37,679
cleared me to land. I proposed, planned

1587
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:40,920
and executed and then told

1588
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,920
this time

1589
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,159
November 2008 May November. So like five

1590
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:54,560
six months and then I looked for another

1591
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:56,159
place known as Nyoma and they created a

1592
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,239
it was slightly difficult because river

1593
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:00,640
was passing close by so it was very

1594
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:03,090
sandy sir.

1595
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:06,129
Yes sir.

1596
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:06,129
[Music]

1597
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,280
So this is the story of displeasure

1598
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:22,560
also. So that's why I said in the

1599
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:26,239
beginning failure is not fatal. Success

1600
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:28,480
is not final. Courage to go on continues

1601
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:30,800
and I do that

1602
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,520
after retirement also because that is

1603
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,920
what I feel that success is not final.

1604
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,239
So it be let's continue what we are

1605
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,719
doing. So this is a new chapter in my

1606
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,040
life, right? Okay. And that is how we

1607
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,080
move on. I have one last question, sir.

1608
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,440
How long do you think we've been

1609
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:50,960
talking? Uh I don't know maybe uh I I'll

1610
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:53,199
tell you the problem. Okay. I have got

1611
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:57,679
too many stories. Number one. Right.

1612
01:19:53,199 --> 01:20:00,320
Number two, I'm a QFI. Qi job is talk

1613
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:03,280
maximum so that when you are teaching

1614
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,679
them in the aircraft, you consume least

1615
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:08,320
time. So we are very talkative people.

1616
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:11,440
Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Okay. Right. And third,

1617
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,800
which all know as you grow old. Okay.

1618
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:19,640
That time I used to question my you know

1619
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,640
uh destiny. Okay.

1620
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,920
Right.

1621
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,280
Why?

1622
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,840
But then I realized when I retired one

1623
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,440
quote I saw and I keep quoting it now

1624
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,120
very often because all these quotes

1625
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,320
which I am quoting you know they are

1626
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,560
related to me that's why I'm quoting

1627
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:45,440
otherwise I'm not a quote man right

1628
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:48,960
destiny is not matter of chance

1629
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:52,320
destiny is matter of choice so make

1630
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:55,360
choices and destiny will follow the

1631
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:58,800
right path

1632
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:03,440
I made the choice of going to DBO

1633
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:06,400
After a horrible accident at Cargill

1634
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:10,239
I made a decision choice of not going to

1635
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:12,480
eastern as a commanding officer and the

1636
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:15,120
rest is as they say is history. I was

1637
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,600
posted to Chandig and I did this landing

1638
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:21,080
of three airfields. So destiny is not

1639
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,080
matter of chance.

1640
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:28,800
Make right choices, right? And

1641
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:32,800
definitely it will

1642
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:36,080
get you what you want. And why not? And

1643
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,960
why not? Why not? Maybe late, maybe this

1644
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,400
thing, but it does. Well, sir, this has

1645
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,880
been an absolute pleasure. We've been

1646
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,120
talking for over 100 minutes. Oh, and if

1647
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,239
and no, but this is a test of how how

1648
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,600
well the conversation's been.

1649
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,040
That means the conversation has been

1650
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,440
very well. Thank you so much for your

1651
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,520
time. All your people feel same. So

1652
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:59,280
they'll tell you that I I cannot promise

1653
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:01,120
this. I know audiences.

1654
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,280
How did you like your stories and sir,

1655
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,719
thank you so much for sharing this.

1656
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,679
Thank you so much for the energy you

1657
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,719
bring. Thank you so much for your

1658
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,000
service and thank you so much for what

1659
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,639
you've done for the country. You're most

1660
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,600
welcome and

1661
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:16,000
because it should reach the people.

1662
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,719
Okay. A thing which not many defense

1663
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
people do. I have done

1664
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:25,840
that is putting down pen on paper and

1665
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,719
telling them that this is my story. My

1666
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,679
story is shades of blue. Right. It is

1667
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:34,080
because of blue uniform, blue skies and

1668
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:37,199
blues in my life.

1669
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:40,400
Okay. In that I have said talked about

1670
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:42,960
uh you know the behind the curtain story

1671
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:47,280
of Cargill that how organizational

1672
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,840
things work right. Okay. And

1673
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,719
I have written this just to tell the

1674
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,239
whole world that organization is never

1675
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,639
bad.

1676
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:59,199
If you are doing genuinely something

1677
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:02,480
organization will always do justice to

1678
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:05,120
you. It is some people you come across.

1679
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:07,920
Okay. And uh for that also I have got a

1680
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,239
quote. I always tell them that there

1681
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:14,000
will be some people in your life who may

1682
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:16,719
not do wrong to you.

1683
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,480
Okay. But don't forget to thank them

1684
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,320
because they are the one who who made

1685
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,880
you strong.

1686
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:27,679
That incident what not to do of Cargill

1687
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:31,600
made me strong to do DBO DBO right which

1688
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:36,320
brought me from displeasure to this.

1689
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:39,120
Well sir, so that is what I will end the

1690
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,880
quote and 100 minutes is quite a time.

1691
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,600
Okay. No sir, thank you so much for your

1692
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,560
time as as always. I enjoyed this. These

1693
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:49,120
were some amazing stories.

1694
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
first person.
