Especially Iran's nuclear sites have been completely destroyed.   In fact, let me tell you, Israel has said that we will not stop until Iran's nuclear sites are destroyed. And because of this, the fear is that a very big war has now started in the Middle East.  I don't know how long this will continue and what will happen.  But you can see this news.  Israel has launched Operation Rising Line.  Iran's Uranium Enrichment Facility Hit Several Times.  So let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening right now in the Middle East.  What does Israel want? What can Iran do from here?  Let's move on. Look, first of all you have to understand some background. If you look at Iran's nuclear program, it was a huge concern for the entire world. Especially for Israel and the US.   Let me tell you here that Iran was going to do weapons grade uranium enrichment very soon. What happens is that if you have 90% purity of uranium enrichment then you can develop a nuclear bomb here and Iran had already achieved more than 60% purity and because of this, the Israeli intelligence was afraid that Iran would make a lot of nuclear weapons within a few days and somewhere the entire existential threat to Israel was going to be proved right and this is the main reason due to which you will see this entire attack. Well, understand its historical tension also.  There has been a shadow war going on between Israel and Iran for many decades.   What I mean to say is that there have been cyber attacks, assassinations, proxy attacks, via Hezbollah, sabotage, you will see many such things between the two countries. And if you look at the past, Israel had killed Iran's nuclear scientist, top nuclear scientist, for example, Mosen Fakrizadeh, here in 2020. And if you look at the recent weeks, the tensions have increased a lot.  Israel was particularly unhappy with the ballistic missiles being tested by Iran here. Apart from this, Iranian threats were being given against Israeli embassies.  Along with this, the activity of Hezbollah, which is Iran's proxy, had increased significantly in Southern Lebanon. Your Iran border is adjacent to Israel and because of this all the diplomatic attempts here were also failing.  You might have seen that here an attempt was being made to make a nuclear deal between Trump and Iran again, like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which Obama had cracked in 2015, which Trump pulled out in his first term, so here Trump was trying to make some kind of a deal and in fact letters were also exchanged between Iran and Trump, but it seems that no kind of deal could be made here and that is one of the biggest reasons, you will get to see this entire attack.  Well what happened here ?  What has Israel done?  Israel launched Operation Rising Lion early this morning under which many sites in Iran were attacked.  You can see that it is being said here that the F35 stealth jet was used by Israel so that many coordinated air strikes could be carried out inside Iran.  Apart from this, Iran's air defense radar was disabled through cyber attacks and at the same time, sabotage operation was conducted by Mossad, which is the Israeli intelligence agency. Many buildings inside the Iranian military buildings have been damaged and because of this, you can see here that the US says that we have no involvement in this.  I will discuss this further with you.  But let me tell you one more thing.  This morning, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion here; your first phase, the first round, is over and just before I was recording the video, the news came that the second round has started.   What this means is that Israel is not stopping at this time and is continuously bombing many places in Iran again and again.  And in fact, if you look at the major targets that have been hit in Iran, if you look carefully, the most important one here is the Natanz Nuclear Facility.  If you look at the map of Iran, here is its capital Tehran and just below it you can see here is Nathan, which is very important for Iran. Its facility is a uranium enrichment centre and it is being said that it has been severely damaged.  Apart from this, Khandab Heavy Water Reactor, if you come a little to the western side, you will find Khandab here.  So here also it is being said that this was a plutonium research centre. It has been hit by a cruise missile. Similarly, there is Khurramabad missile base here.  There was a ballistic missile stock pile there.  That too has been destroyed through explosion.  Along with this, many places like Iranian military command headquarters, IRGC airbase , residences of nuclear scientists have been specifically targeted.  Now look, targeting the residence of a nuclear scientist means that an attempt was made to destroy the enrichment activities that were going on here, the nuclear- related activities that were going on in Iran and the scientists who were involved in it.  Not only this, another important news has come here that the top commanders of Iran, you all must be knowing about IRGC, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, their top commander, Chief Hussain Salami, has been killed in the strike here. Apart from this, senior IRGC general Ghulam Ali Rashid has also been killed. Along with this, former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization nuclear scientist, all of them have been killed here.  Apart from this, it is also being said that in this air strike carried out by Israel, some civilians have also died, including women and children.  Well, now the question here is what justification has Israel given ?  Prime Minister Benjamin Netan Yahoo made a televised address to his entire nation and explained how Iran's nuclear program posed an existential threat to Israel.  This means that Iran could have made nuclear weapons here and fired them at Israel at any time. So this was a question about our existence. Because of this, we attacked Iran here. Apart from this, you can see that he claimed that Israel had no choice but to act unilaterally.  Apart from this he has said that Iran was days away from making 15 nuclear bombs.  Iran could have made 15 nuclear bombs in just a few days. And that is why he has said here that these attacks will continue until we dismantle and destroy Iran's nuclear capability. Well now the question arises what is its global reaction?   The first question is, what is America's role in this? Because it has always been seen that whenever Israel goes to war in the entire Middle East, America stands behind it. But you might have noticed that just a day or two ago the news came that Donald Trump had said that we are withdrawing our personnel from the Middle East. And he also said it is going to be a dangerous place.  Somewhere Trump had already indicated that the entire Middle East can become a very dangerous place.  Meaning, it was largely anticipated that Israel would attack Iran. But perhaps no one would have thought that this would happen so soon; just a day before, Trump's statement had come and then Israel attacked here. So in a way the US has said this in this attack.  In fact, you can look at Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  They have asserted that Israel has acted on its own. America has no role here. Apart from this, as far as the United Nations is concerned, it is being said that an emergency session has been called in the United Nations Security Council.  The UN Secretary General has described the situation here as very grave and unstable.  Then what does Iran have to say apart from this?  Look, Iran's Supreme Leader Avtula Khamenei has condemned the Israeli act and said that it is a criminal act and has promised that there will be severe retaliation for it and has said that Israel will pay a bitter price and has also said that Iranian military units have been put on high alert and Iran's long range missiles have been prepared.  Meaning that you may get the news within a short time or maybe by tomorrow morning that Iran has started the attack on Israel.  It will be interesting to see what happens and when. But definitely here if you look at the past record, the way Iran has retaliated, then there is a sure shot that Iran will also attack Israel in some way.  As far as Russia and China are concerned, they have condemned this action of Israel and also said that ceasefire should happen on immediate basis and also said that we should respect Iranian sovereignty.  You will see this stand.  Well, what is its immediate impact?  The immediate impact is that Israel has now gone on full war time alert.  It has called back all its reservists and the missile defence that is deployed across Tel Aviv, Haifa and at many other places in Israel has been deployed now. The missile defences have been put on full alert because when missiles or drones come from Iran, they will have to be targeted here. Apart from this, it is also being said that Iran can also target US military bases. This is often seen in Iraq and UAE. There is a set pattern. We will have to see what happens here but ultimately see, it affects the entire world.  It affects the economy of our country. And that is the global oil shock.  If you see here, as soon as the news broke out that Israel had attacked Iran, you can suddenly see a jump of 7 to 8% in crude oil and it has gone above $75.  And one of the main reasons for this is that there is a fear here that this Strait of Hormos which you are seeing, will there be any kind of blockage here? Because if something like this happens, then the passage of oil through this particular route will stop and ultimately there will be an impact on the supply and the prices of crude oil across the world may increase and this is the reason that if you see, as soon as the Indian stock market opened today, the Nifty went down by 300 points, there was a big fall in the Sensex, you will see a fall of more than 1-1% in the Indian stock market and if this war continues in this way, then this fall may deepen further here.  Now in the end the question that comes is what next?  Look, the first thing is that Iran will launch missile retaliation due to which a regional war can take place and Hezbollah, Syria, Iraq etc. can also be included in it. Along with this, it is also true that Israel can launch a second wave of air strikes here.  The second round of Operation Line has already started here.  But somewhere Israel has said that we will completely destroy Iran's military and nuclear capability. So it remains to be seen whether Israel does this or not.  Along with this, if global diplomacy intervenes then there may be a ceasefire but you will already see very heavy losses here. Then along with this, cyber war escalation can happen. Both Iran and Israel can launch cyber attacks on each other's infrastructure and nuclear systems. So let's see if any update related to this comes then I will make a video for you and before leaving, a very interesting question.  Can you tell here that all the countries which share border with Iran, so starting from Iran's western border, you have to arrange it clockwise here and the right answer of this, you all know, you will get it on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Twitter and friends, as I told you, Great Learning Festival is going on at present in Study IQ, under which you are being given extra discount on all our UPSC courses, especially in the Pratigya Foundation batch of 2026, you are getting more extra discount, you just have to use this code ankrit live to get maximum discount.
