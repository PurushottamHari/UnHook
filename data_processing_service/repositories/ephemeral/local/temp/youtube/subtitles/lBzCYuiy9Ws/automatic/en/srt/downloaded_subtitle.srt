1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,599
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello Friends.  Friends, Israel has launched

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
a huge attack on Iran.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
Especially Iran's nuclear sites have been

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
completely destroyed.   In

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
fact, let me tell you, Israel has

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
said that we will not stop until

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
Iran's nuclear sites are destroyed.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,120
And because of this, the fear is that

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
a very big war has now

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960
started in the Middle East.  I don't know how long this will continue and what will

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
happen.  But you can see this

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,760
news.  Israel has launched Operation

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,640
Rising Line.  Iran's Uranium

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
Enrichment Facility Hit Several Times.  So let us

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
understand this in a little detail as to

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,840
what exactly is happening right now in the Middle

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,439
East.  What does Israel want?

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
What can Iran do from here?  Let's move on.

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
Look, first of all you have to

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
understand some background.

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,119
If you look at Iran's nuclear program, it was a

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,680
huge concern for the entire world.

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,000
Especially for Israel and the US.   Let

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,960
me tell you here that Iran was going to do

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
weapons grade uranium enrichment very soon.

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,759

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,320
What happens is that if you have 90% purity of

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,720
uranium enrichment then

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,680
you can develop a nuclear bomb here and

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,759
Iran had already achieved more than 60% purity

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
and because of this, the

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,960
Israeli intelligence was afraid that

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
Iran would make a lot of nuclear weapons within a few days and

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
somewhere the entire

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,079
existential threat to Israel was going to be proved right

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
and this is the main reason

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,000
due to which you will see this entire attack.

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
Well, understand its historical tension also.  There has been

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,200

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,880
a shadow war going on between Israel and Iran for many decades.   What I

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
mean to say is that there have been cyber attacks,

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,920
assassinations, proxy attacks,

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,599
via Hezbollah, sabotage,

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
you will see many such things between the two countries.

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,920
And if you

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
look at the past, Israel had killed Iran's nuclear

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,120
scientist, top nuclear scientist,

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,599
for example, Mosen Fakrizadeh, here in 2020.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
And

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,840
if you look at the recent weeks, the tensions have

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
increased a lot.  Israel was particularly unhappy with the

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
ballistic missiles being tested by Iran here.

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,879

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
Apart from this, Iranian

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
threats were being given against Israeli

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,920
embassies.  Along with this, the activity of Hezbollah, which is Iran's

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,080
proxy, had

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
increased significantly in Southern Lebanon.

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
Your Iran border is

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
adjacent to Israel and because of this

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
all the diplomatic attempts here were also

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
failing.  You might have seen that here an

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,360
attempt was being made to make a

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,160

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
nuclear deal between Trump and Iran again, like the

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,120
Joint Comprehensive

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,440
Plan of Action which Obama had cracked in 2015, which Trump

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
pulled out in his first term, so here

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,360
Trump was trying to make some kind of a

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,599
deal and in fact letters were also

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
exchanged between Iran and Trump,

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,599
but it seems that no

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
kind of deal could be made here and that

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,480
is one of the biggest reasons, you will

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,720
get to see this entire attack.  Well what happened here

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,360
?  What has Israel done?  Israel

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,640
launched Operation Rising Lion early this morning

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,799
under which many

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
sites in Iran were attacked.  You

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,519
can see that it is being said here that the

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,239
F35 stealth jet was used by Israel

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,000
so that

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,239
many coordinated air strikes could be carried out inside Iran.  Apart from

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,799
this, Iran's

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,440
air defense radar was disabled

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,920
through cyber attacks and at the same time,

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,560

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,599

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,439
sabotage operation was conducted by Mossad, which is the Israeli intelligence agency.

103
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,599
Many buildings inside the Iranian military buildings have been

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,760
damaged and because of this,

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
you can see here that the US

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
says that we have

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,959
no involvement in this.  I

108
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,000
will discuss this further with you.  But let me tell you one more

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,480
thing.  This morning, Israel

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,879
launched Operation Rising Lion here;

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,040
your first phase, the first round, is

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
over and just before I was recording the video, the

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
news came that the

114
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,160
second round has started.   What this

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,639
means is that Israel is not stopping at this time

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,960
and is continuously

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
bombing many places in Iran again and again.  And in

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,280
fact, if you look at the major

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,880
targets that have been hit in Iran, if

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
you look carefully, the most

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,880
important one here is the Natanz Nuclear

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,280
Facility.  If you look at the map of Iran,

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,240
here is its capital Tehran and just

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,240
below it you can see here is Nathan, which is

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
very important for Iran.

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Its facility is a uranium

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,720
enrichment centre and it is being said that

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
it has been severely damaged.  Apart from this,

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
Khandab Heavy Water Reactor, if you

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,440
come a little to the western side,

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
you will find Khandab here.  So here also it is being said

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,600
that this was a plutonium research centre.

133
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,080
It has been hit by a cruise missile.

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Similarly, there is Khurramabad

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,880
missile base here.  There was a ballistic missile

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,440
stock pile there.  That too has been

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,520
destroyed through explosion.  Along with this,

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
many places like Iranian military command

139
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
headquarters, IRGC airbase

140
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,560
, residences of nuclear scientists have been

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
specifically targeted.  Now

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
look, targeting the residence of a nuclear scientist

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,759
means that an attempt was made to destroy the enrichment

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
activities that were going on here, the nuclear-

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
related activities that were going on in Iran and the

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
scientists who were involved in it.  Not

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,880
only this,

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,880
another important news has come here that the

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
top commanders of Iran, you all must be knowing

150
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,000
about IRGC, Islamic

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,280
Revolutionary Guard Corps, their top

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,440
commander, Chief Hussain Salami, has been

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,759
killed in the strike here.

154
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,240
Apart from this, senior IRGC general

155
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,560
Ghulam Ali Rashid has also been killed.

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
Along with this, former head of Iran's Atomic

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
Energy Organization nuclear scientist,

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
all of them have been killed here.  Apart from this, it is

159
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
also being said that in this

160
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,639
air strike carried out by Israel, some civilians have

161
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,880
also died, including women and

162
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,880
children.  Well, now the question here is

163
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,199
what justification has Israel given

164
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,440
?  Prime Minister Benjamin Netan

165
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,919
Yahoo made a televised address to

166
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
his entire nation and

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,000
explained how Iran's nuclear

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
program

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,720
posed an existential threat to Israel.  This means that

170
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,840
Iran could have made nuclear weapons here and fired them at Israel at any time.

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
So this was a

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,240
question about our existence.

173
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
Because of this, we attacked Iran here.

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
Apart from this, you can see that he

175
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,280
claimed that Israel had no choice but to

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,080
act unilaterally.  Apart from this he has said

177
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,560
that Iran was days away from making 15

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
nuclear bombs.  Iran could have

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
made 15 nuclear bombs in just a few days.

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,960
And that is why he has

181
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
said here that these attacks will continue

182
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
until we dismantle and destroy Iran's nuclear

183
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,360
capability.

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Well now the question

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
arises what is its global reaction?   The

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
first question is,

187
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
what is America's role in this?

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,199
Because it has always been seen that

189
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,520
whenever Israel goes to war in the entire Middle East,

190
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,599
America stands behind it.

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
But you might have noticed that

192
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,919
just a day or two ago the news came that

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
Donald Trump had said that we are

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
withdrawing our personnel from the Middle East.

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
And he also said it is

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,280
going to be a dangerous place.  Somewhere

197
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
Trump had already indicated that the

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
entire Middle East can become a very dangerous

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,720
place.  Meaning,

200
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
it was largely anticipated that Israel would attack Iran.

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
But

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
perhaps no one would have thought that this would happen so soon;

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,199
just a day before, Trump's statement had

204
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,000
come and then Israel attacked here.

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,840
So in a way the

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,080
US has said this in this attack.  In fact, you

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,080
can look at Secretary of State Marco

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Rubio.  They have asserted that

209
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Israel has acted on its own.

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,280
America has no role here.

211
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
Apart from this, as far as the United Nations is concerned, it is being

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
said that

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
an emergency session has been called in the United Nations Security Council.  The

214
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,440
UN Secretary General has

215
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,440

216
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,599
described the situation here as very grave and unstable.  Then

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
what does Iran have to say apart from this?  Look, Iran's

218
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
Supreme Leader Avtula Khamenei has

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
condemned the Israeli act and

220
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,039
said that it is a criminal act and has promised that there will be

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,319
severe retaliation for it and has

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,319
said that Israel will pay a bitter price and has

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,080
also said that Iranian military

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
units have been put on high alert and

225
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,479

226
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
Iran's long range missiles have been prepared.  Meaning that

227
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
you may get the news within a short time

228
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
or maybe by tomorrow morning that Iran has

229
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
started the attack on Israel.  It will be interesting to

230
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
see what happens and when.

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
But definitely here

232
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,760
if you look at the past record, the way

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,680
Iran has retaliated, then there is a

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,000
sure shot that Iran will also

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,920
attack Israel in some way.  As far as Russia and

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
China are concerned, they have

237
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,080
condemned this action of Israel and

238
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
also said that ceasefire should happen on immediate basis

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
and also said that

240
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,560
we should respect Iranian sovereignty.  You will

241
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
see this stand.  Well,

242
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,120
what is its immediate impact?  The immediate impact is that

243
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,279
Israel has now gone on full war time

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,920
alert.  It has

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,720
called back all its reservists and the

246
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,680
missile defence that is deployed across Tel Aviv,

247
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
Haifa and at many other places in Israel has been

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,440
deployed now. The

249
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
missile defences have been put on full alert

250
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,680
because when missiles

251
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,839
or drones come from Iran, they will have to be

252
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,720
targeted here. Apart from this,

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,800
it is also being said that Iran

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040

255
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
can also target US military bases. This is often seen in Iraq and UAE. There is a

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
set pattern. We will have to

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
see what happens here but

258
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,959
ultimately see, it affects the entire world.  It

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,680
affects the economy of our country.

260
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,000
And that is the global oil shock.  If you

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
see here, as soon as the news broke out

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,279
that Israel had attacked Iran,

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,519
you can suddenly see a jump of 7 to 8% in crude oil

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,399
and it has

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,480
gone above $75.  And one of the main

266
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
reasons for this is that there is a fear here that this

267
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Strait of Hormos which you are seeing, will there be

268
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
any kind of blockage here?

269
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,920
Because if something like this happens, then the

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
passage of oil through this particular route will stop

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,240
and ultimately there will be an impact on the supply and the

272
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,160

273
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,480
prices of crude oil across the world may increase and this is the

274
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,880
reason that if you see,

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,959
as soon as the Indian stock market opened today, the

276
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,120
Nifty went down by 300 points, there was a

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,880
big fall in the Sensex,

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
you will see a fall of more than 1-1% in the Indian stock

279
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
market and if this

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
war continues in this way, then this fall may

281
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
deepen further here.  Now

282
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
in the end the question that comes is what

283
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,079
next?  Look, the first thing is

284
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,120
that Iran will launch missile retaliation

285
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,839
due to which a regional war can take place and

286
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,160
Hezbollah, Syria, Iraq etc. can also be included in it.

287
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,600
Along with this, it is also true that

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
Israel can launch a second wave of air strikes here.  The

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760

290
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
second round of Operation Line has

291
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
already started here.  But

292
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
somewhere Israel has said that we will completely destroy Iran's

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,440
military and nuclear capability.

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,120
So it remains to be

295
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
seen whether Israel does this or

296
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,680
not.  Along with this, if global

297
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,560
diplomacy intervenes then there may be a

298
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,480
ceasefire but

299
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,399
you will already see very heavy losses here.

300
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
Then along with this, cyber war

301
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,560
escalation can happen.

302
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
Both Iran and Israel can launch cyber attacks on each other's

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,399
infrastructure and nuclear systems.

304
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
So let's see if

305
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,519
any update related to this comes then I will

306
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
make a video for you and before leaving, a very

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
interesting question.  Can you tell

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
here that all the countries which

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
share border with Iran, so starting

310
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,320
from Iran's western border, you have to

311
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,760
arrange it clockwise here and the

312
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
right answer of this, you all know, you will
