00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello Friends.  Friends, the war between Israel and Iran is

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,200
escalating rapidly.  Seeing the way

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,920
Israel attacked Iran,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,679
Iran launched Operation True Promise

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
3 and a

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,000
huge attack was carried out on many cities of Israel.  In

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
fact let me tell you that

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,760
in this entire war this would probably be the first time in the history

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,080
that exo atmospheric interception was done

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
by Israel.  Meaning that the

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
ballistic missile that was launched here was

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,280
intercepted in space by Iran and shot down.  You can see this

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,760
news.  Iran Launches Operation True

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,440
Promise 3rd Largest Missile Attack Yet

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
on Israel.  Let us understand this in a little detail

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,879
as to what exactly is happening at this time

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
?  How is Iran attacking?   In

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,520
fact, Donald Trump says that

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,680
we had given 60 days time to Iran.  That is

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,200
over now.  You will get to know a lot.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's get started.  Look,

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,559
first of all you have to know a little bit of

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
background here.  What happened?

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,520
You might have noticed that Israel has

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
started Operation Rising Line here

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,879
against Iran.  And here on many

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,520
locations in Iran, in fact, the news came yesterday that Israel has

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,920
attacked more than 200 locations inside Iran.

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,560
And especially here, the main

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
objective was the underground nuclear

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
enrichment sites.  Fordo is done, Natanj is done.

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,479
Apart from this Irshaan also happened.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,479
Attacks were carried out at many places inside Iran

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,720
so that the infrastructure of the nuclear sites

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,200
could be destroyed.

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,600
Along with this, attempts were

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,680
also made to destroy the command posts and air defense systems of the IRGC.  In

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,680
fact,

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,799
you can see in many satellite pictures etc.

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
how the infrastructure of the Nathans enrichment

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,119
complex

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
here has been attacked.  Apart from this, there are

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,280

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
direct attacks on many buildings etc. inside Iran.  The

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
attempt was to kill the top military

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,079
leaders in Iran here.

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,320
And keeping all these things in mind, in

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,200
fact if you see yesterday,

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,360
Israel carried out two big attacks here.  Firstly, the

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
attack was started here yesterday morning

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,840
and late last night the news

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,320
came that Israel has again

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
started attacking inside Iran.  So,

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,520
looking at all these things, Iran's response

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,239
came and they launched Operation Severe Punishment

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,840
or True Promise Three.

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,560
Now True Promise Three because

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
you might remember last year True Promise Two was

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,480
launched here.  At that time also missile attacks were taking place between Israel and Iran

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,720
and

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,520
before that True Promise One was launched.

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,440
So if you see here, Iran has carried out

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,840
major missile retaliation

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
against Israel and has said that Israel will receive severe punishment

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
here.  In fact, if you

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,760
see, the missiles that have been fired here are

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,920
around 150 ballistic

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,640
missiles. Understand carefully, we are

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,680
talking about ballistic missiles like Fateh 110,

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,080
Zulfikar Shah variant, of many types, and

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
what are the targets here?  Like Talviv happened.

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
If you see, this is a very important city

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,640
of Israel and apart from this there is Jerusalem

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
and along with this here in the center and in

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Southern Israel in the Negev Desert, there are

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,280
many military installations of

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
Israel where attempts were made to attack them.  Apart from

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,560
this, Iran

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
also took help of many additional drones.  They

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,360

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,599
also tried to attack many of Israel's radar

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
systems etc. through drones like Shahid type which are suicide drones.   In

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,000
fact, if you look at this entire attack, it is

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,800
not that it has been carried out only by Iran.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,040
Iran's proxies are there, then there is Iraq,

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
apart from that there is Syria, there is Lebanon.

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,360

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
Attempts were made to attack Israel from many places.  And

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
if you look at the areas that have been hit, it is being

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,760
said that three buildings in Tel Aviv have been

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
hit on a large scale.

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,760
In which 22 civilians have been injured.  One person has

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,920
also died.

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
A large explosion was seen here inside Jerusalem,

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
on the western outskirts.  Along with this,

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
military installations

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,040
inside Israel were also targeted.  Along with this, many

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
airports also had to be shut down.

101
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,400
Meaning that

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,879
Iran has carried out retaliation on a very large scale against Israel.

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
Attacked on a large scale.  And

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
looking at this, it is obvious that

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,280
you all know that in Israel you get to see a very large multi-

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
layered missile defense system.

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Because there is continuous war going on

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
and whenever

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,959
any

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,959
missiles are launched by Hamas or Hezbollah, their

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
multilayered missile defence system

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,880
gets activated.  And there

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
are many things inside it.  Like for example

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
Iron Dome.  What does the Iron Dome basically do?   It

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,880
intercepts short range missiles.  Apart from this, David

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
Sling intercepts medium range

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,759
projectiles and missiles.

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,440
As far as Arrow Two and Arrow

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,680
Three are concerned, look, this becomes very

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
important.  Arrow Three intercepts the

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
long-range ballistic missiles here,

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,320
and this makes

124
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,040
it very important because

125
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,960
now Hamas and Hezbollah are not waging war here in a direct way.

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
Here Iran is

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,080
firing missiles directly.  So

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,560
because of this the Arrow Three Cons increases.

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, if you see, a lot of missiles were

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,680
intercepted and shot down and in

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,080
fact the US also helped Israel here

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,080
so that the missiles that were being fired could be

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,960
intercepted and shot down.

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,120
But the most important thing that came to

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,600
light sometime ago yesterday is that

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
Israel destroyed Iran's missile

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240
in space itself.  And that is why there is

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,960
discussion about exo

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,280
atmospheric interception here.  What it basically is is that

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
Iran launched several long range

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,919
ballistic missiles.  So

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,520
what happens here is that

143
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,919
you all know the trajectory of ballistic missiles that

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,240
it first goes into your space.   goes

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,320
out of the atmosphere.  It comes

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,320
out of the earth's atmosphere and goes into space

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
and then taking direction from there,

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,720
comes downwards with the help of gravity

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,479
and hits.  So this is the

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
trajectory of ballistic missiles.  So it is being

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,520
said that

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,160
if we look at it, then perhaps for the first time in history,

153
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,639
Iran or Israel

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
intercepted Iran's missile in space and

155
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,160
shot it down.  This marks the first

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,120
non-operational use of Arrow Three.  And

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,199
you will see the first non-operational use of Arrow Three

158
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
during the war.  Well,

159
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,000
if we talk about this exo-atmospheric interception,

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,280
you will be able to understand it well from this diagram.

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like suppose this is your Iran and

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,000
here is your Israel.  Ok?  So the

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
ballistic missile that Iran launched here,

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
this part is your earth

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,960
's atmosphere.  So

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,039
this missile first comes out of the Earth's atmosphere.  goes into space.

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
So this

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,039
starting face is called the boost face.

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,759
When it remains in space,

170
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,639
we call it mid course face.  So,

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,520
in the mid-course phase,

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,520
Israel launched its Arrow Three defence

173
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
system and launched the missiles

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,720
and destroyed these Iranian missiles in the mid-course phase, in the space itself.

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,960
So

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
this is called exo atmospheric

177
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
interception.  And see why this is so important

178
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
?  Let me tell you some reasons.

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,199
Because if you fire a ballistic

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,759
missile in space, there are

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,319
many benefits to it.  Like here,

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,800

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,039
any type of warhead, be it nuclear, biological, chemical, etc., gets

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
destroyed before it even reaches your atmosphere.

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,599
So you don't have to worry about any loss.  Apart from

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
this, suppose the

187
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
missile comes into the atmosphere and

188
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,440
you destroy it there, then many of its debris

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
etc. can fall in your area.  So

190
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,000
that could cause harm as well.  And what is even more

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
important here is that there are multiple

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
war heads of missiles, like a

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
ballistic missile, suppose if it

194
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,800
enters the atmosphere, then what happens is

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,360
that it spreads into multiple war heads.

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
You can target multiple places with a single missile.

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,520
So before that happens, when you

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
blast it into space and destroy it,

199
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,639
then there are no chances of it happening.  So

200
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,560
that's why it is much more reliable if

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
you can make these kind of interceptions in space itself.

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
So, as I was telling you, till now in military history, this is

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
probably the

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,120
first time in the world that such an

205
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,520
interception has been witnessed during a real war.

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
Well here

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,199
also keep in mind the Arrow 3 Missile Defense System

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,039
as it may be asked in your exam

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,199
as it is in lot of news these days.

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,840
Arrow Three is the top layer of

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,879
Israel's multitiered missile defense

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,280
network, which targets long-range, high-altitude

213
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
threats.

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
Who has developed this?  It is jointly developed by Israel

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,280
Aerospace Industries and the US Missile

216
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
Defense Agency

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,879
and has been operational since 2017 and in fact has been

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,879
continuously upgraded.

219
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,280
It was also sold to Germany in 2023 and is already

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
deployed in Israel.  Well,

221
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,039
considering all these things,

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,039
what is the international reaction coming?  Let

223
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,959
me tell you one thing here, the United Nations is saying

224
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
that look, the Security Council meeting is being called

225
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,360
urgently.  Russia and China in

226
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,760
a way criticized Israel's initial

227
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,399
strike.  Gulf

228
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,279
states Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar all

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,600
raised concerns.  But America is

230
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,600
now completely

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,160
standing with Israel.  In fact, if you see,

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Donald Trump was interviewed by journalists

233
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,240
, by the media, and in that,

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,720
Donald Trump said, not concerned about

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,120
the war with Iran, 60 days, today is 61.

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,080
So basically here Trump is trying to say

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,480
that

238
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
we have been trying to do the nuclear deal with Iran for a long time

239
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,279
and we had given 60 days' time.  In

240
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,800
fact, Trump said that the

241
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,360
intermediaries in Oman, Qatar, back channels in

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,560
Europe all knew that we have

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,800
given 60 days to Iran to do this deal.

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,279
And in fact, if you

245
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,440
remember, Trump had also sent a letter

246
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,519
to Iran saying that these are the terms and conditions of these deals.

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Let's finalise this.

248
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,720
So Trump said that look, this

249
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,360
entire negotiation, the deadline that we had

250
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,160
given, ends on 13th June.  In

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,399
fact, Trump also said that we had

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,440
also advised Israel to

253
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,120
stop the strike right now.  But Israel

254
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
might not have listened and said, no

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
look, this entire deadline is over

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680
and Iran

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
can make nuclear weapons anytime and that is

258
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
why we want that Iran should be

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
completely destroyed, their

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,680
infrastructure should be destroyed. So in a

261
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
way Trump is accepting the fact that the

262
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,640
US was well aware

263
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,640
of Operation Rising Line and now Trump is

264
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
saying that look,

265
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
I am not concerned about this war.  It is not like

266
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,800
this war will spread on a large scale because

267
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,880
Iran knows that it will

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,480
not be able to survive in this war.  This is what Trump is

269
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
trying to suggest.  In fact, Trump is also saying

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
that Iran still has time if

271
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,000
it accepts the deal.  In fact, let me

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
tell you that on Sunday, that is tomorrow,

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
here in Qatar, sorry not in Qatar, but in Oman,

274
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
negotiations are going to take place between the US and Iran.

275
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,880
Indirect talks are going to happen.

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
So it remains to be seen whether Iran

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
accepts the US's stance here.  It will be interesting to see what he does

278
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,519
here.  But a lot

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,160
can happen.  See, if some kind of

280
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,160
deal is reached tomorrow because Israel is basically

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,000
saying that we do not want

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Iran to make nuclear weapons.  If

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
he makes a nuclear weapon then it will be an

284
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,240
existential threat to us.  That is why

285
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,920
you will get to see this entire war.  So I

286
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
hope you have understood this latest news

287
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
and before leaving, there is an

288
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,760
interesting question. I have to tell

289
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200

290
