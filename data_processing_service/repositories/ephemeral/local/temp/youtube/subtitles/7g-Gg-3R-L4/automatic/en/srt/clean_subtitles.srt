Hello Friends.  Friends, the war between Israel and Iran is escalating rapidly.  Seeing the way Israel attacked Iran, Iran launched Operation True Promise 3 and a huge attack was carried out on many cities of Israel.  In fact let me tell you that in this entire war this would probably be the first time in the history that exo atmospheric interception was done by Israel.  Meaning that the ballistic missile that was launched here was intercepted in space by Iran and shot down.  You can see this news.  Iran Launches Operation True Promise 3rd Largest Missile Attack Yet on Israel.  Let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening at this time ?  How is Iran attacking?   In fact, Donald Trump says that we had given 60 days time to Iran.  That is over now.  You will get to know a lot. Let's get started.  Look, first of all you have to know a little bit of background here.  What happened? You might have noticed that Israel has started Operation Rising Line here against Iran.  And here on many locations in Iran, in fact, the news came yesterday that Israel has attacked more than 200 locations inside Iran. And especially here, the main objective was the underground nuclear enrichment sites.  Fordo is done, Natanj is done. Apart from this Irshaan also happened. Attacks were carried out at many places inside Iran so that the infrastructure of the nuclear sites could be destroyed. Along with this, attempts were also made to destroy the command posts and air defense systems of the IRGC.  In fact, you can see in many satellite pictures etc. how the infrastructure of the Nathans enrichment complex here has been attacked.  Apart from this, there are direct attacks on many buildings etc. inside Iran.  The attempt was to kill the top military leaders in Iran here. And keeping all these things in mind, in fact if you see yesterday, Israel carried out two big attacks here.  Firstly, the attack was started here yesterday morning and late last night the news came that Israel has again started attacking inside Iran.  So, looking at all these things, Iran's response came and they launched Operation Severe Punishment or True Promise Three. Now True Promise Three because you might remember last year True Promise Two was launched here.  At that time also missile attacks were taking place between Israel and Iran and before that True Promise One was launched. So if you see here, Iran has carried out major missile retaliation against Israel and has said that Israel will receive severe punishment here.  In fact, if you see, the missiles that have been fired here are around 150 ballistic missiles. Understand carefully, we are talking about ballistic missiles like Fateh 110, Zulfikar Shah variant, of many types, and what are the targets here?  Like Talviv happened. If you see, this is a very important city of Israel and apart from this there is Jerusalem and along with this here in the center and in Southern Israel in the Negev Desert, there are many military installations of Israel where attempts were made to attack them.  Apart from this, Iran also took help of many additional drones.  They also tried to attack many of Israel's radar systems etc. through drones like Shahid type which are suicide drones.   In fact, if you look at this entire attack, it is not that it has been carried out only by Iran. Iran's proxies are there, then there is Iraq, apart from that there is Syria, there is Lebanon. Attempts were made to attack Israel from many places.  And if you look at the areas that have been hit, it is being said that three buildings in Tel Aviv have been hit on a large scale. In which 22 civilians have been injured.  One person has also died. A large explosion was seen here inside Jerusalem, on the western outskirts.  Along with this, military installations inside Israel were also targeted.  Along with this, many airports also had to be shut down. Meaning that Iran has carried out retaliation on a very large scale against Israel. Attacked on a large scale.  And looking at this, it is obvious that you all know that in Israel you get to see a very large multi- layered missile defense system. Because there is continuous war going on and whenever any missiles are launched by Hamas or Hezbollah, their multilayered missile defence system gets activated.  And there are many things inside it.  Like for example Iron Dome.  What does the Iron Dome basically do?   It intercepts short range missiles.  Apart from this, David Sling intercepts medium range projectiles and missiles. As far as Arrow Two and Arrow Three are concerned, look, this becomes very important.  Arrow Three intercepts the long-range ballistic missiles here, and this makes it very important because now Hamas and Hezbollah are not waging war here in a direct way. Here Iran is firing missiles directly.  So because of this the Arrow Three Cons increases. Well, if you see, a lot of missiles were intercepted and shot down and in fact the US also helped Israel here so that the missiles that were being fired could be intercepted and shot down. But the most important thing that came to light sometime ago yesterday is that Israel destroyed Iran's missile in space itself.  And that is why there is discussion about exo atmospheric interception here.  What it basically is is that Iran launched several long range ballistic missiles.  So what happens here is that you all know the trajectory of ballistic missiles that it first goes into your space.   goes out of the atmosphere.  It comes out of the earth's atmosphere and goes into space and then taking direction from there, comes downwards with the help of gravity and hits.  So this is the trajectory of ballistic missiles.  So it is being said that if we look at it, then perhaps for the first time in history, Iran or Israel intercepted Iran's missile in space and shot it down.  This marks the first non-operational use of Arrow Three.  And you will see the first non-operational use of Arrow Three during the war.  Well, if we talk about this exo-atmospheric interception, you will be able to understand it well from this diagram. Like suppose this is your Iran and here is your Israel.  Ok?  So the ballistic missile that Iran launched here, this part is your earth 's atmosphere.  So this missile first comes out of the Earth's atmosphere.  goes into space. So this starting face is called the boost face. When it remains in space, we call it mid course face.  So, in the mid-course phase, Israel launched its Arrow Three defence system and launched the missiles and destroyed these Iranian missiles in the mid-course phase, in the space itself. So this is called exo atmospheric interception.  And see why this is so important ?  Let me tell you some reasons. Because if you fire a ballistic missile in space, there are many benefits to it.  Like here, any type of warhead, be it nuclear, biological, chemical, etc., gets destroyed before it even reaches your atmosphere. So you don't have to worry about any loss.  Apart from this, suppose the missile comes into the atmosphere and you destroy it there, then many of its debris etc. can fall in your area.  So that could cause harm as well.  And what is even more important here is that there are multiple war heads of missiles, like a ballistic missile, suppose if it enters the atmosphere, then what happens is that it spreads into multiple war heads. You can target multiple places with a single missile. So before that happens, when you blast it into space and destroy it, then there are no chances of it happening.  So that's why it is much more reliable if you can make these kind of interceptions in space itself. So, as I was telling you, till now in military history, this is probably the first time in the world that such an interception has been witnessed during a real war. Well here also keep in mind the Arrow 3 Missile Defense System as it may be asked in your exam as it is in lot of news these days. Arrow Three is the top layer of Israel's multitiered missile defense network, which targets long-range, high-altitude threats. Who has developed this?  It is jointly developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and the US Missile Defense Agency and has been operational since 2017 and in fact has been continuously upgraded. It was also sold to Germany in 2023 and is already deployed in Israel.  Well, considering all these things, what is the international reaction coming?  Let me tell you one thing here, the United Nations is saying that look, the Security Council meeting is being called urgently.  Russia and China in a way criticized Israel's initial strike.  Gulf states Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar all raised concerns.  But America is now completely standing with Israel.  In fact, if you see, Donald Trump was interviewed by journalists , by the media, and in that, Donald Trump said, not concerned about the war with Iran, 60 days, today is 61. So basically here Trump is trying to say that we have been trying to do the nuclear deal with Iran for a long time and we had given 60 days' time.  In fact, Trump said that the intermediaries in Oman, Qatar, back channels in Europe all knew that we have given 60 days to Iran to do this deal. And in fact, if you remember, Trump had also sent a letter to Iran saying that these are the terms and conditions of these deals. Let's finalise this. So Trump said that look, this entire negotiation, the deadline that we had given, ends on 13th June.  In fact, Trump also said that we had also advised Israel to stop the strike right now.  But Israel might not have listened and said, no look, this entire deadline is over and Iran can make nuclear weapons anytime and that is why we want that Iran should be completely destroyed, their infrastructure should be destroyed. So in a way Trump is accepting the fact that the US was well aware of Operation Rising Line and now Trump is saying that look, I am not concerned about this war.  It is not like this war will spread on a large scale because Iran knows that it will not be able to survive in this war.  This is what Trump is trying to suggest.  In fact, Trump is also saying that Iran still has time if it accepts the deal.  In fact, let me tell you that on Sunday, that is tomorrow, here in Qatar, sorry not in Qatar, but in Oman, negotiations are going to take place between the US and Iran. Indirect talks are going to happen. So it remains to be seen whether Iran accepts the US's stance here.  It will be interesting to see what he does here.  But a lot can happen.  See, if some kind of deal is reached tomorrow because Israel is basically saying that we do not want Iran to make nuclear weapons.  If he makes a nuclear weapon then it will be an existential threat to us.  That is why you will get to see this entire war.  So I hope you have understood this latest news and before leaving, there is an interesting question.
