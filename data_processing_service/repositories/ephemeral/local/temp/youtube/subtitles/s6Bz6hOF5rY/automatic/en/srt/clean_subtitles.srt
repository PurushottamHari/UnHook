Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, finally Pakistan has accepted in its report that there is a huge water crisis going on there and obviously you will see its direct link with the Indus Water Treaty. Well, keep in mind that the entire Indus water system becomes very important for Pakistan.  Just imagine, if 80 to 90% of the entire agriculture of a country is dependent on a particular river system and if there is any problem there, then you will see its direct impact on their economy and GDP. You can see this news report on India's Indus Treaty Suspension Leads to Water Crisis in Pakistan.  So we will understand this in a little detail as to what exactly Pakistan has said in its report and what its impact could be.  Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that from today our foundation batch of Pratigya for 2026 UPSC is starting.  The most special thing about this batch is that if you take it, you can achieve it and even crack the prelims.  The entire fee will be refunded to you. Apart from this there are many features.  The link is given in the comment section. All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get started.  First of all let me tell you that a report has been released by the Pakistan Government.  In that he says that there has been a shortfall of 13.3% in the Indus River System as compared to last year and it is being said here that India has cancelled the water sharing treaty of 1960.  Because of this, all this is being seen.  Well, let me quickly give you a little background about this. As you may know, in 1960, the peace between India and Pakistan was mediated by the World Bank.  The entire Indus Water Treaty was signed.   There is a simple thing in this, you all must know that here there are three rivers Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, the water of which will be used by Pakistan.  But yes, India was also given the right to use this water.  But in limited quantity.  Meaning, we cannot stop the flow of water here. If some small dams etc. need to be built there, they can be done. But the water flow should not stop. Well, here the Eastern River, that is Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all this water can be used by India.  He can use it as he wishes.  So, here you all know that the war of 1965 took place. 1971, Kargil.  Despite that, if you observe, this treaty continued.  It was not even suspended.  So probably this is one of the longest treaties in the world that you can say has been in place till now. But it is obvious that Pakistan is not relenting. Continuously tries to shed blood in India through terrorism.  The recent Pahalgam terror attack happened.  Probably this was such an occasion where the Indian government wanted to take every step to teach Pakistan a lesson. And finally, the Cabinet Committee on Security decided that the Indus Water Treaty would be suspended and in view of this, we also wrote a letter to Pakistan. So India declared that no water will flow to Pakistan until Pakistan controls terrorism and stops terrorism. And India's action was probably the first formal suspension of the treaty since its inception. Well India, is India taking advantage of this water treaty which we have stopped ?  Look, many hydro power projects which were already being tried to be built on Chenab river are being fast tracked.  Be it Pakaldul Dam, Kiru Dam, Kawar Dam or Ratle Dam.  So in which you will see different capacities.  So these dams which have been built are meant to utilize the water without violating the Indus Water Treaty.  So, in the beginning we were making it so that we could use the water without violating the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty. But now India will try to see how we can divert water through these dams ?  How can we conserve water and use it within India itself? So many such things are actually being done by India.   So in a way, if we can regulate the flow of water through reservoirs.  In a way, if we can implement run of river projects, then the availability of water in Pakistan will decrease and its direct impact will be seen on Pakistan 's agricultural irrigation and ultimately on its GDP.  Well, what will be the impact on Pakistan and if you see, Pakistan has talked about agricultural shock in its report. He has said that look, in Pakistan, the month of June marks the start of Kharif crop season.  You all know about Kharif crops, rice, maize and cotton are grown in India also. So the Indus River System Authority of Pakistan prepared a report here and told how this year there has been a drop of about 13 to 21% in the river flow compared to last year.  For example, it was told that last year in 2024, 144 i.e. 144000 cusecs of water was released.  But here only 124500 cusecs of water was released on the fifth of June.  So if you look at Punjab and Sindh provinces, they rely heavily on irrigation.  If you see this, it has become the entire Punjab province.  But below it became Sindh province and finally, as you all know, the Indus water ultimately falls into the Arabian Sea.  So here both the provinces, Punjab and Sindh, are highly dependent on the Indus Water System. Even if irrigation is done and there is a shortage of water here, then ultimately you will see its impact on the crop yield. Meaning, whatever farming and crop production should have happened there, it may not be possible there.  In fact, you might remember that recently a video also came from Pakistan which went viral. You are seeing this in Sindh, Karachi, there is an airport there and the Pakistani actress Hina Khawaja Bayad made that video at the airport itself and released it on social media and told how there is no water even inside the toilets at the Karachi airport. So he told the government of Pakistan and the establishment that what kind of facilities are they providing now, which went viral very fast, think about it, you are not able to get water even at a place like the airport. Well apart from this, if you see, news is also coming that the Chenab river is also dry in many places, especially because India has closed the Baglihar and Salal dams.  So the tensions are continuously increasing.  But ultimately see, if agriculture is getting impacted here then it will have a big impact on the economy of Pakistan.  The Kharif crop is very critical for the food security of Pakistan.  Not just food security, even the little earnings that these people are able to make through export will not be possible here.  So due to water shortages the entire planting cycle gets disrupted.   The contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in a way, the contribution of GDP through agriculture will decrease. You all already know about the food inflation that is there in Pakistan, I mean I don't know whether it is 25% or 30%, the food inflation has gone up to 40-40%.  Imagine you will see inflation of 40-40%.  So there is a danger of this inflation increasing further and ultimately because of this, you may witness what is called civil war, civil unrest, complete social unrest because if people do not get food to eat, they will not be able to buy it with the money they have. So it is obvious that you will see all these problems.  Well now what diplomatic and legal moves are being taken by Pakistan?  If you look at the official response of Pakistan, then news is also coming out that Pakistan has so far written four formal letters to India. It is clear that Pakistan is in panic at this time. He is repeatedly requesting India to please release the water.  Do not suspend the Indus Water Treaty.  So now it is considering that it will go to international arbitration. Meaning, if India does not listen, and it is obvious that India will not listen this time no matter what happens, then this place will go to the World Bank.  Now it does not seem that the World Bank will be able to help much.   The President of the World Bank himself came and met PM Modi and said that look, we just played the role of a mediator.  What we can do within this and as far as possible Pakistan should go to the Permanent Court of Arbitration.  So we will have to see how India takes its stand there. Well, apart from this, Pakistan is also giving threats and intimidation.  He is saying that suspending these Indus Water Treaties means violation of international law and in some way it is an act of war.  So in a way, this matter can escalate further from here.  Well, how India is adopting it as a pressure tool. India's message is clear.  Water and blood cannot flow together. India has said this before also.  I have said it this time also. And somewhere, by suspending the Indus Water Treaty, we are taking non-military punitive measures.  That means, without firing any missile or doing anything, we are, in a way, teaching Pakistan a lesson. Apart from this, you will also see this strategic shift here.  That means, if you look at India's foreign policy, somewhere or the other we are aligning water security with national security. So India is also building diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to act against terror groups.  It is possible that under immense pressure, the people there will come out on the streets and tell the Pakistani government, why do you spread terrorism?  Why are all these things there ?  Well, that will have to be seen because if water is not available then all these things can happen. And look, news is also coming in that India has already started the pre-feasibility study for diverting Chenab water here.  This entire project has been proposed so that 15 to 20 million feet of water from Chenab can be given to other states of India like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan. We will use it.  Well, its legal and ethical consideration is also being done. Questions are being asked whether India has violated the treaty?  Look, if you look technically, we took a unilateral decision.  So technically it can be said that yes India did violet it.  But India has a proper argument. India says that look, one thing is that already India has a right over the rivers here like Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, which are of Pakistan. We can use it for limited time. So even when we were using it limitedly, Pakistan kept saying something or the other again and again.  And now what has happened is that the water has gone over the head.  The way terrorism is being spread.  So you cannot expect that you will shed blood in India and we will continue to give you water. So, don’t expect this.  So India has its own logic and very solid justification here and what could be its geopolitical implication?  Look, a very dangerous president may be set to weaponize water.  Because such things can often be done in times of conflict. Apart from this, there can also be international pressure here.  It is possible  Now let's see how India can handle it easily.  Then along with this, Pakistan can take help from China to put pressure on India here through Brahmaputra.  But if you actually see, China will not be able to do much.  Because the situation in Pak means that most of the water in the Brahmaputra, if you see, when the Brahmaputra river enters India, it comes there.  The most China can do is threaten to suddenly release a lot of water. In that case, we may face situations like flood etc.  But ultimately, China actually has no control over the water shortage that is being talked about.  Ok?  You also need to understand this.  So the conclusion is that India's suspension of Indus Water Treaty in response to terrorism is a very major shift in South Asia water diplomacy and here the effort will be to monitor it carefully. What is the next step India takes? What does Pakistan take?  The whole world will be keeping an eye on this.
