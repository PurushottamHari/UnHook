2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,000
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, finally

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Pakistan has accepted in its report

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
that there is a huge water

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,960
crisis going on there and obviously

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,640
you will see its direct link with the Indus Water Treaty.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
Well, keep in mind that the

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
entire Indus

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,720
water system becomes very

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,480
important for Pakistan.  Just imagine, if

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,480
80 to

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,719
90% of the entire agriculture of a country is dependent on a particular river system

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,360
and if there is any problem there, then

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,840
you will see its direct impact on their economy and GDP.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
You can see this news report on India's Indus

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
Treaty Suspension Leads to Water Crisis

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
in Pakistan.  So

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
we will understand this in a little detail as to

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,920
what exactly Pakistan has said in its report

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
and what its impact could be.  Let's

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
move on.  But before that, friends, let me

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,039
tell you all that from today our foundation

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,960

Apart from this there are many features.  The

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
link is given in the comment section.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,119
All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
so that you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,640
started.  First of all let me tell you that

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
a report has been released by the Pakistan Government.  In that

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,840
he

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,920
says that there has been a shortfall of 13.3% in the Indus River System as

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
 

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,479

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,840
compared to last year and it is being said here

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,400
that India has cancelled the water sharing

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
treaty of 1960.  Because of this,

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
all this is being seen.  Well, let

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
me quickly give you a little background about this.

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
As you may know,

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,479
in 1960, the peace between India and Pakistan was

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
mediated by the World Bank.  The

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,200
entire Indus Water Treaty was signed.   There is a

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,320
simple thing in this, you all must know that

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,200
here there are three rivers Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, the

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,600
water of which will be

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,000
used by Pakistan.  But yes, India was also given the right to

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,560
use this water.  But in

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
limited quantity.  Meaning, we

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
cannot stop the flow of water here.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
If some small dams etc. need to be built there, they can be done.

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,520
But the water flow should not stop.

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,560
Well, here the Eastern River, that is

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,879
Ravi, Beas and Sutlej,

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,200
all this water can be used by India.  He

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,520
can use it as he wishes.  So, here

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,599
you all know that the war of 1965 took place.

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,000
1971, Kargil.  Despite that, if you

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,400
observe, this treaty continued.  It was

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
not even suspended.  So probably this is one of the

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
longest treaties in the world that you can say has been in place till now.

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
But it is obvious that

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
Pakistan is not relenting.

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Continuously tries to shed blood in India through terrorism.  The

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
recent

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
Pahalgam terror attack happened.  Probably this was such an

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,319
occasion where the Indian government

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,400
wanted to take every step to teach Pakistan a lesson.

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,080
And finally, the Cabinet Committee on

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
Security decided that the

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,319
Indus Water Treaty would be suspended

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,480
and in view of this, we also wrote a letter to Pakistan.

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,599
So India declared

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,159
that no water will flow to Pakistan

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,560
until Pakistan controls terrorism and

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,400
stops terrorism.

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,800
And India's action was

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,080
probably the first formal suspension

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,200
of the treaty since its inception.

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
Well India, is India taking advantage of this water treaty which

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
we have stopped

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,519
?  Look, many

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,760
hydro power projects which were already being

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
tried to be built on Chenab river are being

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,239
fast tracked.  Be it

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,400
Pakaldul Dam, Kiru Dam, Kawar Dam

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,879
or Ratle Dam.  So in which

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,280
you will see different capacities.  So these

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,840
dams which have been built are meant

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
to utilize the water without violating the Indus

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,640
Water Treaty.  So, in the beginning we were making

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,840
it so that we could use the water without

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,159
violating the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty.

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,480
But now

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,040
India will try to see

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
how we can divert water through these dams

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
?  How can we conserve water

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
and use it within India itself?

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
So many such things are

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
actually being done by India.   So in

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,239
a way, if we

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,040
can regulate the flow of water through reservoirs.  In a way, if we

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,959

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,600
can implement run of river projects, then the availability of water

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,919
in Pakistan will decrease

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,800
and its direct impact will be seen on Pakistan

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,880
's agricultural irrigation and ultimately

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
on its GDP.  Well, what will be the

115
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
impact on Pakistan and

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
if you see, Pakistan has talked

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
about agricultural shock in its report.

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
He has said that look,

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,639
in Pakistan, the month of June

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
marks the start of Kharif crop

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
season.  You all know about Kharif crops,

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
rice, maize and cotton are grown in India also.

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
So the Indus River System

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,360
Authority of Pakistan prepared a report here

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,080
and told how this

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,600
year there has been a drop of about 13 to 21% in the river flow compared to last year.  For

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,720

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,800
example, it was told that last year in 2024,

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,280
144 i.e. 144000 cusecs of water was

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,280
released.  But here only

131
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,759
124500 cusecs of water was released on the

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,240
fifth of June.  So

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
if you look at Punjab and Sindh provinces, they

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,919
rely heavily on irrigation.  If

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,680
you see this, it has become the entire Punjab

136
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,600
province.  But below it became Sindh province

137
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
and finally, as you all know, the

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,320
Indus water

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
ultimately falls into the Arabian Sea.  So here

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
both the provinces, Punjab and Sindh, are

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,720
highly dependent on the Indus Water System.

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,360
Even if irrigation is done and there is a

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,919
shortage of water here, then

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,639
ultimately you will see its impact on the crop yield.

145
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,840
Meaning, whatever farming and

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,160
crop

147
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
production should have happened there, it may

148
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
not be possible there.  In fact, you might remember that

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,240
recently a video also came

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
from Pakistan which went viral.

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
You are seeing this in Sindh, Karachi, there

152
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,000
is an airport there and the Pakistani actress

153
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,240
Hina Khawaja Bayad

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,880
made that video at the airport itself and released it

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,680
on social media and told how there is no

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,680
water even inside the toilets at the Karachi airport.

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,160
So he

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,919
told the government of Pakistan and the establishment that

159
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
what kind of facilities are they providing now, which went

160
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,000
viral very fast, think about it,

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,720
you are not able to get water even at a place like the airport.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,479
Well

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
apart from this, if you see, news is

164
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
also coming that the Chenab river is

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
also dry in many

166
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
places, especially because India has

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880

168
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
closed the Baglihar and Salal dams.  So the tensions are

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
continuously increasing.  But

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,120
ultimately see, if agriculture is getting

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
impacted here then it will have a

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,720
big impact on the economy of Pakistan.  The Kharif crop is

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,639
very critical for the food security of Pakistan.  Not just food

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,720
security, even the little earnings that these people are

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,880
able to make through export will

177
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
not be possible here.  So

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,639
due to water shortages the entire planting

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
cycle gets disrupted.   The

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,199
contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in

181
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,120
a way, the contribution of GDP

182
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
through agriculture will decrease.

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
You all already know about the food inflation that is there

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,039
in Pakistan, I

185
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,639
mean I don't know whether it is 25% or 30%, the food

186
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,560
inflation has gone up to 40-40%.  Imagine

187
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
you will see inflation of 40-40%.  So there

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
is a danger of this inflation increasing further and

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
ultimately because of this, you may witness what is called civil war,

190
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
civil unrest, complete social unrest

191
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
because if

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
people do not get food to eat, they will

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
not be able to buy it with the money they have.

194
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,240
So it is obvious that

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
you will see all these problems.  Well

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
now what diplomatic and

197
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
legal moves are being taken by Pakistan?  If

198
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
you look at the official response of Pakistan, then

199
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,720
news is also coming out that Pakistan has

200
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
so far written four formal letters to India.

201
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,520
It is clear that Pakistan is in panic at this time.

202
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,560
He is repeatedly requesting India to

203
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,599
please release the water.  Do

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,840
not suspend the Indus Water Treaty.  So now it is

205
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,240
considering that it will go to international arbitration.

206
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Meaning, if India does not listen, and it

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,919
is obvious that India will not listen this time

208
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
no matter what happens, then this place will

209
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,120
go to the World Bank.  Now it does not seem that the

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,039
World Bank will be able to help much.   The

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
President of the World Bank himself

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,199
came and met PM Modi and said that

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
look, we just

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,039
played the role of a mediator.  What we

215
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
can do within this and as far as possible

216
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
Pakistan should go to the Permanent Court of

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
Arbitration.  So we will have to see

218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
how India takes its stand there.

219
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,959
Well, apart from this, Pakistan is also giving threats and

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
intimidation.  He is saying that

221
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,760
suspending these Indus Water Treaties means

222
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,800
violation of international law and in some way

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,680
it is an act of war.  So in a way,

224
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
this matter can escalate further

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,560
from here.  Well, how India is adopting it as a pressure tool.

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,360
India's message

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,760
is clear.  Water and blood cannot flow together.

228
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,760
India has said this before also.  I have said it this time also.

229
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,480
And somewhere,

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,800
by suspending the Indus Water Treaty, we are taking non-military

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,920
punitive measures.  That means, without

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,760
firing any missile or doing anything, we are, in

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,519
a way, teaching Pakistan a lesson.

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Apart from this, you will also see this strategic shift here.  That

235
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,320
means,

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
if you look at India's foreign policy,

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,360
somewhere or the other

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,600
we are aligning water security with national security.

239
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
So India is also building

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,160
diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,640
act against terror groups.  It is possible that under

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,640
immense pressure, the

243
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
people there will come out on the streets and

244
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,560
tell the Pakistani government, why do you

245
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
spread terrorism?  Why are all these things there

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,399
?  Well, that will have to be seen because if water is

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
not available then all these things can happen.

248
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,440
And look, news is also coming in

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,519
that India has already started the pre-feasibility study

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,519
for diverting Chenab water

251
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
here.  This

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,640
entire project has been proposed

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,880
so that 15 to 20 million feet of water from

254
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Chenab can be given to other states of India like

255
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan.

256
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,760
We will use it.  Well, its legal

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
and ethical consideration is also being done.

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
Questions are being asked whether India has

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
violated the treaty?  Look,

260
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
if you look technically,

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
we took a unilateral decision.  So technically it can be

262
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,000
said that yes India

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,839
did violet it.  But India has a proper argument.

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
India says that look, one thing is that

265
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,880
already India has a right over the rivers here like Indus,

266
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,959
Jhelum, Chenab, which are of Pakistan.

267
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,800
We can use it for limited time.

268
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
So even when we were using it limitedly,

269
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Pakistan

270
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839
kept saying something or the other again and again.  And now what has happened is that the

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
water has gone over the head.  The way

272
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
terrorism is being spread.  So you

273
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
cannot expect that you will

274
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,399
shed blood in India and we will continue to give you water.

275
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
So, don’t expect this.  So India has its

276
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
own logic and very solid

277
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,320
justification here and

278
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,640
what could be its geopolitical implication?  Look, a very

279
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,120
dangerous president may be set to

280
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
weaponize water.  Because

281
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
such things can often be done in times of conflict.

282
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
Apart from this, there

283
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
can also be international pressure here.  It is possible  Now let's

284
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,880
see how India can handle it easily.  Then

285
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
along with this, Pakistan can take help from China to

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120

287
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
put pressure on India here through Brahmaputra.  But

288
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,279
if you actually see, China will

289
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
not be able to do much.  Because the situation in Pak

290
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,680
means that most of the water in the Brahmaputra,

291
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
if you see, when the Brahmaputra

292
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,640
river enters India, it comes there.  The

293
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
most China

294
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
can do is threaten to suddenly release a lot of water.

295
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
In that case, we

296
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
may face situations like flood etc.  But

297
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
ultimately,

298
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
China actually has

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
no control over the water shortage that is being talked about.  Ok?  You also

300
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
need to understand this.  So the conclusion is

301
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,560
that India's suspension of Indus

302
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,000
Water Treaty in response to terrorism is

303
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,720
a very major shift in South Asia water

304
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,720
diplomacy and here the effort will be to

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
monitor it carefully.

306
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
What is the next step India takes?

307
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,399
What does Pakistan take?  The

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
whole world will be keeping an eye on this.

309
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
So I hope that you have

310
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,839
understood in detail the news that came yesterday

311
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,279
and before leaving, there is a very

312
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,279
interesting question, can you tell

313

which of the following correctly

314
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,680
matches a tributer with the river it joins,

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
which of these tributers that is

316
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,680
joining that river is correct, that

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
pair, you have to tell which is correct, its

318
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
