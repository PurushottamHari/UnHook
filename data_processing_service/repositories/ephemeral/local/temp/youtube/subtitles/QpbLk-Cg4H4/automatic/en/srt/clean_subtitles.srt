So, you know this is our 100th episode. Yes, Ansh told me.  Good.  Are you happy with my work?  Yes, yes.  Yes.  Sure? Because in the middle you were very doubtful. I remain doubtful about everything.  It happens in everything.  So, at what point are you sure?  At what point were you sure?  Tell me about my work. No, I see the results after that.  Good.  So what do you think about the result ?  From your end? Then such people tell me that you are Prakhar's father, I feel very good. Well, now just like you are making all the wedding bookings etc., people recognize you there also.  Yes, I recognise it. So you find them because you keep asking me whether I found anyone today?  Did you meet anyone today?  Yes, you get them.  Then why do you ask?  No, I am asking, right now I don’t get as much as I should. Finish. Stop the podcast.  Come on brother, finish it.  Did you ever feel afraid in your childhood that you would slip out of your hands?  No, never on the hands or legs, but never on the body, meaning it feels like you are understanding something, friend dad, it must happen like this.  Yes, no, when the child is 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 years old it feels like that and even when he went to America I was like that.  But now it's alright, that ends well.  Good.  Ok.  So, it felt that way at that time for some reason or just generally because there is no distance , because America is a very free society.  Now you are too free in your thoughts, so ignore that. So do you still watch all my episodes or not?  I watch it most of the time. Good.  And you must have come to that segment where I praise you.  No, I have n't seen anyone like this for a long time.  Well, yes, maybe we have seen such segments for a long time but whenever you have seen them, how do you feel?  Doesn't that sound okay? Tell me openly friend, what happens if you don't feel okay ?  No, every child praises his father or every child praises his father, do you shame on him?  Yes, he is doing it. So I do it.  No, but still because I mean, to a large extent, this is a bit of a similar thing, I don't know how you will take it.  To a large extent, I do my work so that you feel proud.  In general, I give him such an orientation because I know, you see, I know, you might like it, you have been thinking from the beginning that Prakhar should name him, so then I give him a level of orientation that he likes, according to you, what do I do best, what do I do best in my work, yes, what am I good at, you are good at everything, this Holi or podcast or half an hour will only last, you accept it, what better can I do? First of all, you do not talk to your guest while maintaining eye contact. Ok, good.  Whereas one should always talk while looking into the eyes.  Ok. And I don't like the abuses etc. that happen in some podcasts. Ok.  Ok. Well it isn't taken anymore.  Yes.  It does n't happen now.  Yes.  It doesn't happen now.  We only refuse guests.  Papa watches our podcast so don't give it to me.  Yes.  Ok.  Then everything else is fine.  Good.  Yes.  So, how many years ago was that incident at that time?  85 87? Started practice in 84?  From here. In this very office 84 Yes, practically in this very office. 84 and me in 2024.  So, exactly 40 years later, right? And you had a scooter then? Describe means we used to say financial. Yes, yes, there was a scooter.  Yes.  Yes. Bought a car in 86.  Good.  Which car was that? That was 800?  No Premier Padmini.  You will install it once, you will be impressed by how the Premier Padmani looks, you will drink water from it, right? Yes, it was like this, the second one, this second one, the blue one, yes, yes, I bought it for ₹00, yes and then initially I did not have money, so I picked it up and kept it in Mathura, I could not drive it because yes because people would ask where the car was parked, so that is why I got it parked at my uncle's house in Mathura, as if no one would ask, what will happen if they ask?  I don't know, just in the beginning there was a little more consciousness.  Okay, so he was made to stand there and then how did he go to the clients or how did he do it ?  Used to go by scooter.  Well, I would have gone by scooter.  And what year did you first start seeing success papa?  When did your life start changing?  Because you see, I remember in the first year, we had 8485, we got aggregate receipt of the year, about 6070 at that time, it used to be reasonably well because whatever we used to get in the job, a chartered accountant, a fresh chartered accountant used to get only ₹34000 per month. So by that standard is good and I remember in 1989, first four months from April to July, I mean our receipts were aggregated to ₹ 1 lakh of we were very happy, we, me and Rajji Tau ji, we are very happy, we have, we have stuck well, and but I find each and every person very lovely, I like it from the heart, so things keep getting added on and then technically also we kept ourselves up to date , kept ourselves sound.  Whoever we could help, wherever we could, we would help them. And God has been very kind.  Blessings of parents.  This matters a lot in life. To my mind.  I have never seen a man more hardworking than you.  And people in your office also kept telling me this. Like Rishabh Bhaiya or those people who said this is unique about your father.  And then for me it becomes a matter of family.  But even today you wake up at 5:00 am.  Yes, I wake up before 5 even today and by 10:00 pm at night you are not even in a condition to talk, you pass out, I mean, Papa and I sitting together literally just say, you are fine, you are fine, while doing that, Papa starts snoring, he does not even know that it is okay because he gets tired and my mother told me sir, you told me, Mummy told me that when you had started doing legal practice in the beginning, you used to take the entire file and read it, you used to memorize it, I do not read it now, you used to memorize your entire argument which you will give tomorrow, yes yes because because I have studied in Hindi medium school and arguments have to be made in English.  So I did not have enough confidence that whether I would be able to speak.  So I used to write it down and memorize it roughly and when I used to argue and that too, by heart used to, even now it so happens even now before some strange benches, stranger benches across the country, when I go to new judges, I do not know them, that is why sometimes I feel at the age of 62 also my heart throbs on us, it must be fun otherwise what will be the fun left, there is no fun in the work, the fun begins if we win, after that. And there is stress due to stress. Yes.  But you don't mind.   If you mind it then there is no option.  Either you are or you are not, either you are in profession or you are not.  Because without stress you cannot achieve this rate of success.  This is my belief.  Although there may be divergent views on it.  But I enjoy that stress after success.  After the success [MUSIC].  What is that one thing you have learnt from your grandfather which has helped you throughout your life? That one should not break anyone's trust.  Dada ji always says that if someone has trusted you then you must ensure that the trust remains intact. Never ever backstep anybody. This teaching and commitment from grandfather that whatever you say to someone, fulfill those words, fulfill the promise no matter what the cost is. What is that thing that you learnt from me and Amma which helped you throughout your life? I learnt from Amma to love everyone with all my heart. And don't think that I will get any benefit from this, I won't. I learnt this from my mother. What do you think?  What did you do well in parenting me? I have taught you good things since childhood. Stories have been taught.  And whether it is from Mahabharata or from Panchatantra.  Yes. And whatever time I could have spent with you, I am sad that I did not spend with Radhika.  Do you like Radhika more than pyaari ?  No, that's fine. Both of them are lovely.  Radhika is really lovely. Yes.  And but one thing is because by the time you were growing up I probably did not have that much work engagement. After Radhika was born, my workload increased and I was not able to give her that much time.  So let's go now, I mean we can't go back, no yes yes yes but I would agree because I think whatever I am able to talk about, to a large extent its corpus was that every night before going to sleep, you used to tell me a story and make me pray and I used to make you pray, that prayer had a lot of impact, do you remember the prayer?  I neither remembered it then nor do I remember it today.  My father must have made me do that prayer every day for at least three-four years. I never remembered it. Because they pray so forcefully, let me sleep, just let me sleep brother.  Yes, but prayers were held every night.  Shamak remembers Shamak saying that I will be a good boy. I will not fight with anyone.  I will not fight with anyone.  All things are true.  I will love my younger sister Radhika very much. That is true.  That is true.  Yes. And then you should tell me that I should obey everyone, I should obey the elders.  Apart from all these things, I also used to say that when I grow up, I will become the Chief Justice of India.  He used to say this also. That is deserted.  That dream is gone. Baba, I cannot become a good judge.  My mouth is wide open. What do you think mommy did? Good parenting with us.  The affection that mom has for you guys or for the entire family is very pure. I can't describe the intensity of that and me. He maintained his career for the sake of his family and his children for so many years that his children would grow up. First of all, I have children whom I have to raise.  She did not even come to the office.   She did n’t even practice.  When we grew up, she thought, let me do something now.  So his sacrifice is for the family, not only to her children but to my family, my extended family, I am us, and selflessly, he has no selfish motive of any kind.  There is no meaning in being with your children.  She does everything for her Even Family and extended family with the same dedication as she does for all of us.  Be it my sisters or anyone else.  We are my cousin brothers and their families.   Do you think I'll go away again ?  Yes, do you know the fear?  Are you scared of this?  No, I am not scared. I know.  Well, you know I will go. Why?  Why do you know?  You are also getting married to your Clau, who is Mexican. Yes.  And I know that you are with me for the seven days I am with you.  Otherwise, Mom and I will be alone.  Good.  I will leave you alone and go away. Kshama will see it from behind.  Yes, he will handle it.  No, where will I go?  I will go at least a little bit. No, go and fly as much as you can, what's the big deal in it, now if you want to progress, do it, to move ahead you have to leave the previous steps, this was taught to me, if you have to climb the next step, the upper step, then you will have to leave the lower one, I remember, earlier I used to go to Commissioner Appeal, there was problem in going to tribunal because there used to be one or two cases there, then our KC Singhal saheb said that Rakesh, if you want to climb the upper step, then you will have to leave the lower one. Then you will have to give up attachment.  In this way, it applies to every aspect of life. go ahead.  Yes, I also feel that whatever my mission is, it will take me somewhere. Now that thing happens. See, always progress and do no harm to others.  Do as much as you can. In what gives you happiness, in what feels good. But no one else should suffer any loss or trouble.  Uncle ji taught me. Yes. I have learnt many things in life from Tauji. So one of the lessons from that was that when you start saying more in fewer words, then that is it.  Now, I used to follow him a lot. Arun Jaitley sir used to say.  We used to say it so to the point and it was so relevant.  He used to say Revent only.   He did not say anything irrelevant and was concise. So Tau ji always says that you should bring something in nuclear form. How much power does a nuclear bomb have? You make the nuclear weapon and then blast it. We will articulate things as Shak said, now we will articulate things in fewer words and add weight to it.  Uncle ji says one more thing.  There should be weight in our words, not in our voice; we are right, the thing is right, the rest are peripheral things, the substance is the matter; I learnt a lot in life from Tau ji and what did I learn from Tau ji, one thing I learnt is that before doing anything, write it down; brain is very precious; what are the things to be done to remember this ?  what to do?  Don't misutilize it to remember those to-do things. Ok?  Is it okay? He is very creative.  Keep him thinking about other things. Put it to planning.  Put it for execution.  But to think about this, first write down the tasks that need to be done. [Music] Secondly, whatever the parents said, I learnt it from my uncle.  I also did n't listen to my mom and dad that much.  So one day my uncle said, friend, you talk about them, parents are a very weak link. So if you have the strength, then fight the world.  These are very tender heart persons.  So from that day onwards I never avoided what mom and dad said, I learnt a lot from my uncle and I also learnt think big, what do we think big in small things, if you think big then you will do big, I think this is yes and always stay positive, it is a good thing, which helps, keep doing it, keep doing it, it will come back to you on its own, you should believe that you are selfish that whatever you are doing good will ultimately come back, but even if it does n't come back, keep doing it, we are fine, wherever I have reached now, I have reached because of your blessings, this house has been made by Amma, this is Amma's house, nothing else can happen here, Papa, there will only be progress here and wherever I go, I will carry this, yes always bless us, not only them, no, everyone is blessed, we have blessings, Bhaiya and I don't have anything apart from this, get that laddu, parents, elders have this, son and I have seen that this is the only thing we have in life Difference differentiates, it brings a difference in life, which means whoever takes the blessings of elders, parents, see, everyone has bad things but take the good things.  Hmm. Take any good thing from anyone. What is the laddu for?  Just completed 100 episodes.   We will make it sweet, please calm it down.  Give it to brother Shamak first.  Yes shmak shmak.  Come come inside come in the frame. So far there have only been 100.  Yes.  Good.   I have made good progress, just not 100%.  No, I thought it was too much. No no, you also take it.   Are we making good progress as per 100 or not, we are fine, come on bro, I may not be, I am a little too idealistic but whatever I am, whatever I am, whatever I will be, I will be because my father, mother, my sister, my grandparents, the rest of my family, my brother, my uncle, my aunt, these people are with me. His blessings are with me.  And frankly this feeling alone has given me so much pain through what has been a very hard journey.  I remember when I left America and came here, I used to be so stressed about how this would happen? How will we do it?  Right?  And now we are 100 episodes deep since I got back.  100 episodes.  I don't have any memory of when those 100 episodes were completed.  And in that we have done what is the number Govind? 900 and 4 million views on YouTube alone. In a 100 episodes, we've done about 10 crore plus views on long form content alone. Over the last 100 episodes.  We've done about 80 crore 80 crore views on shots sorry 80 crore views on shots over the last 100 episodes and it has been a fantastic journey bringing you on to some of the best conversations I've had over the last one year you've seen us cry on this podcast.  You've seen us laughing on this podcast.  I've probably seen a lot more laughing and crying on this podcast. And I want your life to be as full of laughter as there is laughter on this podcast. And look at the little tears, it's a part of it.  Right?  Over the last 100 episodes we've tried to take four broad themes we wanted to play with.  We Took Family.  We insisted upon family?  I would ask that question over and over.  So House Your Relationship With Your Parents Growing Up?  In that, in the beginning you put a dedication for your father?  How was your relationship with him?  Sir, how has been your relationship with your mother?  We take your relationship with God.  And what is your relationship with God?  Are you a God fearing We ask questions about your vulnerability Your fears.  What is your life's biggest fear brother?  Okay, tell me one thing, what is the biggest fear in your life ?  And we ask questions about friendship.  How were your friends etc., Sir? I tried to do over the first 100 episodes over the first 900 million how much is in crore?  90 crores.  Almost 100 crore views.  100 crore views.  I try to ground myself.  In a very stressful position that I was in on two things that last for ever. Your family, the memories of them, the lessons you learn from them, your friends, your God and your fears.  And now now that 100 episodes are over, what was once Prakhar's discourse is now PGX.  Now there is going to be a new story.  And I am going to tell you a new story.  And if you stay here, if you subscribe, if you watch my content again, you are going to come across a very new story that I am very excited to tell you.  This is episode 100 of The Prakhar Gupta Experience. You are probably close to the 100 crore viewers that we have on this channel.  This has been an absolute dream to live through.  To build for.  This has been bigger, more beautiful, more meaningful than I thought it would be This has given me some incredible friends, some incredible mentees that I get to mentor, some very young blood that I like to shape, some very cool things to talk to my father about Now you have given my father's pride when you walk up to him and tell him that I watch your son's content He loves it.  You have made me smile.  Thank you so much.  This is a dream and I am going to make this dream bigger and larger for us.  On to the dirt.  See you.
