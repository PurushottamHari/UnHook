1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
So, you know this is our 100th episode.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,919
Yes, Ansh told me.  Good.  Are you

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,800
happy with my work?  Yes, yes.  Yes.  Sure?

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,960
Because in the middle you were very doubtful.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,840
I remain doubtful about everything.  It

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
happens in everything.  So, at

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
what point are you sure?  At what point were

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
you sure?  Tell me about my work.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,480
No, I see the results

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
after that.  Good.  So what do you think about the result

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,320
?  From your end?

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
Then such people tell me that you are Prakhar's

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
father, I feel very good.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,120
Well, now just like you are

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,280
making all the wedding bookings etc.,

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
people recognize you there also.  Yes, I recognise it.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
So you find them because you

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,079
keep asking me whether I found anyone today?  Did you

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
meet anyone today?  Yes, you get them.  Then

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
why do you ask?  No, I am asking,

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,600
right now I don’t get as much as I should.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,399
Finish. Stop the podcast.  Come on brother,

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,360
finish it.  Did you ever feel afraid in your childhood that

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
you would slip out of your hands?  No, never on the hands or

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
legs,

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,880
but never on the body, meaning it feels like

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,439
you are understanding something, friend

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,159
dad, it must happen like this.  Yes, no,

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,400
when the child is 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,080
years old it feels like that and even when he went to America

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,280
I was like that.  But now it's alright, that

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,280
ends well.  Good.  Ok.  So, it felt that way at that time for

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,080
some reason or just generally

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,799
because there is no distance

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,200
, because America is a very free

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
society.  Now you are too free in your thoughts, so

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
ignore that.

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
So do you still watch all my episodes

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,479
or not?  I watch it most of the time.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Good.  And you must have

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,640
come to that segment where I

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
praise you.  No, I have

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,439
n't seen anyone like this for a long time.  Well,

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
yes, maybe we have seen such segments for a long time

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,560
but whenever you have seen them,

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,399
how do you feel?  Doesn't that sound okay?

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
Tell me openly friend, what happens if you don't feel okay

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
?  No, every child praises his father

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,640
or every child praises his father, do

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,159
you shame on him?  Yes, he is doing it.

51
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,239
So I do it.  No, but still because

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,160
I mean, to a large extent, this is a bit of a similar

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
thing, I don't know how you will take it.  To a large

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
extent, I do my work so that you feel

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
proud.  In general, I

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
give him such an orientation because I know, you

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
see, I know, you might like it,

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,040
you have been thinking from the beginning that

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Prakhar should name him, so then I give him a level of

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,080
orientation that he likes,

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,080

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
according to you, what do I do best,

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
what do I do best in my work, yes, what am I

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,959
good at,

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,599
you are good at everything, this Holi or

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,040
podcast or half an hour will only last, you accept it,

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,920
what better can I do?

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,480
First of all, you do not talk to your guest while maintaining eye contact.

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,640
Ok, good.  Whereas one

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,280
should always talk while looking into the eyes.  Ok.

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,599
 

72
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,440
And I don't like the abuses etc. that happen in some podcasts.

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,120
Ok.  Ok.

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,720
Well it isn't taken anymore.  Yes.  It does

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
n't happen now.  Yes.  It doesn't happen now.  We

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
only refuse guests.  Papa watches our

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,840
podcast so don't give it to me.  Yes.  Ok.  Then

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:14,640
everything else is fine.  Good.  Yes.  So,

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,040
how many years ago was that incident at that time?  85 87?

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,519
Started practice in 84?  From here.

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,239
In this very office 84 Yes, practically in this very office.

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,319
84 and me in 2024.  So,

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:30,000
exactly 40 years later, right?

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,920
And you had a scooter then?

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
Describe means we used to say financial.

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Yes, yes, there was a scooter.  Yes.  Yes.

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,680
Bought a car in 86.  Good.  Which car was that?

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,159
That was 800?  No Premier Padmini.  You will

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,200
install it once, you will be impressed by how the Premier Padmani looks, you will

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:51,599
drink water from it, right? Yes, it was like this, the second one, this

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,000
second one, the

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:01,040
blue one, yes, yes, I

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,120
bought it for ₹00, yes and then initially I did

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,360
not have money, so I picked it up and kept it in Mathura, I

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
could not drive it because yes

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,000
because people would ask where the car was parked, so that is why I got it

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,920
parked at my uncle's house

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
in Mathura, as if no one would ask,

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,639
what will happen if they ask?  I don't know, just in the beginning there was

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,479
a little more consciousness.  Okay,

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
so he was made to stand there and then

102
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
how did he go to the clients or how did he do it

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,520
?  Used to go by scooter.  Well, I would have

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,160
gone by scooter.  And what year did you first

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,720
start seeing success papa?  When did your

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,639
life start changing?  Because you see,

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,080
 

108
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:40,840
I remember in the first year, we had

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,720
8485, we got aggregate receipt of the

110
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,280
year, about 6070 at that time, it used to be

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,520
reasonably well because whatever we used to get in the job,

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,320
a chartered accountant, a fresh

113
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,800
chartered accountant used to get only ₹34000 per month.

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,759
So by that standard is

115
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,680
good and I remember in 1989, first four

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,880
months from April to July, I

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,479
mean our receipts were aggregated to ₹ 1 lakh

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,280
of we were very happy, we, me and Rajji Tau

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,560
ji, we are very

120
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,160
happy, we have, we have stuck well, and

121
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,600
but

122
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,919
I find each and every person very lovely, I like it

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
from the heart, so

124
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,039
things keep getting added on and then

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,759
technically also we kept ourselves up to date

126
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,240
, kept ourselves sound.  Whoever we could help, wherever we could, we would help them.

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
And God has been very kind.  Blessings

129
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,120
of parents.  This matters a lot in life.

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,000
To my mind.  I have

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,440
never seen a man more hardworking than you.  And

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
people in your office also kept telling me this.

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
Like Rishabh Bhaiya or those people who said this is

134
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,759
unique about your father.  And then for me it

135
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,560
becomes a matter of family.  But even today you

136
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,039
wake up at 5:00 am.  Yes, I wake up before 5

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
even today and by 10:00 pm at night

138
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
you are not even in a condition to talk, you pass

139
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
out, I mean, Papa and

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
I sitting together literally just say, you are

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
fine, you are fine, while doing that, Papa

142
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
starts snoring, he does not even know that it is

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
okay because he gets tired and my

144
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,440
mother told me sir, you told me, Mummy

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
told me that when you had

146
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,280
started doing legal practice in the beginning, you used to take the entire file and

147
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,280
read it, you used to memorize it, I do

148
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,319
not read it now, you used to memorize your entire argument

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,720
which you will give tomorrow, yes yes because because I have

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
studied in Hindi medium

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,400
school and arguments have to be made in

152
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,160
English.  So I did not have enough

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,240
confidence that whether I would be able to

154
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,360
speak.  So I used to write it down and memorize it roughly and

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
when I used to argue and that too, by

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,840
heart used to, even now it so happens even now

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,960
before some strange benches, stranger benches

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,960
across the country, when I go to

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,319
new judges, I do not know them, that

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,120
is why sometimes I feel at the age of 62 also

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
my heart throbs on us, it must be fun

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
otherwise what will be the fun left, there is no

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,520
fun in the work, the fun begins if we win, after that.

164
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,520

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,639
And there is stress due to stress.

166
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
Yes.  But you don't mind.   If

167
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,960
you mind it then there is no option.  Either

168
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,880
you are or you are not, either you are

169
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,680
in profession or you are not.  Because without stress you

170
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,000
cannot achieve this rate of success.  This

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,639
is my belief.  Although there may be divergent

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,280
views on it.  But I

173
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
enjoy that stress after success.  After the success

174
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,599
[MUSIC].  What is that one

175
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,720
thing you have learnt from your grandfather

176
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,800
which has helped you throughout your life?

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,400
That one should not break anyone's trust.  Dada ji

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,360
always says that if someone has trusted

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,759
you then you must ensure that the

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,440
trust remains intact.

181
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:08,879
Never ever backstep

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:12,160
anybody. This teaching and commitment from grandfather

183
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,960
that whatever you say to someone, fulfill those words,

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,039
fulfill the promise no matter what the

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,960
cost is. What is that thing that you learnt from me and Amma

186
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,440
which helped you throughout your life?

187
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,080
I learnt from Amma to love everyone with all my heart.

188
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,039
And don't think that I will get any

189
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,839
benefit from this, I won't.

190
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,880
I learnt this from my mother.

191
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,839
What do you think?  What did you do well in

192
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,560
parenting me?

193
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,000
I have taught you good things since childhood.

194
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,480
Stories have been taught.  And whether

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,920
it is from Mahabharata or

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,920
from Panchatantra.  Yes.

197
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,600
And whatever time I could have spent with you,

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,360
I am sad that I did

199
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
not spend with Radhika.  Do you like Radhika more than pyaari

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
?  No, that's fine.

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,600
Both of them are lovely.  Radhika is really lovely.

202
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes.  And but one thing is because by the time

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,279
you were growing up I probably did

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,080
not have that much work engagement.

205
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:17,040
After Radhika was born, my workload increased and I was

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,320
not able to give her that much time.  So let's go now, I mean

207
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,000
we can't go back, no yes yes yes

208
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,080
but I would agree because I think

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
whatever I am able to talk about, to a

210
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
large extent its corpus was that every night

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
before going to sleep, you used to tell me a story

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
and make me pray and I used to make you pray,

213
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,240
that prayer had a lot of impact, do you

214
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,920
remember the prayer?  I neither remembered it then nor do I

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,680
remember it today.  My

216
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
father must have made me do that prayer every day for at least three-four years.

217
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,959
I never remembered it.

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,160
Because they pray so forcefully, let me

219
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,320
sleep, just let me sleep brother.  Yes, but

220
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
prayers were held every night.  Shamak remembers Shamak

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
saying that I will be a good boy.

222
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,920
I will not fight with anyone.  I will

223
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,920
not fight with anyone.  All things are

224
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,920
true.  I will love my younger sister Radhika very much.

225
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,560
That is true.  That is true.  Yes.

226
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,480
And then you should tell me that I should obey everyone, I should

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,560
obey the elders.  Apart from all these things,

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
I also used to say that when I grow up, I will

229
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,760
become the Chief Justice of India.  He used to say this also.

230
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,440
That is deserted.  That dream is gone.

231
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Baba, I cannot become a good judge.  My

232
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
mouth is wide open.

233
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
What do you think mommy did?

234
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,399
Good parenting with us.  The

235
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,880
affection that mom has for you guys or

236
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,200
for the entire family is very pure.

237
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't describe the intensity of that and me.

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,800
He maintained

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,120
his career for the sake of his family and his children for so many years that

240
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,880
his children would grow up.

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,240
First of all, I have children whom I have to

242
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,320
raise.  She did not even come to the office.   She did

243
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,720
n’t even practice.  When we

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,279
grew up, she thought, let me

245
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,399
do something now.  So his sacrifice is

246
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,200
for the family, not only to her children but

247
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,360
to my family, my extended family, I am

248
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,120
us,

249
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
and

250
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,120
selflessly, he has no selfish motive of any kind.  There

251
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,640

252
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
is no meaning in being with your children.  She does everything for her Even Family and

253
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,600
extended family with the same

254
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,760
dedication as she does for all of us.  Be

255
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
it my sisters or

256
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,760
anyone else.  We are my cousin brothers and their

257
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
families.   Do

258
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,320
you think I'll go away again

259
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,839
?  Yes, do you know the fear?  Are

260
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
you scared of this?  No, I am not scared.

261
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
I know.  Well, you know I will go.

262
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,040
Why?  Why do you know?  You are

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
also

264
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,920
getting married to your Clau, who is Mexican.

265
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.  And I know that you are

266
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
with me for the seven days I am with you.  Otherwise,

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,720
Mom and I will be alone.  Good.  I will leave you alone and go away.

268
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,839
Kshama will see it

269
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,040
from behind.  Yes, he will handle it.  No, where will

270
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,079
I go?  I will go at least a little bit.

271
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,760
No, go and fly as much as you can, what's the big

272
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,800
deal in it, now if you want to

273
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,279
progress, do it, to move ahead you have to leave the previous steps,

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,040
this was taught to me, if you have to climb the next step, the upper step, then you will have to

275
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,079
leave the lower one, I

276
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,639
remember, earlier I used to go to

277
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,200
Commissioner Appeal, there was

278
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,079
problem in going to tribunal because there used to be one or two cases there,

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,800
then our KC Singhal saheb

280
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,480
said that Rakesh, if you want to climb the upper step, then you will

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,519
have to leave the lower one.

282
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,040
Then you will have to give up attachment.  In this way, it

283
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,240
applies to every aspect of life.

284
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,680
go ahead.  Yes, I also feel that

285
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,639
whatever my mission is, it will take me somewhere.

286
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:48,639
Now that thing happens.

287
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:52,560
See, always progress and do

288
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,480
no harm to others.  Do as much as you can.

289
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,639
In what gives you happiness, in what feels good.

290
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,880
But no one else should suffer any loss or

291
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
trouble.  Uncle ji taught me.

292
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
Yes.

293
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,240
I have learnt many things in life from Tauji.

294
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,079
So one of the lessons from that was

295
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,240
that when you start saying more in fewer words,

296
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,760
 

297
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,800
then that is it.  Now, I used to follow him a lot.

298
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,639
Arun Jaitley sir used to say.  We used to

299
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,240
say it so to the point and it was so

300
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,040
relevant.  He used to say Revent only.   He did

301
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,040
not say anything irrelevant and was concise.

302
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,639
So Tau ji always says that you should

303
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
bring something in nuclear form.

304
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,680
How much power does a nuclear bomb have?

305
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,560
You make the nuclear weapon and then blast it.

306
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,560
We will

307
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,200
articulate things as Shak said, now

308
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,720
we will articulate things in fewer words

309
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,560
and add weight to it.  Uncle ji

310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
says one more thing.  There should be

311
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,680
weight in our words, not in our voice; we are

312
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,839
right, the thing is right, the

313
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,199
rest are peripheral things, the substance is the matter; I

314
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,639

315
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:16,079
learnt a lot in life from Tau ji and what did I learn

316
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:20,360
from Tau ji, one thing I learnt is that

317
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,160
before doing anything, write it down; brain is very

318
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,800
precious; what are the things to be done to remember this

319
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,079
?  what to do?  Don't misutilize

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,480
it to remember those to-do things.

321
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,440
Ok?  Is it okay?

322
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,600
He is very creative.  Keep him thinking about other things.

323
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,279

324
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,519
 

325
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,519
Put it to planning.  Put it for execution.  But to

326
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,160
think about this, first write down the tasks that need to be done.

327
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,220
 

328
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,220
[Music]

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,800
Secondly, whatever the parents said,

330
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,279
I learnt it from my uncle.  I also did

331
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,959
n't listen to my mom and dad that much.  So one day my uncle

332
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
said, friend, you

333
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,399
talk about them, parents are a very weak link.

334
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,519
So if you have the strength, then

335
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,399
fight the world.  These are very

336
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,920
tender heart persons.  So from that day

337
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:20,240
onwards I never avoided what mom and dad said, I

338
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,880

339
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,440
learnt a lot from my uncle and I also learnt think

340
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,160
big, what do we think

341
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,760
big in small things, if you

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,440
think big then you will do big, I

343
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,199
think this is yes and always stay positive, it is a

344
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
good thing, which helps, keep doing it, keep doing it, it will come

345
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,360

346
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,839
back to you on its own, you should believe that you are

347
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,959
selfish that whatever you are

348
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,079
doing good will ultimately come back, but even if it does

349
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:54,320
n't come back, keep doing it, we are fine,

350
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,680
wherever I have reached now, I have

351
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,680
reached because of your blessings, this

352
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,759
house has been made by Amma, this is Amma's house, nothing

353
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,120
else can happen here,

354
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,880
Papa, there will only be progress here and wherever I

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,720
 

356
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,639
go, I will carry this, yes

357
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,399
always bless us, not only them, no,

358
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,720
everyone is blessed, we have blessings, Bhaiya

359
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,720
and I don't have anything apart from this, get that

360
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
laddu, parents,

361
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,079
elders have this, son and

362
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,279
I have seen that this is the only thing we have in life

363
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,920
Difference differentiates, it brings a difference

364
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,480

365
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:38,720
in life, which means whoever takes the blessings of elders,

366
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,360
parents, see, everyone has bad things

367
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,399
but take the good things.  Hmm.

368
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,399
Take any good thing from anyone.

369
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,800
What is the laddu for?  Just completed 100 episodes.   We

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,120
will make it sweet, please calm it down.  Give it to brother Shamak

371
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,680
first.  Yes shmak shmak.  Come come inside come

372
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,079
in the frame.

373
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,519
So far there have only been 100.  Yes.  Good.   I have

374
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,880
made good progress, just

375
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,600
not 100%.  No, I thought it was too much.

376
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,839
No

377
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,160
no, you also take it.   Are

378
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,520
we making good progress as per 100 or

379
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
not, we are fine,

380
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,600
come on bro, I may

381
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,280
not be, I am a little

382
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,880
too

383
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,080
idealistic but whatever I am, whatever I am, whatever I will be, I will

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,799

385
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,679
be because my father, mother, my sister, my

386
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,240
grandparents, the rest of my family, my brother,

387
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,720
my uncle, my aunt, these people are with me.

388
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,200
His blessings are with me.  And

389
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,000
frankly this feeling alone has given

390
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,000
me so much pain through what has been a

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,360
very hard journey.  I remember when

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,840
I left America and came here, I used to be

393
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,160
so stressed about how this would happen?

394
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,400
How will we do it?  Right?  And now we are

395
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
100 episodes deep since I got back.  100

396
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,039
episodes.  I don't have any memory of

397
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,000
when those 100 episodes were completed.  And in

398
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:16,960
that we have done what is the number Govind?

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,160
900 and 4 million views on YouTube alone.

400
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:24,240
In a 100 episodes, we've done about 10 crore

401
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:28,360
plus views on long form content alone.

402
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:33,520
Over the last 100 episodes.  We've

403
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:37,039
done about 80 crore 80 crore views on shots

404
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,799
sorry 80 crore views on shots over the last

405
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,559
100 episodes and it has been a fantastic

406
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,799
journey bringing you on to some of the best

407
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,120
conversations I've had over the last one

408
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,360
year you've seen us cry on this

409
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,960
podcast.  You've seen us laughing

410
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
on this podcast.  I've probably

411
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,000
seen a lot more laughing and crying on this podcast.

412
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,400
And I want your life to

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,360
be as full of laughter as there is laughter on this podcast.

414
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,600
And look at the little tears, it's a

415
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,480
part of it.  Right?  Over the last 100

416
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,320
episodes we've tried to take four broad

417
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,320
themes we wanted to play with.  We Took

418
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,240
Family.  We insisted upon family?  I would ask that

419
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,520
question over and over.  So House

420
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
Your Relationship With Your Parents Growing

421
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
Up?  In that, in the beginning you put a

422
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,640
dedication for your father?  How was your

423
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
relationship with him?  Sir,

424
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
how has been your relationship with your mother?  We

425
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,760
take your relationship with God.  And what is

426
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
your relationship with God?  Are you a God

427
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,880
fearing We ask questions about your

428
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
vulnerability Your fears.  What is your

429
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
life's biggest fear brother?  Okay,

430
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,039
tell me one thing, what is the biggest fear in your life

431
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
?  And we ask questions about

432
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,520
friendship.  How were your friends etc., Sir?

433
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,480
I tried to do over the first 100

434
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,480
episodes over the first 900 million

435
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,679
how much is in crore?  90 crores.  Almost 100

436
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,559
crore views.  100 crore views.  I try to

437
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,679
ground myself.  In a very stressful

438
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,039
position that I was in on two things that

439
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,600
last for ever.

440
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,440
Your family, the memories of them, the lessons you

441
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,000
learn from them, your friends, your God

442
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
and your

443
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,400
fears.  And now now that 100 episodes are

444
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,880
over, what was once Prakhar's discourse is

445
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,240
now

446
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,240
PGX.  Now there is going to be a new

447
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,039
story.  And I am going to tell you a new

448
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
story.  And if you stay here, if you

449
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,880
subscribe, if you watch my content again,

450
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,760
you are going to come across a very new story

451
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,840
that I am very excited to tell

452
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,480
you.  This is episode 100 of The Prakhar Gupta

453
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,960
Experience.

454
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,520
You are probably close to the 100 crore

455
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,600
viewers that we have on this channel.  This has been an

456
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,880
absolute dream to live through.  To

457
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:46,720
build for.  This has been bigger,

458
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,720
more beautiful, more

459
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,840
meaningful than I thought it would be This has

460
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,880
given me some incredible friends, some

461
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,640
incredible mentees that I get to mentor, some very

462
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,320
young blood that I like to shape, some very

463
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,960
cool things to talk to my father about Now you have

464
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,200
given my father's pride when you

465
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,840
walk up to him and tell him that I

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,240
watch your son's content He loves it.  You

467
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,320
have made me smile.  Thank you so much.  This is

468
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,840
a dream and I am going to make this dream

469
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,000
bigger and larger for us.  On to the dirt.  See

470
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
you.
