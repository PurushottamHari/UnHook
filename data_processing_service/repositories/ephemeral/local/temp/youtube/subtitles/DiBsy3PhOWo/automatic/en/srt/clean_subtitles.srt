Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then what is the use of reading them again and again? I would like to thank Study IQ.  I Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study IQ supported me till Mains. Even after that he did not leave me. And I have taken this mock I study IQ. And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, I was looking everywhere including on social media.  In fact, many of you were repeatedly demanding in the comment section of my videos that a video should be made on whether a massive oil discovery is going to happen in the Andaman Sea, which is India's Andaman Sea. Look, what is the reason behind this, a statement came from our Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. He gave an interview to a media The New Indian and in that he said that India is on the brink of Guyana sized oil discovery in Andaman Sea.  Keep in mind that there is a small country in South America called Guyana where oil was recently discovered and they benefited a lot from it.  This means that due to such a huge oil reserve in a small country, their GDP started growing by 40, 50, 60-60%. So much revenue was being generated. So let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is this matter?  Meaning, are we going to make a huge oil discovery in the Andaman Sea? What is the current progress right now ?  I will tell you all that in detail. Let's move on.  But before that let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026 or are preparing for the long term, both the batches for 2027 are available on Study IQ. Their links are given in the comment section. You have to use this code at the time of live checkout so that you can avail the maximum discount. Let's get started.  As I was telling you, an exclusive interview was given by Hardeep Singh Puri ji.  He spoke to The New Indian about India's vision of energy independence and said that India may be on the verge of discovering a game changing oil reserve in the Andaman Sea and compared it with the South American country Guyana where a major oil discovery was made in 2015. Yes it takes time when you discover the oil but actually when the oil is extracted it takes a very long time.  So recently, Guyana has been getting a lot of benefits here over the last four years.  Well, here's what he exactly said ?  You can see.  He says when I made this statement about Krishna Godavari basin at that point in time that was one place.  I had once given a statement here regarding the KG Basin.  So a lot of gas is coming out from there.  But I had spoken about one place.  But right now we're seeing a lot of green shoots here all across the country. Meaning, oil can be discovered at many places.  And it 's just a matter of time before we find a big guyana in the Andaman Sea.  So that is ongoing, he says.  And see, this bold prediction can benefit India a lot somewhere.  If actually we make such a big discovery of oil. Well, here we need to understand a little background that we are talking about the Andaman Sea.  After all why only Andaman Sea?  First of all, understand a little from the map, what does it mean when we say Andaman Sea?  As you can see, here is the Eastern coastal region of India, here is the Bay of Bengal and here you can see the Andaman and Nicobar islands. So when we say Andaman Sea, it means this entire area on the eastern side of the islands which borders with the South East Asian countries. So this entire area is called Andaman Sea. So basically what it is is that the basin of Andaman and Nicobar is one of India's least explored off shore frontiers.  Meaning, India has tried and attempted at many places.  In fact, let me tell you that there are many such sedimentary regions , we have not even explored those sedentary regions.  And one of them is Andaman and Nicobar Basin where the least exploration has taken place. And despite this, the type of geography is very promising that the chances of oil discovery here are very high.  That means, despite having so many chances, we had not yet done exploration there and there were many reasons for this.  Firstly, there are a lot of technical challenges because there is deep water, seismic complexity, ecological sensitivity, logistical difficulties regarding forests etc. because it is very far from the mainland. But what happens is that now as India's energy demand is increasing, we do not want to be dependent. We are very dependent.  We procure almost 85-90% oil. So imagine, you might be seeing recently that the war is going on between Israel and Iran. Iran has repeatedly threatened to close down the State of Homs.  So, somewhere or the other, the Indian economy always faces shocks because of the crude oil prices.  This means that if the price of crude oil goes above $100 per barrel, the Indian economy will be hit.  Meaning, we haven't even done anything yet.  Despite that, we still face trouble again and again.  So if such a discovery happens, it will be very beneficial somewhere and that is why now the government's attention has shifted towards this.  Now the question is what is the current development taking place regarding the Andaman Sea?  First of all let me tell you that the first exploration well in this basin is by All India Limited and its name is Vijayapuram One.  Let me show you a little bit.  You are seeing this Andaman Island. Basically we are talking about South Andaman. Above this became Middle Andaman. Then above that comes your North Andaman. So the lower part, because below this, keep in mind that Nicobar Island will come below it.  So this one is from South Andaman and here you can see, this is Shri Vijaypuram and here you must be knowing about North Saintland Island. Lives in a lot of isolation.  So this Shri Vijayapuram area is where you can see the airport named after Veer Savarkar. So in its offshore, i.e. around here, it is said that here in the Vijayapuram One basin, the first ever exploration well was drilled by Oil India Limited using Blackford Dolphin Deep Sea Rick. Well what is this Blackford Dolphin Deep Sea Rick ?  This is basically a company called Dolphin Drilling that operates a semi-submersible drilling rig here.  It operates it and has deep water capability where drilling is done upto 6000 feet of water and internationally it has a good record in drilling.  So this is what has been drilled here using this Black Fort Dolphin deep seric and it is being said that by the end of this year three to four more wells will be drilled by ONGC following large scale 2D and 3D seismic survey.  So currently seismic surveys etc. are going on to determine exactly where we should carry out exploration.  So after 2D and 3D mapping, it will be decided where exactly we can drill three or four more wells.  And this exploration campaign is based on promising geological and seismic data. We are doing drilling here according to the things we are finding.  Well, at least this has happened.  The second development is that we are collaborating with foreign companies. Like Exxon Mobil became Shell. They are in talks with ONGC to form a partnership and carry out deep seed drilling in that basin. And this is important because these majors, these companies bring advanced technology for ultra drip water operations and somewhere this signals that there is global confidence about the Andaman Sea. Meaning the world knows that there could be a huge oil reserve there.  Besides this, support of the Government is also necessary and in view of this, the Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons are giving financial incentives to the companies.  Tax breaks are being given under this policy to help hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy and apart from this, environmental clearance etc. is being made a little easier so that the permissions can be fast-tracked a little bit because this has been a big problem that things are not fast-tracked in our bureaucracy. Well, what's at stake here, means that if we talk about reserves, how much could be there in the Andaman Sea, some estimates are being made because you cannot say exactly right now, but it is said that 610 million tonnes of oil could be there which is equivalent to 4.5 billion barrels.  An oil reserve of 4.5 billion barrels can be seen in the Andaman Sea region. And if you talk about the entire country, because many of the secondary reasons, as I told you, are still unexplored.  So in total it is said that you can see 22 billion barrels of oil equivalent in India.  Which is huge untapped national asset.  If we get this, just think how big the benefit could be.  So what is there right now is that these are preliminary estimates.  When things move forward and exploration is done then we can get the exact data. Well here I would like to compare you a little with Gayana. If you look, the first major discovery was made in Guyana.  Well, first check its location also. This is a South American country and the northern part here is a small country called Guyana and on its left side is Venezuela. Suriname is on the right side. Brazil can be seen below.  So, in this side of shore region of Guyana, this entire area in the Atlantic Ocean, it is said here that a massive discovery was made in 2015, which has not yet happened in India and its current production because the discovery was made in 2015, the production started gradually from 2019 and as of today the production is of 60,000 barrels per day. Now if you look at the total production in India, it is only 35,000 barrels per day.  You just think where a small country like Guyana has a production of 660000 barrels per day and such a big country like ours has the production of only 35000 barrels per day, from this you can understand how much benefit Guyana would have got from this and here their estimated revenue is it is around 11 billion barrels and here you can see of India which I told you has a total reserve of 22 billion, sorry revenue, I said this is a reserve, keep it in mind, okay, well if you look at foreign investors, you will find companies like Exxon Mobil there also. Efforts are being made to bring them to India also. Economic Impact: Here, because of this, you can see that 60% GDP growth was witnessed because their revenue increased very rapidly. Now it is not the case that if such a discovery happens in India then our GDP growth rate will also increase by 60%.  This is not so because Guyana is a small country.  Its already total GDP was very small. So suddenly there was such a huge windfall due to which their GDP growth rate started increasing by 60.6%.  But yes, definitely it will impact our import bill.  We import so much oil and spend all those dollars, we won't have to do that.  Its economic impact, as I told you, we import 85% of crude oil, so there will be relief in that.  Apart from this, there are many participations of foreign companies, foreign direct investment, technology, capital, international attention, etc. will be available here. Along with this, we will be saved from the geopolitical hobby that keeps happening here.  The war that keeps happening in the Middle East and it is obvious that jobs, unemployment, infrastructure, etc. will also increase significantly.  But look, there are technical challenges too.  Meaning you have to do ultra deep water exploration. High drilling cost occurs at 3000 meter depth. ₹800 crore is spent on the well. In fact, I also want to show you a statement by Hardeep Singh Puri ji.  He said, look, such wells involve a lot of expenditure.  You can't do anything.  Meaning, you take a risk in a way.  You keep doing dick continuously, keep doing it and somewhere you get success.  For example, if you see the example of Guyana, she had [ __ ] 44 wells.  That means, after going to well number 41, they found that there was oil there.  You understand how much hard work is required here.  So many years pass by. And in fact it has been said by them that the company in our country, ONGC, has done the maximum number of well digging in the last 37 years, just last year in 2023-24.  A total of 540 wells have been dug. Which is highest number in past 30-4 years.  And you can see that the company has also made a capital expenditure of Rs 37,000 crore. Meaning, he was saying that the earlier governments did not spend that much. But now we are ready to take the risk here. And we are ready to spend on all this infrastructure.  And but look, there are challenges too.  Then for example there are environmental challenges etc.   There is an ecological sensitive zone there. You will have to coordinate with the Navy.   The outcome is uncertain.  Even after spending so much money, you are not very sure that you will get it.  I am not 100% sure, right?  If it was 100% then what would have been the point? Then you could have invested all the money.  So now the question is what next?  Look, in the short term, the results of Vijayapuram One Well will be closely monitored. ONGC will start its drilling at the end of 2025. Suppose there are discoveries here in the medium term then development planning will take place.  Final investment decisions will be taken.   The construction of infrastructure will be started and in the long term there will only be benefits for India if a discovery is made here, then let's see what happens here, but I hope that the news that was coming about the Andaman Sea that a huge oil reserve has been found or is about to be found, so I hope that that thing must have become clear to you and before leaving, can you tell me a very interesting question, what does this term sweet crude oil mean, which of the following correctly describe this term, you all know its correct answer, you will definitely find it on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from telegram and friends, as I told you, if you are preparing for 2026 or 27, then definitely join our Pratigya batch.
