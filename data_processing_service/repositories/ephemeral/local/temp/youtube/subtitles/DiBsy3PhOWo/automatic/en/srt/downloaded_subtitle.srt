1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
IQ.

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,120
Hello Friends.  Friends, I was looking

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
everywhere including on social media.  In fact, many of you were

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,800

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
repeatedly demanding in the comment section of my videos

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
that a video should be made on whether a

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
massive oil discovery is going to happen in the Andaman Sea, which is India's Andaman Sea.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Look, what is the reason behind this,

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
a statement came from our Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
He gave an interview to a media

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
The New Indian and in that

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,039
he said that India is on the brink of Guyana

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,199
sized oil discovery in Andaman Sea.  Keep in mind that there is

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
a small country in South America called

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,560
Guyana where oil was recently discovered

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,280
and they benefited a lot from it.  This means that due to

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,560
such a huge oil reserve in a small country,

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
their GDP started growing by 40, 50, 60-60%.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
So much revenue was being generated.

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
So let us understand this in a little detail as to

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,280
what exactly is this matter?  Meaning, are

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,360
we going to make a huge oil discovery in the Andaman Sea?

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
What is the current progress right now

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
?  I will tell you all that in detail.

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
Let's move on.  But

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
before that let me tell you all that those of you who are

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,119
preparing for UPSC 2026 or are

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,040
preparing for the long term,

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
both the batches for 2027 are available on Study IQ.

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
Their links are given in the comment section.

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
You have to use this code at the

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
time of live checkout so that you

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
can avail the maximum discount.

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's get started.  As I was

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
telling you, an exclusive interview was given

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
by Hardeep Singh Puri ji.  He spoke to The New

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
Indian about India's

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
vision of energy independence

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,560
and said that India may be on the

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
verge of discovering a game changing oil

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
reserve in the Andaman Sea and

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,040
compared it with the South American country

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,720
Guyana where a major oil discovery was made in 2015.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Yes it takes time

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
when you discover the oil but

59
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
actually when the oil is extracted

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,959
it takes a very long time.  So

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,440
recently,

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,040
Guyana has been getting a lot of benefits here over the last four years.  Well,

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
here's what he exactly said

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
?  You can see.  He says

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,760
when I made this statement about Krishna

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Godavari basin at that point in time that was one

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
place.  I had once

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
given a statement here regarding the KG Basin.  So

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
a lot of gas is coming out from there.  But

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
I had spoken about one place.  But right now

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
we're seeing a lot of green shoots here all across the country.

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,239
Meaning,

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,280
oil can be discovered at many places.  And it

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,160
's just a matter of time before we find a

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
big guyana in the Andaman Sea.  So that is

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
ongoing, he says.  And see, this

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
bold prediction

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
can benefit India a lot somewhere.  If

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
actually we make such a big discovery of oil.

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Well, here we need to understand a little

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,959
background that we are

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
talking about the Andaman Sea.  After all

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,720
why only Andaman Sea?  First of all, understand a little from the map,

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
what does it mean when we say Andaman Sea?  As you can see,

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
here is the Eastern coastal region of India,

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,680
here is the Bay of Bengal and

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,440
here you can see the Andaman and Nicobar islands.

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
So when we

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
say Andaman Sea, it means

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,560
this entire area on the eastern side of the islands

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,120
which borders with the South East Asian countries.

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,280
So this entire area is called Andaman Sea.

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,760
So basically what it is is that the

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,879
basin of Andaman and Nicobar is one of

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,840
India's least explored off shore

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,280
frontiers.  Meaning, India has tried and attempted at many places.  In

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
fact, let me

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,959
tell you that there are many such sedimentary regions

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,360
, we have

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,920
not even explored those sedentary regions.  And one of them is

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,480
Andaman and Nicobar

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,040
Basin where the least exploration has taken place.

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,599
And despite this, the

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,760
type of geography is very promising

106
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,400
that the chances of oil discovery here are

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
very high.  That means,

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
despite having so many chances, we had

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
not yet done exploration there and there were

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
many reasons for this.  Firstly, there are

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
a lot of technical challenges because there is deep water,

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
seismic complexity, ecological

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,479
sensitivity,

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
logistical difficulties regarding forests etc. because

115
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,639
it is very far from the mainland.

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,040
But what happens is that now as

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
India's energy demand is increasing, we do

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,680
not want to be dependent.

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
We are very dependent.  We procure almost 85-90% oil.

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,479
So imagine, you might be

121
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,240
seeing recently that the war is going on between Israel and Iran.

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,560
Iran has repeatedly threatened to

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
close down the State of Homs.  So, somewhere or the

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
other, the Indian

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
economy always faces shocks because of the crude oil prices.  This

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
means that if the price of crude oil

127
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
goes above $100 per barrel, the Indian

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
economy will be hit.  Meaning, we haven't

129
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
even done anything yet.  Despite that,

130
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,759
we still face trouble again and again.  So

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
if such a discovery happens, it will be

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,840
very beneficial somewhere and that is why now the

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
government's attention has shifted towards this.  Now the

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,479
question is what is the current development

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,479
taking place regarding the Andaman Sea?  First of all let

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,000
me tell you that the

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,720
first exploration well in this basin is by All India Limited and

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,039
its name is Vijayapuram One.  Let

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,440
me show you a little bit.  You are seeing this Andaman Island.

140
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
Basically we are talking about South Andaman.

141
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
Above this became Middle Andaman.

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,960
Then above that comes your North Andaman.

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
So the lower part, because

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,360
below this, keep in mind that Nicobar Island will come

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,919
below it.  So this one is from South Andaman

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,479
and here you can see, this is

147
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,160
Shri Vijaypuram and here

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
you must be knowing about North Saintland Island.

149
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,680
Lives in a lot of isolation.  So this Shri

150
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,080
Vijayapuram area is where you can see the

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,479
airport named after Veer Savarkar.

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,800
So in its offshore, i.e.

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,919
around here, it is said that here in the

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,120
Vijayapuram One basin, the

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,199
first ever exploration well was drilled

156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,479
by Oil India Limited

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,880
using Blackford Dolphin Deep Sea Rick.

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,960
Well what is this Blackford Dolphin Deep Sea Rick

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,919
?  This is basically

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,400
a company called Dolphin Drilling that

161
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,960
operates a semi-submersible drilling rig here.  It

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,000
operates it and

163
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,319
has deep water capability where

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
drilling is done upto 6000 feet of water and

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,880
internationally it has a good record

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,600
in drilling.  So this is what has been drilled here

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,919
using this Black Fort Dolphin

168
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,880
deep seric and it is being said that by the end of this year

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,600
three to four

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,479
more wells will be drilled by ONGC

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,639
following large scale 2D and 3D seismic

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,560
survey.  So currently seismic surveys etc. are going on to determine

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,360
exactly where

174
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,000
we should carry out exploration.  So after 2D and

175
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,720
3D mapping, it will be decided

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,800
where exactly we can drill three or four more wells.  And this

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
exploration campaign is based on

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
promising geological and seismic data.

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960

181
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,880
We are doing drilling here according to the things we are finding.  Well, at least

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,199
this has happened.  The second development is

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
that we are collaborating with foreign companies.

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
Like Exxon Mobil became Shell.

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,240
They are in talks with ONGC

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
to form a partnership and carry out deep seed

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
drilling in that basin.

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
And this is important because these

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
majors, these companies

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,199
bring advanced technology for

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,720
ultra drip water operations and

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
somewhere this signals that there is

193
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,199
global confidence about the Andaman Sea.

194
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
Meaning the world knows that there could be a huge

195
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
oil reserve there.  Besides this,

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
support of the Government is also necessary and in

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
view of this, the Indian Ministry

198
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons are

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
giving financial incentives

201
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
to the companies.  Tax breaks are being given

202
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
under this policy to help hydrocarbon

203
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,880
exploration and licensing policy and

204
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
apart from this, environmental clearance

205
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,639
etc. is being made a little easier

206
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,240
so that the permissions can be fast-tracked a little bit

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
because this has been a big problem that

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,479
things are

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,840
not fast-tracked in our bureaucracy. Well,

210
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,680
what's at stake here, means that if we

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
talk about reserves, how much could be there in the Andaman Sea,

212
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
some estimates are being made

213
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
because you cannot say exactly right now,

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,360
but it is said that 610 million tonnes of

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,120
oil

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,520
could be there which is

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,759
equivalent to 4.5 billion barrels.  An

218
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
oil reserve of 4.5 billion barrels can be

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
seen in the Andaman Sea region.

220
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,160
And if you talk about the entire country,

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
because many of the secondary

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,319
reasons, as I told you, are still

223
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,479
unexplored.  So in total it is

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,599
said that

225
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,919
you can see 22 billion barrels of oil equivalent in India.  Which is

226
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,080
huge untapped national

227
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,479
asset.  If we get this, just think

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
how big the benefit could be.  So what is there right now is that

229
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,640
these are preliminary estimates.  When

230
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
things move forward and exploration is done

231
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
then we can get the exact data.

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Well here I would like to compare you a little

233
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,959
with Gayana.

234
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
If you look, the first major discovery was made in

235
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
Guyana.  Well, first check its location also.

236
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,800
This is a South American country and the

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
northern part here is a small country called

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,040
Guyana and on its left side is Venezuela.

239
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
Suriname is on the right side.

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,279
Brazil can be seen below.  So,

241
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,360
in this side of shore region of Guyana, this entire area in the

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,760
Atlantic Ocean, it is said here

243
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,240
that a massive discovery was made in 2015, which has

244
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,640
not yet happened in India and its

245
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,200
current production because the discovery was made in 2015, the

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,040
production started gradually from 2019

247
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,600
and as of today the

248
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
production is of 60,000 barrels per day.

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,160
Now if you look at the total

250
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
production in India, it is only 35,000 barrels per

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,800
day.  You just think where a small country like Guyana has a

252
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,600
production of 660000 barrels per

253
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,519
day and such a big country like ours has the production of only 35000

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,839
barrels per day, from this you can understand

255
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
how much benefit Guyana would have got from this and

256
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,800
here their estimated revenue is it is

257
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,399
around 11 billion barrels and here

258
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
you can see of India which I

259
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,279
told you has a total reserve of 22 billion, sorry

260
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
revenue, I said this is a reserve,

261
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,800
keep it in mind, okay, well

262
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
if you look at foreign investors, you will

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,519
find companies like Exxon Mobil there also.

264
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
Efforts are being made to bring them to India also.

265
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,320
Economic Impact: Here, because of this,

266
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,240
you can see that 60% GDP growth was witnessed

267
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
because their revenue increased very rapidly.

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Now it is not the case that if

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
such a discovery happens in India then our GDP

270
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,079
growth rate will also increase by 60%.  This is not so

271
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
because Guyana is a small country.  Its

272
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,720
already total GDP was very small.

273
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
So suddenly there was such a huge windfall

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
due to which their GDP growth rate

275
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,920
started increasing by 60.6%.  But yes,

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
definitely

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,399
it will impact our import bill.  We import so much

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
oil and spend all those dollars,

279
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
we won't have to do that.  Its

280
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,640
economic impact, as I told you,

281
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,640
we import 85% of crude oil, so there will be

282
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,959
relief in that.  Apart from this, there are

283
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
many participations of foreign companies,

284
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
foreign direct investment,

285
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,800
technology, capital, international attention, etc. will be available here.

286
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,200
Along with this,

287
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,040
we will be saved from the geopolitical hobby that keeps happening here.  The

288
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
war that keeps happening in the Middle East

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,680
and it is obvious that jobs,

290
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
unemployment, infrastructure, etc. will also

291
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,760
increase significantly.  But look, there

292
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,920
are technical challenges too.  Meaning you have to do ultra deep

293
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,480
water exploration.

294
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,839
High drilling cost occurs at 3000 meter depth.

295
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
₹800 crore is spent on the well.

296
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
In fact, I also want to show you a statement by

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Hardeep Singh Puri ji.  He

298
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,279
said, look, such wells involve a

299
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
lot of expenditure.  You can't

300
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,920
do anything.  Meaning, you take a risk in a way.  You keep doing

301
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,600
dick continuously, keep doing it

302
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,480
and somewhere you get success.  For

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,560
example, if you see the example of Guyana,

304
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,959
she had [ __ ] 44 wells.  That means, after

305
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,360
going to well number 41, they found that there was

306
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,279
oil there.  You understand how much

307
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
hard work is required here.  So many years pass by.

308
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
And in fact it has been said by them that the

309
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
company in our country, ONGC, has done the

310
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
maximum number of well digging in the last 37 years,

311
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,160
just last year

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,399
in 2023-24.  A total of 540 wells have been dug.

313
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,040
Which is highest number in past

314
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,600
30-4 years.  And you can see that the company has

315
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,000
also made a capital expenditure of Rs 37,000 crore.

316
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,399
Meaning, he was saying that the earlier

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
governments did not spend that much.

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
But now we are ready to take the risk here.

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
And

320
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,920
we are ready to spend on all this infrastructure.  And

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,320
but look, there are challenges too.  Then for

322
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,880
example there are environmental challenges etc.   There

323
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
is an ecological sensitive zone there.

324
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
You will have to coordinate with the Navy.   The

325
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
outcome is uncertain.  Even after spending so much money,

326
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
you are not very sure that

327
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,639
you will get it.  I am not 100%

328
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,560
sure, right?  If it was 100% then what would have been the point?

329
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
Then you could have invested all the money.  So now the

330
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,680
question is what next?  Look,

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,760
in the short term, the results of Vijayapuram One Well will be

332
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
closely monitored.

333
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,399
ONGC will start its drilling

334
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
at the end of 2025.

335
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,720
Suppose there are discoveries here in the medium term

336
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,639
then development planning will take place.  Final

337
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
investment decisions will be taken.   The

338
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
construction of infrastructure will be started

339
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
and in the long term there will only be

340
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
benefits for India if a discovery is made here, then

341
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
let's see what happens here, but I

342
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
hope that the news that was coming about the Andaman Sea

343
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
that a huge oil reserve has been found

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
or is about to be found, so I hope that that thing must have become

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,680
clear to you and before leaving, can you

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
tell me a very interesting question, what does

347
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,639
this term sweet crude oil

348
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
mean, which of the following

349
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
correctly describe this term,

350
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
you all know its correct answer, you will definitely find it on my Instagram,

351
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
if you are not there, no

352
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
problem, you can get its

353
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
correct answer from telegram and friends, as I

354
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
told you, if you are preparing for 2026 or 27, then

single book pitch has topper suggested but nothing

364

works for me.  I was like it, it won't happen, let's

365
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,920
leave it.  If it is not happening then what is the

366
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,240
use of reading them again and again?

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,880
