I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, this is my analysis.  However, rumours are rife in the corridors that something might go wrong between Israel and Pakistan.  Ok.  But will this happen?  I will tell you a lot. Why is America being so kind to Pakistan now?  We will talk about Noor Khan Airbase as well as Israel, Iran and Israel, Pakistan.  Is it possible that Israel may attack Pakistan also ?  Look, anything can happen.  So let me give you an analysis.  But before that let me tell you that you can download our wonderful course on Chanakya Niti.

And after that I will tell you what the problem is. Look, you know that here Iran has launched a massive attack on Israel and Israel had initiated it.  So this problem has started in the Middle East.  First of all let us talk about Iran.  Iran and Pakistan.  We will keep Pakistan here and look at it one by one.  So first of all this is your Pakistan and after that what is the situation of Iran?  So Iran has been a friend of Pakistan.  1947 When Pakistan separated, both Iran and Pakistan joined America.  You had a choice, either you join Russia or you join America. Friends, listen to the complete analysis carefully. After that things will become very clear to you. And in this, international relations also include every thing like how geopolitics is going on. So Iran and Pakistan were with America.  You will be surprised to know that Iran may have been a good friend of India. I wouldn’t say he’s been a friend or a companion.   There has n't been a friend.  Because Iran has not supported India much.  Be it the 1965 war or the 1971 war. Pakistan has received tremendous support from America.  Ok?  Not now, this is till 2001, till 2001.  But again America is supporting Pakistan.  I will tell you now why we will come to America also.   Let us talk about Iran first.  So Iran did not support India either in the 1965, 199 or 1971 wars.  There was the Pahlavi dynasty.  Reza Pahlavi was there.  You already know it.  He was with America.  There was complete prowess.  Whatever oil reserves there were, a lot of help was being provided to Pakistan and a lot of help was being provided to American and British companies.  Is it okay?  So all this was happening.   In fact, both have taken joint action against Balochistan.  However, that changed last year.  These things changed when Iran attacked Pakistan's Balochistan and Pakistan attacked Iran in Balochistan and then Iran killed four Pakistanis in firing, but Iran has always supported Pakistan.  Then there was a revolution in Iran in 1971 and in 1979 there was a revolution in Iran.  Now when revolution came in Iran, then as you know, an Islamist government came into power here, so Pakistan gave more support. General Zia-ul-Haq was anyway a staunch Islamist.  Now what happens is that from 1979 to 1989, two big wars take place. One is the Soviet-Afghan war.  Now listen carefully.  Both the countries are supporting America. You know, America has given its support to Pakistan. Ok?  Pakistan was used by America. Gave money to Pakistan.  America gave huge amount of money and asked him to train the Mujahideen.  Iran also supported Pakistan and said that we will support you in fighting against the Soviet Union. You support us in fighting against Iraq.  So this exchange takes place.  Do you understand?  A long time passes and this is the support that Iran gives to Pakistan.  Well, another thing that Iran does is that Iran says that when relations with America became very bad, then you know Pakistan openly recognized it.  The Islamist regime that came into power was recognised and welcomed.  But now Pakistan is no longer what it was because America and Iran turned against each other.  Now the dilemma here is that Iran has always had this demand from Pakistan, which still exists. Friends, when Shabaz Sharif went there, Khomeini directly told him that look, we are not a nuclear nation and you have to stand against Israel.  So if we are attacked, you will come with us. However, Shabaz Sharif did not say anything on this.  Are you understanding?  So one thing has become clear to you that Iran and Pakistan support each other.  But recently Pakistan is in a state of disarray.  Earlier, as long as America was right, both the countries were doing it.  But when America turned against Iran, then Pakistan faced a problem as to what should we do?  Although he still says that we support Iran. Now come to Israel.  What is the situation in Israel ?  If we talk about Israel, then Israel and Pakistan are arch enemies.  Arch enemy.  Ok?  Pakistan has not even recognised Israel yet.  So Pakistan does not like Israel at all. Israel had even said this to India during Operation Kata in 1979-80 that it had asked India to give them its airbase.  We will destroy all the nuclear weapons of Pakistan. You give us your airbase.   Is it okay?  I even said this.  And it's happened twice that you'll just come to our plane.   We will get your refill done.  We will destroy all the nuclear sites of Pakistan. India did not take such a step. Otherwise Israel would have finished off Pakistan long ago.  Are you understanding?  Let me tell you one more thing.  I forgot to tell you.  Like Iran, its nuclear program is progressing very fast and after 1979, Iran understood that if we want to survive and if we want to protect ourselves then we need a nuclear program.  At that time Abdul Qadir, who was a scientist of Pakistan, you also know that the entire nuclear program of Pakistan was made secretly.  So he had set up a black market so that whoever was illegal, meaning whoever wanted to advance his nuclear program, should come to us.  We will give you whatever nuclear blueprints we have. Iran says that Pakistan helped Iran.  China was also involved in this.  So, Pakistan helps Iran in its nuclear program in some way or the other. Ok?  So the direct enemy of Israel is somewhere Pakistan.  Even if it is not done directly, indirectly it helps Iran.  Now come on, what is the situation in America?  Now look at the situations in America and Pakistan, if we talk presently, they are looking quite favourable. How?  You should understand one thing.  Under whose control was Noor Khan Airbase ?  It was under the control of America.  This is well known.  Now friends, it is just said that the cargo here, that is, even high officials, are not allowed at Noor Khan Airbase. America always wanted an airbase in Pakistan.  Is it okay?  The Pasni airbase here and the Sanguli airbase, both of them were used by America.  I always got it refilled here. Now in 1979 when America became hostile towards Iran, even then America wanted Pakistan's airbase and it still wants it.  Now friends, America is currently supporting Pakistan because it has to build its strategic assets there. Pahalgam attack happened on 22nd April and in the same April America started talks with Iran. Is it okay under the nuclear program?  The conversation is ongoing here. During this time, Pahalgaon is attacked. After that India strikes.  India beats Pakistan.  So when India attacks Pakistan, America first says that it has nothing to do with us. But then when this attack happens on Noor Khan, suddenly a ceasefire is imposed.  Totally out of the blue.  Because it is said that Pakistan was completely under the control of America. And an official has also said this. what happens now?  Donald Trump suddenly showers love on Pakistan. Their Michael Kuller from the American Army will even invite Asim Munir on Army Day. Come to Iran, son.  Talks with Iran were failing.  Talks with Iran were failing. Israel said that enough is enough. Stop the conversation.  Attack Iran. Ok?  During this time, friends, America was talking to Pakistan since March or February. what were you talking about? IS Khorasan You saw that America praised Pakistan.  Why?  Counter Terrorism: Pakistan has played a major role in controlling terrorism.  We thank him.  Friends, the plan was big.  The plan was that because the talks with Iran failed.  Will attack Iran's nuclear sites.  Ok? Although America has said that we had nothing to do with this, but Don Trump has clearly said that today is Day 61 and now if you do not listen to us then we have attacked.  You still have time.  Israel attacked.  Israel attacked.  Now look at the game, Iran wants Pakistan.  Donald Trump has said that America needs Pakistan.  Donald Trump has said that my brother, this war will last a long time.  And this will last for a very long time and at that time we will need Pakistan.  To attack Iran we need Pakistan because if this war starts from here then it will continue for a long time.  Ok?  Israel will attack.  So if this happens then Pakistan will help us through its airbase.  Did you understand?   This is also the reason why America is supporting Pakistan.  Now you will say that Sir its okay.  What is Pakistan doing?  Here comes another big game.  This is about America.  But what's the biggest game?   The biggest game is that Pakistan is saying we are with Iran.  Pakistan is saying we are with Iran.  Let me tell you the statement.  See, Khawaja Asif, who is the Defense Minister, spoke to the Pakistani media.  Now they have said that we condemn Israel. We completely condemn what Israel has done. He also said that the manner in which the attack was carried out was wrong.  Muslim countries will have to unite.  And Israel, if we are not united, listen very carefully.  If we don't unite , Israel will kill Muslim countries one by one. Israel will target Muslim countries one by one. So here America is supporting Pakistan and Israel is speaking against Pakistan and Pakistan is giving statements against Israel. Now after that see what happens next that if this is Pakistan then we have Iran here.  Ok?  We stand with Iran.  Iran has the right to defense and the genocide that Iran and Israel are carrying out will have to be stopped.  This is the right time when we should stand up against our enemy, the exact word enemy Israel, and if Israel is not stopped now, it will shed the blood of more Muslims in the future.  After that, Shahbaz Sharif had gone to Iran after the Pahalgam attack. I will tell you the exact words of Ali Khomenei, what he said. Ok?  Ali Khamenei rebuked Pakistan in a way and expressed his displeasure by saying that you are a Muslim country but still you are silent against Israel. You have not taken any concrete steps against Israel. Directly after that you are a nuclear nation.  You will have to stand openly against Israel.  And if there is a nuclear threat to us then you will have to take action along with us and you will also have to use your nuclear weapons. Shabaz Sharif did not say anything on this.  Shahbaz Sharif remained silent on this.  What this means is that you should assume that Pakistan can betray Iran.  And it is always said that Pakistan supports Iran behind the scenes. But the one who is silent supports America.  Ok?  But what is Pakistan's current stand regarding this attack ?  This stand is clear that whatever Israel has done to Israel is very wrong. Israel cannot attack Iran's nuclear program. And friends, there is another news also.  This intelligence agency Musad Usad has also found out that Pakistan also helps Iran in its nuclear program.  Is it okay?  China, China is helping Iran.  He is selling a lot of weapons.  And China Pakistan is also a friend of China.  So geopolitics, you are seeing what is happening here.  Now America is supporting Pakistan and Pakistan is standing against Israel.  That's why there is a journalist here.  He has said that if something like this happens then Israel may attack Pakistan also.  Because friends, Iran will 110% ask for help from Pakistan. You should see this.  Write down what I say, if this war continues for long. Ok?  And if this missile exchange happens because Pakistan has publicly supported Iran.  Even friends, let me tell you that the Foreign Office of Pakistan has also issued a statement that the military strikes by Israel are a violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is absolutely wrong according to the Charter of the United Nations.  Article 51 of the UN Charter.  So we say that whatever Israel did was wrong and Iran can self-defend itself. So if this war continues, Pakistan will stand with Iran and Israel always wants to attack Pakistan, especially on nuclear sites.  So there is a big possibility that an attack may happen. But then what about America?  America is supporting Pakistan.  Now if America is supporting Pakistan then Israel listens to America.  The answer is no.  America has distanced itself from this. Israel does not listen to anyone. Israel will do whatever it thinks is in its interest. Infact America listens to Israel, friends.  This is true.  And Israel, Pakistan continuously spews venom against Israel.  Ok?  He always keeps on talking a lot.  So Israel needs a chance.  In fact, he had openly supported India and said, yes, kill them. America did not openly support. America is saying the same thing that now America needs Pakistan's airbases against Iran. Israel does not need any airbase.  Ok?  So at this time Pakistan is in a very bad situation that if it supports Iran then America will be angry with it.  If it supports Iran, America will deal with it in a jiffy and will not give it any money. And the direct threat from Israel is looming over Pakistan. Ok?  that anything can happen. So this is how geopolitics is working right now. However, I do not think that Pakistan will jump directly into the war.   He will not jump into the war directly and will not be with him either because at this time he too is saying that we need everyone's support.  But his support is openly towards Iran. Ok.  So, this is the complete account. Look, there is one thing we must not forget.  This war is between Israel and Iran.  Is it okay? So what we are saying is that if America says so then perhaps Israel will not attack Pakistan. If something like this happens, it is because Israel has tried this before.  but it's not like that.  I told you that he will do whatever he feels is right.  And wherever it feels that those countries which have helped Iran till now, Israel has attacked them.  And this is why Pakistan does not openly help Iran. But everything is behind the scenes.  So it is possible that a news may come that look brother, Israel has bombed their nuclear site or the place from where help is being given or from where supplies are being given to Iran.  Big Possibility.  What do you think?  You please tell me in the comment box.  But this is if the war continues for a long time.  Ok?  Very long and if this war continues for long then it will become a big problem for everyone. Everyone whatever is there is for the whole world.  Ok? So this is the thing.  So I hope I explained all the geopolitics to you.  Explained everyone's relations. You got it.  What do you think, please tell me in the comment box. Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off and signing off with our Chanakya Niti course. Link to description comment is given.  Thank you.
