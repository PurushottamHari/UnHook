1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,480
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,759
Friends, this is my analysis.  However,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
rumours are rife in the corridors that

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
 

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
something might go wrong between Israel and Pakistan.  Ok.  But will

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,560
this happen?  I will tell you a lot.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,160

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,640
Why is America being so kind to Pakistan now?  We will talk about Noor Khan Airbase

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,920
as well as Israel, Iran and Israel,

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
Pakistan.  Is it

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,280
possible that Israel may attack Pakistan also

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,440
?  Look, anything can happen.  So let me

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
give you an analysis.  But before that let me

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
tell you that you can download our wonderful course on Chanakya Niti.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,440
Friends, whatever is there

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
today, is there today and whatever is there tomorrow, we are

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,360
running a sale.  Then after this we will turn off policy 70 coupon code.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
So the course is for ₹300.  There

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
are sessions of over 30 hours.  There are close to 600

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
verses.  And I have told you each and every thing.

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,719
It has been added to the history and mentioned here.

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,320
So you will get a lot of help.  So the

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,119
link is given in the description comment box.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,760
So look

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,240
here there is Pakistan, Israel, Iran and

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,960
America.  So let us know the things one by one.  Is it

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
okay?  And after that I will

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,159
tell you what the problem is.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
Look, you know that here Iran has

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,880
launched a massive attack on Israel and

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Israel had initiated it.  So this

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,320
problem has started in the Middle East.  First of all let

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,159
us talk about Iran.  Iran and

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Pakistan.  We will keep Pakistan here

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,680
and look at it one by one.  So

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,159
first of all this is your Pakistan and after that what is the

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,880
situation of Iran?  So

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,840
Iran has been a friend of Pakistan.  1947 When

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
Pakistan separated, both Iran and Pakistan

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
joined America.  You had a

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
choice, either you join Russia

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,600
or you join America.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Friends, listen to the complete analysis carefully.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
After that things will become very clear to you.

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
And in this, international relations also include every

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,920
thing like how geopolitics is going on.

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,479
So Iran and Pakistan were

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
with America.  You will be surprised to know

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,840
that Iran may have been a good friend of India.

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,800
I wouldn’t say he’s been a friend or a companion.   There has

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
n't been a friend.  Because Iran has

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,120
not supported India much.  Be

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,200
it the 1965 war or the 1971 war.

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,120

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Pakistan has received tremendous support from America.  Ok?  Not now, this is till

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
2001, till 2001.  But again America is

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
supporting Pakistan.  I

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
will tell you now why we will come to America also.   Let us

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,640
talk about Iran first.  So Iran did not

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
support India either in the 1965, 199 or 1971 wars.  There

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,879
was the Pahlavi dynasty.  Reza

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Pahlavi was there.  You already know it.  He

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,200
was with America.  There was complete prowess.  Whatever oil

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
reserves there were, a lot of help was being provided to Pakistan

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,360
and a

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,080
lot of help was being provided to American and British companies.  Is it

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
okay?  So all this was happening.   In

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,120
fact, both have taken

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,800
joint action against Balochistan.  However, that

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,959
changed last year.  These things changed when Iran

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,680
attacked Pakistan's Balochistan and

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,400
Pakistan attacked Iran in Balochistan

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
and then Iran killed four Pakistanis in firing,

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,200

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,640
but Iran has always

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
supported Pakistan.  Then there was a revolution in Iran in 1971 and

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
in 1979 there was a revolution in Iran.  Now

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
when revolution came in Iran, then as

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
you know, an Islamist government came into power here,

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
so Pakistan gave more support.

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,799
General Zia-ul-Haq was anyway a staunch

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,080
Islamist.  Now what happens is that

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,400
from 1979 to 1989, two big wars take place.

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
One is the Soviet-Afghan war.  Now

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
listen carefully.  Both the

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,360
countries are supporting America.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,599
You know, America has given its support to Pakistan.

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Ok?  Pakistan was used by America.

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,560
Gave money to Pakistan.  America

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,280
gave huge amount of money and asked him to

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,080
train the Mujahideen.  Iran also

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,040
supported Pakistan and said that

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
we will support you in fighting against the Soviet Union.

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,760
You support us in fighting against Iraq.  So this

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,959
exchange takes place.  Do you understand?  A long

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,519
time passes and this is the support that

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,759
Iran gives to Pakistan.  Well, another thing that Iran does is that

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
Iran says that when

101
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
relations with America became very bad, then

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,520
you know Pakistan openly

103
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,759
recognized it.  The

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,639
Islamist regime that came into power was recognised

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,199
and welcomed.  But now Pakistan is

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,280
no longer what it was because America and Iran turned

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,000
against each other.  Now the

108
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,720
dilemma here is that Iran has always had

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
this demand from Pakistan, which still exists.

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
Friends, when Shabaz Sharif went there,

111
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,360
Khomeini directly told him that look,

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
we are not a nuclear nation and you have to

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,240
stand against Israel.  So if we are

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,000
attacked, you will come with us.

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,120
However, Shabaz Sharif did not say anything on this.  Are you

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,600
understanding?  So one thing has become clear to you

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
that Iran and Pakistan

118
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
support each other.  But

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,919
recently Pakistan

120
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,360
is in a state of disarray.  Earlier, as long as America was right,

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,199
both the countries were doing it.  But when

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
America turned against Iran,

123
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
then Pakistan faced a problem as to

124
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
what should we do?  Although he still

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,160
says that we support Iran.

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Now come to Israel.  What is the situation in Israel

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,880
?  If we talk about Israel, then Israel

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,919
and Pakistan are arch enemies.  Arch

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,479
enemy.  Ok?  Pakistan has

130
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,120
not even recognised Israel yet.  So

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,039
Pakistan does not like Israel at all.

132
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,560
Israel had even said this to India

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,000
during Operation Kata in 1979-80

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
that it had asked India to give them its

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,479
airbase.  We will destroy all the nuclear weapons of Pakistan.

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,639
You give us your airbase.   Is it

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,120
okay?  I even said this.  And it's

138
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,960
happened twice that you'll just come to our plane.   We

139
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
will get your refill done.  We will

140
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
destroy all the nuclear sites of Pakistan.

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,600
India did not take such a step.

142
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,160
Otherwise Israel would have finished off Pakistan long ago.  Are

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,880
you understanding?  Let me tell you one more thing.  I

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
forgot to tell you.  Like

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,319
Iran, its nuclear program is

146
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,160
progressing very fast and after 1979,

147
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
Iran understood that if we want to

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
survive and if we want to

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
protect ourselves then we need a nuclear program.  At

150
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,720
that time Abdul Qadir, who

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,919
was a scientist of Pakistan, you also know

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
that the entire nuclear

153
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,960
program of Pakistan was made secretly.  So

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,520
he had set up a black market so that whoever was

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,440
illegal, meaning whoever wanted to

156
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
advance his nuclear program, should

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,360
come to us.  We will give you whatever nuclear blueprints we have.

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,639
Iran says that Pakistan

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,720
helped Iran.  China was also involved in this.  So,

161
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,880

162
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,120
Pakistan helps Iran in its nuclear program in some way or the other.

163
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,199
Ok?  So the direct enemy of Israel is

164
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
somewhere Pakistan.  Even if it is not done

165
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,840
directly, indirectly

166
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,599
it helps Iran.  Now come on,

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,440
what is the situation in America?  Now look at the situations in America and

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,440
Pakistan, if

169
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,639
we talk presently, they are looking quite favourable.

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,680
How?  You should

171
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,440
understand one thing.  Under whose control was Noor Khan Airbase

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
?  It was under the control of America.  This

173
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,759
is well known.  Now friends, it is just said that the

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,240
cargo here, that is,

175
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,960
even high officials, are not allowed at Noor Khan Airbase.

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
America always

177
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,199
wanted an airbase in Pakistan.  Is it okay?  The

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
Pasni airbase here and the Sanguli

179
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,759
airbase, both of them were used by America.  I

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,039
always got it refilled here.

181
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,160
Now in 1979 when America

182
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,919
became hostile towards Iran, even then America wanted Pakistan's airbase

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,280
and it still

184
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,400
wants it.  Now friends,

185
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,800
America is currently

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,800
supporting Pakistan because

187
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
it has to build its strategic assets there.

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,840

189
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Pahalgam attack happened on 22nd April and

190
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,199
in the same April America started talks with Iran.

191
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Is it

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,360
okay under the nuclear program?  The conversation is ongoing here.

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,280
During this time, Pahalgaon is attacked.

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,280
After that India strikes.  India

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,160
beats Pakistan.  So when India

196
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,919
attacks Pakistan, America first

197
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
says that it has nothing to do with us.

198
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,639
But then when this attack happens on Noor Khan,

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,280
suddenly a ceasefire is imposed.  Totally out

200
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,680
of the blue.  Because it is said that

201
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,919
Pakistan was completely under the control of America.

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,360
And an official has also said this.

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,080
what happens now?  Donald Trump suddenly showers love on Pakistan.

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,800
Their

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,719
Michael Kuller from the American Army will

206
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
even invite Asim Munir on Army Day.

207
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,919
 

208
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,640
Come to Iran, son.  Talks with Iran were

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,279
failing.  Talks with Iran were failing.

210
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Israel said that enough is enough.

211
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,160
Stop the conversation.  Attack Iran.

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,200
Ok?  During this time, friends,

213
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,600
America was talking to Pakistan since March or February.

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,839
what were you talking about?

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
IS Khorasan

216
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,440
You saw that America

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,519
praised Pakistan.  Why?  Counter Terrorism:

218
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120

219
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,720
Pakistan has played a major role in controlling terrorism.  We

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,760
thank him.  Friends, the plan was

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,480
big.  The plan was that because the

222
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,000
talks with Iran failed.  Will attack Iran's nuclear

223
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,760
sites.  Ok?

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
Although America has said that we had nothing to do with this,

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,720
but Don Trump has clearly said

226
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,240
that today is Day 61 and now if you do not

227
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,680
listen to us then we have attacked.  You still

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,200
have time.  Israel attacked.  Israel

229
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:48,480
attacked.  Now look at the game,

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,360
Iran wants Pakistan.  Donald Trump has said that

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,560
America needs Pakistan.  Donald

232
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,040
Trump has said that my brother, this

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,000
war will last a long time.  And this will last for a very long time and at that

234
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,959
time we will need Pakistan.  To

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,680
attack Iran we need Pakistan

236
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,680
because if this

237
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,560
war starts from here then it will continue for a long time.  Ok?  Israel

238
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,959
will attack.  So if this happens then

239
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,240
Pakistan will help us

240
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,959
through its airbase.  Did you understand?   This is

241
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,480
also the reason why America is

242
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,959
supporting Pakistan.  Now you will say that Sir its

243
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,680
okay.  What is Pakistan doing?  Here

244
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,560
comes another big game.  This is about

245
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,519
America.  But what's the biggest game?   The

246
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,040
biggest game is that Pakistan is saying

247
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,560
we are with Iran.  Pakistan is saying

248
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,000
we are with Iran.  Let me

249
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,079
tell you the statement.  See, Khawaja Asif,

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,640
who is the Defense Minister,

251
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,760
spoke to the Pakistani media.  Now

252
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,880
they have said that we condemn Israel.

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,920
We completely condemn what Israel has done.

254
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,160

255
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,920
He also said that the manner in which the attack was carried out was

256
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,959
wrong.  Muslim countries will

257
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,720
have to unite.  And Israel, if we are not united,

258
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,320
listen very carefully.  If we don't unite

259
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,800
, Israel will kill Muslim countries one by one.

260
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,839
Israel will target Muslim countries one by one.

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,959
So here America is

262
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,200
supporting Pakistan and Israel is

263
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,440
speaking against Pakistan

264
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,680
and Pakistan is giving statements against Israel.

265
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,240
Now after that see what

266
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,800
happens next that if this is Pakistan then we have

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,760
Iran here.  Ok?  We

268
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,880
stand with Iran.  Iran has the right

269
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,000
to defense and the genocide that

270
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Iran and Israel are carrying out will have to be stopped.  This is the

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,519
right time when we should stand up against our enemy, the

272
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,600
exact word enemy Israel,

273
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
and if Israel is

274
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,480
not stopped now, it will

275
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,800
shed the blood of more Muslims in the future.  After that,

276
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,279
Shahbaz Sharif had gone to Iran after the Pahalgam attack.

277
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,440
I will tell you the exact words of Ali Khomenei,

278
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
what he said.

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,720
Ok?  Ali Khamenei rebuked

280
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,880
Pakistan in a way and

281
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
expressed his displeasure by saying that you are a Muslim country

282
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
but still you are silent against Israel.

283
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,680
 

284
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,320
You have not taken any concrete steps against Israel.

285
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,959
Directly after that you

286
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,680
are a nuclear nation.  You will

287
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:36,000
have to stand openly against Israel.  And if there is a

288
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,480
nuclear threat to us then

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,519
you will

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,519
have to take action along with us and you will also have to

291
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
use your nuclear weapons.

292
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,880
Shabaz Sharif did not say anything on this.  Shahbaz

293
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,920
Sharif remained silent on this.  What this means is

294
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,040
that you should assume that Pakistan

295
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,880
can betray Iran.  And it is always said

296
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,200
that Pakistan supports Iran behind the scenes.

297
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,279
But the one who is silent

298
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,440
supports America.  Ok?  But

299
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,720
what is Pakistan's current stand regarding this attack

300
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,160
?  This stand is clear that whatever Israel has

301
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
done to Israel is

302
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,040
very wrong.

303
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,279
Israel cannot attack Iran's nuclear program.

304
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
And friends, there is another news also.  This

305
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,279
intelligence agency Musad Usad has

306
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
also found out that

307
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,839
Pakistan also helps Iran in its nuclear program.  Is it

308
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,560
okay?  China,

309
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,959
China is helping Iran.  He is

310
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,800
selling a lot of weapons.  And China Pakistan is

311
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,040
also a friend of China.  So

312
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,959
geopolitics, you are seeing what is

313
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,040
happening here.  Now America is

314
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,839
supporting Pakistan and Pakistan is

315
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,480
standing against Israel.  That's why there is a

316
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,040
journalist here.  He has said that if

317
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,920
something like this happens then Israel may

318
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,079
attack Pakistan also.  Because friends, Iran will

319
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,320
110% ask for help from Pakistan.

320
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,519
You should see this.  Write down what I say,

321
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,920
if this war continues for long.

322
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
Ok?  And if this missile exchange

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
happens because Pakistan has publicly

324
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,600
supported Iran.  Even friends, let

325
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
me tell you that the Foreign

326
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,959
Office of Pakistan has also issued a statement that the

327
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
military strikes by Israel are a

328
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,000
violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

329
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,399

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,120
This is absolutely wrong according to the Charter of the United Nations.  Article 51 of the UN

331
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,279
Charter.  So we say that whatever Israel

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
did was wrong and Iran

333
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,440
can self-defend itself.

334
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,959
So if this war continues, Pakistan will

335
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,800
stand with Iran and Israel always

336
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,600
wants to attack Pakistan,

337
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,160
especially on nuclear sites.  So there is

338
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,320
a big possibility that an attack may happen.

339
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,639
But then what about America?  America is

340
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
supporting Pakistan.  Now if

341
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,160
America is supporting Pakistan then

342
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,720
Israel listens to America.  The answer

343
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,360
is no.  America has distanced itself from this.

344
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,680
Israel does not listen to anyone.

345
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
Israel will do whatever it thinks is in its interest.

346
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Infact America

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,360
listens to Israel, friends.  This is true.  And

348
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,040
Israel, Pakistan continuously

349
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,839
spews venom against Israel.  Ok?  He

350
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,199
always keeps on talking a lot.  So Israel

351
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,600
needs a chance.  In fact, he had openly

352
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,279
supported India and said, yes, kill them.

353
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
America did not openly support.

354
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
America is saying the same thing that

355
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,079
now America needs Pakistan's airbases against Iran.

356
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,399
Israel does

357
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,199
not need any airbase.  Ok?  So at this time

358
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,279
Pakistan is in a very bad situation

359
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,240
that if it supports Iran then

360
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,920
America will be angry with it.  If it

361
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,839
supports Iran, America will deal with it in a jiffy

362
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,720
and will not give it any money. And the

363
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,839
direct threat from Israel is looming over Pakistan.

364
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,839
Ok?  that anything can happen.

365
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,440
So this is how geopolitics is working right now.

366
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,440
However, I do not think that

367
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,759
Pakistan will jump directly into the war.   He will

368
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
not jump into the war directly and will

369
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
not be with him either because at this time he too is

370
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,600
saying that we need everyone's support.  But

371
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,120
his support is openly towards Iran.

372
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,040
Ok.  So, this is the complete account.

373
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,000
Look, there is one thing we must not forget.  This war is between

374
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,000
Israel and Iran.  Is it okay?

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
So what we are saying is that if America says so then

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
perhaps Israel will not attack Pakistan.

377
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,120
If something like this happens, it is because

378
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Israel has tried this before.  but it's

379
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
not like that.  I told you that he will do whatever

380
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,199
he feels is right.  And wherever

381
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,040
it feels that those countries which have

382
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
helped Iran till now, Israel has

383
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,600
attacked them.  And

384
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,839
this is why Pakistan does not openly help Iran.

385
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
But everything is behind the scenes.  So it is

386
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
possible that a news may come that look brother,

387
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,360
Israel has bombed their nuclear

388
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,839
site or the place from where help is being given or

389
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,320
from where supplies are being given to Iran.  Big

390
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,320
Possibility.  What do you think?  You please

391
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,199
tell me in the comment box.  But this is if the

392
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,680
war continues for a long time.  Ok?  Very long

393
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,600
and if this war continues for long then it will

394
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,839
become a big problem for everyone.

395
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Everyone whatever is there is for the whole world.  Ok?

396
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,000
So this is the thing.  So I hope I

397
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,919
explained all the geopolitics to you.  Explained everyone's relations.

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
You got it.  What do you

399
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,760
think, please tell me in the comment box.

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,919
