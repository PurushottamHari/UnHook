1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
We're all at the mercy of our own minds.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
But the problem is is that in modern

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,480
life, we're constantly made to feel

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,240
we're not good enough. Something's

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
always missing, and I will be happy or

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040
unhappy if this or that happens to me.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
So, we become prisoners of life. And you

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
learn this the hard way. Yes. When I was

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,160
in a long retreat, cut off from the

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,520
world for 4 years. And memories were

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
coming up from the past. It would build

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,760
into horrific amounts of depression,

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
anxiety, pain. And I jumped over the

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
wall and tried to escape because of what

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,160
happened to me when I was 14. Are you

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,399
comfortable talking about this? Gerong

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
Tupton is a Buddhist monk who spent over

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,360
30 years helping Hollywood stars, CEOs,

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,360
and corporations. Stay in control within

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,239
a world overloaded with stress,

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,879
addiction, anxiety, and burnout. Here we

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
go. I became controlled by distraction,

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,719
controlled by negative thinking. What is

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
life going to do to me next? How will I

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,920
handle it? And things only changed when

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
I hit rock bottom. I had spent so much

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
effort trying to push that suffering

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
away because it's so disgusting and so

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
shameful, but it was just making it

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,199
worse. So many of us run away from pain

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,119
though. But the reality is you can run

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,960
to the end of the earth and that thing

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,880
that has been tormenting you will always

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
trip you up. And so I went back into

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
that retreat knowing the methods are

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
there. I just need to know how to use

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,960
them and I could learn to conquer this.

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
And that's where meditation comes in. Do

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
you think you can teach me? Because I

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
very much feel like I'm on the receiving

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,880
end of life. First of all, chuck all

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,280
those things away. There's a lot of

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
spiritual tat, isn't there? I mean, I

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
said it. I actually hated meditation

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
when I first did it because there's a

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
lot of misconceptions and actually all

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
you're doing is these three things to be

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
less controlled by negative thinking.

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,560
And the beauty of this is that they can

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
show in brain scans. There'll be visible

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
changes in your brain. So, let's try

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
this.

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Listen to my regular listeners. I know

54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
you don't like it when I ask you to

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
subscribe at the start of these

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
conversations. I don't like saying I

57
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
don't like it being in there. None of us

58
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,119
like it. It's frustrating. Do you know

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
what's also frustrating? It's also

60
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,920
frustrating when I go into the back end

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
of the YouTube channel and I see that

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,079
56% of you that listen frequently to

63
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
this podcast haven't yet subscribed. And

64
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
so many of you don't even know that you

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
haven't subscribed because I see in the

66
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
comment section you say to me, you go,

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,719
"I didn't even realize I didn't

68
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
subscribe." And that actually fuels the

69
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,759
show. It's basically like you're making

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
a donation to the show. So that's why I

71
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,040
ask all the time because it enables us

72
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
to build and build and build and build

73
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
and we're going for the long term here.

74
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
So all I'd ask you is if you've seen

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
this show before and you like it, help

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,760
me, help my team here. Hit the subscribe

77
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
button and we'll continue to build this

78
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
show for you. That's my promise. Thank

79
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,879
you to all of you guys that do

80
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,440
subscribe. Means the world to me. Let's

81
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,440
get on with the show.

82
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,680
Galong Tupton,

83
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,519
why is your work more important now than

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
ever before? Why is your message more

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,560
important now than ever before? I think

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,599
uh because we're now living in times

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,480
where we need meditation more than ever

88
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,239
because of the the speeding up of life

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
obviously with technology and the way we

90
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
live and also I think because meditation

91
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,120
has become more widespread there are

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,680
loads of misconceptions about it. So I

93
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
do try to put some effort into kind of

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
clarifying some of those misconceptions.

95
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,319
When you look out into the world

96
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
and you perform your sort of own

97
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
analysis on what the world, the western

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
world is getting right and getting

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,640
wrong, what are some of your sort of big

100
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,800
picture feelings, thoughts and concerns?

101
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,800
Well, the way we are all buried in our

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,959
phones is quite something, isn't it? And

103
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,800
the way we interact with information has

104
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,599
changed so much. So we we are kind of

105
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,360
bombarded or invaded by constant flow of

106
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,720
information which has a lot of

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,440
persuasive undercurrents to it. And this

108
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,760
is affecting our stress levels and also

109
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
affecting our confidence levels. We're

110
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
constantly made to feel we're

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
something's missing. Something's always

112
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
missing. We're not good enough. If you

113
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,599
get this, you'll be okay. I if if and

114
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
when this happens to you, then and only

115
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,840
then can you be happy. So we've kind of

116
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,400
lost our power. We talked a little bit

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
about the word purpose as well. What is

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,280
your perspective on the state of human

119
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,200
purposefulness?

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,120
So I think um this issue around purpose

121
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,439
I think it it is connected to the

122
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,840
breakdown of religion

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,680
in that I would say well I think we'd

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
all say that religion used to be very

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
much the center of the table and it sort

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,360
of gave everybody their a sense of their

127
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,759
place in the universe and the question

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,919
of purpose was never such an issue

129
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,759
because everything was uh in context

130
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
according to one's religious belief and

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
of course now we're in a post-religious

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
culture and it's much more about the

133
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,240
individual and there are good things

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,000
about that of course but what happens

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
then is we become very obsessed with our

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,199
purpose and the word purpose itself

137
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,280
suggests I want something I want what do

138
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,600
I want and in in Buddhism we look at

139
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,880
that wanting mind and see how insatiable

140
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,000
it is and how the more you want the more

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,680
you're going to want and so from a

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Buddhist perspect perspective. We're all

143
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,800
looking for purpose, but maybe

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,199
externally because we get what we want

145
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,840
and then want something else.

146
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,160
And maybe what we're actually looking

147
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,520
for is something deeper within, but we

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,560
don't know how to access it. So, is it

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,680
wrong then to be in search of purpose?

150
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Is it a misguided pursuit?

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,680
No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,960
what's misguided for us is that we are

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,840
obsessed with the idea that happiness

154
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
comes from the outside

155
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,479
and on the other side of the coin

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,639
suffering too. So I will be happy if I

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,360
get this or get that or this situation

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,639
or that situation and I will be unhappy

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,280
if this or that happens to me. So we

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,080
become at the sort of receiving end of

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,000
life. What life is going to do to me

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,880
next. how will I handle it? So, so

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,240
there's there's not much strength there.

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,240
And I think the message of meditation is

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,800
that you become your own purpose and you

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
you become the generator of your own

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,840
experiences because you learn how to

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,960
take hold of your own mind. In this

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
conversation, do you think you can teach

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
me how to do that? Because I very much

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
feel like in my life I'm on the

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
receiving end of life. Well, I'd love to

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,520
show you how or maybe help you to see

174
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,440
that meditation is easier than you

175
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,240
thought or more more applicable to daily

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,400
situations than you thought. When we

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
think about the state of well-being in

178
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,639
the western world, everybody knows these

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,240
stats around suicidality. Um, if we look

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,560
at the US for example, they've slipped

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,680
further in the unhappiness rankings than

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,680
ever before. The US fell to 24th place

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,479
in 2025 in global happiness rankings. In

184
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
2011, the US had been 11th place and now

185
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,280
they're 24th. And the UK followed the

186
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,840
same pattern. The UK dropped to 23rd in

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,960
global happiness rankings, which is its

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,039
lowest position in a long time. But then

189
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,759
more sort of horrifically, the suicide

190
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,000
numbers in the UK, the US are

191
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
tremendously alarming. In the UK,

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,120
suicide has reached its highest level in

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
many many decades.

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,360
Something is going on here. Absolutely.

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,080
So, so we we have developed the most,

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,960
you know, materially comfortable

197
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,479
culture in history. We are materially

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,880
more comfortable than ever and yet

199
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,960
emotionally more uncomfortable. So,

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,039
something hasn't added up. you know

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
we've created a comfortable to a certain

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,680
extent out outer world for oursel and we

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,800
can achieve high levels of material

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,199
comfort and somehow the more of that we

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
have the more emotionally uncomfortable

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,160
and I think this is all to do with the

207
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,080
mechanisms of desire so so when we are

208
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
in a culture that is constantly

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,560
promising us the next piece of enjoyment

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,360
the next hit the next bars the next

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,639
thing we're caught in a sort of cycle of

212
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,319
wanting more I I I was described this

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
the the search for happiness that the

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,680
problem in that is the search itself

215
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,319
because s searching is a habit that will

216
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,720
lead to more searching. So we're always

217
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,680
looking for the next thing. So we get

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,120
what we want. Not always but sometimes.

219
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
And then very soon we want something

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,919
else. So the more we're wanting the more

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,319
we're feeling we don't have. So we end

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,639
up possibly with a lot but feeling quite

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,080
empty inside. And then we're back to

224
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,800
this question. What is my purpose?

225
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,880
What's it all for? I've I I've reached

226
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,719
the the I've reached the the goal I

227
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,479
wanted to reach, but I still feel empty.

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
I still feel something is missing. We're

229
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
told something is missing all the time.

230
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,440
Because to keep a consumer message

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
going, you have to tell people they're

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,959
lacking in something. And the insistency

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
with which that message is fed to us

234
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,839
through our phones basically and through

235
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,640
through the the media that we consume is

236
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
going to affect us. I think 90% of

237
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
people listening right now would say

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
that their meaning in life comes from

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,000
the pursuit of something, the journey

240
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,360
towards something. It might not come

241
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
from the attainment of it, being

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
successful, being on the podium, but

243
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
they would say that the the meaning they

244
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,440
experience, the joy, the thing that gets

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
them out of bed is in the pursuit of

246
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,720
something, whether it's building a

247
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,839
business or, I don't know, becoming an

248
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,560
athlete or building a charity.

249
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,480
Are they misguided in that thought? No,

250
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,360
it's just that we we we could look

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,160
deeper into our own internal psychology

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
and see how well the the word pursuit is

253
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,279
everything. So, we're always in pursuit

254
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,839
of something. And the the the the

255
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,560
chemistry of of our body in the state of

256
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,160
pursuit is that chemical dopamine. The

257
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
interesting thing about dopamine is it

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,360
falls away just before you get what you

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
want. So, so the the chase is much more

260
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
exciting than the having or the getting.

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
And so we're in locked into this

262
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,320
constant chase and what is the next

263
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,880
thing? When will I get the next thing?

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,360
And I think the the reason why we feel

265
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,320
so sort of empty or disappointed is

266
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,880
because what we get is never enough. And

267
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,920
meditation comes into this conversation

268
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,680
to to show us that actually what we were

269
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
looking for

270
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,279
was already there inside.

271
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,279
That's the key point.

272
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
What were we looking for? We were

273
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,760
looking for freedom.

274
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,320
If you if you think about how it feels

275
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
when you get what you want,

276
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
you know, there's the chasing, the

277
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,120
wanting, and then there's the getting.

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,120
There's a kind of relief, isn't there?

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,640
It it's it's a feeling of, oh, the

280
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
wanting's gone away. It's like hunger.

281
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
You feel hungry, you eat a sandwich, the

282
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,760
hunger's gone away. I mean that's a

283
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,920
metaphor for everything and that you

284
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,720
when you get what you want there's this

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,200
relief the the the the the wanting the

286
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,640
the the the needy feeling the oh when

287
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,839
will I get it has gone and there's a

288
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,519
relief so actually what what we're well

289
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
momentarily and then it kicks in again

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,399
we're looking for the next thing but

291
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,920
what we're looking for is the absence of

292
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
wanting

293
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
that's the the happiness we achieve when

294
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
we get what we want is a kind of freedom

295
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,320
from wanting so the problem is is that

296
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
we're caught in a cycle where we then

297
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
just want something else.

298
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
So, I'm not suggesting let's all go and

299
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,320
sit on a mountaintop and meditate and

300
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,720
not have lives and not have careers. Not

301
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,519
at all. I'm simply suggesting that we've

302
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,240
put our focus very strongly on material

303
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,480
things. And I think there needs to be

304
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
also a focus on the mind and I think

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
that's how we can learn to free

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,760
ourselves.

307
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,839
You learned this the hard way through

308
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,279
your own experiences.

309
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,959
Can you talk to me about how you learned

310
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,920
these lessons? Well, I definitely became

311
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,560
a monk through extreme suffering. I

312
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,480
wouldn't describe myself as having been

313
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,600
a kind of, you know, a spiritual seeker

314
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,920
and I went to a monastery with a kind of

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
open glowing heart wanting to find the

316
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,480
answers. I went to a monastery in a

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,880
completely broken state because I had

318
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,920
been living uh in this kind of ambition

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,959
cycle wanting wanting wanting and and

320
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,160
really uh not looking after myself. I

321
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,920
had a very uh self-loathing and unhappy

322
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,399
mind, a lot of depression, a lot of

323
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,959
anxiety. And

324
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,519
I was um I went to that monastery

325
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
feeling completely at rock bottom. And I

326
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,680
I didn't go to a monastery to live there

327
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,120
forever. I just kind of dipped my toe

328
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,040
in. But you know, I stayed. If I was a

329
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
fly on the wall in your life on that day

330
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,639
when you showed up at that monastery,

331
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
what would I have seen?

332
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,839
So I was very ill and I arrived at the

333
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,399
monastery um really needing help. So I

334
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,079
was I was living in London and New York.

335
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
I was trying to become an actor. My

336
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
mother's an actor so I sort of wanted to

337
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,800
follow in her footsteps. And I got into

338
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,440
a really kind of dangerous kind of party

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,519
lifestyle, really wild and burning the

340
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,800
candle at both ends. I basically made

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,279
myself ill. I had a very very dramatic

342
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,880
burnout living in Brooklyn and waking up

343
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
one morning in my apartment thinking I

344
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,880
was having a heart attack. Um, I went to

345
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
I had didn't have medical insurance, but

346
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,519
I managed to find some kind of like

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
cheap ECG place and they checked my

348
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,040
heart out and they said, "You you have a

349
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,639
heart condition. What have you been

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,040
doing?" And you know, I really was had

351
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,519
to stop in my tracks and I was very very

352
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,279
ill after that for a few months. What

353
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,800
age was this? 21. Wow. And during that

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,320
time of being horrendously ill, I had to

355
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,880
question everything I was doing with my

356
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,920
life. But that illness is a symptom.

357
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,639
It's a symptom of of unhealthy living,

358
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,240
but also an unhealthy relationship with

359
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
my own mind. And where did that

360
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,440
unhealthy relationship with your own

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,480
mind stem from?

362
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,839
So I think things that that happened in

363
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,720
my early life uh traumatic things,

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,399
difficult things uh and then me not

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,959
knowing how to deal with those and just

366
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,440
bottling them up and pushing through,

367
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,240
pushing forward and not looking at

368
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,760
myself. I had this very sort of escapist

369
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
way about myself. I think that's what

370
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,920
all the partying was about to kind of

371
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,680
get out of my head. And so, so when I

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,600
had that burnout, I think it was a

373
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,160
combination of physical stress and

374
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,360
mental stress that just exploded very,

375
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,519
very suddenly, literally overnight.

376
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,959
Did you have an abusive childhood?

377
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,320
Because I was I was reading some of the

378
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,600
things that you had said and it

379
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,519
suggested to me that there was things

380
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,560
that happened when you were young that

381
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,000
left imprints on you that you had to

382
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,839
work through. Yeah. Yeah. I I would say

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
things happened in my teens that were

384
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,480
troubling. You know, when I was uh when

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,880
I was quite like 13, 14, I started to

386
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
run with a much older crowd. So, I had a

387
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,959
kind of double life. I was I was at

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,839
school and very studious and very quiet.

389
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:05,120
And then outside school, I was in a rock

390
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,079
band with much older people. Um, when I

391
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,880
was 14, I started to actually work as a

392
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,160
jazz pianist in wine bars across London,

393
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,079
pretending I was 21. And the the people

394
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,760
I was running with at that time were

395
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,320
much much older than me. And um, yeah,

396
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,720
there there there were some situations

397
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,279
where the relationships turned, I would

398
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,920
say, abusive. And I I would say I was a

399
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,360
victim of at the time maybe I thought I

400
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,680
knew knew what I was doing, but looking

401
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,880
back, definitely not. And I think that

402
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,560
left imprints and I think it made me um

403
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
frightened of myself and frightened of

404
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,760
other people. Are you comfortable

405
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,600
talking about this? Yeah. Was this

406
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,600
sexual abuse? Yeah. From from uh from

407
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
one of the people I was in in a band

408
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
with. Yeah.

409
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,639
And when you think when you sort of

410
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,720
trace the steps of the behavior that you

411
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,160
then saw in your early 20s, the sort of

412
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,199
escapist behavior, the sort of

413
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,079
self-medicating behavior, is is that the

414
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,920
cont is that where that originated from

415
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,600
the sort of processing of that and the

416
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
dealing with those? It's really hard to

417
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
make a very specific direct connection,

418
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,399
isn't it? And that's what we always want

419
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,880
to do. We want to say this happened

420
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
because of this and there's this, you

421
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
know, this happened and therefore I went

422
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
off the rails. In a way that's too easy

423
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
because I think there's a mixture of

424
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,600
many many elements that can send one off

425
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
the rails. You know my parents are are

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
incredibly loving people. I mean they

427
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
really loved me and brought me up very

428
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,839
well but they they split up very very

429
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,519
suddenly when I was 17. My my dad

430
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,000
literally ran off with one of my mom's

431
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,839
friends and it was a a very huge

432
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
explosion in the family and we were all

433
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,759
very broken by it. And so there are many

434
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
many things, many factors that came

435
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
together in my teenage years that I

436
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,120
think sent me off the rails. I got into

437
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,360
uh Oxford University and that was a big

438
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,360
prestigious thing, but I fell apart in

439
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,480
Oxford. I started to get horrendously

440
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,920
depressed and I actually got expelled.

441
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,440
It's actually quite hard to get expelled

442
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,880
from Oxford. I didn't I've never met

443
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
anyone that got expelled. Exactly. My

444
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
mother was delighted. She said, "Oh,

445
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,559
that's like Lord Byron, Shel, those are,

446
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
you know, very hard to get thrown out of

447
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,839
Oxford. you have to, you know, do

448
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,640
something pretty horrendous. But I think

449
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,679
in my case, they they threw me out

450
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,199
because I was just not functional. And

451
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,959
that then just led to my demise. And

452
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,439
then on the one hand, I was started

453
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,080
acting and being in plays and and having

454
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,919
this kind of um almost like a glamorous

455
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,200
persona and on the other hand crumbling

456
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,000
inside. I had this incredibly persistent

457
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,600
monologue of self- disgust,

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
you know, like like a voice in the head

459
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,880
that says, "You are disgusting.

460
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,640
You are no good. You are a failure." I

461
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
used to call it my devil voice, but but

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,679
it it it's obviously part of me. And and

463
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,400
that's something that later on when I

464
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,160
started to do retreats became incredibly

465
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,039
loud in my head. And I had to work hard

466
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,520
on meditation to help not to get rid of

467
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,840
that but to integrate it and and learn

468
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,240
to be at peace with it. It's definitely,

469
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,679
you know, it's gone away now. Where does

470
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
that voice originate from? You're not

471
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
the first person that I've sat with here

472
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
who's talked to me about a similar voice

473
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,039
in their mind. And I'm wondering is that

474
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
a is that something from we inherit from

475
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,000
our environment? uh something that

476
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
happens, a culmination of things that

477
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
happen. Is it genetic or is it all of

478
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
the above? It's many things because

479
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,400
that's very specific. It's many things.

480
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,080
And it's I think in my case it was

481
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,919
because I became very good at

482
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,720
suppressing my suffering because I

483
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,280
became very proficient at pushing things

484
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
down and just going to as many parties

485
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,520
as possible and and trying not to

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,000
suffer. I think the when you push

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,160
something down, the kind of volcano

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,080
effect happens and then this sort of

489
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,320
angry voice comes up. This this this uh

490
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,400
pressure leads to a kind of backlash

491
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,120
inside yourself and it's an internalized

492
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,440
um anger that also is is fed to us from

493
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,799
our environment. Absolutely.

494
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,360
So you arrive at the monastery. Yeah.

495
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,320
Who told you to go to a monastery? So,

496
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,640
my oldest childhood friend, Tara, uh we

497
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,240
grew up together and um when I was

498
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
completely falling apart with this heart

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
condition at 21, she basically scooped

500
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,960
me up and took me to the monastery.

501
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,919
She's the one who told me. She said,

502
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,840
"Oh, there's a monastery in Scotland

503
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
which it's called Samuel Ling. It's a

504
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,919
Tibetan Buddhist monastery, and for the

505
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,799
first time ever, they've opened their

506
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,400
doors to people who wanting to be monks

507
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,760
for a year.

508
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,000
one year and so she she said let's go

509
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
and do it this could she wanted to do it

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,559
too but she said this could really help

511
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,799
you so she basically pretty much carried

512
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,400
me there what were you saying to her

513
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,320
when she asked you how you were doing or

514
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
what your symptoms were I was lying in

515
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,720
bed with with horrendous heart

516
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,039
palpitations and any move I made my body

517
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,880
would be bathed in sweat I mean on we we

518
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,880
were in California because I got sick in

519
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
New York I managed to get to California

520
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,280
where my mother was living and Tara was

521
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,120
there and they looked after me. And then

522
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
literally flying back to the UK, I had

523
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
to lie down on the plane. She was almost

524
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,039
carrying me. It was really really heavy.

525
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,760
But she she said, "Look, this place

526
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,760
could help you. It's just a year. It's

527
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
just a year out of your life." I I I I

528
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,200
thought, "Okay, I'm going to do that and

529
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
then I'll go back to New York." I almost

530
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
sublet my apartment in New York, but I

531
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
didn't in the end. But there there

532
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,919
definitely was a feeling in me of,

533
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
"Okay, I'm going to go to this Buddhist

534
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,919
retreat, get myself straightened out,

535
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,039
and then go back to what I was doing

536
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,640
before.

537
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,440
So, it didn't feel too outrageous

538
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,679
because it was only a year. Of course,

539
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,000
it wasn't a year. This is 30 years

540
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,840
later. I'm still there. Wow.

541
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,400
And to give people like me who don't

542
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,360
understand what happens in a monastery a

543
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,240
picture into the what I would describe

544
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,000
as incredible dedication and sacrifice

545
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,039
that you've gone through over those 30

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,120
years. Can you can you share some of the

547
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,559
practical things that you've done in

548
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,679
those 30 years that most people would

549
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,440
think of as being just outrageous? But

550
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,120
do you know what? You say sacrifice, but

551
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
to me it didn't feel like a sacrifice.

552
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,919
It felt like immediate relief because I

553
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,480
Yes. When you become a monk, you you

554
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
take vows to give up things, certain

555
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
things, but the things I was giving up

556
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
were the things that made me ill. So you

557
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,520
you know you're giving up uh intoxicants

558
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,440
and you become celibate and you uh I

559
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
mean the there are also kind of moral

560
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,760
vows such as you give up telling lies

561
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,440
and stealing and harming others. These

562
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
are all you know good principles to

563
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,880
follow. But I suppose the two major

564
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,200
things are no intoxicants and celibacy.

565
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
And to me that was such a relief to to

566
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
just kind of give all of that up and be

567
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,960
in almost like kind of like a rehab

568
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,760
situation. And but I I have to emphasize

569
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
it didn't feel too heavy because I

570
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,760
thought it was only going to be for a

571
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,880
year. So celibacy is sex giving them

572
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,480
sex. Yes. Yeah. And and what I found is

573
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
that you actually develop stronger

574
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,039
relationships. So people often think

575
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
monks must be very lonely. But what I

576
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,520
found was that then you were in a

577
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,480
community of people where the the sexual

578
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,200
um chemistry is off the agenda. So you

579
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,600
start having friendships that really are

580
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,440
so heartbased and you meet lots of

581
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,520
people who are on the same path as you.

582
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,440
So I didn't feel lonely at all. What is

583
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,440
it about sex that is

584
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
maybe a distraction, but what is it that

585
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,520
puts on the list? It's not it's not to

586
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,919
say that that sex is wrong or evil or

587
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,320
bad. It's not a sort of uh weird sort of

588
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,679
moralistic anti-ex thing at all. It's

589
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,919
simply about where you're putting your

590
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,640
focus. So when you're when you're a

591
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,240
monk, you're giving up family life,

592
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
you're giving up sexual relationships,

593
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,559
you're giving up romance, you're giving

594
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,679
up all of that so that you can focus

595
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,559
very intent intensely on meditation

596
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
practice with the purpose that you can

597
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
eventually help others. It's not a

598
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,679
selfish thing is you're doing this so

599
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,159
that you can be of more benefit to

600
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,280
others. But you want no distractions.

601
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,200
And also you you at a deeper level, you

602
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,559
want to start to experiment with what

603
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,880
happens when you don't immediately run

604
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,200
after a desire.

605
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,120
You start to experiment with trying to

606
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
not suppress your desire because that's

607
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,520
incredibly unhealthy, but watch your

608
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,480
desire and observe it and find out that

609
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,000
you are more than your desire.

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,960
And so celibacy is an amazing

611
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,559
environment to start doing that work.

612
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,080
And that also means no masturbation and

613
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,440
those kinds of things. Yeah. I mean it's

614
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,600
it's really about working with desire

615
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,760
rather than just when I say working with

616
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,039
I mean ex observing it and learning ways

617
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,640
to transform it rather than just giving

618
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,720
into it or suppressing it. And

619
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,679
I wouldn't say celibacy is for everybody

620
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,320
but it suits a certain type of person.

621
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,880
Mhm. And you know in Buddhism in general

622
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,480
there are in in in

623
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,840
the UK or America there's you know

624
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
thousands and thousands and thousands of

625
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Buddhists but maybe a small handful of

626
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
monks who become celibate. It's a very

627
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,240
specific particular way to practice

628
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
Buddhism. It's not the only way. I'm

629
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
inquiring about this subject because

630
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,000
it's actually because of a conversation

631
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
I was having with a really good friend

632
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,200
of mine over New Year's who's had some

633
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
troubles in his life. um has struggled

634
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
in relationships, has struggled

635
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,760
professionally, has also struggled a

636
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
little bit with purpose and meaning and

637
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,360
has now sort of started to investigate

638
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,000
religion. And one of the things he said

639
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,000
to me because there's a particular

640
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
strangle hold that his sexual desires

641
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
has over him is that he was thinking

642
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,039
about abstaining from masturbation and

643
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,360
sex just for a short period of time. And

644
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
I think actually the reason for that is

645
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,400
kind of what you've described there,

646
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,360
which is just to try and separate get

647
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,279
back control from desire. He'll need to

648
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,919
meditate

649
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,840
because just abstaining from the thing

650
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,000
you want to the thing you're desperate

651
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,880
to do and you're abstaining almost like

652
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,480
locking yourself in a cage and saying I

653
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,760
won't I won't do that thing then what

654
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,320
are you replacing it with or so so for

655
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,360
example when I work in you know I often

656
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,279
teach meditation in drug rehab centers I

657
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,360
talk a lot about how okay yes you've had

658
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,919
to give up the drug that was making you

659
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,640
ill. But that's not the whole story. The

660
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,320
the rest of the story is what are you

661
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
going to do about the mind that is

662
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,320
addicted to that substance and how are

663
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,640
you going to resolve that? How are you

664
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,080
going to fill the the hole inside that

665
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,320
was craving something? Okay. So, with

666
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,559
the meditation, you're not just giving

667
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,840
up something. You're learning to fill

668
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,000
your fill your own spirit with something

669
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,679
more positive for yourself almost to

670
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,679
heal from the thing that was had the

671
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,600
desire. Yeah. Yeah. Desire is such an

672
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,159
interesting thing because it's we think

673
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,320
we want something. But what's going on

674
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,240
under the desire is a feeling of lack, a

675
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,440
feeling of hopelessness, a feeling I

676
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,720
don't have. There's something missing.

677
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,520
And so meditation is about filling that

678
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,279
with with light and with with love. You

679
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,640
know, the deepest addiction we all have

680
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,799
is the addiction to our own thoughts.

681
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,440
that that's the that's really the root

682
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,120
of it all is that a wanting thought

683
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,919
arises in the my mind and then I jump on

684
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,240
it and I want to get something to kind

685
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,080
of alleviate that. But it's that

686
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,559
internal attachment. Buddhism talks a

687
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,400
lot about non-attachment and I think

688
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,760
this is widely misunderstood. People

689
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
think it means you're supposed to be,

690
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
you know, detached and have no friends

691
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,520
and be unattached. It doesn't mean that

692
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,159
at all. It means how we're so attached

693
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,080
to our thoughts and our emotions and

694
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,600
they get into the driving seat and send

695
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,679
our life in all kinds of directions we

696
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,640
don't want it to go in. How do we learn

697
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,400
to transform that inner attachment to

698
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,360
the thought itself? And that's obviously

699
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,799
where meditation comes in.

700
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's talk about Buddhism then. So I

701
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,679
said to you before we started recording

702
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
that in the last sort of 12 months or so

703
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
I've got really interested in Buddhism.

704
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,159
I uh started reading some books about

705
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,200
Buddhism and I find it to be most

706
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,440
aligned with this sounds like a strange

707
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,279
thing to say but I'm gonna say it anyway

708
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
with almost like the medication that I

709
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,279
need.

710
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,440
And I know it's not a medication but but

711
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,720
it is a deep medicine. It's a medicine.

712
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,799
It's a science to me. It's not so much a

713
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,840
religion. It is more of a medicine or a

714
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,080
science. Yeah. I've struggled with the

715
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,000
religions. I I was Christian growing up,

716
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,919
but I've struggled with like deities and

717
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
gods and these kinds of things because

718
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,880
there's like 5,000 different gods that

719
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,400
through history, so I don't really know

720
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,679
which one's real and there's lots of

721
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,159
books and I'm still on that journey, but

722
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,600
when I found Buddhism, it wasn't framed

723
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,919
like the other religions. I thought it

724
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,000
was much more compelling. What is

725
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,840
Buddhism? Can you tell me where it's

726
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,080
come from? Is it a religion? Is there a

727
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,159
god? Do I have to worship? Do I go to

728
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,520
hell, heaven? There's there's nothing to

729
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,679
worship at all. Buddhism is a path to to

730
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,080
um inner internal understanding. The

731
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,799
word Buddha means awake. And yes,

732
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
Buddhism has a his history in that there

733
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,480
was somebody called the Buddha in India

734
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,279
2,500 years ago who attained awakening

735
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
and gave teachings and Buddhism you

736
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,279
could call it that has come from there.

737
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,120
But actually this word Buddhism is a

738
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,799
modern word ism. It's a modern word.

739
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,159
Well, in the original languages of

740
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,799
Buddhism such as Sanskrit and Tibetan,

741
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,080
you find terms that are so different

742
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:46,080
from religion. You find terms such as

743
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,440
the science of awareness or the the um

744
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,159
the examination of awakening, the inner

745
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,720
inner awareness. It's a path of mental

746
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,120
discovery. It's a science. So, it's not

747
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,360
a religion per se. Technically, it is.

748
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,880
If you define a religion as a group

749
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
spiritual purpose and there are

750
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,159
monasteries, there are organizationals

751
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,880
within Buddhism. But it also defies most

752
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,279
categorizations around religion-

753
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,039
because it doesn't believe in a creator.

754
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,279
It doesn't believe in somebody to

755
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,919
worship. It it's really about the power

756
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,000
of your own mind. And is there a hell

757
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,120
and a heaven in Buddhism? They talk

758
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
about hell and heaven as um uh states of

759
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,159
mind. They talk about everything as a

760
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
state of mind. They say this is a state

761
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,120
of mind. Buddhism is very much about

762
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,679
exploring the the fabric of reality. Th

763
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,960
this table, this body, this this

764
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,159
so-called self, ideas of hell, heaven,

765
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,919
they say these are all mental

766
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,480
experiences. Everything is mind

767
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,480
according to Buddhism.

768
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,159
So you get to the monastery. Yeah.

769
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,760
Talk to me about your journey of

770
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
healing.

771
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,120
So I was quite ill for a while in the

772
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,440
monastery and they kind of left me

773
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,039
alone. They they let me rest a lot. I

774
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,520
did little light little bits of light

775
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,200
work around the monastery. Started to

776
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,279
meditate. Um

777
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,120
you know I I actually hated meditation

778
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,600
when I first did it. This was a problem.

779
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,440
You know I I believed in it. I grew up

780
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,679
in a Buddhist family. There's been this

781
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,360
kind of faith in Buddhism as I grew up.

782
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,000
But I never actually did anything. I

783
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,080
never I never meditated. Then I get to a

784
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,240
monastery, I become a monk and read the

785
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,440
small print. You know, you got to

786
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
meditate. And I hated it. I really

787
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,960
really hated it. And I thought, oh, the

788
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
what am I going to do? I really don't

789
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,080
enjoy this at all. I find it an enormous

790
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,080
struggle. So I struggled a lot with

791
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,279
meditation in those early days, days,

792
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,840
weeks, months even. Why did you hate it?

793
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,039
I hated it because

794
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,279
I was doing it in a way that was making

795
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,399
me more stressed.

796
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,200
I would sit down. I I thought that

797
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,440
meditation is about clearing the mind.

798
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I'd heard this phrase, clear your mind.

799
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,080
I thought that's what you do. So, I sat

800
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,159
there trying to clear my mind. And the

801
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,960
more I tried to clear my mind, the

802
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,360
louder it was was shouting.

803
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
And that particularly that negative

804
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,360
voice I told you about that you are no

805
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,279
good, you're rubbish, you're you're

806
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,760
awful, you'll fail. That became louder

807
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,279
and louder. And so the meditation became

808
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,760
incredibly stressful because I thought I

809
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,480
I can't do this. I can't I can't get get

810
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,080
rid of my thoughts. Of course, now since

811
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,520
now I've discovered it's nothing to do

812
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,240
with clearing the mind. But because I

813
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,480
thought it was, I struggled enormously.

814
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,919
What is it then? It's nothing to do with

815
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,600
clearing the mind. It's not about

816
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,480
putting yourself in an unconscious state

817
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,000
at all. It's about working with your

818
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,600
mind. So, it's about learning how to be

819
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,399
less

820
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,000
controlled by your mind,

821
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,360
but it's not about getting rid of the

822
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,600
thoughts. In fact, the thoughts are

823
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,600
quite helpful.

824
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,240
You know, they actually help you to

825
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
meditate. You see, what I was doing in

826
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,519
those early days was I thought, okay,

827
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,880
just sit down and just push everything

828
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,640
away and go into the kind of zen state.

829
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
And of course, that's just like

830
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,919
suppression, isn't it? You're just

831
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
trying to suppress. You're trying to

832
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,960
push.

833
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
It's like it's like trying to get a

834
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,039
small child to sit still in in their

835
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,000
high chair while you're feeding them.

836
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,200
They're going to, you know, they're

837
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,159
going to want to move around. So, it's

838
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
not about that pushing away of thoughts.

839
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,240
I mean, you've got to ask yourself if if

840
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,159
that was the aim, well, why why would it

841
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
be the aim? Imagine if you could clear

842
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,080
your mind.

843
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,919
So, what? You have 10 minutes of just

844
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,799
being blank

845
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,679
and then you carry on with your day.

846
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,919
Where's the Where's the journey? What

847
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
What journey is that? You just passed

848
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,039
out on the floor for 10 minutes. Might

849
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,440
as well as sleep or something. Yeah.

850
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,120
Yeah. And I can fully understand that if

851
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,200
if you're if you're really stirred up

852
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,360
and miserable and stressed, the idea of

853
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,080
10 minutes of switching it off would be

854
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,399
great. But it's not the solution. It

855
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,399
doesn't work. what is the solution? So,

856
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,679
so it is definitely about changing your

857
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,919
relationship with your thoughts. So,

858
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,960
okay. So, a typical meditation practice

859
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,120
is you sit and you focus on your

860
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,919
breathing. It's it's different from

861
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,039
breath work. You're not breathing in a

862
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,399
particular way. You're not trying to

863
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,559
breathe slowly, deeply, or anything.

864
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
You're just breathing normally. You

865
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,039
know, just let the breath do its own

866
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,679
thing and you're focused on it.

867
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,480
So on paper that sounds really clear and

868
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,519
clean and simple. Focus on your breath.

869
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,159
The reality is it's really messy because

870
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,360
you focus on your breath and within a

871
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,159
few seconds you're thinking about

872
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,360
shopping lists or food or sex or

873
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,840
anything. You know the mind just goes.

874
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,360
That's when the work starts because at

875
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,279
some point you realize your mind has

876
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,120
wondered.

877
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,880
Okay. That's when many people think they

878
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,080
failed. You know they were they were

879
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,440
meditating. and they were with the

880
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,039
breath and then they realize they're

881
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,600
thinking about emails they need to write

882
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,919
or shopping or whatever and then they

883
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,440
think, "Oh, I'm I'm a failure." And they

884
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,879
very angrily bring themselves back to

885
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,960
the breath. That's just going to make

886
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,639
you more stressed

887
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,800
because you're actually training in in

888
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,800
feeling like a failure. You know what I

889
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,639
mean? So, so you can relate. I mean, it

890
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,320
takes me 7 seconds to drift off when I'm

891
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,119
trying to meditate. So, it's not that at

892
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,879
all. It it's that you you're with the

893
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,560
breath

894
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,159
and then your mind wanders. It's not

895
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,679
even that you see your mind wandering.

896
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,000
You kind of find out afterwards, don't

897
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,639
you? It's not It's not like I'm with the

898
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
breath and I can see my mind step away

899
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
from the breath and then go to a

900
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,079
thought. It's more that I'm with my

901
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,399
breath. I pass out and I wake up the

902
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,879
other side of town. Yeah, that is the

903
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,359
meditation. Waking up inside your

904
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,119
thoughts. That is the definition of

905
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,200
meditation. So, you haven't failed at

906
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,720
all. You are meditating because what

907
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,760
happened was you were with the breath

908
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,920
you got lost you lost your mind and then

909
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,240
you found your mind again because you're

910
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,079
back you suddenly realize oh where was I

911
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,599
am supposed to be meditating so that is

912
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,320
meditation you're back with your

913
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,720
awareness and then you gently bring

914
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
yourself back to the breath and actually

915
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,920
all you're doing is those three things

916
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,240
throughout the session either you're

917
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,839
with the breath or you're noticing that

918
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,640
you got lost or you're returning

919
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,200
and it's that that returning

920
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,800
that makes you strong.

921
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,760
Every time you return to the breath, you

922
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,280
you are making a very powerful decision.

923
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,880
That's the attachment or the addiction

924
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,200
to the thoughts. The mind was lost in

925
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,720
those thoughts and you are recapturing

926
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,760
your attention and bringing it back. So,

927
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,520
you are choosing where to send your

928
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,920
mind.

929
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,599
And if you do this like an exercise,

930
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,359
almost like going to the gym and getting

931
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,040
strong day after day, week after week,

932
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,680
you you're you're teaching yourself how

933
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,839
to choose to be happy and how to choose

934
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,119
not to suffer.

935
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,200
So it such a simple technique on paper,

936
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,079
you know, focus on your breath, come

937
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,400
back when you get lost,

938
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,119
is actually

939
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,720
profoundly transformative

940
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,000
psychologically

941
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,520
because I think most people listening to

942
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,760
this assume that they're kind of

943
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,079
strapped to their thoughts and their

944
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,440
thoughts are the car driving wherever it

945
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,119
wants to go and we're just strapped to

946
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,640
the back of it, our ankles tied to the

947
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,160
back of it with a piece of rope. Yeah.

948
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Absolutely. And we just kind of suffer

949
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,160
consequences. hijacked by our thoughts.

950
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,320
Yeah. Hijacked is a great great you know

951
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,720
it stormed the like pilot's cabin and

952
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,320
it's flying us. Exactly. Wherever it

953
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,920
wants to go. Exactly. That's kind of the

954
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,760
experience we have. So then you

955
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,240
meditation puts you behind the wheel of

956
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,200
the car. Most people haven't had the

957
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,839
experience you've had training yourself

958
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,760
to sort of disassociate or realize that

959
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,880
you're not your thoughts. So, as someone

960
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
that's on the other side of this

961
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,280
practice,

962
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,280
how can you persuade me that my life

963
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,040
will be better if I listen to this?

964
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,359
Like, what's the before and after, I

965
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,599
guess, for you? So, I don't think

966
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,119
everybody has to join a monastery and do

967
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,240
extreme retreats and the kind of things

968
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,119
I do. It maybe that's my my kind of

969
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,960
extreme nature. I I have so many friends

970
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,520
who meditate while they have families

971
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,280
and busy jobs and they they do 15

972
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,119
minutes a day or twice a day or

973
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,480
whatever. It can absolutely be done in

974
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,160
anybody's lifestyle. But the whole point

975
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,560
is that you are learning to find your

976
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,760
own inner freedom. You're learning to

977
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,440
how to discover that you you are bigger

978
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,920
than the pain and suffering that seems

979
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,520
to drive your life. Because what what I

980
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
described earlier with the coming back

981
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,800
to the breath is is that first stage of

982
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,440
learning to gain a bit more power around

983
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,400
what your mind is doing. And then what

984
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,560
is so interesting is when you start to

985
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:54,160
think about okay when when I'm unhappy

986
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,880
or when I'm angry or whatever

987
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,839
if I am observing myself being unhappy

988
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,480
is the observer unhappy

989
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:05,520
is the is the observer angry and if I

990
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,359
feel angry and I know I'm angry the part

991
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,160
of my mind that's looking at the anger

992
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,440
cannot be angry because it's seeing the

993
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,280
anger. So, so in Buddhism they they they

994
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,480
use a metaphor to describe this which is

995
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,000
the sky and the clouds. The clouds can

996
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,440
be heavy and rainy and all of that but

997
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
the sky is always bigger than the

998
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,680
clouds. So our awareness of our minds

999
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,160
that that's where we can find our

1000
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,760
freedom. And when we talk about seeking

1001
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,520
purpose and seeking what are we looking

1002
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,760
for in life, I think that's what we're

1003
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,160
looking for all the time in everything

1004
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,839
we do. Whether it be big life goals or,

1005
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,760
you know, drinking a cup of coffee or

1006
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,320
water, small moments, in every moment,

1007
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,040
we're looking for release or freedom. We

1008
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,200
think we're looking to feel happy or we

1009
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,079
think we're looking for love or sex or

1010
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,760
or whatever it is. But I think what

1011
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,640
we're really looking for is to free

1012
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,599
ourselves from from suffering and to

1013
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,400
free ourselves from need and to to be

1014
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,400
free to be more in touch with who we

1015
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
really are. I think that's what we're

1016
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,720
looking for. And when when you meditate

1017
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,960
and you step back and look at your mind,

1018
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,520
that observational

1019
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,000
aspect is is key.

1020
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,040
to become the sky. Yeah. To become the

1021
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,599
sky rather rather than the clouds. And

1022
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,920
then I think it can change your life

1023
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,920
because

1024
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,520
you you know when I first met my teacher

1025
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,760
he he was quite a straight talking

1026
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,880
person. He he would he he wouldn't you

1027
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,720
know say much and what he said was often

1028
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,480
could be sound sound a little bit harsh

1029
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,079
but he said it with love. And when I

1030
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,520
first met him, I'd go on about all the

1031
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,839
stuff that was happening with me or had

1032
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,280
happened with me or to me. And he just

1033
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,960
says, "Stop taking yourself so

1034
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,119
seriously."

1035
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,480
And initially that could sound like a

1036
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,520
slap in the face. I mean, imagine if you

1037
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,880
went to a therapist and they said, "What

1038
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,400
you've been through is peanuts. You

1039
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,920
know, stop taking yourself seriously."

1040
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,480
But he didn't mean it like that. What he

1041
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,119
meant was stop clinging to a kind of

1042
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,440
solidity. Stop making your your thoughts

1043
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,920
and feelings and your past and make it

1044
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,920
so solid. make try to be the sky instead

1045
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,400
of the clouds. Try to step back and be

1046
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,640
less solid about everything. Buddhism is

1047
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
very much into this

1048
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,119
notion that they call emptiness which

1049
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,480
isn't emptiness in terms of a kind of

1050
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,240
vacuous void but more that things are

1051
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,160
illusurary things aren't as real and

1052
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,400
solid and heavy as we think they are.

1053
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,480
And I think meditation can help us to

1054
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,040
think more in that way and find more

1055
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,040
happiness. real happiness not not the

1056
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,960
happiness that depends on I will be

1057
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,200
happy if I will be happy when I can only

1058
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,200
be happy because that's a very limited

1059
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,839
happiness but imagine if you could be

1060
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,839
happy no matter what is that what

1061
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,920
Buddhism helps us to do I think Buddhism

1062
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,560
is about freedom and I think freedom is

1063
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,720
happy no matter what and I think but

1064
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,440
more than that I think it's also about

1065
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,960
compassion I the way I'm describing it

1066
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,040
could sound like this is all just about

1067
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,880
one's own personal development and

1068
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,160
freeing oneself and becoming happier.

1069
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,560
But the key point is we're living in a

1070
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,560
connection, a world of connection. And

1071
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
how can we genuinely help others? I

1072
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,760
think through freeing our minds and

1073
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,160
helping others to do the same. Can I be

1074
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,119
in that state of mind where I am the sky

1075
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,839
while also being incredibly effective in

1076
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,280
my job as a CEO? Yeah, I think this is

1077
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,960
this is possibly one of the

1078
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,640
misconceptions. You know this is

1079
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,280
something I came across quite early on

1080
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,680
in when I was teaching meditation. I

1081
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,720
started to give talks about meditation

1082
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,119
in the workplace like 25 years ago. So

1083
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,920
before it became very popular. You now

1084
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,000
mindfulness is everywhere in in the

1085
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,280
corporate world. But when I started it

1086
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,960
was quite unusual. And I did come across

1087
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,440
a lot of misconceptions. The funniest

1088
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,599
one was before I went into a boardroom

1089
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,359
to talk to the the people in there about

1090
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:00,000
meditation, their CEO took me to side

1091
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,240
and he said, "Um, please don't make them

1092
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,359
too relaxed."

1093
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,599
I said, "What do you mean?" He said,

1094
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,079
"Well, I I like what you do, but I don't

1095
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,400
want them to become too relaxed." I

1096
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,119
said, "I'm not I'm not some kind of like

1097
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,720
stage hypnotist. I'm not going to walk

1098
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,319
into there and sort of, you know, put

1099
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,040
everyone into a trance. That's that's

1100
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,640
not what I do. But it was such an

1101
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,760
interesting conversation because it made

1102
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,200
me see that his view of meditation is

1103
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,160
that you would become this kind of

1104
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,720
spaced out, happy with everything, don't

1105
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,480
care, and you'd lose your drive. And

1106
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,240
it's absolutely not that at all because

1107
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,160
it's about precision. It's about being

1108
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,040
present. It's about being less

1109
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,359
controlled by distraction, be less

1110
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,280
controlled by negative thinking. And if

1111
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,640
you can do that, you can achieve more.

1112
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,119
So if you are a CEO, if you are trying

1113
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,440
to achieve something in your work and

1114
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,520
you meditate, it can make you can work

1115
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,599
much much harder and get less tired. And

1116
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,920
then also you can start to think more

1117
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,480
deeply about why am I doing the things

1118
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,400
I'm doing and what am I really trying to

1119
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,240
achieve here?

1120
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,520
Some of the most famous CEOs in the

1121
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,440
world talk about their meditation

1122
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,119
practice and this is why I've also been

1123
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,960
slightly compelled into it. I think for

1124
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,760
me I'm the type of person that's very

1125
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,400
influenced by other people that I kind

1126
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,319
of look up to and so someone like Steve

1127
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,680
Jobs who I think had a deep sort of

1128
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,760
spiritual practice which involved

1129
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,119
meditation which I also think he cites

1130
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,200
as being much of the reason he was able

1131
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,079
to see around the corner and be more of

1132
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,440
a visionary um was one of the big points

1133
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,240
of inspiration for me to get more

1134
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,319
curious about Buddhism and meditation.

1135
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,720
Do you have any examples of like very

1136
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,480
high productive, very successful people

1137
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,400
that have had tremendous

1138
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,720
benefits from meditation as it relates

1139
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
to them being more successful in their

1140
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,440
missions, their professional missions? I

1141
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,680
mean, I can't I can't think of specific

1142
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,079
individual names, but it's it's just

1143
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,079
generally very well known that if you

1144
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,400
meditate, it makes you more effective in

1145
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,000
your life because you are becoming your

1146
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,160
own boss. I mean we talk about being

1147
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,359
your own boss but how many of us are

1148
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,280
really really our own boss? You know we

1149
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,880
can be the boss of other people. We can

1150
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,640
be the boss of our environment to a

1151
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,839
certain extent but to be to be the CEO

1152
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,839
of your own mind

1153
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,319
very very difficult. And so people who

1154
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,640
can do that definitely become more

1155
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,200
effective in the world. But I think what

1156
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,960
also happens is they start to think

1157
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,720
about how they could be really

1158
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,400
successful and then do some good with

1159
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,640
that success because they

1160
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,440
they start to think about well is it all

1161
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,119
just about the success and the wealth or

1162
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,280
is there something I could do with that

1163
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,599
success and wealth because meditation

1164
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,920
makes you more compassionate. Meditation

1165
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,319
makes you more ethical. It makes you and

1166
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,160
not ethical in a kind of you know the

1167
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,960
word ethics sounds so kind of Victorian

1168
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,200
and so kind of restrictive but I mean

1169
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
trying to make the world a better place

1170
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,960
and I think there are many examples of

1171
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,040
people who've become enormously

1172
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,040
successful and used that success for the

1173
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,160
good of the world and I think meditation

1174
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,760
is something key in their success. I was

1175
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,839
just looking for a couple of examples

1176
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,440
and um Ray Dalio who a lot of people

1177
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,040
know is one of the the best investors in

1178
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,200
the world who wrote the book principle

1179
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,800
said meditation more than anything in my

1180
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,480
life is the biggest ingredient of

1181
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,720
whatever success I've had. And Mark

1182
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,160
Benoff who's the CEO of Salesforce a

1183
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,440
tremendously large company said

1184
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,920
meditation is the most important thing I

1185
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,200
do each day. Oprah Winfrey Jack Dorsey

1186
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,400
let's say who's the co-founder of

1187
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,000
Twitter and Square said there's nothing

1188
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,319
more impactful on my work than

1189
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,839
meditation. And Steve Jobs said, "If you

1190
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,160
just sit and observe, you will see how

1191
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,000
restless your mind is. If you try to

1192
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,400
calm it, it only makes it worse. But

1193
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,880
over time, it does calm." And he

1194
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,760
practiced Zen Buddhism and was a regular

1195
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,079
meditator. And he um says that his

1196
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,599
minimalist design philosophy and focus

1197
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,359
were strongly influenced by his

1198
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:59,040
spiritual and meditative practices.

1199
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,119
You see, I think the the um

1200
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,119
the thing that trips people up when they

1201
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,920
think about how meditation could make

1202
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,160
you more effective is the word calm.

1203
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,319
Mhm. Because they think, "Oh, well, if I

1204
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,000
become calm, I'm going to be I'm going

1205
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,359
to miss I'm not going to be a

1206
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
workaholic. I'm going to drop the ball."

1207
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,160
Yeah. If I'm too calm,

1208
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,640
but I don't think of calm in that way at

1209
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,560
all as almost like a tranquilized calm.

1210
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,640
I think of calm as being able to keep a

1211
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,040
cool head under fire.

1212
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,520
and be really precise and really on the

1213
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,680
on the focus on in the now and really

1214
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,359
hold on to your purpose and know why

1215
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,800
you're doing what you're doing and be

1216
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,119
less influenced by the areas of your

1217
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,760
psychology that trip you up. I'm hearing

1218
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,240
like clarity and emotional control.

1219
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,640
Yeah. Optimizing your how your brain

1220
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,240
performs. I started my first business at

1221
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,920
12 years old and then I started more

1222
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,480
businesses at 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. And

1223
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,200
at that time, what I didn't realize is

1224
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
that being a founder with no money meant

1225
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,800
that I also had to be the marketeteer,

1226
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,359
the sales rep, the finance team,

1227
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,359
customer service, and the recruiter. But

1228
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,200
if you're starting a business today,

1229
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,520
thankfully there's a tool that wears all

1230
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,760
of those hats for you, our sponsor

1231
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,079
today, which is Shopify. Because of all

1232
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,160
of its AI integrations, using Shopify

1233
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,960
feels a bit like you've hired an entire

1234
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,560
growth team from day one, taking care of

1235
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,480
writing product descriptions, your

1236
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,960
website design, and enhancing your

1237
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,880
products images, not to mention the bits

1238
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
you'd expect Shopify to handle, like the

1239
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,480
shipping, like the taxes, like the

1240
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,680
inventory. And if you're looking to get

1241
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,760
your business started, go to

1242
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,920
shopify.com/bartlet

1243
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:43,040
and sign up for a $1 per month trial.

1244
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,599
That's shopify.com/bartlet.

1245
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,359
This one change has transformed how my

1246
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,520
team and I move, train, and think about

1247
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,000
our bodies. When Dr. Daniel Lieberman

1248
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,240
came on the DEO, he explained how modern

1249
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,240
shoes with their cushioning and support

1250
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,839
are making our feet weaker and less

1251
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,079
capable of doing what nature intended

1252
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,920
them to do. We've lost the natural

1253
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,480
strength and mobility in our feet, and

1254
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,960
this is leading to issues like back pain

1255
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,640
and knee pain. I'd already purchased a

1256
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,160
pair of Viva barefoot shoes. So, I

1257
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,839
showed them to Daniel Lieberman and he

1258
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,599
told me that they were exactly the type

1259
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,200
of shoe that would help me restore

1260
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,920
natural foot movement and rebuild my

1261
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,760
strength. But, I think it was

1262
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,119
planticitis that I had where suddenly my

1263
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,480
feet started hurting all the time. And

1264
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,240
after that, I decided to start

1265
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,760
strengthening my own foot by using the

1266
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,280
Vivo Barefoot. And research from

1267
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,200
Liverpool University has backed this up.

1268
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,520
They've shown that wearing Vivo Barefoot

1269
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,400
shoes for 6 months can increase foot

1270
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,720
strength by up to 60%. Visit

1272
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,960
and use code diary 20 from my sponsor

for 20% off. A strong body starts with

1274
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,720
strong feet. Earlier on you said that in

1275
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,280
Buddhism they talk about an emptiness

1276
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,119
which is kind of this realizing that

1277
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,839
life isn't so solid and your identity is

1278
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,359
a mirage and all these kinds of things.

1279
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,599
It almost sounded like that's the

1280
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,920
opposite of like victimhood

1281
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,240
because when we think about victimhood,

1282
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,079
it is I create an identity for myself

1283
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,920
and then I create a story around that

1284
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,520
identity which has suffered some kind of

1285
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,079
injustice and then I kind of live out

1286
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,359
that injustice. How does Buddhism think

1287
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,920
about victimhood and identity and trauma

1288
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:21,280
I guess? So of course we identify

1289
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,440
incredibly strongly with our past and we

1290
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,559
in so many ways are prisoners of what

1291
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,359
has happened to us in our past and it's

1292
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,800
totally understandable of course but

1293
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,319
Buddhism brings in a whole fresh

1294
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,720
perspective which is that you are not

1295
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,319
your past. I mean even on a physical

1296
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,400
level every cell in your body has

1297
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,000
changed and your mind has changed. You

1298
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,200
are you are right now in the present.

1299
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,720
The past is is an illusion as is the

1300
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,680
future.

1301
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,760
And we spend so much time in the past

1302
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,319
and future or trying to manipulate the

1303
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,760
present. Whereas with with meditation,

1304
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,160
you're learning to to be in the now and

1305
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,599
not be. It doesn't mean you don't plan

1306
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,480
or don't remember, but you're learning

1307
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,559
to be to cling less to the past and

1308
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,599
future. And you're learning to cling

1309
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,200
less to or hold less to the idea that

1310
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,640
things are really as solid as you think

1311
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,800
they are. I mean it's very scientific

1312
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,520
that there's a there's a Buddhist uh

1313
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,359
meditation which literally is about a

1314
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,599
table like you know here we are with

1315
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,920
this table and they say if you if you

1316
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,559
take apart this table you'll find it

1317
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,359
doesn't exist because the table as it

1318
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:30,319
seems right now is is a is a top with

1319
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,720
legs. You you you take the bits apart

1320
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,240
and now where is your notion of table?

1321
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,880
you've got these bits of wood or metal

1322
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,800
or whatever it is and you start kind of

1323
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,440
dissecting that further and further and

1324
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,400
further. Uh this is where Buddhism and

1325
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,599
and and particle physics become you know

1326
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,680
talking a lot. There's a lot of

1327
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,359
conversation there in that the the

1328
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,319
smaller and smaller you go into these

1329
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,359
these wood shavings and then particles

1330
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,760
and can you find the smallest part that

1331
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,520
makes up all of reality and Buddhists

1332
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
would say no because if it's a part it

1333
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,599
has parts.

1334
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,319
There is no such thing as the partless

1335
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:10,160
particle because if it's a particle it

1336
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,240
can be further subdivided. So,

1337
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,559
we can't find the smallest base that

1338
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,559
makes up all of matter. What we're

1339
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,119
experiencing is more like a dream or an

1340
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,480
illusion. And uh the reality we live in,

1341
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,119
of course, it feels very solid. You

1342
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,720
know, if I if I throw this this cup at

1343
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,480
somebody, it's going to hit their head

1344
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,000
and hurt them. There's no point saying,

1345
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,640
"Well, it's all empty. Don't worry about

1346
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,800
it." But the idea behind this philosophy

1347
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,240
of understanding things not to be as

1348
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,720
solid as they are is that we can learn

1349
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,200
to suffer less because we spend so much

1350
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,800
of our energy constantly reacting to

1351
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,160
things as if they're really solid and

1352
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,240
really real and there's nothing that can

1353
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,079
be done about them whether that be

1354
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,720
people or objects in the world around us

1355
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,280
or our mind itself.

1356
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,839
And if we can desolidify some of that we

1357
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,920
could become more free. We all carry so

1358
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,280
many burdens in this regard. You know,

1359
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,880
it could be grief, it could be

1360
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,800
heartbreak, it could be a colleague at

1361
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,280
work that doesn't dislike us, a comment

1362
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,000
in our Instagram page of someone some

1363
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,200
something someone said about us. How

1364
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,319
does one go about

1365
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:16,000
alleviating ourselves from this kind of

1366
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:20,160
burden? Yeah. So, I for me it it's very

1367
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,559
much about um dropping the story

1368
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,400
and looking at the feeling. Okay.

1369
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,920
Explain that to me.

1370
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,480
So

1371
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,200
for me this became

1372
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,119
very uh very

1373
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,960
important practice for me when I was in

1374
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,760
a long retreat.

1375
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,400
So I went into a very long retreat for

1376
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,160
four years. I became a monk for a year

1377
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,920
and I stayed a bit longer stayed a bit

1378
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,079
longer. It was after about four years

1379
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,559
that I I decided to do this for life and

1380
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,160
I took lifelong vows and then I knew

1381
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,680
about these long I did some short

1382
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,160
retreats but I knew about these long

1383
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,160
retreats but it wasn't until 12 years

1384
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,400
later that the opportunity came up to go

1385
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,079
into a long retreat

1386
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,319
uh four years long where you are really

1387
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,880
just cut off from the world for that

1388
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,000
length of time. No, no, nobody goes in

1389
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,359
or out. And you are meditating many,

1390
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,599
many hours a day. And it was the most

1391
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,680
frightening experience of my life

1392
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,520
because I I was in there alone with with

1393
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,800
my own thoughts and emotions. It's not a

1394
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,640
completely solitary retreat. There are

1395
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,480
other monks there all doing their own

1396
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,079
meditation in their rooms. So there is a

1397
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,920
kind of group, but you are very much

1398
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,599
alone as well.

1399
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,640
And for me the whole thing was for the

1400
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,680
first two years was just horrific

1401
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,720
amounts of depression, misery, pain,

1402
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,880
anguish, anxiety that would build into

1403
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,520
panic attacks. I I was really really

1404
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,760
shocked by what happened to me in there

1405
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,520
because I I I think I thought I'd you

1406
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,400
know I'd been a monk for 12 years and

1407
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,440
I'd already started to you know give a

1408
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,520
few talks about meditation and and

1409
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,200
maybe I thought I was quite sorted but I

1410
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,920
I wasn't and I got in there and really

1411
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,319
fell apart. But it was an amazing thing

1412
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,079
that happened to me because that falling

1413
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:09,200
apart forced me after a while to to

1414
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,040
learn how to engage with what I'm

1415
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,640
talking about which is looking at the

1416
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,559
suffering and working with that with

1417
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,040
meditation

1418
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,720
looking at the suffering. So for me

1419
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,040
during those first two years of the

1420
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,000
retreat

1421
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,480
I was completely obsessed with the story

1422
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,760
because I I was experiencing these

1423
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:33,359
horrendous feelings of heartbreak

1424
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,079
and feelings of depression uh anxiety

1425
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:39,040
just kind of a whole

1426
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,200
mass of suffering inside myself and I

1427
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,800
was I was trying to almost do therapy on

1428
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,559
myself and think okay let's you know

1429
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,480
thinking memories were coming up from

1430
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,880
the past and thinking about things that

1431
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,720
had happened in my past and is this why

1432
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,800
I'm suffering now and how do I resolve

1433
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,400
that? And the more I went down that

1434
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,040
road, the worse it got. And I found

1435
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,280
myself really disconnected from

1436
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,119
Buddhism. And it was a really

1437
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,920
frightening experience because I I'm

1438
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,480
there in a 4-year retreat. I'm a monk

1439
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,200
and I'm I was feeling completely

1440
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,960
alienated from the whole thing. I I kind

1441
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,359
of wanted to just get away from it. I

1442
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,520
wanted to run away. And things only

1443
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,839
changed when I

1444
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:23,440
hit rock bottom like hugely in that I

1445
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,040
actually

1446
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,920
I climbed over the wall of the retreat

1447
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,920
to run away. I couldn't take it anymore.

1448
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,559
I I at one morning I had the most

1449
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,680
immense panic attack I've ever had and I

1450
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,400
just like saw red and just ran I legged

1451
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,839
it out of the retreat which is un it's

1452
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,040
unthinkable. you know, in a four-year

1453
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,040
retreat, you're not supposed to leave.

1454
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,119
But I jumped over the wall and tried to

1455
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,559
escape. I say tried to escape as if I

1456
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,480
was in some kind of, you know, prison or

1457
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,079
cult. It's not like that. People do

1458
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,400
leave retreats, but for me, it was this

1459
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,359
kind of dramatic get out of there and

1460
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:59,359
run away. And

1461
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:01,920
I remember um like freaking out and

1462
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,760
running and running and running down

1463
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,920
this road in the rain. This was on a

1464
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,240
very, you know, remote area of a

1465
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,720
Scottish island. and then just stopping

1466
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,240
and thinking, "What are you doing?

1467
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,799
What what has happened to you?" And I

1468
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,559
just stopped and then went back and I

1469
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,599
asked the leaders of the retreat if I

1470
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,559
could be let back in. And they said,

1471
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,559
"Well, no, you've left." But I really

1472
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,000
begged them because I I had such clarity

1473
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,480
in that moment. I wanted to go back in.

1474
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,559
And they said, "Okay, the abbot of my

1475
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,000
monastery said, "Okay, stay stay in a

1476
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,400
little caravan on the edge of the

1477
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,799
retreat boundary for a week, for seven

1478
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,240
days, and think about what you're doing,

1479
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,680
and then we'll see if you will let you

1480
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,240
back in.

1481
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,240
And during that time, I

1482
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,000
I thought really deeply and I re I

1483
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,680
really knew I wanted to go back in

1484
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,359
because there was at that moment a

1485
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,280
thought of shall I give up being a monk?

1486
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,480
Shall I give up the whole thing? I I

1487
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,799
can't do this. It's made me so

1488
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,599
miserable. But I I really knew in that

1489
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:57,920
moment what what my purpose was. I knew

1490
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,480
I wanted to go back in and carry on. But

1491
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,680
I also knew I'd been

1492
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:08,319
tormenting myself with my past and that

1493
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:11,920
I hadn't worked out how to

1494
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:14,319
how to heal myself. I I I'd been sinking

1495
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,079
so badly and I if I was to go back in

1496
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,559
there, I would have to try a completely

1497
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,240
new approach.

1498
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,480
Why did you choose to go back in?

1499
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,599
Because I I really strongly believed

1500
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,559
that it was what I want to do with my

1501
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,240
life. And a part of me thought, don't

1502
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,920
give something up when you're freaking

1503
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,760
out because you will regret it. If

1504
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,359
you're going to give this thing up, give

1505
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,480
it up from a place of clarity, knowing

1506
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,079
that there's something better for you

1507
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,680
out there. Don't give up because you're

1508
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,839
having a panic attack and you can't take

1509
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,720
it. That's the wrong kind of timing to

1510
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,599
make a life change because I do I I

1511
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,920
really do believe in what I'm doing. I I

1512
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,400
I this is the life I've chosen for

1513
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,799
myself and I want to do it. But it got

1514
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,559
so difficult I couldn't take it anymore.

1515
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,319
Why did you want to do it? If something

1516
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,760
is painful and causing you anxiety

1517
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:08,160
because I felt that this this pain I'm

1518
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,480
going through

1519
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,319
I've the the meth the methods are there.

1520
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,839
I just need to know how to use them and

1521
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:18,799
I could learn to conquer this. I I this

1522
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,319
pain could be the breakthrough. Most

1523
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,160
people in in their lives when they think

1524
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:24,720
about the things that give them anxiety

1525
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,559
or pain or fear, you know, we live as

1526
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,720
sort of discomfort avoiding humans. So

1527
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,119
we try and run to run to comfort or

1528
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,440
pleasure. Exactly. So life is hard.

1529
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,839
Let's run from it. Let's get on a plane,

1530
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,119
fly to another country and try and just

1531
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:40,000
set up a new life somewhere else. It

1532
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,680
doesn't work because you go to your new

1533
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,359
life and the thing that has been

1534
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,200
haunting you like a shadow goes with

1535
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:49,440
you. You can't run from yourself.

1536
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,160
You can you can run to the end of the

1537
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,359
earth and that thing that has been

1538
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,280
tormenting you is part of you. And until

1539
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,079
you learn to integrate that, it will

1540
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,960
always trip you up. And so I went back

1541
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,920
into that retreat knowing, okay, this is

1542
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,920
your last chance.

1543
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,079
If you don't if if you mess this up

1544
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,960
again, that that's it, you know, forget

1545
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,440
it. So it was a real like make orb

1546
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,960
breakak situation. And I went back in

1547
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,200
and I I I um

1548
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:25,440
everything changed

1549
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,640
because I found I I had to find a new a

1550
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,280
different way of dealing with that

1551
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,200
suffering. What was that? Okay. So, I'm

1552
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,720
back in there and it's coming up again.

1553
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:40,200
The depression, the anxiety, the

1554
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,200
the pain that to me it felt like

1555
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,280
it it felt like like some something like

1556
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,559
that was piercing me. It felt like a It

1557
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,559
felt like there was like a knife

1558
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,880
constantly twisting,

1559
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,040
twisting and turning in my heart or like

1560
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,079
in the middle of me. It was really

1561
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,599
painful. And what I'd been doing up

1562
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,319
until that point was just trying to get

1563
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,920
that knife out. And also thinking, why

1564
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,760
is it there? Is it because of what

1565
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,280
happened to me when I was 14? Is it what

1566
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,680
happened to me when I was 17? Is it

1567
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,960
this? Is it that? Is it my my family?

1568
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,040
What is it? That's the story. I say

1569
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,280
story. I'm not I'm I'm not belittling

1570
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:19,240
people's stories. I'm just saying it's

1571
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,240
the narrative, isn't it?

1572
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,240
So, I I decided to to use the knife as

1573
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:30,640
the meditation

1574
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:32,640
to to actually meditate on it.

1575
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,440
And and uh the the whole thing starts to

1576
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,760
change when you do that because until

1577
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,960
that point you've been if until that

1578
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,920
point you've been trying to get rid of

1579
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,680
your suffering or get rid of your pain.

1580
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,680
But if you turn your pain into your

1581
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,280
meditation, you're moving towards it.

1582
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,440
And

1583
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,760
how can it hurt you if you've decided to

1584
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,480
move towards it? You you you've made

1585
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,400
that choice. So what I started to do was

1586
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,160
just focus on the pain but try to bypass

1587
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,000
the judgments. I don't like this. This

1588
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,079
is so terrible. Why am I depressed? Why

1589
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,240
am I anxious?

1590
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,520
And just feel the feeling. And it's a

1591
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,480
sensation in the body.

1592
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,160
Because one of the key um

1593
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,480
instructions in meditation is when you

1594
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,799
focus your mind, you focus it with less

1595
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,040
judgment. This is good. This is bad. You

1596
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:25,359
just focus. So you're focusing on that

1597
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,839
feeling without pushing it away, without

1598
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:30,559
saying why do I feel like this, but just

1599
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:33,440
the feeling and it you start it starts

1600
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,480
to change.

1601
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,680
It starts to change because

1602
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,359
you're accepting it. My my teachers had

1603
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,960
always said to me, they'd always go on

1604
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,240
and on about acceptance and I just I

1605
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,559
just wanted to hit them when they said

1606
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,160
it cuz it sounded so grim. You know,

1607
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,240
you've got to accept yourself or you've

1608
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,520
got to accept your suffering. To me,

1609
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,280
that sounded like you were going to for

1610
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,440
the rest of your life be dragging this

1611
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,200
bag of rocks up a hill. You know,

1612
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,280
acceptance is so miserable and so

1613
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,960
boring. I didn't realize that what they

1614
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,880
meant was was compassion and

1615
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,000
self-acceptance at a very very deep

1616
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,040
level. So, so I was I'm I'm focusing on

1617
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,040
that feeling in my body and trying not

1618
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,760
to go into the stories about it or the

1619
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:18,799
hatred of it and just move towards it

1620
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,599
and and kind of become become one with

1621
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:23,760
that pain and then you relax and

1622
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,119
something kind of releases

1623
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,880
and I mean I think it works on a

1624
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,400
chemical level cuz basically when you're

1625
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,319
when you're trying to push pain away

1626
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,160
you're creating enormous amounts of uh

1627
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,559
cortisol in your body the stress

1628
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,240
hormone. When you relax, the endorphins

1629
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,559
arise, you start to feel happy. I mean,

1630
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,960
it's quite bizarre that the thing that

1631
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,520
has hurt you so much starts to turn into

1632
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:47,280
a kind of joyful feeling and you start

1633
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:49,440
to think, "Oh, wow. Okay, so happiness

1634
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,599
is nothing to do with somebody being

1635
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,680
nice to me or this object or that

1636
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,640
thing." And happiness is about being

1637
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,520
okay with your suffering

1638
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:03,119
and and and not just being okay with it,

1639
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,920
but actually sending love into the place

1640
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,720
in yourself that you hated so much. So

1641
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,720
for for me um that what started to

1642
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,960
change was

1643
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,640
from from from having a feeling like a

1644
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,920
knife twisting inside me and hurting me

1645
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:20,640
and wanting to get rid of it.

1646
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:23,760
I found ways to hold that with with

1647
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:28,000
love. And I I started to have this image

1648
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,920
in my head of as if I had found a like a

1649
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,520
frightened rabbit or a bird with a

1650
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,000
broken wing and I'm holding that in my

1651
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,599
hand with tenderness.

1652
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,119
I'd never been able to do that for

1653
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,720
myself.

1654
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,319
I had never ever been able to be kind to

1655
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,240
myself.

1656
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:48,319
Everything in my life until up until

1657
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:50,640
that point had been so harsh and so self

1658
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:53,839
self-hating

1659
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,319
and and I think you know in my teenage

1660
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:58,960
years when I was trying to become a a

1661
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:01,119
successful actor I think that was the

1662
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,720
drive was I I hate myself so I better

1663
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,359
get loads of people to love me instead

1664
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,960
cuz I can't do it. I'm not saying all

1665
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,480
actors are like that by no means but

1666
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,440
there is a kind of actor who is like

1667
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,400
that. We know that and that was me. And

1668
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,400
then, you know, even as a as a as a monk

1669
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,240
and you become celibate and you you're

1670
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,240
you know, having this kind of more like

1671
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,559
looking after yourself lifestyle, I

1672
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,160
developed all these incredibly strong

1673
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,680
attachments with friends where I'd want

1674
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,520
them to be nice to me and I didn't want

1675
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,079
to be alone with myself. I couldn't

1676
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,680
spend time alone with myself. And then

1677
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,319
in the first two years of that retreat,

1678
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,000
I'm hating myself and hating my pain and

1679
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:38,400
jumping over the wall and anything to

1680
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,599
kind of jump out of my own skin. And

1681
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,880
when I learned how to do this kind of

1682
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,799
practice with sending compassion

1683
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,960
into that part of myself that I'd hated

1684
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,359
so much, it it it was really

1685
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,680
transformative.

1686
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,720
You said it felt like holding a scared

1687
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,160
rabbit or a bird with a broken wing.

1688
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,920
How did you come to feel about that

1689
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,760
bird?

1690
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:08,640
I felt um I felt love for that part of

1691
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:11,359
myself. And for me, that's only possible

1692
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,480
when you stop getting so distracted by

1693
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:16,799
all the history and the the the the

1694
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,720
details of your past, but you're just

1695
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,720
relating to the feeling in your body

1696
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,319
right now.

1697
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,079
And I don't know if it's like this for

1698
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,160
everybody, but for me, feeling it in the

1699
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,920
body is a really easy way to start

1700
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,760
because

1701
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,240
yeah, it's depression, it's anxiety,

1702
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,760
it's trauma, whatever it is that's quite

1703
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,000
kind of nebulous. How do you find it?

1704
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,440
And for me it was so physical. It was

1705
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,200
like this twisting of a knife in the

1706
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
heart or a sinking feeling in the in the

1707
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,559
chest. And just to relate to that

1708
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,480
sensation with kindness

1709
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,559
taught me how to love myself but in an

1710
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,760
accepting way you know not it's not

1711
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,920
about you know becoming an egoomaniac

1712
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,160
like I love myself. It's more have

1713
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,319
kindness for yourself. How does this

1714
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,839
translate to things like grief? Because

1715
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,920
grief is one of the the hardest things

1716
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,520
to get to acceptance on the sort of

1717
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,839
finality of life, losing someone you

1718
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,440
love. You've been through this yourself.

1719
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,599
You you had a I think a best friend of

1720
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,839
yours who was Well, my teacher. Oh, your

1721
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,160
teacher. Well, he was my best friend as

1722
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:19,920
well as my teacher. He he he was

1723
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,960
murdered. He was in so 11 years ago. My

1724
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,799
teacher Akon Rimpiche who had been my

1725
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,359
everything for all those years, you

1726
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:30,720
know, he he was my teacher, my closest

1727
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:32,240
friend. He I also I spent a lot of time

1728
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,839
with him. I became his kind of

1729
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,599
assistant. So when he would travel, I

1730
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:39,760
was with him all the time. So we were

1731
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:42,880
very close. He was Tibetan and he was in

1732
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:46,000
charge of our monastery in Scotland. And

1733
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:49,280
part of his his work was he would run a

1734
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,799
charity called Rockpa which has um oh

1735
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:56,960
that's him. um he would go to Tibet

1736
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:59,200
every year and um look after projects

1737
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,599
there, feeding orphans, looking after

1738
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,079
schools, hospitals, etc. He was on his

1739
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:07,200
way to Tibet one year and he was in

1740
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,319
Changdu in China and he was um basically

1741
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,960
ambushed and stabbed, killed.

1742
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,880
And I mean this completely rocked the

1743
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,440
Buddhist world. It's like, you know,

1744
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,200
horrendous news. But on a personal level

1745
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,640
for me,

1746
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,240
I was one of the first people who found

1747
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,079
out. I I've been on the phone to him

1748
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,079
every day until then. I was his

1749
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,839
assistant and very working very closely

1750
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:34,160
with him. So it complet my it completely

1751
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:36,799
like blew me apart. I mean it blew me to

1752
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,920
pieces.

1753
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:43,079
I cannot describe how badly it blew me

1754
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,079
to pieces.

1755
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:49,440
But

1756
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:52,799
the meditation I've described to you

1757
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,440
saw me through

1758
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:58,160
because I at some point during that

1759
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,760
grieving process I remembered what to

1760
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,200
do.

1761
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,160
At first I didn't because you know when

1762
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,799
you're really in it in in it you you

1763
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,319
can't think but then

1764
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,160
so there was the whole aftermath you

1765
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:13,200
know he was killed and it was in all the

1766
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,960
press and then as his assistant I was

1767
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,279
the one dealing with the media and in a

1768
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,679
way that you stay busy when you're

1769
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,319
grieving it kind of helps you to you

1770
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,480
know stay focused but then the nights

1771
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,440
the nights was nighttime was when it

1772
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,199
started to hurt

1773
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,679
because at night I would just be tossing

1774
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:35,600
and turning turning and feeling like

1775
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,920
feeling like I was on fire

1776
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,239
because I had a mixture of grief, anger,

1777
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,080
despair. It was a whole mixture of

1778
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:44,719
things.

1779
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:48,159
We knew the killer. The person who

1780
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,839
murdered him had been a monk, a Tibetan.

1781
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,120
He had been a monk in our monastery. We

1782
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:55,120
knew him. He actually had the same name

1783
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:57,600
as me and we knew him quite well. So

1784
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,440
there was all of that mixed in with what

1785
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,000
on earth happened to this person that he

1786
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,440
did this thing. And so all of that is

1787
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,359
consuming me at night and I'm just

1788
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,120
tossing and turning feeling like I'm in

1789
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,719
flames. And then at some point it kicked

1790
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,799
in

1791
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,960
the the meditation. It just had it just

1792
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,480
happened because I'd done it in retreat.

1793
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,719
It had seen me through. It had really

1794
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,319
really helped me. And at some point I

1795
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:23,359
just had to lie there and send love into

1796
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:26,640
the flames in me. You know, I had to

1797
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:29,040
send send that kindness into the place I

1798
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,880
was in despair.

1799
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,480
I'm not saying that I then just became

1800
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:37,600
all right. No, but it absolutely

1801
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,839
calmed things. Absolutely. And it it is

1802
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,880
it is it is all about love. It really

1803
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:45,199
is. You are sending love into the pain

1804
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:48,080
you are experiencing.

1805
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:49,920
And this helped me through the grief. It

1806
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,920
helped me also with forgiveness with the

1807
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,239
the guy we knew who did it. It helped me

1808
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,560
on so many levels. And I'm not saying

1809
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,040
that it, you know, it's it's all okay,

1810
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:03,120
but I have I I've made peace with his

1811
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:06,400
death. And

1812
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:09,600
I mean, he taught me this practice.

1813
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:12,159
He taught me how to do that. And then he

1814
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,440
died and I had to do it. That I I think

1815
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:17,679
of it as his last gift to me.

1816
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,480
And um

1817
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,159
I'm you know I I I I'm will be forever

1818
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
grateful.

1819
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,719
When you talk about sending love into

1820
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,120
the flames, what is the the actual

1821
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,040
practice there? Is it certain sentences

1822
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,880
you're saying? No, it's thinking. Yeah,

1823
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,880
I'm glad you asked this because it it is

1824
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:40,159
so much about going beyond the words and

1825
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,400
going into an experience of oneness.

1826
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,880
So, so to make it really practical, you

1827
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,560
know, you're feeling you're feeling

1828
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,560
incredible trauma in your body for

1829
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,800
finding it physically is the easiest way

1830
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,719
to do it. Like you your body's in flames

1831
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,320
or you've got like a feeling of a knife

1832
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,560
twisting in your heart, whatever it is,

1833
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,239
there's this feeling in the body and

1834
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,840
first of all, you just focus on that

1835
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,960
feeling.

1836
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,880
So, anybody who who meditates knows how

1837
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,560
to focus on their breathing. It's the

1838
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,000
same thing. It's just where you're

1839
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,920
focusing. So, you're feeling the feeling

1840
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,679
and you're trying to bypass the thoughts

1841
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,159
of this is uncomfortable. I want this to

1842
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:22,159
go away. Why did he die? What happened?

1843
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,640
You're just feeling the feeling.

1844
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:29,400
And then you pay attention to that

1845
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,400
feeling in a loving way.

1846
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:36,000
You you flood it with love.

1847
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:40,000
And the reason this is possible, I mean

1848
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,679
this is touching upon a major a major

1849
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,600
belief in Buddhist philosophy, which is

1850
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,600
that our minds are naturally

1851
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,520
compassionate.

1852
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,480
We are not

1853
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:53,280
these fight orflight killing machines

1854
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:57,679
that some people like to think the human

1855
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,560
being is. We are our natural state is to

1856
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:03,360
be kind. It is who we are naturally deep

1857
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,760
down. So when you clear away all the the

1858
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,640
words and the the ideas and you just sit

1859
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,159
with the feeling and you send love into

1860
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,159
that feeling with your mind, you're just

1861
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,719
loving that feeling, holding it with

1862
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,800
compassion as if you were with a friend

1863
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,400
who was grieving. You know, if you if

1864
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,280
you were sitting with a friend who was

1865
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,960
freaking out or grieving or whatever,

1866
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,800
you you you're not going to slap them

1867
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,120
around the face and say snap out of it.

1868
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,600
You will hold their hand

1869
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,800
and we all know how to do that.

1870
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,400
The question is, can you do it for

1871
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,320
yourself?

1872
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,640
And for me, that was a huge challenge

1873
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,640
because I hated myself so much for so

1874
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,000
many years.

1875
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,719
I was my worst enemy. So to hold my own

1876
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,320
hand internally in that sense, that's

1877
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,880
what I mean by sending love into the

1878
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:51,199
feeling. And what happens then is the

1879
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,199
feeling starts to change.

1880
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,040
It starts to melt. The sharpness, the

1881
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,440
sharp edge of it, edges of it start to

1882
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,679
melt. And you start to be okay with

1883
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,679
being not okay.

1884
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,679
And

1885
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,280
it's almost as if a kind of happiness

1886
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,800
starts to arise, but it's not like a

1887
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,800
it's a kind of happiness you haven't

1888
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,440
tasted before. It's a happiness of I can

1889
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,239
be okay with this. It makes you

1890
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,960
immensely strong.

1891
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,480
You talked about forgiveness.

1892
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,560
Did you forgive the man that murdered

1893
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,640
your friend and teacher? Yes.

1894
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,360
Quite quickly.

1895
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,840
it I mean in a way it was made easier

1896
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,159
because it became really clear that he

1897
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,000
was psychotic

1898
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,520
and of course that's no excuse or

1899
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,600
condoning or anything like that but

1900
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,760
somebody who is

1901
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,760
really unable to control themselves I

1902
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,679
mean how can you hate them or whatever

1903
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,800
you know it's

1904
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,040
that's an extreme case but there are the

1905
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,040
practice of forgiveness is a hard one

1906
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,400
isn't it because we we've all got people

1907
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,400
in our lives that we think might have

1908
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,000
wronged us or done which has caused us

1909
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,719
pain and almost the way that we

1910
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,000
create our own perception of justice is

1911
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:09,920
by holding the grudge. Yeah. Now, now

1912
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,760
why do we do that? That's my that's the

1913
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,920
question is do we think

1914
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,080
do we think that if we let go of the

1915
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,679
grudge we have let the other person get

1916
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,159
away with it? That's how it kind of

1917
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,520
feels, right? Wouldn't you say that by

1918
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,679
holding the grudge they've got away with

1919
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,840
it?

1920
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,600
because you're the one suffering.

1921
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,120
They've really won. They're winning in

1922
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,520
each moment because you're holding on to

1923
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,960
that. In Buddhism, there's a a teaching

1924
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,679
that says it's like holding on to a

1925
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:42,320
piece of hot metal or holding a hot coal

1926
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,239
in your hand and it's just burning you.

1927
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,159
So, if I'm holding the grudge, they have

1928
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,719
absolutely got away with it because they

1929
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:52,880
are the thing they did which was one

1930
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:55,360
thing maybe I am now constantly hurting

1931
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,159
and they are absolutely the winner. So

1932
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:00,239
for I I wonder if we we assume I think

1933
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,040
we do assume that forgiveness is a kind

1934
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,199
of giving up even the word forgive the

1935
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,719
give in the word. So it sounds like

1936
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:09,280
we're taking a weaker position. We're

1937
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,360
giving up. We're sort of surrendering

1938
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,480
but I think forgiveness is a strength or

1939
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,840
a power and

1940
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,280
it's actually nothing to do with the

1941
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,679
other person. They might you're not

1942
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,520
going to necessarily write them a letter

1943
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,239
and say I've forgiven you. But you're

1944
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,080
freeing yourself. You're dropping your

1945
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:30,480
burden because that rage is toxic and

1946
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,280
that hurt is toxic.

1947
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,800
It's so hard to let go of it. And people

1948
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,280
can say, "Let go and you just want to

1949
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,800
slap them in the face because what?

1950
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,040
Okay, is it that easy? I'm just going to

1951
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,679
let go." You know, it's not that easy.

1952
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,600
It's bloody hard.

1953
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:49,199
But meditation gives gives you the

1954
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,440
tools. Partly because meditation anyway

1955
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,960
is helping to loosen up that kind of

1956
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,400
glue that we have in our minds where

1957
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,800
we're glued into those feelings. It even

1958
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:01,360
just a simple meditation like coming

1959
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,360
back to the breath is helping you to be

1960
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,280
less glued into those thoughts and

1961
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,239
reactions and feelings. So the feeling

1962
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:11,040
of rage can start to be less heavy for

1963
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:12,640
you. You've been through several sort of

1964
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,440
traumatic incidents. You talked about

1965
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,800
being 14, being 17, sexual abuse, parent

1966
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,719
parental divorce, a little bit of

1967
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,239
neglect, it sounds like, as well. Have

1968
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,239
you forgiven all of those people in your

1969
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,239
life?

1970
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,040
I don't know. I don't know if

1971
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:32,080
forgiveness is a big huge massive moment

1972
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,159
or if it's a process. I'm friends with

1973
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,600
all those people,

1974
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:40,840
very close friends with all those

1975
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,840
people. And I think

1976
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:46,320
here's what I think. I think I've

1977
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:50,080
learned how to forgive the feelings

1978
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,880
that those incidents hap gave rise to.

1979
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:57,600
Mhm. That to me is much more important

1980
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:59,520
than forgiving the people. Mhm.

1981
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,480
And I think what's also happened to me

1982
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,880
is I've started to find that the

1983
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:09,520
suffering

1984
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:11,040
that I experience has some use

1985
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,440
because it is the thing that you're

1986
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:17,600
using for your mental transformation.

1987
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,080
Rimpache always used to say um suffering

1988
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,239
is like compost.

1989
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,159
Compost is made of rotten vegetables.

1990
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:26,800
people chuck it away or they know how to

1991
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,800
make the field grow and I I think it's

1992
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,719
like that.

1993
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,960
So with forgiveness um I would say yeah

1994
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,320
meditation but I would say also thinking

1995
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,640
thinking deeply about

1996
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,840
about the situation.

1997
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:47,600
You know what's really helped me

1998
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,280
with with my dad and with other people

1999
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,120
is to think about the suffering they

2000
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,280
were going through that kind of like

2001
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:55,440
propelled them to behave the way they've

2002
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,440
behaved. There's always something isn't

2003
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,760
there in somebody that has made them

2004
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,440
behave the way they behave. And there's

2005
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,320
a part of us that gets very indignant

2006
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,880
and thinks how dare they they should

2007
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,159
know better. Whereas the Buddhist's

2008
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,520
answer would be well what what do you

2009
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:12,080
mean they should know better? They know

2010
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,760
what they know there. They are they are

2011
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,320
driven by their own confusion and their

2012
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,560
own pain. Wh Why do you think they were

2013
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,800
out to get you? Why do you think they

2014
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,040
were deliberately out to maliciously get

2015
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,640
you? Weren't they just caught in their

2016
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:29,280
own suffering and you you were there?

2017
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,880
But it's not so much about you.

2018
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,320
And I think that starts to lighten the

2019
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,120
burden a bit when you start to think

2020
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,960
about, you know, there's a meditation I

2021
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,280
sometimes do where you you swap places

2022
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,679
with the other person in your mind.

2023
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,120
You sit and you think about being them

2024
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,320
and looking at the world out of their

2025
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,760
eyes. The person that hurt you. Yeah. So

2026
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,199
many people will be thinking about that

2027
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,120
person in their life as you speak and

2028
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,120
they'll be the challenge I guess they'll

2029
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,640
face is they'll continually come back to

2030
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,120
this idea that this person is an

2031
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,640
 Yeah. They you know it almost

2032
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,800
we all are though. We are too. We all

2033
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,520
are. I am. We're all because we're all

2034
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,239
just confused. We're all at the mercy of

2035
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,400
our own minds.

2036
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:11,440
If you meditate regularly, you realize

2037
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,800
how out of control you are because

2038
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,560
you're trying to sit there with your

2039
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,040
breathing and all you're thinking about

2040
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,679
is shopping lists and you think, "Wow,

2041
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,760
the human mind is really pretty messed

2042
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,280
up. We can't make it do anything we want

2043
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:27,120
it to do." So this person that you think

2044
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,120
they're so evil and so terrible and how

2045
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,719
dare they do the thing they've done. I'm

2046
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,920
not saying that we're condoning it and

2047
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,199
saying, "Yeah, you can do what you

2048
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,520
want."

2049
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,840
I'm just saying lighten up a bit because

2050
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,800
people are just doing their best and

2051
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,920
sometimes their best is really bad. Then

2052
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,239
that doesn't have to become your

2053
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,920
problem. It's not really about you.

2054
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,320
We we we obviously take things

2055
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,280
personally. If something is done to you,

2056
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,800
of course you're going to take it

2057
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,640
personally.

2058
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,320
But meditation helps you look at the

2059
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,719
360°

2060
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:01,679
view of a situation rather than just

2061
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,199
from your perspective. And very

2062
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,760
important here that we don't get into

2063
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:08,000
that kind of victim shaming reality

2064
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,400
where you think, "Oh, it's all about me

2065
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,800
and poor them." It's it's not that at

2066
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,600
all. It's simply that you think we're

2067
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,400
all we're all messed up in various ways

2068
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,080
and and that's the human condition. Make

2069
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,560
sure you keep what I'm about to say to

2070
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,320
yourself. I'm inviting 10,000 of you to

2071
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,440
come even deeper into the diary of a

2072
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,600
CEO. Welcome to my inner circle. This is

2073
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,120
a brand new private community that I'm

2074
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,960
launching to the world. We have so many

2075
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,440
incredible things that happen that you

2076
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,960
are never shown. We have the briefs that

2077
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,040
are on my iPad when I'm recording the

2078
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,480
conversation. We have clips we've never

2079
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,000
released. We have behind the scenes

2080
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,320
conversations with the guest and also

2081
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,600
the episodes that we've never ever

2082
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,360
released and so much more. In the

2083
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,960
circle, you'll have direct access to me.

2084
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,719
You can tell us what you want this show

2085
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,239
to be, who you want us to interview, and

2086
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,880
the types of conversations you would

2087
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:58,880
love us to have. But remember, for now,

2088
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,120
we're only inviting the first 10,000

2089
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,400
people that join before it closes. So,

2090
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,600
if you want to join our private closed

2091
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,719
community, head to the link in the

2092
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,719
description below or go to

2093
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,719
daccircle.com.

2094
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,840
I will speak to you then. I'm going to

2095
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:13,040
let you in to a little bit of a secret.

2096
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,480
You're probably going to think me and my

2097
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,080
team are a little bit weird, but I can

2098
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,760
still remember to this day when Jamaima

2099
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,320
from my team posted on Slack that she

2100
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,080
changed the scent in this studio. And

2101
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,080
right after she posted it, the entire

2102
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,520
office clapped in our Slack channel. And

2103
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,679
this might sound crazy, but at the D

2104
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,679
ofio, this is the type of 1% improvement

2105
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,000
we make on our show. And that is why the

2106
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:34,880
show is the way it is. By understanding

2107
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,960
the power of compounding 1%, you can

2108
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,560
absolutely change your outcomes in your

2109
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,960
life. It isn't about drastic

2110
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:44,159
transformations or quick wins. It's

2111
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,000
about the small consistent actions that

2112
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:48,080
have a lasting change in your outcomes.

2113
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,080
So two years ago, we started the process

2114
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,520
of creating this beautiful diary and

2115
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,360
it's truly beautiful. Inside there's

2116
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,840
lots of pictures, lots of inspiration

2117
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,679
and motivation as well, some interactive

2118
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,560
elements. And the purpose of this diary

2119
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:03,760
is to help you identify, stay focused

2120
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,360
on, develop consistency with the 1%s

2121
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,120
that will ultimately change your life.

2122
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,400
So if you want one for yourself or for a

2123
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,040
friend or for a colleague or for your

2124
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:14,480
team, then head to the diary.com right

2125
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,639
now. I'll link it below. Many of us live

2126
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,920
trapped in the life we have. I guess

2127
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,920
maybe the word trapped isn't the right

2128
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,920
word, but held back in many ways because

2129
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,400
of fear. And I wondered what Buddhism

2130
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,480
teaches us about fear in terms of fear

2131
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,679
of

2132
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:32,960
taking risks or you know going and

2133
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:34,800
becoming a Buddhist uh monk or starting

2134
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,960
a business or pursuing a passion or

2135
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,639
moving to Bali. Many of us have these

2136
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,840
these dreams, these callings, but we're

2137
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:44,000
trapped in fear. And would you also

2138
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,840
agree that the fear can be about those

2139
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,400
bigger things, but also it's a momentto-

2140
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:52,239
moment subtle anxiety that just like

2141
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:55,600
pervades everything? Yeah, it's both. To

2142
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:59,840
to me this became hugely

2143
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:03,520
um like obvious when I came out of that

2144
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:07,280
four-year retreat because I I came out

2145
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,719
that retreat was 2005 to 2009.

2146
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,360
When I came out of that retreat,

2147
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,360
everybody had smartphones.

2148
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,040
During those four years, the whole

2149
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,080
landscape of technology changed

2150
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,360
dramatically. Smartphones, social media,

2151
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,639
the whole thing happened during that

2152
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,400
time. And you hadn't been on the

2153
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,360
internet those that No, no, we had

2154
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:27,280
nothing. Before my retreat, some people

2155
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,360
had Blackberries and then that was it.

2156
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,280
And then suddenly it's all different.

2157
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,639
And I arrived in London and everybody's

2158
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,960
walking around with their face buried in

2159
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:37,040
phones and I I'm walk, you know, going

2160
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,280
up the escalator and the and the tube in

2161
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:42,400
London and the little billboards are

2162
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:45,199
moving images. Mhm. That made me feel

2163
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,280
dizzy.

2164
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:51,040
But where I'm going with this is is I I

2165
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:52,719
I I'm maybe because I've been in this

2166
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,960
unusual environment and now I'm back in

2167
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:58,159
normal reality. I see it with more of a

2168
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,560
shock. And I started to think, how much

2169
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,080
are we being made to feel afraid all the

2170
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,320
time?

2171
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,280
When news media becomes digitalized and

2172
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:09,199
monetized and then you have to keep the

2173
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,960
person reading, we know the tricks that

2174
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,560
people have to do. We know we all know

2175
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,800
about clickbait. We all know about how

2176
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,159
the the headline of an article has to be

2177
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,880
shocking enough to make you read the

2178
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:20,159
article and then you see the ads. You

2179
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,560
don't actually find out the information

2180
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:25,600
until two/ird way down. We know, we know

2181
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,360
that and we're all wise to that on one

2182
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,000
level and on the other level we are

2183
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,840
completely influenced by it. So we're

2184
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,080
now walking around in a world where

2185
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:37,040
we're constantly being told we are in

2186
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,719
danger. I'm not I'm not here to, you

2187
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,320
know, I'm not anti-technology. It's

2188
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:43,520
great. It can do so many good things,

2189
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:45,760
but it's like food. You got to eat it in

2190
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,760
the right way. If you if you overeat,

2191
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,440
you get sick. If you not discerning

2192
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,840
about what you eat, you're going to get

2193
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:55,199
ill. It's the same with technology.

2194
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,679
And so yeah, fear is now used in every

2195
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:59,679
every walk of life. Fear is used more

2196
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,360
than ever in politics to to make us

2197
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,679
afraid so that we vote for people

2198
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,840
because of fear. Fear is used so much

2199
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:08,480
now to make us go shopping, hurry up

2200
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,080
while stocks last. So what do we do

2201
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,480
about that when we live in a world that

2202
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,800
is

2203
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:17,360
commercially driven or driven by power

2204
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,440
dynamics that mean that fear is just a

2205
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,760
great motivator and a great way to

2206
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,080
influence? I think we we have to protect

2207
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,760
our minds with meditation. Does this

2208
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,000
mean like throw your phone away and

2209
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,000
don't go outside? What does it mean? No.

2210
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,719
Don't throw your phone away. Don't don't

2211
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,920
go and run away to the mountains. Learn

2212
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:38,880
to face the fear. Learn to be fearless

2213
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,760
in a frightened world. And I think this

2214
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:44,320
is something very practical because I I

2215
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,560
do this through practicing microscopic

2216
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,840
moments of meditation in busy

2217
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,840
situations. What does that mean? So, I

2218
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,239
might be standing in a queue and I'll

2219
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,800
feel the ground under my feet. I might

2220
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:58,960
be in an airport queuing up and instead

2221
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,920
of going into that impatience thing and

2222
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,800
the stressy mode or or checking my

2223
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,880
phone, I'll I'll do a mo moment of

2224
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,400
meditation. Something that's very

2225
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,960
important to me is to meditate every

2226
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,120
day, sitting down and doing it kind of

2227
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,880
formally, but also these micro moments

2228
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:17,199
throughout the day. Tiny moments where

2229
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,800
you just become aware of yourself,

2230
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,800
become aware of the ground under your

2231
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,480
feet, become aware of your shoulders,

2232
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,639
drop your shoulders, be aware of them,

2233
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,480
become aware of your breathing. And I

2234
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,159
find this if you do this in cues and

2235
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,159
traffic jams, it changes your entire

2236
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,520
reality

2237
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,520
because what are you doing? You're re

2238
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,280
you're rew you're rewiring your own

2239
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,400
brain.

2240
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:40,639
You you know how whenever we're in a

2241
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,480
stuck situation like a queue or a

2242
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:46,960
traffic jam, we are wired to respond

2243
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:50,000
with tension and impatience.

2244
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,560
But if you do a mic micro moment of

2245
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
mindfulness, you're changing the wiring.

2246
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:57,600
You're teaching yourself that you can

2247
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,080
meet stress in a calm way. You can be

2248
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,840
okay with being stuck in in the traffic.

2249
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,679
So what that does is it then makes you

2250
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,760
more fearless because you're almost like

2251
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,440
looking forward to the next traffic jam

2252
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,800
whereas most of us are just reacting to

2253
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,280
situations instead of reacting you're

2254
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,880
thinking bring it on.

2255
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,800
There is a gap isn't there between what

2256
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,040
happens and how we react. That's the

2257
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:21,120
crucial gap. the gap between impulse and

2258
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:24,159
action because so much is reaction.

2259
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:27,440
So so much of I think we spend so much

2260
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:30,080
of our lives just reacting

2261
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,800
in in in the I feel hungry so I eat

2262
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,360
somebody says hello I say hello but even

2263
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,040
on a momentto- moment basis how much are

2264
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,880
we consciously living and how much are

2265
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,800
we just reacting

2266
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,199
and so when we can find that gap between

2267
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,440
the impulse and the action and make a

2268
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:47,360
different choice

2269
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,280
I think it's almost like in every moment

2270
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:53,280
we're we're standing at a fork in the

2271
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:54,800
road In every moment, what one road is

2272
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,880
the road of reaction and the other road

2273
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,040
is the road of response.

2274
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:01,760
Meditation helps you pause and see you

2275
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,440
could make a choice. I don't have to get

2276
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,600
stressed out in traffic. I could instead

2277
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,600
be mindful or I don't have to get I

2278
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,120
don't have to my colleague at work is

2279
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,280
grumpy. I don't have to bite their head

2280
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,440
off and then regret it. I could I could

2281
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,320
hold back.

2282
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,360
So you say meditation is the solution to

2283
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,040
many of the things we've talked about

2284
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,040
today including the response versus

2285
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:23,040
reaction fork in the road. Yeah. So if

2286
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,880
you were making a plan for me from this

2287
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,360
day onwards on how to implement

2288
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,840
meditation in my life. Yeah. Um what

2289
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,679
would that plan look like? First of all,

2290
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,560
chuck all those things away. Okay. All

2291
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,719
of this stuff on the desk.

2292
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,239
Paraphernalia. Okay. So on the desk I

2293
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,480
have like a sound healing bowl, some

2294
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:40,639
incense, some rings, some little I don't

2295
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,280
even know what these are. Yeah. So,

2296
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,040
we're going to chuck all the

2297
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,920
paraphernalia away in the bin. Okay,

2298
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:48,320
we're going to bin all of it. Okay, let

2299
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,920
me You know, you don't need any

2300
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,800
equipment.

2301
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:57,520
There's a lot of spiritual tat, isn't

2302
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:59,760
there? I mean, I said it.

2303
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:03,440
You know, it's about you and your mind.

2304
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:06,880
It's not about having little symbols and

2305
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,520
incense and you don't need it. And okay,

2306
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,440
what is the plan? The plan is to start

2307
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,760
with 10 minutes a day. Okay. 10 minutes

2308
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:16,560
a day. When?

2309
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,400
Ideally morning. Okay. Simply because

2310
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,080
you're starting your day, right? And

2311
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,520
your cortisol level is highest in the

2312
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,440
morning. When you wake up, there's a

2313
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,120
spike of cortisol. Bring it down with

2314
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,320
meditation. So, I get up, I check my

2315
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,600
emails, check my WhatsApp, then

2316
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,040
meditate. I'm joking. If you want. No,

2317
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,560
no. Tell me the the optimal way. You're

2318
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,080
going to be my Get up straight away and

2319
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,600
meditate. Okay. Get up straight away and

2320
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,080
meditate because you're starting your

2321
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,520
day, right? And 10 minutes is enough to

2322
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,360
start with. And the beauty of this is

2323
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,800
that you know they can show in brain

2324
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,159
scans that 10 minutes a day after 4 days

2325
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,400
there'll be visible changes in your

2326
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:50,320
brain. So knowing that keeps you going

2327
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,920
because you think okay this literally is

2328
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,080
like weight training. I'm going to get

2329
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,560
muscle. And what do I do? So I sit down

2330
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,920
somewhere. You sit down

2331
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,719
and you're going to focus on your

2332
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:03,120
breathing. But what I find really

2333
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,360
crucial is that you are not just

2334
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,880
launching yourself into it. you are

2335
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,840
introducing

2336
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,520
a bit of compassion into the process and

2337
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,080
this is what elevates the meditation

2338
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,639
from being just a kind of brain gym into

2339
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,960
being something that takes you to a much

2340
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,120
more kind of like spiritual realm of it

2341
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,400
and and it connects in with what we were

2342
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,320
talking about earlier about learning to

2343
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,239
be more compassionate to yourself and

2344
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,760
others. So you start with that

2345
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,400
intention.

2346
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,080
So you start by just settling and

2347
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,440
sitting. You know, some people sit

2348
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,120
cross-legged on the floor, but it's also

2349
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:38,080
okay on a chair. But on the chair, there

2350
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:40,239
should be some sense of posture. So

2351
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,639
you're sitting up straight. And you

2352
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:45,440
would start with setting the intention.

2353
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:47,199
And I don't mean an intention such as,

2354
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,800
oh, today I want this or want that. It's

2355
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:52,159
the bigger intention. Why am I

2356
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:55,120
meditating? I am meditating for not only

2357
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:57,600
myself, but for all living beings. I'm

2358
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:59,679
doing this for me and the world. And I'm

2359
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,480
not I'm not not trying to fool myself by

2360
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:05,199
thinking if I do my meditation somehow

2361
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,520
wars will end or whatever. No, it's more

2362
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:09,280
that if I do this this will help me

2363
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,120
become more effective in the world and

2364
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,120
spread more love and compassion. So

2365
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,280
that's the reason. So you're setting

2366
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,840
that intention with your thinking for a

2367
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,960
few moments and then you're going to

2368
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:26,400
start to be aware of yourself.

2369
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:28,400
So okay. So let's just try this.

2370
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:31,400
So take a moment to set the intention of

2371
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,400
compassion

2372
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:38,920
making the intention that you're doing

2373
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,920
the practice for yourself and others.

2374
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,239
And now just become aware of your hands.

2375
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,280
Maybe your hands are resting on your

2376
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:52,880
knees or your legs.

2377
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,719
And feel that there's a lot of nerve

2378
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,280
endings in the fingers. So, it's easy to

2379
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,600
start here where you just feel the

2380
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:02,600
contact between your skin and your

2381
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,600
clothing.

2382
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,480
You're aware of your hands resting on

2383
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,480
your legs.

2384
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:19,120
Bring the focus up to your shoulders.

2385
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:23,040
Most of us have tense shoulders because

2386
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,719
we're on our phone or behind a desk. So,

2387
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:29,639
as you're aware of your shoulders, the

2388
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,639
tension can just drop away.

2389
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,199
Bring your focus to the front of your

2390
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:40,199
body.

2391
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,639
Start to notice your breathing.

2392
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,840
The trick here is not to try to breathe

2393
01:32:53,600 --> 01:33:00,040
or go into deep breathing, but just let

2394
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,040
your breath be natural

2395
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,159
and focus on the rising and falling of

2396
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,120
your chest or your belly with each

2397
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:14,480
breath.

2398
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,080
And when you realize your mind has

2399
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,080
wandered, gently come back to the

2400
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,080
breath.

2401
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:25,360
Now you can make the focus more precise

2402
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,800
by feeling the air in your nose or your

2403
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,280
mouth. If you can breathe through your

2404
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,840
nose, then do that,

2405
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,520
otherwise the mouth. And you're sensing

2406
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,960
the air as it comes in and out of your

2407
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,560
nostrils or your lips.

2408
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,159
You can feel the air brushing against

2409
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,320
the skin at the edge of your nose or

2410
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,320
your mouth.

2411
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,880
And then you'll realize your mind has

2412
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,120
gone somewhere and you gently bring it

2413
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,360
back.

2414
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:58,000
Okay. And to end the session, we'll just

2415
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:01,960
do a short one for now. Take another

2416
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,960
moment to think about compassion.

2417
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:10,480
You're dedicating your practice to

2418
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:14,159
freedom, compassion, and happiness for

2419
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:16,560
yourself and all beings.

2420
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:18,159
and stop there.

2421
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,440
I mean, that was short, but it gives you

2422
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:23,600
an idea of the process. And one major

2423
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,280
warning

2424
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,639
is you trip yourself up if you try and

2425
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,320
think, well, did it go well?

2426
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,960
Partly because of the culture we're in

2427
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,480
and how everything is about sensation. I

2428
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,920
think we only think something's working

2429
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:42,080
if it makes us feel something. Mhm. And

2430
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,679
med meditation is very different. You

2431
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,280
know, when I start when I first started

2432
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,800
meditating, I described how I really

2433
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,639
hated it and found it, you know, really

2434
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,239
stressful. One thing I remember that

2435
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,600
happened to me was I started to do quite

2436
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,800
a lot of it cuz I thought, okay, I'm

2437
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,360
going to get into this thing and do it

2438
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,679
and become like a a pro and I was doing

2439
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:00,239
loads of it and finding it was making me

2440
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:02,000
feel more unhappy and I was feeling this

2441
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:04,400
kind of sense of like sinking feeling in

2442
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
my chest and I thought, you know, I' I'd

2443
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,159
struggled with depression anyway. I

2444
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,320
thought this making me more depressed

2445
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:12,080
and I went to Rimpiche my teacher and I

2446
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,520
said medit I'm doing loads of it it's

2447
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:16,480
making me depressed he said it's nothing

2448
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,400
to do with the meditation it's it's how

2449
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,040
you are

2450
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:24,000
he said you're a junkie

2451
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,520
you're using your meditation like a drug

2452
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,639
I said what do you mean he said well I

2453
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,360
think you're sitting there waiting for

2454
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,679
it to to kind of like come on you're

2455
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:33,679
waiting for it to give you a high and

2456
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,360
it's so true because I realized I'd been

2457
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,360
sitting

2458
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,560
or like getting addicted to it and

2459
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,159
thinking, okay, I'm going to do my

2460
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,600
meditation,

2461
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:43,760
right? I've done 5 minutes. Where's

2462
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,679
where's the bliss? When am I going to

2463
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,040
feel good?

2464
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,880
And what he was trying to tell me is

2465
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:51,520
that if I'm trying to make myself feel

2466
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:54,159
good, I'm already coming from a place of

2467
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,600
lack.

2468
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:57,600
You know what I mean? I'm already saying

2469
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,920
to myself, I don't feel good. So, I'm

2470
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,840
actually promoting

2471
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,840
a sense of lack. So how do we perceive

2472
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,760
the meditation then? If it's not at some

2473
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,960
just give up judgment. Just do it. Just

2474
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,560
do it. Just do it. And it's not going

2475
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,639
well, going badly. I like it. I don't

2476
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:17,400
like it. You just do it. And try to let

2477
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:17,400
go of quality control.

2478
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,000
I really need to start doing it. My

2479
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,760
partner, she's so great. She does it

2480
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,760
every morning for like 20 20 30 minutes.

2481
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,400
So why didn't you sit next to her? She

2482
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,239
said this to me. What stops you? What

2483
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:33,239
stops me?

2484
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:33,239
Hm.

2485
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:38,080
I mean, it's there on tap. She's doing

2486
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,280
it every morning. What's stopping you s

2487
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:44,679
sitting next to her?

2488
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,679
I think

2489
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:52,320
I think one of the things that comes to

2490
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:55,280
mind is how uncomfortable I feel in

2491
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:58,000
silence and

2492
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,320
the idea of like silence and being

2493
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,800
because she's there. Would you be okay

2494
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,560
better on your own then? No, it's just

2495
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:08,320
like silence with my own thoughts. I

2496
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:11,199
spend a lot of time trying to kind of

2497
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:13,199
not I spend a lot of time trying to

2498
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:15,440
distract myself.

2499
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,520
Don't we all? That's Welcome to the

2500
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,280
modern world. I'm pretty extreme. Are

2501
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,199
you? Yeah, I'm pretty extreme. So like

2502
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,800
if I go into the shower, I have to have

2503
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,000
something playing something talking. A

2504
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,960
podcast. It could be the news. It could

2505
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,639
be YouTube. If I'm no matter where I am,

2506
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,880
I always even when I go to sleep, I have

2507
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,719
to be listening to something. So my I've

2508
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,400
like almost wired my brain in the

2509
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,080
opposite way where it's there's always

2510
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,679
something. Yeah. I went through a phase

2511
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,880
where I couldn't eat unless I was also

2512
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:41,199
watching something. I mean, yeah. I

2513
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,639
mean, I do that. I can't unless there's

2514
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:44,400
something playing. But that's why

2515
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,480
meditation's perfect for you. Yeah, I

2516
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,119
know. Tell me about it. This is giving

2517
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:53,880
you a way to find a different way to

2518
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:53,880
experience yourself. M

2519
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,600
Yeah. I mean, you know, you I'm sure you

2520
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:02,320
exercise. Yeah. So, you go to the gym.

2521
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:04,080
Yeah. And you That's challenging. Yeah.

2522
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,679
And you you're you're pushing your

2523
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,280
muscles and there's a kind of like

2524
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,360
there's an effort required. Do you know

2525
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:12,000
what it is? Same thing. Same thing with

2526
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,960
the gym. I know that if I go, my muscles

2527
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,840
are going to grow. I'm going to be

2528
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,600
stronger. I'm going to be health

2529
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,440
healthier, happier. All those things.

2530
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,119
And because I've never done meditation,

2531
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:21,280
I don't actually have evidence of the

2532
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:23,119
upside. Just have a brain scan after 4

2533
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,719
days and you'll see. That's why I ask

2534
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:27,520
you the question about you before and

2535
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:29,360
you after. Yeah. What is the difference?

2536
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,040
And if whoever's listening to this right

2537
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,560
now,

2538
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,320
can you give them a before and after

2539
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,080
picture of how their life will will be

2540
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,840
practically different if they implement

2541
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:40,639
just 10 minutes a day meditating. Okay.

2542
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,239
So, so I find it really inspiring to

2543
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,400
know that there there are visible

2544
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,920
changes in the brain scan after 4 days.

2545
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,239
You don't necessarily feel those

2546
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,239
changes, but knowing that gives you

2547
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:53,520
faith and confidence just like you know

2548
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:54,960
if you eat healthy food your your you

2549
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,639
know your body will improve your health

2550
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,360
will improve. So knowing that is a good

2551
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:01,040
thing in terms of seeing the results.

2552
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:03,040
Everybody's different. There's no you

2553
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,880
can't draw a graph. You can't say if you

2554
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,920
do x amount of days you will reach this

2555
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,159
level of calm or focus. But what happens

2556
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,719
is as you start to meditate after a few

2557
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:16,560
days or weeks you just start to feel you

2558
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:19,679
can handle stuff better. So for me um

2559
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,040
the the p my main practice is is very

2560
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,920
much connected what I was talking about

2561
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:27,119
before with uh trying to sit with

2562
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,360
discomfort and stop pushing it away. And

2563
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:32,719
that's a total revolution in my life. I

2564
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:34,560
was always on the run always. I think we

2565
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:37,280
failed to realize that actually our

2566
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:42,480
entire

2567
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:44,000
human experience is just in our minds.

2568
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,840
That does that make sense what I'm

2569
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,440
trying to say there? Because I'm there

2570
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,679
asking you about like what's the upside

2571
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:51,199
of this whatever but it's it's falling

2572
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,760
into the trap of not realizing that

2573
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:55,760
everything I I will experience today is

2574
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,320
actually formed in my own mind. That's

2575
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,920
the whole reason for meditation is to

2576
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,600
know that everything is dependent on

2577
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,920
your mind. The good and the bad.

2578
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:06,080
everything. So instead of being so

2579
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:09,520
obsessed with the details of what's

2580
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:11,920
going on, go to the source.

2581
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,600
Yeah. Go to the source, the the

2582
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:19,119
projector rather than the movie.

2583
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:21,199
Go to the source and and change that and

2584
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:22,800
transform that and work on that. So how

2585
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:25,119
has your projector changed in the last

2586
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,639
30 years? I I'm definitely a happier

2587
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:31,280
person. I'm I'm definitely um more at

2588
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:34,719
peace with myself. that that negative

2589
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:38,320
voice doesn't come up, you know, that

2590
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:41,600
that self-hatred has has really kind of

2591
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:45,760
like what's the word? Kind of like uh

2592
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:49,040
yeah, gone away. And um I'm happier. And

2593
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:52,639
I've got I I feel so so lucky to have

2594
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:54,239
tools that I know I can use when I'm

2595
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,679
suffering.

2596
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:57,040
You know, for the last few years, I've

2597
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:59,040
I've suffered with quite a lot of ill

2598
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,280
health because I had really really

2599
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:03,280
severe COVID right at the start of the

2600
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,719
pandemic, and it did something to my

2601
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,119
heart and my lungs. And since then, I've

2602
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:08,719
had you could call it long COVID, you

2603
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:11,199
could call it heart, lung damage,

2604
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:13,119
whatever. So, I I live with kind of

2605
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:16,159
levels of illness that are hard to deal

2606
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:18,000
with. But this practice is something I

2607
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:20,960
can do. I can I can sit there with an

2608
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,440
ill body and send love into that body

2609
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,480
and feel kind of okay. So, it's made me

2610
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:28,560
stronger and I can I can function better

2611
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,639
than before. But, you know, the other

2612
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,400
thing is I don't really care. I don't

2613
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,400
really care whether it's working or not

2614
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:36,639
because I I trust it and I'm just going

2615
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:38,560
to keep going and I I'm in for the long

2616
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:41,040
game. I'm just going to keep going. You

2617
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,920
signed a lifelong vow. I did. I'm I'm

2618
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:46,639
I'm I have I have taken vows to to be a

2619
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:49,520
monk for my life. Why? When I put the

2620
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:52,080
robes on, I felt every I felt every cell

2621
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:54,480
in my body

2622
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,639
click. I mean, it sounds a bit weird,

2623
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,560
but it just felt like that. I felt all

2624
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,639
my cells fall into place. I just felt

2625
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:03,600
really this is

2626
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:05,199
this is this is really right for me. I

2627
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:09,520
think it's what I'd been looking for all

2628
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:11,760
along when I is is a way of working with

2629
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,199
my mind. I'm I'm not really interested

2630
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,119
in religion. I'm not really interested

2631
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:18,159
in faith, but I'm really interested in

2632
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:20,560
the mind. And being a monk has given me

2633
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:23,920
this opportunity to work on my mind but

2634
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:26,719
also an opportunity to to be of some use

2635
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,880
in the world like some help to others.

2636
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:31,040
So, okay, let me challenge this a little

2637
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,960
bit in terms of how I imagine someone

2638
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,719
listening might might respond. They go,

2639
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,800
"Okay, so you went through this process.

2640
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,800
You worked on your mind. Now you've

2641
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,840
worked on your mind." No, no, working.

2642
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,440
It's not over. Okay. It total work in

2643
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,719
progress. And this is the this is part

2644
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,840
of the misconception is someone will

2645
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,760
listen and say, "Well, you've worked on

2646
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,320
your mind now, so go live now." No, it's

2647
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,920
an ongoing process. I'm still a mess.

2648
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,920
I'm still a mess, but I'm okay with

2649
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,080
being a mess. That is a huge difference

2650
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,320
is that I I still get stressed. I still

2651
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,560
get upset, but I'm really gentle with

2652
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,719
myself in a way that I never knew how to

2653
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,840
be. I was always, "You're so disgusting.

2654
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,560
What's wrong with you? You should be

2655
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,719
ashamed of yourself." That's gone. Now

2656
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,119
I'm okay with with myself. And that

2657
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,880
that's such that that is happiness that

2658
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:14,159
really has made me happier. So it's for

2659
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,679
me it's not about, oh, you've done it

2660
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:18,960
and now it's it's a it's ongoing.

2661
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,920
What is the most important thing we

2662
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,239
didn't talk about that we should have

2663
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,639
talked about as it relates to the

2664
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:27,280
suffering that my viewers are probably

2665
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:29,920
experiencing in their own life? You know

2666
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:32,719
what's missing always is we can talk

2667
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,960
about this stuff but are we going to do

2668
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:37,440
it? And what's really missing for so

2669
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,280
many people is they will listen to this

2670
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:41,920
episode or they will read a book about

2671
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:44,639
meditation or see a video and it all

2672
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,480
sounds great but then we get busy and

2673
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:49,920
forget to do it. What's missing for

2674
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:52,080
everybody is the doing it. How how do we

2675
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,239
jump from being interested in something

2676
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:56,639
to actually doing it? I mean there's

2677
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:58,480
there's a a joke which is the definition

2678
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,000
of a Buddhist is somebody who's either

2679
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:02,239
meditating or feeling bad that they're

2680
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,320
not meditating. And that is it, isn't

2681
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,719
it? It's a bit like exercise. We know we

2682
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,840
should be doing it. So for me the the

2683
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,360
the missing link is

2684
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,639
people try and force themselves to

2685
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,960
meditate because they know it's good for

2686
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:17,199
them and then it's it's a hopeless

2687
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:19,360
process. They won't do it because it

2688
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:22,080
becomes another should

2689
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:23,760
on the to-do list. I think the only way

2690
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:27,440
to become really enthusiastic about

2691
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:30,080
doing it every day is to really think

2692
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:32,960
about it and realize that it will give

2693
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,760
you what you were looking for anyway

2694
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,159
from the coffee, the drugs, the alcohol,

2695
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:42,880
the sex, the whatever it is you're into,

2696
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:45,280
whatever we're looking for out there.

2697
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:47,679
Meditation it was happiness. It was

2698
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:49,600
freedom. It was release. The only place

2699
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:52,320
you can find that is in your mind

2700
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:55,199
because going down those roads is just

2701
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:57,199
taking you further into needing more.

2702
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:58,880
So, so I think that the the thinking

2703
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:01,520
process that helps people meditate every

2704
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:04,080
day is to think about how it will give

2705
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,920
you what you were looking for anyway

2706
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,920
and then you want to do it then then you

2707
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,520
feel like oh okay the we have no sense

2708
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,320
of exhaustion when it comes to chasing

2709
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:18,159
our addictions do we? So imagine if we

2710
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:20,639
could meditate with that kind of energy.

2711
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:23,520
I often often think I often think maybe

2712
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:25,440
I need to go do some kind of um

2713
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,920
meditation retreat as well just to get

2714
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:30,880
me sort of started and just uh have

2715
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,239
someone there with me who can

2716
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,159
help me think through some of these

2717
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:35,760
things that can be a good thing just to

2718
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:39,199
just to get started. It doesn't have to

2719
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,520
be four years like no like a weekend, 3

2720
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:43,199
days, 5 days, 2 days. That can be a good

2721
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,840
thing. And that's why Buddhist centers

2722
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:48,159
are good places because they offer that.

2723
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,760
And there's never a kind of you got to

2724
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:52,000
sign along the dotted line and say, "I'm

2725
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:54,719
now a Buddhist." We're so not interested

2726
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,400
in converting people to Buddhism. But

2727
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,159
yeah, go to a retreat. Is Buddhism

2728
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,360
growing? Yeah, I imagine it is. In the

2729
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:01,119
world, you know why it's growing? It's

2730
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:04,000
because it doesn't try to attract

2731
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:06,000
followers and because of that, it grows.

2732
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,960
interesting and also because of

2733
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,840
everything else that's just going on in

2734
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,520
the world at the moment um with you know

2735
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,719
people feeling more isolated, lonely,

2736
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,480
purposeless, depression, suicidality,

2737
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:18,000
all of these things. We're seeing a lot

2738
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:19,360
especially in young men as well. The

2739
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,760
stats around young men and their

2740
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:24,080
suicidal ideation and their feelings of

2741
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,239
purposelessness and their loneliness

2742
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,800
stats are worse than women's as well.

2743
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:31,119
But I think yes the the way the world is

2744
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:34,000
with all of these challenges and

2745
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:37,119
negative things at the same time what's

2746
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,560
hugely growing in modern culture is

2747
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:40,320
people getting more interested in their

2748
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,239
own minds. There are more and more

2749
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:44,639
people going for psychotherapy

2750
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:46,080
counseling meditation any kind of

2751
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,600
discipline that helps us to understand

2752
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,159
our minds better. That interest is

2753
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,760
growing. So, we're we're in a really

2754
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:55,360
exciting phase in history where people

2755
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,639
are wanting to transform their minds,

2756
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,639
wanting to take control of

2757
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:01,280
consciousness. It's because we've had

2758
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:03,199
something fail us. We maybe we're waking

2759
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,840
up to realizing that the system hasn't

2760
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:08,880
worked for us. We've created a kind of

2761
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:11,520
gilded cage for ourselves. This this

2762
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,199
beautiful material world that is also

2763
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,520
running out of resources. So, it's not

2764
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:18,239
going to be able to serve us much longer

2765
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:20,239
if we carry on abusing the planet. So,

2766
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:23,119
we have created our own prison and now

2767
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:25,199
we're looking for the way out.

2768
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:28,000
Turns out it wasn't the individualism

2769
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:31,600
and the materialism

2770
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:35,280
um after all.

2771
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:38,000
Maybe it was always there inside us.

2772
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:40,080
That's Buddhism would say that we we are

2773
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,679
we are Buddha within. We we all have a

2774
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:46,159
sleeping Buddha within us and we we have

2775
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:48,639
potential. We have great capacity for

2776
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:51,600
awakening, great capacity to help

2777
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:54,080
others. It's just like a crystal covered

2778
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,480
in layers and layers and layers of mud.

2779
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,840
And we need to clear the mud away. We

2780
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,119
have a closing tradition on this podcast

2781
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,960
where the last guest leaves a question

2782
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:04,239
for the next guest, not knowing who

2783
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,719
they've left it for. And the question

2784
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:08,560
that has been left for you,

2785
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:10,480
what are the ways that you express your

2786
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,320
love and appreciation for the people who

2787
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:15,440
matter to you in your personal or

2788
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:16,960
professional life?

2789
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,800
I

2790
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,760
don't do this very well all the time,

2791
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:24,639
but I try to be be there for them when

2792
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:26,800
they're going through a hard time. I

2793
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:29,600
because I used to find it really scary

2794
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,520
and I'd run away and I'd close down. I

2795
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,639
try to in the same way as I try to move

2796
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,239
towards my own discomfort. I try to be

2797
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:38,960
there with other people when they're

2798
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:41,199
uncomfortable and not judge. I try that.

2799
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,840
I'm I've I'm sure I fail a lot, but I

2800
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:45,840
try. A friend of mine described that as

2801
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,239
sitting in the mud with them. Yeah.

2802
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:51,280
Yeah. We often try and fix and correct

2803
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:53,040
and Yeah. I have a I see myself trying

2804
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,400
to do that, give advice, whatever. It's

2805
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,600
not about that. It's about being with

2806
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:00,080
the person, being being

2807
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,840
with them without judging them. Thank

2808
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,960
you so much for what you do. Um you've

2809
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,320
got these incredible books which I'm

2810
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,159
going to recommend everybody check out.

2811
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,000
Both Sunday Times bestsellers I believe.

2812
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:10,719
And a monk's guide to happiness,

2813
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,119
meditation in the 21st century. And this

2814
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:16,239
book is called Handbook for Hard Times,

2815
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:17,840
a monk's guide to fearless living. I

2816
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:19,119
think that your message is more

2817
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,360
important now than it's ever been

2818
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:22,719
because there's I mean much of the

2819
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,320
reason why I've probably stumbled across

2820
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:26,159
Buddhism is for the same reasons that

2821
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,920
many people are, which is it feels

2822
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:29,280
intuitively like the the answers we've

2823
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:32,080
been given in the way of life that we're

2824
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,159
all living is failing us in some way.

2825
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:35,920
And we know that we can feel it inside

2826
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:37,440
ourselves. But the answers that we see

2827
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,159
to

2828
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:42,400
as antidotes to that feeling aren't much

2829
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:44,239
better all the time. And there again

2830
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,840
often they're about self or it's about

2831
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:48,159
you know join this group of people that

2832
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:51,040
are doing this sort of thing over here

2833
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:52,800
or there's this religious you know group

2834
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,719
that you can join. But actually,

2835
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,239
Buddhism offers us an alternative

2836
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:59,600
approach, which is to go inside

2837
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:01,199
ourselves and to alleviate ourselves

2838
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,920
from the suffering that we've

2839
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:05,440
self-imposed by

2840
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,719
understanding that maybe the answers we

2841
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,719
were looking for were inside the whole

2842
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:11,119
time. And um I'm so glad that people

2843
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,239
like you do podcasts like this because

2844
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,520
that you're getting the message out

2845
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:15,040
there into the world. And it's a message

2846
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,760
that I think is so unbelievably

2847
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:20,880
important. And I think maybe maybe just

2848
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,960
maybe maybe you've persuaded me today to

2849
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,239
just give it a shot. Yeah. And that's

2850
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,840
the hard thing because it's good. It's

2851
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:28,000
good enough. It's all well enough

2852
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,880
knowing about something. But then what

2853
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,639
will I do tomorrow morning?

2854
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,920
When you sit there tomorrow morning.

2855
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:37,679
Yeah. And your mind starts racing.

2856
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:39,520
Whatever you do, don't feel like you

2857
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:41,760
failed.

2858
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,800
Just remind yourself that the thoughts

2859
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:47,360
actually make your meditation stronger.

2860
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,199
Because if coming back to the breath is

2861
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,199
what you're trying to do, you have to

2862
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:52,800
have somewhere to come back from. Yeah.

2863
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:54,880
The thought that took you away is

2864
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:57,280
exactly what brings you back. So bring

2865
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,360
it on. The more thoughts, the better.

2866
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,880
Okay.

2867
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,000
Thank you. I'm so appreciative of you

2868
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,360
and thank you for spreading the words

2869
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,679
that you're you're spreading because as

2870
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,960
I said, you're going to be saving and uh

2871
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:08,719
saving a lot of people from a lot of

2872
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,760
pain and suffering, but also um giving

2873
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,520
them a an alternative approach to

2874
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,440
sitting with it with a compassion. So

2875
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:19,239
thank you. Thank you. It's really lovely

2876
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,239
to spend time with you.
