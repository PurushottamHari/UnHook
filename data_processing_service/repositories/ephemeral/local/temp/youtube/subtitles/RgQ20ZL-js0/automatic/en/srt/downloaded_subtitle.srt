1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
There is a word in Indian sports which

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,919
everybody knows about but

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,920
no one wants to speak about it.  No athletes or

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,240
coaches take steroids.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,880

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,680
Watch the video carefully as it appears on the screen.  Gaurav Mathur's friend

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,960
and others are not prepared to leave him off.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,599
This is the 5000m race at the National Open Championships in 2023.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
Usually in sports,

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,480
players compete to win.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,719
But watch this video carefully.  There is something different going on in this.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,000

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,800
Six athletes are trying

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
not to accidentally win.

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,280
why?  Because these players found out

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,399
that anti-doping officials had

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,399
come to their tournament that morning.

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,960
This means that whichever are the top three players,

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,920
they will have a test.  With this, the six

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,719
players were trying not to win by mistake.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,080

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,680
And this is not an isolated incident.   The

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,000

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,080
finals for the 100m race of the Delhi State Championship were being held in September 2023.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,360
But only one player out of eight was

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,520
ready to run away.  Lalit Kumar.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,520
That's why Lalit ran this race alone.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,200
And the story is not over yet.  A few weeks

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,920
later, Lalit received an email

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,640
that he too has been banned for taking drugs.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,799
So brother what is going on?  On one hand, there is

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
talk of hosting the Olympics in Ahmedabad

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,680
and on the other hand, seven out of eight

34
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
athletes do not even participate because they will be

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
tested.  The root of all these things

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,520
is doping in Indian sports.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
India has been number one when it comes to

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
doping offences.  Recently, Olympic gold

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
medalist Neeraj Chopra also said that

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,600
doping has become a big problem among Indian athletes.

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
Actually, nowadays there is a

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
huge problem with doping in India.  In

43
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,879
fact,

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
you will not have to work hard to catch these steroids.

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,120
Like sports

46
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,599
journalist Jnathan Salvaraj showed how

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,280
you can find cans of

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,200
EGH and EPO, two branded drugs, openly sold in stadiums across India.  Even the

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,319
doctor does

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,760
n't have this much.  Even the doctor does

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,280
n't have this much.  And to investigate this,

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,319
we spoke to athletes, coaches and

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,720
doping experts to understand the root of this problem.

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,160
And first of all let's talk

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,760
to Lalit Kumar.  A 23-year-old athlete who

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,120
ran alone and then got banned a few weeks later.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,959
Lalit's story

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,879
is not actually just about sports.  It is

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,440
about life opportunities and the decisions

60
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
that people take to move forward in their lives.

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
But if you are confused about your career

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840

introductory call about this session will be on

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,239
Friday at 7:00 pm.  So you

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,359
can join this.  We became so helpless that

96
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,840
we did not even feel like eating properly for two days.  Did

97
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,320
not like it.  It seemed as if

98
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,199
what had happened to our child.

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,360
This is Lalit Kumar.  His sports journey did

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
not start with him but started

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080
because of his father Om Prakash.  Om

102
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,960
Prakash was a district level discus throw

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,120
champion whose dream was to

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,520
win a medal for the country in athletics but his

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
dream could not be fulfilled.  He

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,000
passed this dream on to his son.  I

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,759
thought that if I survive then my children should

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
grow up.  This decision was

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,360
also practical for him.  When he moved to class six,

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,199
when we had small schools we said that

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,440
whatever we have to do for the children, we will do it for our own

112
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
children and we will not have that much money left that

113
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
we can bribe them.

114
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,960
So we thought the easiest way would be to

115
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,360
make our child athletic.

116
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,199
Lalit's journey begins with poverty and the dream of a government job.

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,160
This is Lalit.

118
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,000
This is Lalit's house.  A small house

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh.  You are lying in this very house.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Yes, yes.  It is a small house.  We do

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,280
n't have any fame.  We are poor people.  Lalit

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,600

123
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,919
started participating in sports competitions at a very young age.

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,720
First of all, this is your village, right?  Yes yes,

125
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,560
childhood was absolutely good.  We used to play here.

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Meaning that now it has developed a bit.   There was nothing

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
like this earlier.  At first it was completely empty.

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
But Lalit actually

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,080
wanted to enter wrestling or kabaddi.  Not in running.

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
No, I did not feel like it at all.

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
Papa would still scold me and send me away.  Mom

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,360
also used to scold me.  So I didn't like the fact

133
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,360
that he was making me run.  I did

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,320
not feel like it at all.  of India Bronze

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
Medal.

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,440
But yes, he was

137
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
so passionate about wrestling that

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,680
one day Lalit's father promised him

139
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,080
that if he qualifies for the Nationals,

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
he will get an Android phone.

141
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,000
So what the phones were like at that time was that

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,400
we used to look for an Android phone from our friends

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
because I had rich friends and they had it.  I

144
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
mean, my father

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,000
says that no one will make you stronger than me, so I got a

146
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
silver medal from there,

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
after the silver medal, my father got me a phone,

148
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
but that is why many poor athletes

149
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
become runners because

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
in wrestling you need a lot of guidance.

151
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Training is required.  Whereas

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
in Kabaddi it is a group sport.  So you have to

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
depend on others.  Whereas

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
you can do running yourself without any

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,960
equipment.

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,960
It was a very good race.  The track was very fast

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,840
and Dayant Singh, who was a four-time youth national 800m

158
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,840
champion, is today a coach.

159
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,240
He has seen the same pattern

160
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,800
in his students.  They come from a normal family or

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800
below normal because they

162
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,240
feel that this is a game and we do

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
not need much in it.

164
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
No equipment required.  We just have to run away.  So,

165
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,039
along with running, one has to take great care of many things like

166
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,039
recovery diet.  Only then does one

167
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,960
realise that it is not like one has to

168
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
run away from this and it is very easy to run away.

169
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,360
But at that time, Lalit was not thinking about a government job,

170
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,080
rather he was thinking that

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
if he won the competition, his family would

172
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
get some help.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
I got a medal in the state and then in Gloster.  Then

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,759
after that

175
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,000
he waived off 70-50, maybe 60% of my school fees.  And the

176
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,800
annual charges were also made absolutely

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,360
free. After winning one medal each, this

178
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,599
boy from Jewar started dreaming again.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,400
Lalit used to participate in competitions

180
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,199
and win medals.  As soon as he

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,160
won the medal his dreams grew bigger.  At that time it seemed

182
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,080
as if I had to win a national medal.  You will

183
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
get money and the financial condition of your family will

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,240
improve a lot.  But do

185
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
nâ€™t be mislead into thinking that these athletes

186
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
dream of becoming Olympic medalists.

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
Their dreams are very practical.

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
What is there in sports career is like

189
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,080
we represent the nation.

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
After doing national representation, we

191
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
also get a good government job.  Due to which the

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
financial condition of the house also improves

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,440
and we feel like we are like the government.

194
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,840
So I might as well step my game up.   The

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
same thing was told to us by Delhi's top athletic coach

196
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,319
Dinesh Rawat.  Mainly those who are poor, the

197
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
poor ones, their only concern is that they will get

198
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
some job from here, then they will get a job

199
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
later and some who get a good level, then

200
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
they

201
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,120
think of doing something for the country, that they have to do something.

202
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
Firstly, those of you who belong to the middle class and

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
lower middle class come here with the thought

204
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,599
that they will get a job or something will happen and in this way they will

205
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,599
get monetary benefits.

206
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,760
Indian athletes are not dreaming

207
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
that they will win the gold medal in the Beijing Olympics.

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,640
He is dreaming that he will

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,640
get a government job which will help him get his house

210
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,959
fixed.  Their parents will

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,120
get some money.  He will stop working.

212
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,680
Like Lalit's performance was good.

213
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,320
He got a good opportunity to

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,880

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
get admission in the university through sports quota.  So he got

216
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,959
selected at two places for further studies.  Either

217
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,920
in Aligarh Muslim University or

218
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,320
in Delhi University.  So he decided that

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,200
brother papa, Delhi facilities are good.

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,600
We will get information there and the track will also be correct there.

221
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,600

222
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
Lalit chose Delhi University.  But

223
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,120
as soon as he reached Delhi University,

224
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,760
he realized that to win the competition, not only

225
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,120
hard work is required but money is also required.  A

226
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,600

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
huge amount of money is required for training, coaching, accommodation and diet.  But to

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,000
collect this money, Lalit's father

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
left his job as a security guard

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
and started driving an auto.  Papa used to drive an auto.

231
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,399
Papa took the auto because of me.  I felt

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
very sad that because of me my father was

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,480
doing all sorts of things.

234
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,640
At that time he used to earn â‚¹ 6000 and his mother runs the household expenses

235
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,160
through the buffalo.  I was doing a job.

236
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,399
Lalit's family transfers him â‚¹6000 every month

237
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,959
so that he can eat proper food.

238
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,519
But for this, Lalit's father had to

239
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,600
work overtime.

240
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,680
How will I get money if I am not able to do it here?

241
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,519
How far will Papa give?  All these things keep going on.  If I

242
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,600
had money at that time then I wouldn't have

243
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,160
even thought about it.  Recently, India's former

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,880
badminton champion Pullela Gopichand had said

245
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,560
that if you are not rich then

246
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,120
never let your child take up sports.

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,399
They know that names like Saina Nehwal, PV

248
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,320
Sindhu and Neeraj Chopra

249
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,079
inspire millions of people in our country.  But

250
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,720
nothing happens to most of them.

251
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,040
When we spoke to several athletes,

252
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600
we discovered that there were three common things in all their stories.  The

253
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,000
first thing is that he

254
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,640
became an athlete because maybe

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,600
it was his father's dream or

256
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,839
someone became famous in the area or the right coach

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
spotted him once.  That means I

258
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
played normal local games like this.  I got my position in that.

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
Then in 2019 my sir told me to

260
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
come in the top six in the finals.  So I

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
came in the top six.  Sir called me near him.  The

262
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,560
second thing is that most athletes

263
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
come from very poor families and they

264
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,480
believe that if this boy or girl

265
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
can do so well in the village, then if he or

266
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
she gets proper resources in the city, he or she will definitely

267
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,800
win a medal for the country and

268
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:12,160
with this dream, thousands of athletes

269
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,640
come to Delhi to make this dream come true.

270
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,680
But after coming to the city, the athletes

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,240
realize that the ways of the city are very different.

272
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,200
That's why Lalit's father keeps

273
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,680
calling his coach.  When he went to Delhi,

274
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,640
we used to ask him, brother, is our son facing

275
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,560
any problem or is he behaving badly.

276
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,360
We were

277
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,000
in constant touch with those who were its cost.  And poor Lalit was

278
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,800
crushed under this pressure every day.  He

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,160
even left his education and kept focusing on just one thing â€“

280
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,240
running.   My

281
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
financial condition was also with me that I

282
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,640
am the eldest in the family so there was

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
a lot of pressure on me that brother, I am still running.

284
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,399
I don't have any earning source.

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,240
So how do I move the house forward?

286
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
Because Lalit's younger brother would also call him and

287
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,440
ask that I need some money.

288
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
But Lalit thought that how could I

289
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,399
tell him that I too don't have any money.

290
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,399
How can I give it to you?  But Lalit

291
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,200
tried to ignore all these things and

292
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,959
just focus on running because he

293
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
knew what the consequences would be if he took stress.  There is a

294
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,200
lot of stress

295
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
Sir, like if you have to play a game then you have to be

296
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
completely stress free

297
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,279
because Sir, as long as the mind of a 100 meter athlete is

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
absolutely under stress

299
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,279
then he will not be able to give his performance

300
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,120
at all.  But Lalit did not know

301
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,750
what was going to happen in his life.

302
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920

Eight people qualified for the 2023 Delhi State Championships

307
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,160
final 100m race.

[Music] The

309
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,800
winner will get a chance to compete in the Nationals

310
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:57,279
and a cash prize of Rs 3 Lakhs and this cash

311
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,279
prize means a lot to Lalit.

312
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,079
Papa used to drive an auto.  Papa

313
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,320
took the auto because of me.  I felt very sad that

314
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
because of me my father was doing all sorts of things.   My

315
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,079
 

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,079
uncle's son Bhaiya

317
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,480
gave me â‚¹ 00 for Specs.

318
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,120
I had taken those.

[MUSIC]

320
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,240
On September 26, Lalit followed his typical pre-

321
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,120
race routine.  He ate some food.

322
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,360
Drank water and filled a form where

323
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,760
he had to tell what he had eaten before the race

324
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,760
?

325
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,040
Then he started his training.

326
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,940
[MUSIC]

327
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:50,000
But Lalit was a bit tense as

328
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,880
his personal best is 11.18 seconds.

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
Last year the winner's timing was 10.92

330
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,639
seconds.  But just when he was thinking about this

331
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,279
he got another shock that his

332
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,680
other athletes

333
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,240
refused to compete because the officials of the National Anti-Doping

334
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,240
Agency had come there and they would

335
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,320
take urine samples of all the athletes.

336
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,800
Now Lalit started deciding whether he would

337
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,720
run away alone or not.  His coach

338
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
told him that he

339
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
may qualify for the Nationals but he will neither

340
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,240
get any money nor any medal for this race.

341
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,700
Lalit decided that he would

342
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:34,340
participate in the race.

343
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:34,340
[MUSIC]

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,120
And obviously there was controversy but he

345
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,760
qualified for the Nationals.  But Lalit did

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,079
not know that this could be his last official race.

347
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,160
After his solo run,

348
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,320
he was tested by anti-doping officials.

349
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
Lalit was not panicking as he

350
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,199
knew he had not done anything and

351
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,000
after several weeks a female came.  A band

352
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,000
anabolic steroid.

353
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,399

354
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,800

355
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,040
Lalit tested positive for cetirizine, a performance enhancing drug that is used for muscle building and recovery.

356
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,000
After that I got a bell saying that I was

357
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,320
definitely disturbed but after that I did

358
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,079
not tell anybody.  I came home.  I

359
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
go to his house.  First of all I

360
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,800
went to NADA office.  Officials of the National Anti-Doping Agency (

361
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,040
NADA) asked Lalit several questions like,

362
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,519
when did you take it, what did you take and

363
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,519
why did you take it?  Every athlete who is found positive for

364
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,519
doping can also undergo a second test

365
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,480
to verify it.

366
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,040
But for that they have to pay â‚¹00 which

367
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,959
Lalit does not have.  Sir,

368
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,680
what can I tell you about myself, I have been in complete depression for three-four months.

369
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,959

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,560
Lalit was banned for 4 years and it seemed as if

371
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,880
his entire life was ruined.  We became so

372
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,120
helpless that we did not even feel like eating properly for two days.  Did

373
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,040
not like it.  It

374
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,199
seemed as if what had happened to our child.

375
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,160
But the real struggle came after this ban

376
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,800
when Lalit noticed that people around him were

377
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,560
behaving very strangely.   I did

378
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
nâ€™t do this, I didnâ€™t do that.  He did

379
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,560
n't listen to me.  He did not listen at all.

380
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
Here he is roaming around with girls, there he is

381
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
doing this, drinking etc.

382
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,240
Lalit said that he will fight these things also.

383
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,800
But he couldnâ€™t fight the fact that

384
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,440
when did he take the drugs, how did he take them, where did they get it from.  There

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,839
are many heads in his circle.  Coach,

386
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,680
coach sir also comes, those who

387
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,440
stay with me also come and the person

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,160
who gave me water can also come.

389
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,279
Even today Lalit says that he did

390
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,800
not take anything illegal intentionally.  I

391
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,560
said why would I accept it when I have not even

392
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,079
taken it.  If I had taken it, I would have

393
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,839
accepted it because it is a matter of one year.

394
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
Anything can happen in a year.   If it

395
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
had happened I wouldn't have run.  Lalit

396
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,720
definitely said that he gave multivitamins and

397
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,440
protein supplements.  Multivitamins,

398
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,199
Vitamin C and Proteins were available.  But

399
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,959
what happened to me was that as soon as the competition

400
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,199
comes near, I leave everything 20 days in advance.

401
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
And now he also remembers

402
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,000
that before the race he had dengue and

403
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,160
he had taken antibiotics.  But he did

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,559
not know that because of all these things he would get banned.

405
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,679
But Lalit decided that he would

406
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,839
get to the root of this matter.

407
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
That's why he took admission in Netaji Subhash National

408
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,079
Institute of Sports, Patiala,

409
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,720
India's premier coaching institute, to

410
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,600
know

411
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,000
why and how it got banned and unfortunately,

412
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,720
it is the truth of sports in India

413
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,600
that awareness among players

414
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,280
about drugs increases after the ban and not

415
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,400
before the ban. In 2022,

416
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,360
our country has the highest number of doping violations in the entire world

417
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,480
and most of these violations are

418
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,799
seen in junior level athletes and minors.  I

419
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,799
realised this after coming to Under 20.

420
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,799
I played Under 20.  Even after that I came to

421
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
know that all these things exist.  Meaning,

422
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,640
what are the things that happen.

423
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
I have also read a lot of things.  What should not be taken?  There

424
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
are a lot of things.  Meaning that those

425
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
people don't even know what

426
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
all these things are.  Medicines, etc.  These young

427
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,600
athletes are so immature that they do

428
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,280
not care what risks they are taking.

429
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,840
That is the complete list of our NADA.  The

430
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,000
NADA people also

431
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,320
guide.  They also have workshops on how to deal with

432
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,799
these banned substances.  They

433
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,160
call them children.  What about the

434
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,170

435
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,640
benefits you might get by not doping

436
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,120
[music]

437
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,200
and how it might ruin your career, i.e. your body.

438
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,360
Girls especially

439
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,240
like this, it means it is their workshop.  Coach

440
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,559
Rawat told us that one day

441
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
a 15-year old boy came to him and asked him

442
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,840

443
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
which drugs should he take for performance enhancement?  This is a case of 15-20 years ago.

444
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,799
A child, that is a small child,

445
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
is 15 years old.  So it seemed to me,

446
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,520
earlier also I had asked him questions and I would have

447
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
refused him saying this is nothing, work

448
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,840
hard on it and day before yesterday he asked that

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
HGL, I don't know, it is human growth

450
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
hormones, like I said who

451
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,679
told you, what are you saying,

452
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,440
he is not saying to me, is he asking me like this, I said now

453
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,919
you do this, there is no need to train here,

454
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,160
thank you very much, get out of here, so

455
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,480
I immediately

456
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,120
threw him out, social media and YouTube have made things

457
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,760
worse, you will find many useless videos

458
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
where athletes are being encouraged to

459
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,559
take unverified products,

460
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,360
after Dynamol, there is

461
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,280
a salt called Methaju which is used for gaining.

462
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
You can use

463
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,559
it for bulking.  This is for sizing up.   It

464
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,559
wasn't this much earlier, now it has become more.

465
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,480
Actually these channels have also come on YouTube that

466
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
kids hear about doping and vaping

467
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
and the results come out very quickly.   They are

468
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,000
in the pursuit of shortcuts

469
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,520
and new coaches are also coming in to

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,320
show their results so that more children

471
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,720
come to them.  So, they guide the children in the wrong direction.  Even

472
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,480
those athletes who knowingly take these drugs do

473
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,400
not know what

474
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
they are doing to their bodies.  But

475
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,520
when the positive result comes, it is

476
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,679
not Uber who will cry but the athlete and his family will

477
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,520
cry.  But think yourself that most of the

478
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
athletes are poor.  Neither he himself is

479
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,240
educated nor his parents.  That depends

480
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
on the coach.  In all minor cases the

481
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
child will not be like this because the child is

482
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,520
new.  He has no idea how it is.   The

483
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,440
coach will tell him.  It is the coach's fault in this.  The

484
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,280
coach will say that yes if you do this then

485
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
nothing happens, which means it does not

486
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,200
come under dope, this does not come under dope, they will say that but

487
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,840
parents should also tell the child not to go and do it on

488
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,919
their own, does the coach know anything, there are too many coaches now, a

489
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,520

490
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
lot of courses are also being conducted, one should see that not everyone should be

491
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
made a coach, the one who has played in his initial age

492
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,559
knows the

493
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,160
entire reality of the ground, how much hard work has to be done,

494
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,520
how it has to be done, many became

495
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,679
coaches just like that, there are no medals in the state, now they have

496
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,679
become coaches, coach Rawat says that

497
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,919
in Delhi itself many people have made coaching a

498
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,960
business, at this time

499
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
in our Delhi, there are too many such

500
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,280
cases that everyone is doing

501
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
coaching.  I am doing some small courses.

502
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,640
Then after that, it becomes clear.

503
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,720
So they start taking coaching and

504
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,159
they don't even know that coaching has to be done in this manner, that is, in a

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,760
proper manner.  Guardians are not treating the

506
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,640
children right.  Some coaches do

507
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,200
n't know.  While other coaches

508
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
take advantage of the athletes.  There are only one or two% coaches

509
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,159
who tell such kids that I will

510
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,799
not train you.  They either drive away

511
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
or guide.  Otherwise, most of the kids

512
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
want that the child should come and

513
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,679
tell them that he wants to take the medicine so that they

514
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,320
can sell the medicine to them.  There are many such pots.

515
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,799
And do you know the story of these athletes

516
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,120
?  There is so much pressure on him that he is just

517
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,120
looking for a shortcut.  And Lalit says

518
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
that all these things happened in front of him.   When I used to be

519
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,520
in the stadium, people used to say to me,

520
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,080
brother, now you are reaching your peak.  Now you take the

521
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,320
medicine, injection etc.  Take some pill or something.

522
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,280
Take the luggage.  You

523
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,520
will ask everyone from coaches to athletes

524
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,159
what does it mean to load the luggage?  Every child will

525
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,799
tell you.  Lalit says that no one

526
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,600
told him what is right and what is

527
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,840
wrong, no guidance, no orientation.

528
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,799
And this confusion is not just among small athletes

529
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,880
but also among professionals.

530
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,440
Dr. PCM Chandran who has been the

531
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
Head of Medicine of the Sports Authority of India.

532
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,080
He says that this whole system is

533
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,240
very complex.  For every

534
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,880
sport there is their different medications.  The

535
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
same drug may be legal for one sport

536
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,760
and illegal for another.  For example,

537
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
beta blockers, which are used to control hand or body shakes, are

538
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,919

539
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,159
banned in shooting but

540
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,720
not in other sports.  In Lalit's case, the

541
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,720
burden of proof was on him.  He had to prove

542
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,440
to the NADA officials

543
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,280
what he took, why he took it and how he took it.  Lalit

544
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
says that if I donâ€™t know that

545
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,679
something was a band, how can I prove it.  Everybody is

546
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,480
looking for shortcuts.  But they do not

547
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,400
know that taking shortcuts leads to a dead end.

548
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
And the results in shortcuts will last only for a few days.

549
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,280
After that the

550
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,240
child would be finished.  Come.

551
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,200
When you talk to Lalit, comeback is a

552
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,200
word he uses again and again.

553
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,720
So we can make a comeback.  Then I made a comeback.

554
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,360
After crying and breaking things,

555
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,480
Lalit decided to give running another

556
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,240
try.  But the biggest decision that Lalit

557
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,559
took is that he will have to

558
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,039
become financially independent.  If he

559
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,200
goes on this path.  His family definitely

560
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,440
gets tensed.  But now he is happy because his younger

561
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,559
brother also got a job in the Agniveer Scheme

562
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,360
and now both the brothers can take care of themselves.

563
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,600
Lalit's former coach Farid Alam

564
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,919
believes that he is a good athlete and

565
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,480
he requested that Lalit

566
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,360
become a PE teacher in a school near Jewar.  Lalit

567
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,039
applied and

568
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,679
got a job through merit, through which he gets â‚¹00 every month, through which

569
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,760
he can earn money

570
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,679
and also make his comeback.  They

571
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,600
don't give it to the family members, mom and dad.  Me and this two of

572
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,159
us are getting our work done on salary.

573
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,559
Lalit decided that he will officially

574
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,640
start running from 2027.  And there

575
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,559
is a reason behind this.  He is now

576
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,120
also giving tips and coaching to young athletes so that they do

577
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,840
not make the mistakes that Lalit made.  Lalit says

578
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,400
that no one gives proper teachings to the poor youngsters.

579
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,120
And it is to fix these things that

580
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,360
he became a PE teacher.  In his first

581
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,840
month itself, his students won

582
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,799
a silver medal in the state finals of the Under Six tournament.

583
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,440
This

584
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,000
may be a very small news for me and you.  But Lalit is

585
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,880
a great example for the future of our country.

586
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,520
My team member Mohit

587
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,280
met Lalit many times.  For the first time he had

588
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,360
asked Lalit who is that Pulila Gopichand sir, the

589
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,840
badminton coach, he said that if you come

590
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,240
from a poor family then I would tell you not to come here.

591
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,480
When Mohit met Lalit for the second time, Lalit had a

592
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,640
ready answer, you had told me that

593
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
you had said about Sir Gopichand, I saw him that day,

594
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
he had said the right thing,

595
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
middle class people should

596
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,600
not think about sports because there

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,840
may be a return or else it is almost nil.

598
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,840
Meaning if Plan A is not successful then Plan

599
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
B should always be carried along.  If I had not completed the course, I would have had

600
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200

601
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,520
no idea who would have placed me where.  I would be

602
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,159
doing something similar.  Now the

603
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,720
athletes will have to take up this responsibility.  But

604
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,120
what about the agencies?  The story of athletes like Lalit

605
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,600
clearly shows that

606
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,919
Olympics will come to Ahmedabad but to win medals there

607
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,080
we will have to solve the problem at its root.  The

608
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,320
problem will not be solved after winning the medal

609
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,520
but the problem will be solved when

610
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,919
an athlete runs the race for the first time.

611
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,840
Our roots will be hollow from the beginning, so they wo

612
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,760
n't last long in the stomach.  Those roots have to be

613
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,080
strengthened.  We have to get away from these things.

614
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,880
Well, I mean like they provide

615
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,520
fertilizer and water.  From the same point of view, if we

616
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,520
give these things to the children too from the beginning and tell

617
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,760
them that they will become good athletes

618
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,600
in the future.  Our India will

619
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,279
come from here to here.  The tricolor will always

620
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
be ours.  You will feel like saluting.  Like we do

621
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,360
now, like Neeraj Chopra

622
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,200
came in, madam, after that India has progressed a lot.

623
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,440
Now doping tests

624
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
start mostly at the national level, by

625
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,799
then many athletes have developed the habit and

626
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,279
they get caught in the trap of drugs.

627
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,720
Whichever coach we talked to, he told us the same

628
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,120
thing.  Actual children take it at the grass

629
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,120
root level.  In Delhi state itself we

630
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,880
can see that earlier there was no dope test here.

631
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
So the result was a very high level

632
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
result.  Ever since the dog test has been done the

633
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
results have gone down completely.  The kids who were

634
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
working hard, who werenâ€™t using steroids

635
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,919
, are getting a chance.  Now, we are

636
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,520
coming forward and winning medals.  Because

637
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,840
testing has two benefits.  Firstly, you

638
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,400
can catch the cheaters.  The second benefit is

639
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,960
that a fear spreads among the athletes.  They

640
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,880
can also scare the children by saying that the

641
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
NADA team is coming here.  So that before taking it he

642
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,880
refuses and says that he doesn't want to take it.

643
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,840
But doing this is obviously not that easy.

644
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,559
Like PCM Chandran said each test costs

645
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,880
â‚¹00.  Now this is easy for an athlete to

646
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,360
do.  But it's not so easy for thousands of athletes

647
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,760
across the country.  That is why

648
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,640
we need a focused strategy where

649
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,960
our agency will have to do randomized testing

650
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,919
at the district and state levels and

651
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,240
spread awareness from a very young age.

652
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,480
Apart from this we will have to fix coaching

653
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,039
in our country.  Everyone told us

654
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,520
that bad coaches will ruin the country.  If a

655
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,279
coach is applying for a degree, is

656
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,440
doing a degree, he must have some

657
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,360
achievement to prove that he is eligible to become a coach.

658
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,799
Now the person who never came to the ground is

659
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,919
becoming a coach.  He doesn't even know what

660
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,960
practice is,

661
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,279
what sports is?  So what will he teach the children

662
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,520
further?  Now many coaches have

663
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
got the certificate from NIS Patiala but

664
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,000
what happens at the ground level?  He has

665
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,880
no idea.  It takes a whole village to

666
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,679
make an athlete, and all because of one bad YouTube

667
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,320
video, athletes end up doing this.

668
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,039
Lalit got his lesson but

669
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,360
what about the system?  And to change this system, Lalit has

670
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,279
started running and coaching.

671
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,120
And like I told you earlier don't
