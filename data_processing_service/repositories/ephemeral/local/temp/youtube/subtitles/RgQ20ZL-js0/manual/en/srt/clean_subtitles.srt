There is a word in Indian sports which everyone knows about but no one wants to speak about it.  No athletes or coaches take steroids. Watch the video carefully as it appears on the screen.  Gaurav Mathur's friend and others are not prepared to leave him off. This is the 5000m race at the National Open Championships in 2023. Usually in sports, players compete to win. But watch this video carefully.  There is something different going on in this. Six athletes are trying not to accidentally win. why?  Because these players found out that anti-doping officials had come to their tournament that morning. This means that whichever are the top three players, they will have a test.  With this, the six players were trying not to win by mistake. And this is not an isolated incident.   The finals for the 100m race of the Delhi State Championship were being held in September 2023. But only one player out of eight was ready to run away.  Lalit Kumar. That's why Lalit ran this race alone. And the story is not over yet.  A few weeks later, Lalit received an email that he too has been banned for taking drugs. So brother what is going on?  On one hand, there is talk of hosting the Olympics in Ahmedabad and on the other hand, seven out of eight athletes do not even participate because they will be tested.  The root of all these things is doping in Indian sports. India has been number one when it comes to doping offences.  Recently, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra also said that doping has become a big problem among Indian athletes. Actually, nowadays there is a huge problem with doping in India.  In fact, you will not have to work hard to catch these steroids. Like sports journalist Jnathan Salvaraj showed how you can find cans of EGH and EPO, two branded drugs, openly sold in stadiums across India.  Even the doctor does n't have this much.  Even the doctor does n't have this much.  And to investigate this, we spoke to athletes, coaches and doping experts to understand the root of this problem. And first of all let's talk to Lalit Kumar.  A 23-year-old athlete who ran alone and then got banned a few weeks later. Lalit's story is not actually just about sports.  It is about life opportunities and the decisions that people take to move forward in their lives.

It seemed as if what had happened to our child. This is Lalit Kumar.  His sports journey did not start with him but started because of his father Om Prakash.  Om Prakash was a district level discus throw champion whose dream was to win a medal for the country in athletics but his dream could not be fulfilled.  He passed this dream on to his son.  I thought that if I survive then my children should grow up.  This decision was also practical for him.  When he moved to class six, when we had small schools we said that whatever we have to do for the children, we will do it for our own children and we will not have that much money left that we can bribe them. So we thought the easiest way would be to make our child athletic. Lalit's journey begins with poverty and the dream of a government job. This is Lalit. This is Lalit's house.  A small house in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh.  You are lying in this very house. Yes, yes.  It is a small house.  We do n't have any fame.  We are poor people.  Lalit started participating in sports competitions at a very young age. First of all, this is your village, right?  Yes yes, childhood was absolutely good.  We used to play here. Meaning that now it has developed a bit.   There was nothing like this earlier.  At first it was completely empty. But Lalit actually wanted to enter wrestling or kabaddi.  Not in running. No, I did not feel like it at all. Papa would still scold me and send me away.  Mom also used to scold me.  So I didn't like the fact that he was making me run.  I did not feel like it at all.  of India Bronze Medal. But yes, he was so passionate about wrestling that one day Lalit's father promised him that if he qualifies for the Nationals, he will get an Android phone. So what the phones were like at that time was that we used to look for an Android phone from our friends because I had rich friends and they had it.  I mean, my father says that no one will make you stronger than me, so I got a silver medal from there, after the silver medal, my father got me a phone, but that is why many poor athletes become runners because in wrestling you need a lot of guidance. Training is required.  Whereas in Kabaddi it is a group sport.  So you have to depend on others.  Whereas you can do running yourself without any equipment. It was a very good race.  The track was very fast and Dayant Singh, who was a four-time youth national 800m champion, is today a coach. He has seen the same pattern in his students.  They come from a normal family or below normal because they feel that this is a game and we don’t need much in it. No equipment required.  We just have to run away.  So, along with running, one has to take great care of many things like recovery diet.  Only then does one realise that it is not like one has to run away from this and it is very easy to run away. But at that time, Lalit was not thinking about a government job, rather he was thinking that if he won the competition, his family would get some help. I got a medal in the state and then in Gloster.  Then after that he waived off 70-50, maybe 60% of my school fees.  And the annual charges were also made absolutely free. After winning each medal, this boy from Jewar started dreaming again. Lalit used to participate in competitions and win medals.  As soon as he won the medal his dreams grew bigger.  At that time it seemed as if I had to win a national medal.  You will get money and the financial condition of your family will improve a lot.  But do n’t be mislead into thinking that these athletes dream of becoming Olympic medalists. Their dreams are very practical. What is there in sports career is like we represent the nation. After doing national representation, we also get a good government job.  Due to which the financial condition of the house also improves and we feel like we are like the government. So I might as well step my game up.   The same thing was told to us by Delhi's top athletic coach Dinesh Rawat.  Mainly those who are poor, the poor ones, their only concern is that they will get some job from here, then they will get a job later and some who get a good level, then they think of doing something for the country, that they have to do something. Firstly, those of you who belong to the middle class and lower middle class come here with the thought that they will get a job or something will happen and in this way they will get monetary benefits. Indian athletes are not dreaming that they will win the gold medal in the Beijing Olympics. He is dreaming that he will get a government job which will help him get his house fixed.  Their parents will get some money.  He will stop working. Like Lalit's performance was good. He got a good opportunity to get admission in the university through sports quota.  So he got selected at two places for further studies.  Either in Aligarh Muslim University or in Delhi University.  So he decided that brother papa, Delhi facilities are good. We will get information there and the track will also be correct there. Lalit chose Delhi University.  But as soon as he reached Delhi University, he realized that to win the competition, not only hard work is required but money is also required.  A huge amount of money is required for training, coaching, accommodation and diet.  But to collect this money, Lalit's father left his job as a security guard and started driving an auto.  Papa used to drive an auto. Papa took the auto because of me.  I felt very sad that because of me my father was doing all sorts of things. At that time he used to earn ₹ 6000 and his mother runs the household expenses through the buffalo.  I was doing a job. Lalit's family transfers him ₹6000 every month so that he can eat proper food. But for this, Lalit's father had to work overtime. How will I get money if I am not able to do it here? How far will Papa give?  All these things keep going on.  If I had money at that time then I wouldn't have even thought about it.  Recently, India's former badminton champion Pullela Gopichand had said that if you are not rich then never let your child take up sports. They know that names like Saina Newal, PV Sindhu and Neeraj Chopra inspire millions of people in our country.  But nothing happens to most of them. When we spoke to several athletes, we discovered that there were three common things in all their stories.  The first thing is that he became an athlete because maybe it was his father's dream or someone became famous in the area or the right coach spotted him once.  That means I played normal local games like this.  I got my position in that. Then in 2019 my sir told me to come in the top six in the finals.  So I came in the top six.  Sir called me near him.  The second thing is that most athletes come from very poor families and they believe that if this boy or girl can do so well in the village, then if he or she gets proper resources in the city, he or she will definitely win a medal for the country and with this dream, thousands of athletes come to Delhi to make this dream come true. But after coming to the city, the athletes realize that the ways of the city are very different. That's why Lalit's father keeps calling his coach.  When he went to Delhi, we used to ask him whether our son was facing any problems or was behaving in a wrong manner. We were in constant touch with those who were its cost.  And poor Lalit was crushed under this pressure every day.  He even left his education and kept focusing on just one thing – running.   My financial condition was also with me that I am the eldest in the family so there was a lot of pressure on me that brother, I am still running. I don't have any earning source. So how do I move the house forward? Because Lalit's younger brother would also call him and ask that I need some money. But Lalit thought that how could I tell him that I too don't have any money. How can I give it to you?  But Lalit tried to ignore all these things and just focus on running because he knew what the consequences would be if he took stress.  There is a lot of stress Sir, like if you have to play a game then you have to be completely stress free because Sir, as long as the mind of a 100 meter athlete is absolutely under stress then he will not be able to give his performance at all.  But Lalit did not know what was going to happen in his life. [MUSIC] Eight people qualified for the 2023 Delhi State Championships [MUSIC] for the final 100m race. [Music] The winner will get a chance to compete in the Nationals and a cash prize of Rs 3 Lakhs and this cash prize means a lot to Lalit. Papa used to drive an auto.  Papa took the auto because of me.  I felt very sad that because of me my father was doing all sorts of things.   My uncle's son Bhaiya gave me ₹ 00 for Specs.  I had taken those. [MUSIC] On September 26, Lalit followed his typical pre- race routine.  He ate some food. Drank water and filled a form where he had to tell what he had eaten before the race ? Then he started his training. [MUSIC] But Lalit was a bit tense as his personal best is 11.18 seconds. Last year the winner's timing was 10.92 seconds.  But just when he was thinking about this he got another shock that his other athletes refused to compete because the officials of the National Anti-Doping Agency had come there and they would take urine samples of all the athletes. Now Lalit started deciding whether he would run away alone or not.  His coach told him that he may qualify for the Nationals but he will neither get any money nor any medal for this race. Lalit decided that he would participate in the race. [MUSIC] And obviously there was controversy but he qualified for the Nationals.  But Lalit did not know that this could be his last official race. After his solo run, he was tested by anti-doping officials. Lalit was not panicking as he knew he had not done anything and after several weeks a female came.  A band anabolic steroid. Lalit tested positive for cetirizine, a performance enhancing drug that is used for muscle building and recovery. After that I got a bell saying that I was definitely disturbed but after that I did not tell anybody.  I came home.  I go to his house.  First of all I went to NADA office.  Officials of the National Anti-Doping Agency ( NADA) asked Lalit several questions like, when did you take it, what did you take and why did you take it?  Every athlete who is found positive for doping can also undergo a second test to verify it. But for that they have to pay ₹00 which Lalit does not have.  Sir, what can I tell you about myself, I have been in complete depression for three-four months. Lalit was banned for 4 years and it seemed as if his entire life was ruined.  We became so helpless that we did not even feel like eating properly for two days.  Did not like it.  It seemed as if what had happened to our child. But the real struggle came after this ban when Lalit noticed that people around him were behaving very strangely.   I did n’t do this, I didn’t do that.  He did n't listen to me.  He did not listen at all. Here he is roaming around with girls, there he is doing this, drinking etc. Lalit said that he will fight these things also. But he couldn’t fight the fact that when did he take the drugs, how did he take them, where did they get it from.  There are many heads in his circle.  Coach, coach sir also comes, those who stay with me also come and the person who gave me water can also come. Even today Lalit says that he did not take anything illegal intentionally.  I said why would I accept it when I have not even taken it.  If I had taken it, I would have accepted it because it is a matter of one year. Anything can happen in a year.   If it had happened I wouldn't have run.  Lalit definitely said that he gave multivitamins and protein supplements.  Multivitamins, Vitamin C and Proteins were available.  But what happened to me was that as soon as the competition comes near, I leave everything 20 days in advance. And now he also remembers that before the race he had dengue and he had taken antibiotics.  But he did not know that because of all these things he would get banned. But Lalit decided that he would get to the root of this matter. That's why he took admission in Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports, Patiala, India's premier coaching institute, to know why and how it got banned and unfortunately, it is the truth of sports in India that awareness among players about drugs increases after the ban and not before the ban. In 2022, our country has the highest number of doping violations in the entire world and most of these violations are seen in junior level athletes and minors.  I realised this after coming to Under 20. I played Under 20.  Even after that I came to know that all these things exist.  Meaning, what are the things that happen. I have also read a lot of things.  What should not be taken?  There are a lot of things.  Meaning that those people don't even know what all these things are.  Medicines, etc.  These young athletes are so immature that they do not care what risks they are taking. That is the complete list of our NADA.  The NADA people also guide.  They also have workshops on how to deal with these banned substances.  They call them children.  What about the benefits you might get by not doping [music] and how it might ruin your career, i.e. your body. Girls especially like this, it means it is their workshop.  Coach Rawat told us that one day a 15-year old boy came to him and asked him which drugs should he take for performance enhancement?  This is a case of 15-20 years ago. A child, that is a small child, is 15 years old.  So it seemed to me, earlier also I had asked him questions and I would have refused him saying this is nothing, work hard on it and day before yesterday he asked that HGL, I don't know, it is human growth hormones, like I said who told you, what are you saying, he is not saying to me, is he asking me like this, I said now you do this, there is no need to train here, thank you very much, get out of here, so I immediately threw him out, social media and YouTube have made things worse, you will find many useless videos where athletes are being encouraged to take unverified products, after Dynamol, there is a salt called Methaju which is used for gaining. You can use it for bulking.  This is for sizing up.   It wasn't this much earlier, now it has become more. Actually these channels have also come on YouTube that kids hear about doping and vaping and the results come out very quickly.   They are in the pursuit of shortcuts and new coaches are also coming in to show their results so that more children come to them.  So, they guide the children in the wrong direction.  Even those athletes who knowingly take these drugs do not know what they are doing to their bodies.  But when the positive result comes, it is not Uber who will cry but the athlete and his family will cry.  But think yourself that most of the athletes are poor.  Neither he himself is educated nor his parents.  That depends on the coach.  In all minor cases the child will not be like this because the child is new.  He has no idea how it is.   The coach will tell him.  It is the coach's fault in this.  The coach will say that yes if you do this then nothing happens, which means it does not come under dope, this does not come under dope, they will say that but parents should also tell the child not to go and do it on their own, does the coach know anything, there are too many coaches now, a lot of courses are also being conducted, one should see that not everyone should be made a coach, the one who has played in his initial age knows the entire reality of the ground, how much hard work has to be done, how it has to be done, many became coaches just like that, there are no medals in the state, now they have become coaches, coach Rawat says that in Delhi itself many people have made coaching a business, at this time in our Delhi, there are too many such cases that everyone is doing coaching.  I am doing some small courses. Then after that, it becomes clear. So they start taking coaching and they don't even know that coaching has to be done in this manner, that is, in a proper manner.  Guardians are not treating the children right.  Some coaches do n't know.  While other coaches take advantage of the athletes.  There are only one or two% coaches who tell such kids that I will not train you.  They either drive away or guide.  Otherwise, most of the kids want that the child should come and tell them that he wants to take the medicine so that they can sell the medicine to them.  There are many such pots. And do you know the story of these athletes ?  There is so much pressure on him that he is just looking for a shortcut.  And Lalit says that all these things happened in front of him.   When I used to be in the stadium, people used to say to me, brother, now you are reaching your peak.  Now you take the medicine, injection etc.  Take some pill or something. Take the luggage.  You will ask everyone from coaches to athletes what does it mean to load the luggage?  Every child will tell you.  Lalit says that no one told him what is right and what is wrong, no guidance, no orientation. And this confusion is not just among small athletes but also among professionals. Dr. PCM Chandran who has been the Head of Medicine of the Sports Authority of India. He says that this whole system is very complex.  For every sport there is their different medications.  The same drug may be legal for one sport and illegal for another.  For example, beta blockers, which are used to control hand or body shakes, are banned in shooting but not in other sports.  In Lalit's case, the burden of proof was on him.  He had to prove to the NADA officials what he took, why he took it and how he took it.  Lalit says that if I don’t know that something was a band, how can I prove it.  Everybody is looking for shortcuts.  But they do not know that taking shortcuts leads to a dead end. And the results in shortcuts will last only for a few days. After that the child would be finished.  Come. When you talk to Lalit, comeback is a word he uses again and again. So we can make a comeback.  Then I made a comeback. After crying and breaking things, Lalit decided to give running another try.  But the biggest decision that Lalit took is that he will have to become financially independent.  If he goes on this path.  His family definitely gets tensed.  But now he is happy because his younger brother also got a job in the Agniveer Scheme and now both the brothers can take care of themselves. Lalit's former coach Farid Alam believes that he is a good athlete and he requested that Lalit become a PE teacher in a school near Jewar.  Lalit applied and got a job through merit, through which he gets ₹00 every month, through which he can earn money and also make his comeback.  They don't give it to the family members, mom and dad.  Me and this two of us are getting our work done on salary. Lalit decided that he will officially start running from 2027.  And there is a reason behind this.  He is now also giving tips and coaching to young athletes so that they do not make the mistakes that Lalit made.  Lalit says that no one gives proper teachings to the poor youngsters. And it is to fix these things that he became a PE teacher.  In his first month itself, his students won a silver medal in the state finals of the Under Six tournament. This may be a very small news for me and you.  But Lalit is a great example for the future of our country. My team member Mohit met Lalit many times.  For the first time he had asked Lalit who is that Pulila Gopichand sir, the badminton coach, he said that if you come from a poor family then I would tell you not to come here. When Mohit met Lalit for the second time, Lalit had a ready answer, you had told me that you had said about Sir Gopichand, I saw him that day, he had said the right thing, middle class people should not think about sports because there may be a return or else it is almost nil. Meaning if Plan A is not successful then Plan B should always be carried along.  If I had not completed the course, I would have had no idea who would have placed me where.  I would be doing something similar.  Now the athletes will have to take up this responsibility.  But what about the agencies?  The story of athletes like Lalit clearly shows that Olympics will come to Ahmedabad but to win medals there we will have to solve the problem at its root.  The problem will not be solved after winning the medal but the problem will be solved when an athlete runs the race for the first time. Our roots will be hollow from the beginning, so they wo n't last long in the stomach.  Those roots have to be strengthened.  We have to get away from these things. Well, I mean like they provide fertilizer and water.  From the same point of view, if we give these things to the children too from the beginning and tell them that they will become good athletes in the future.  Our India will come from here to here.  The tricolor will always be ours.  You will feel like saluting.  Like we do now, like Neeraj Chopra came in, madam, after that India has progressed a lot. Now doping tests start mostly at the national level, by then many athletes have developed the habit and they get caught in the trap of drugs. Whichever coach we talked to, he told us the same thing.  Actual children take it at the grass root level.  In Delhi state itself we can see that earlier there was no dope test here. So the result was a very high level result.  Ever since the dog test has been done the results have gone down completely.  The kids who were working hard, who weren’t using steroids , are getting a chance.  Now, we are coming forward and winning medals.  Because testing has two benefits.  Firstly, you can catch the cheaters.  The second benefit is that a fear spreads among the athletes.  They can also scare the children by saying that the NADA team is coming here.  So that before taking it he refuses and says that he doesn't want to take it. But doing this is obviously not that easy. Like PCM Chandran said each test costs ₹00.  Now this is easy for an athlete to do.  But it's not so easy for thousands of athletes across the country.  That is why we need a focused strategy where our agency will have to do randomized testing at the district and state levels and spread awareness from a very young age. Apart from this we will have to fix coaching in our country.  Everyone told us that bad coaches will ruin the country.  If a coach is applying for a degree, is doing a degree, he must have some achievement to prove that he is eligible to become a coach. Now the person who never came to the ground is becoming a coach.  He doesn't even know what practice is, what sports is?  So what will he teach the children further?  Now many coaches have got the certificate from NIS Patiala but what happens at the ground level?  He has no idea.  It takes a whole village to make an athlete, and all because of one bad YouTube video, athletes end up doing this. Lalit got his lesson but what about the system?  And to change this system, Lalit has started running and coaching. And like I told you earlier don't forget to check out outskill. You will find the link in the description.  See you next time.
