1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,720
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,759
Welcome to Study Gloss.  We will

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,599
talk openly as we always do.

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,920
I am giving you the update of Meghalaya case on Crime Affairs.

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,320
So brother, what

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,760
kind of love is that which cannot be understood?  It has

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,760
become so bloody.  I don't even understand marriage these days.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Look, this is not a matter of husband and wife.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,400
Recently a case came up in which the husband found

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
out that his wife was having an affair with someone else.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
So, the current case of the husband is from

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,399
Karnataka, Bengaluru.  He cut off his wife's head and

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
calmly placed it in the police station saying,

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,200
brother look at this.  Friends, another case of

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,920
Shraddha Walker.  Many such cases have come up involving

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,800
wives too.  's husband's have also come.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Now more husbands have come.  So there is a

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,840
flood of memes that people are posting border memes that

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Bhaiya I am going on honeymoon with all the weapons.  I

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,920
cannot understand

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,800
what to do.  That if you do a love marriage then it is a

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,119
blue drum.  Our lives will end in the blue drum.  If it's an

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,439
arranged marriage then

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,920
on the honeymoon.  And if everything goes well, a

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,159
terrorist attack will occur.  So

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
what should we do?  If he said so, what did he say?

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,159
Brother, love has become bloody.  Should we love or

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,600
not?  Take retirement.

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,640
Stay with saints, do yoga well or what else

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,080
?  What is suction?  The solution is to

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,520
become a little sensible.  Keep your eyes,

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,119
ears, nose all open and don't let it flow too much.

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,200
 

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,000
Ok?  Don't get too emotional.

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Control your emotions a little and think

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
that everything is okay, everything is fine, it should not happen

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,079
that later you are found naked like what has happened here, it is

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,119
happening in many cases

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,640
and now more cases are coming,

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,280
men will have to become a little stronger, you have

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,840
forgotten the purpose, the

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,840
more you get detached from the course, the more

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
troubled you will be, I have created a very amazing course in The Superior Mans,

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
I think

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
now there is a need for it, you can purchase it for

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,560
â‚¹300, in that I had told you that a

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,360
man grows from challenges.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Women grow with love.  But

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
when men start growing with excessive love,

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
feminist qualities

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,400
start appearing in them.  Women

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,400
become masculine.  So you have to understand whether

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
your masculine qualities are

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
intact or not.  Now this does not mean

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,239
that you should kill someone and fight, that is very

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,840
bad.  Fighting or getting angry is, in

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,400
a way, a feministic quality.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,720
You will have to show resilience.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Resilience is important.

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,200
Be like Lord Shiva, that it's okay, if you are getting love then it's

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
okay, even if you are not getting it, it doesn't matter

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,239
friend.  We are happy with ourselves.

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,560
So the thing is that marriages will continue to happen in this society.  If

65
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
you feel that marriage will not happen

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
then you are under a huge misunderstanding.

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Marriages will keep happening.  Boys will keep on doing it

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
and as the time progresses, brother,

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
in this terrible Kaliyuga, it is written that women will get

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
a lot of power because

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,360
slowly and gradually the man will come under the control of the woman and

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,760
in reality there will be very few men

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,640
left.  Now this does not mean that

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,200
anyone should be beaten up.  This means that you have to

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,400
maintain your dignity.  You have to maintain

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,400
your self worth.  There is nothing above that.  So

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,040
always remember that if someone is

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
not more interested in you.  Ok?  Or if you

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
feel that the conversation is not going well, your

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,879
conscience tells you who

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
is right and who is wrong, then you should leave it, move on, there is

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,200
no need to be clingy there.

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
A friend of Raja Raghuvanshi was telling him that

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
Raja Raghuvanshi was saying that

85
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
brother I am in engagement because

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
I am not getting any special response in engagement, if the girl is not talking then should

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
I marry or not,

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
break the engagement. If you

89
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,360
feel like this, brother it is a question of your life,

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
it does not matter, you will have money, I will give it, it is a

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
question of your life, you are going to spend

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
three to two times more time with that person than what you have lived till now, will the

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,519

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,159
compatibility work or not

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,799
?  It is important to understand this.

96
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,720
One thing that became clear in all the cases was that look, I am

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,640
not saying anything.  But somewhere the man was

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,640
weak.  Isn't it?  The difficulty was very great.   A

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,799
decision you should have taken much earlier.

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,359
He was dragged.  It dragged on for a long time hoping that

101
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,359
things would get better.  And the

102
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,680
family and society also have a hand in this.

103
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,400
We never get freedom.

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Men don't get it at all.

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,720
If you share something with anyone then

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,040
you will be considered weak.  If you cry

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,919
you will be considered weak.

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
Where should a man go?  That's why the man is getting beaten.

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,320
I have written many lectures on women as well.

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
But right now the control is there and it has always

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
been with women.  This is just

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,840
empty talk, friends.  But actually the

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,800
entire control remains in the hands of women.

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,400
And that is exactly what it is.  Whatever species you

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,199
see, woman is the leader in it.  Female

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,280
elephants, lionesses and lionesses hunt.   The

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
lioness lives under the lion.  And if the lionesses get

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,639
angry they will kill the lion and drive him away.

119
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,960
Baggins hunts alone.  If you

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,120
look at a bee, then even if you look at any whale, the

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
females are very big.  She

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,080
is a leader.  And he is still the leader today.  It is

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
created on empty basis, not patriarchy.  If

124
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,800
you look deeply then you will realize that

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
everything is being controlled from there.  Ok

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
?

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,600
So what do you want to do?  We have to respect others a lot.  We have to

128
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,880

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,960
respect other's decision.  If the person in front of you

130
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
tells you that brother we will not stay with you.  If

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
you feel that you have

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,720
no self meaning then just say okay thank you.   It

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,960
was great meeting you.  All the best.

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Just look at the rest of the red flags.  Look at the red

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
flags.  That being said, I was just

136
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
reading a report from NDTV.  It

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,600
had NCRB data in it, in which it is being told

138
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
that in 20 to 30% of the marriage cases, there is

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,039
affair with someone else or

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,720
extra marital affair, so you should check this beforehand.  In

141
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
fact, even after marriage, if you

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
feel that your wife should talk to someone else.  Do

143
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
n't get angry.  There

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,919
is no need to get angry.  You should also quietly

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,440
tell your husband that okay, we are ready to separate.

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,120
You are fine.  Maybe for the

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,880
timing you might get angry.  For the timing

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
you may feel pain but bearing this pain is

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
good for you in the long term, otherwise you will come to know that

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,560
God himself is explaining to you that he

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,880
told you son, you did not listen,

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,919
so keep these things in mind that

153
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,560
ultimately you are the most important for yourself,

154
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,800
your life is most important, many people will

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,600
come and go in your life and once

156
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,440
you stop talking to someone then

157
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
break contact with him, block him everywhere,

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
delete everything of his, delete everything that

159
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,720
happens to him from his life, only

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,960
then will you be able to grow in reality.   There is

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520

162
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,840

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,160
no benefit in such love or such marriage, such a relationship which is very toxic

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,840
and later this toxicity

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,960
becomes very, what do we say, dangerous.

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,960
You have to understand how you have to deal with it.

167
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,240
How to deal with the situation.

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,720
Because if you think that the other

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,000
person will understand then you are under a big misunderstanding.

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
He will never understand.  He will rather become more and

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,639
more dangerous.

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,319
You will have to change yourself with time.

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,560
You have to change yourself.

174
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
Ok?

175
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,479
So I just want to say that take care of

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,400
yourself and focus on yourself.

177
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,000
