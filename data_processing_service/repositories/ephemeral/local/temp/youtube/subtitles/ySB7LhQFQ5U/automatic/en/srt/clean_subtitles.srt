I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  We will talk openly as we always do. I am giving you the update of Meghalaya case on Crime Affairs. So brother, what kind of love is that which cannot be understood?  It has become so bloody.  I don't even understand marriage these days. Look, this is not a matter of husband and wife. Recently a case came up in which the husband found out that his wife was having an affair with someone else. So, the current case of the husband is from Karnataka, Bengaluru.  He cut off his wife's head and calmly placed it in the police station saying, brother look at this.  Friends, another case of Shraddha Walker.  Many such cases have come up involving wives too.  's husband's have also come. Now more husbands have come.  So there is a flood of memes that people are posting border memes that Bhaiya I am going on honeymoon with all the weapons.  I cannot understand what to do.  That if you do a love marriage then it is a blue drum.  Our lives will end in the blue drum.  If it's an arranged marriage then on the honeymoon.  And if everything goes well, a terrorist attack will occur.  So what should we do?  If he said so, what did he say? Brother, love has become bloody.  Should we love or not?  Take retirement. Stay with saints, do yoga well or what else ?  What is suction?  The solution is to become a little sensible.  Keep your eyes, ears, nose all open and don't let it flow too much. Ok?  Don't get too emotional. Control your emotions a little and think that everything is okay, everything is fine, it should not happen that later you are found naked like what has happened here, it is happening in many cases and now more cases are coming, men will have to become a little stronger, you have forgotten the purpose, the more you get detached from the course, the more troubled you will be, I have created a very amazing course in The Superior Mans, I think now there is a need for it, you can purchase it for â‚¹300, in that I had told you that a man grows from challenges. Women grow with love.  But when men start growing with excessive love, feminist qualities start appearing in them.  Women become masculine.  So you have to understand whether your masculine qualities are intact or not.  Now this does not mean that you should kill someone and fight, that is very bad.  Fighting or getting angry is, in a way, a feministic quality. You will have to show resilience. Resilience is important. Be like Lord Shiva, that it's okay, if you are getting love then it's okay, even if you are not getting it, it doesn't matter friend.  We are happy with ourselves. So the thing is that marriages will continue to happen in this society.  If you feel that marriage will not happen then you are under a huge misunderstanding. Marriages will keep happening.  Boys will keep on doing it and as the time progresses, brother, in this terrible Kaliyuga, it is written that women will get a lot of power because slowly and gradually the man will come under the control of the woman and in reality there will be very few men left.  Now this does not mean that anyone should be beaten up.  This means that you have to maintain your dignity.  You have to maintain your self worth.  There is nothing above that.  So always remember that if someone is not more interested in you.  Ok?  Or if you feel that the conversation is not going well, your conscience tells you who is right and who is wrong, then you should leave it, move on, there is no need to be clingy there. A friend of Raja Raghuvanshi was telling him that Raja Raghuvanshi was saying that brother I am in engagement because I am not getting any special response in engagement, if the girl is not talking then should I marry or not, break the engagement. If you feel like this, brother it is a question of your life, it does not matter, you will have money, I will give it, it is a question of your life, you are going to spend three to two times more time with that person than what you have lived till now, will the compatibility work or not ?  It is important to understand this. One thing that became clear in all the cases was that look, I am not saying anything.  But somewhere the man was weak.  Isn't it?  The difficulty was very great.   A decision you should have taken much earlier. He was dragged.  It dragged on for a long time hoping that things would get better.  And the family and society also have a hand in this. We never get freedom. Men don't get it at all. If you share something with anyone then you will be considered weak.  If you cry you will be considered weak. Where should a man go?  That's why the man is getting beaten. I have written many lectures on women as well. But right now the control is there and it has always been with women.  This is just empty talk, friends.  But actually the entire control remains in the hands of women. And that is exactly what it is.  Whatever species you see, woman is the leader in it.  Female elephants, lionesses and lionesses hunt.   The lioness lives under the lion.  And if the lionesses get angry they will kill the lion and drive him away. Baggins hunts alone.  If you look at a bee, then even if you look at any whale, the females are very big.  She is a leader.  And he is still the leader today.  It is created on empty basis, not patriarchy.  If you look deeply then you will realize that everything is being controlled from there.  Ok ? So what do you want to do?  We have to respect others a lot.  We have to respect other's decision.  If the person in front of you tells you that brother we will not stay with you.  If you feel that you have no self meaning then just say okay thank you.   It was great meeting you.  All the best. Just look at the rest of the red flags.  Look at the red flags.  That being said, I was just reading a report from NDTV.  It had NCRB data in it, in which it is being told that in 20 to 30% of the marriage cases, there is affair with someone else or extra marital affair, so you should check this beforehand.  In fact, even after marriage, if you feel that your wife should talk to someone else.  Do n't get angry.  There is no need to get angry.  You should also quietly tell your husband that okay, we are ready to separate. You are fine.  Maybe for the timing you might get angry.  For the timing you may feel pain but bearing this pain is good for you in the long term, otherwise you will come to know that God himself is explaining to you that he told you son, you did not listen, so keep these things in mind that ultimately you are the most important for yourself, your life is most important, many people will come and go in your life and once you stop talking to someone then break contact with him, block him everywhere, delete everything of his, delete everything that happens to him from his life, only then will you be able to grow in reality.   There is no benefit in such love or such marriage, such a relationship which is very toxic and later this toxicity becomes very, what do we say, dangerous. You have to understand how you have to deal with it. How to deal with the situation. Because if you think that the other person will understand then you are under a big misunderstanding. He will never understand.  He will rather become more and more dangerous. You will have to change yourself with time. You have to change yourself. Ok? So I just want to say that take care of yourself and focus on yourself. Focus on your purpose.  Focus on your growth. Everything else is secondary.  Everything will come to you.  And this is what we have told you very well in our wonderful course on Dark Psychology.
