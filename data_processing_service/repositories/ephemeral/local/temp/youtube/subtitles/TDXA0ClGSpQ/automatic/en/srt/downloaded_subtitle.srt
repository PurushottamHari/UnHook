00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, the recent Air

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,720
India accident in Ahmedabad has

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,639

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
shaken not just India but the aviation sector of the entire world.  And keeping

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,719
this in mind, the government is

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,040
taking several steps and a very

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,600
important step in this is that new

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,600
Aviation Rules have been issued regarding

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,920
demolition of obstacles near

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
airports.  If you see this, there is news that

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,880
Government has notified new rules to demolish

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
obstructions near airports.  I mean, you must have

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
seen that there are many buildings, trees, and many such

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
things that may

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
obstruct the landing and take-off of a flight.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
So this entire law is related to that

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
and let me tell you already, if you see, there are

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,960
many such airports in India, you will find

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,719
many such structures around those airports

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
which

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,480
can prove to be dangerous for the aircraft.

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,399
So, I will tell you everything in detail.

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,559
Let's move on.  Look,

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,320
first of all, let me tell you that the new

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
draft that has been released here is named

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,440
Aircraft Demolition of Obstructions

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,520
Rules 2025 and this has basically been

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,520
issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  This

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
is a draft for now.  The public

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
opinion of the people will be known and after that

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
it will finally be implemented.  But

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,400
what is its main purpose?  The purpose is to

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
empower authorities if they believe that there is

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,119
any obstruction around the airport

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,360
which may cause

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,759
issues in take off and landing of aircraft.  There

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,320
may be issues regarding his safety.

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,400
So it should be broken and demolished on immediate basis.

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,479
And look, the

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,840
obstruction here is called

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,680
obstacle limitation surfaces.  It is basically an

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
imaginary surface.  Let me

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
show you.  For suppose this is the airport.

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
And from here the flight takes off and

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,799
lands.  Meaning, as

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,400
you already know here, there is a runway around the airport

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
and the

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,399
flights take off and land here.

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,960
So what's in here?  If you look, this

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,840
is an imaginary surface.  It is made like this.  So there

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,759

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
should not be any obstruction on this imaginary surface.  There

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200
should be no tree, no building

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
, no tower.  For

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,719
example, if you look at this one,

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,799
this tower here is

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,399
going upwards on this imaginary surface.  So this

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
should not happen.  We will have to break it.  On the

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
other hand, if you look, this is a

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,000
very tall building.  But the

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
ground level here is a little lower.  So there is no

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
problem in this because it is

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
below the imaginary surface.  So, in a way,

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
this surface is decided for

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
whatever flights are landing and taking off.  I hope

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,000
they don't face any issues.   There will be no

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,640
problem in communication with the control tower at the airport.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,959
Because of this, whatever area above

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,200
this has to be kept clear.  There should

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
not be any kind of obstruction here.

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
So what is said in these rules that are being brought

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,879
?  In this,

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
DGCA has basically been empowered.

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,599
To the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.  It will be their

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,080
responsibility to identify all the airports in the country

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,160
and if

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
they find any structure like a tower

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,040
etc. around those airports, then it should be

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,519
demolished on immediate basis.  So what will DGCA do for this

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,360
?  It will identify it and

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,959
declare those structures as

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,800
hazardous obstacles.  And this will basically be told to the

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
district administration and the

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
local authorities that

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,519
without any delay, you should

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
break and demolish those obstacles.  So what was the

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,159
problem now, that

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,159
if you look currently, there was a lot of

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,400
bureaucratic structure in place here.  If

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,239
a building has to be demolished or a tree has to be

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,560
cut, then a lot of issues would arise in it.

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,800
And because of this things couldn't happen quickly.

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
But now under the new rules

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,480
it is being fast tracked so that there is no

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
problem of any kind.  Suppose,

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
if the local authorities demolish a building, then it should

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
not happen that they are

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
blamed and a case is filed in the court,

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,959
these

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
rules have been brought in a way to prevent all these things from happening.

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
Yes, here, suppose someone has a building, then the

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,519
government declares it to be an

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,560
obstacle.  So what is here is that he

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,319
can file a case in the court.  But even if

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,480
this happens, that

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
building should be demolished first.  It should not happen

109
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
that now you know

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,319
how long the cases in our country continue for 10 years, 20 years.

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,720
So it is not the case that

112
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,959

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,799
nothing will happen to the building here until a decision is taken in the case.  So

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
considering all these things, it became very important to bring these rules.

115
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
Now look, let

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,239
me tell you why it is important.

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,239
If you look inside India, there is already a

118
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,799
huge crisis going on.  For example,

119
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,799
if you look at Nagpur airport, there are

120
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,120
more than 60 such structures.  Yes, there are

121
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,960
more than 60 such structures around Nagpur Airport

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,240
which were identified as

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,960
hazards in 2023.  But

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
you know nothing has been done to them yet.

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
Those structures remain the same.

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
If you look at Mumbai Airport,

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,560
recently more than 90 illegal

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,800
buildings were also declared hazards.

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,919
But till now only seven of them have been

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,000
demolished and that

131
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,080
too after the intervention of the High Court.

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
Similarly, it is being

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
said recently that in Trivandrum Airport, a local campaign was

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,120
conducted in which more than 600

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,440
notices were given and finally 141

136
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,440
obstructions were removed, which was

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
a big step.  Let

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,240
me tell you that in and around Kolkata Airport there are 377 such

139
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
obstacles that have been identified.

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
But till now he has not even been touched.

141
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,960
He is the same as before.  So you are

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
understanding that this crisis is already there in India

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,720
and keeping this in mind,

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,479
this entire rule has been brought in.  Now

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
what could be the risk to air safety?  These

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,120
obstacles can basically cause mid-air turbulence whenever a

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,120
flight takes off or lands.

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Landing can cause misjudgement.  Suppose there is

150
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
poor visibility, then it is possible that it might

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
collide with that structure.

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,160
Apart from this, the runway can get overrun.   There

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
is danger if emergency diversion has to be made.  I mean that you must have seen many times that

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
a flight is about to land

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,919
but an emergency arises because of which it has to

157
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
take off again without

158
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,320
landing. In that case, if there is any diversion or any action has to be taken in the emergency, it

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,400

160
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
could be a big risk for it.  Well,

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
how many stakeholders are there here?  As

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
I told you, the primary

163
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
responsibility of DGCA is to identify the

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,800
obstructions and

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
notify the concerned parties that these are

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
creating problems.  Then it will be the

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
responsibility of the district authorities to implement whatever has been

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
told to DGCA that these

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
buildings are obstructions.  So you

170
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,759
demolish them.  And there are many airports run by airport operators like

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
Airport Authority of India.

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
Mumbai Airport, Ahmedabad

173
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,160
Airport which is under Adani.  Delhi

174
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,479
airport is in GMRC.  So, it will be the responsibility of

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
all such airport operators that

176
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
if they see any obstruction, they should

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
immediately inform about it.  And yes,

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,080
builders and land owners

180
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
can complain.  You can appeal

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
in the court.  But that will happen through a process.  So what is the

182
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
legal and public response here? The

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
draft rule that has been issued is

184
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,080
open for public comments.

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,080
Builders, civil rights groups, residents,

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,560
they can submit their suggestions by

187
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,800
visiting the website.  But aviation experts and

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,960
safety analysts have supported the move.  I

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
appreciate that yes, this should have happened.

190
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
Steps should have been taken earlier.

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,880
Well, whatever it is, the government is taking this step now.

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,120
But yes, who will cause conflict here

193
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,720
?  There are property developers,

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,880
housing societies which already have

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,000
buildings built, which are

196
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,599
politically bad constructions, there can be

197
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
problems in that too.

198
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,520
Municipalities will also face problems as to whether

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,280
they will listen to voters,

200
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
listen to people, comply and what should they do?

201
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,199
So what's in here?  Now

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
if we talk about its future implications, there are a lot of

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
good things.  There is a positive outcome.

204
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,319
Like runway safety will improve.  We will be

205
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,080
able to show the world that we

206
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
keep our airport compliant with ICAO standards.

207
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,440
Turn around time will be a little

208
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
quicker for obstacle removal.  Then

209
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
public awareness will also increase that yes, there

210
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,039

211
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,720
cannot be anything above this height around the airport.  Apart from this,

212
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
India's image regarding global safety

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
compliance will also improve.  Yes, there are

214
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,360
challenges as I told you, there

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
can be a lot of resistance from local politicians and land mafias.  Those people will

217
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,720
create obstacles saying do not demolish the

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
building.  Then you may have to face legal battles also.  There

219
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720

220
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,400
may be pressure from local officials to execute orders

221
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
swiftly.  So let's see what happens regarding this.

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,479
But at the same time, friends, let me

223
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
tell you some updates now.  As

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,560
you all know, the

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
two black boxes related to the Air India plane crash have been

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,479
recovered.

227
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,120
But the second black box was

228
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,879
recovered after a few days.  The Cockpit

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Voice Recorder (CVR) is

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,240
said to be severely damaged.  So here

231
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
it is being said that somewhere the

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
black box may be

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,879
sent to the US so that the data can be recovered.

234
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,879
So this has been updated.  Secondly

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,199
look here, I was seeing that many people were commenting

236
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,360
about the rat.  Many people had the question,

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
what is this?  For example, in the Air India

238
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
plane accident that happened,

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,120
experts believe that a rat was seen.

240
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,680
Now rat does not mean that mouse.  Please

241
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,560
understand this carefully.  Rat here means ram

242
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,440
air turbine.  What a ram air turbine is basically is

243
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,600
a small propeller

244
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,760
like device that automatically

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
deploys in the event of a dual engine failure.

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,000
Suppose this is a plane.  You

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
can see this near the wheel.  So this

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
is a small device.  Ok?  So this is called

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
rat ram air turbine which is a small

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,640
propeller.  So what happens is that

251
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
suppose both the engines of the plane fail

252
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,480
then what it does is that it

253
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,360

254
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
generates power in times of emergency by using the wind speed.  Meaning there was a power

255
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,600
failure and both the engines failed.

256
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
So it is deployed only in extreme emergencies

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240
when both the engines fail.

258
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
This means that it is

259
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
very difficult to handle the plane.  But

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040
ultimately an effort is made that if

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
both the engines fail then something should

262
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,519
happen.  So this RAM is useful.  So

263
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,240
here also it is being said that the videos

264
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,040
and audio that have surfaced are of the crash of Air India A

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,519
flight.  So it has been observed

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,920
somewhere in it that the sound of both the engines, that

267
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,440
sound of the jet engine, is probably not

268
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
coming.  So most likely it could be

269
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,440
that both the engines failed and this RAM in that plane got

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,040
deployed.

271
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
This is what experts believe.  So now let's

272
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,640
see what ultimately happens regarding this.

273
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
What decision comes out

274
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
in the investigation?  But definitely it

275
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
could be a very big one.  In fact, experts are

276
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,040
saying that either both the engines would have failed

277
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,360
or there would have been an electronic failure

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
or a hydraulic failure.

279
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,760
In all three cases the RAM gets deployed.

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,320
Meaning, rum was deployed in the Air India plane.

281
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
This definitely means

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
that one of these three things must have happened.  So let's

283
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,600
see what happens regarding this.  But I hope

284
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
that you have understood the news that came today

285
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120

Airport Authority of India?  Which of the following is

290
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
not a function of Airport Authority of

291
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
