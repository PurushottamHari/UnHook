Hello Friends.  Friends, the recent Air India accident in Ahmedabad has shaken not just India but the aviation sector of the entire world.  And keeping this in mind, the government is taking several steps and a very important step in this is that new Aviation Rules have been issued regarding demolition of obstacles near airports.  If you see this, there is news that Government has notified new rules to demolish obstructions near airports.  I mean, you must have seen that there are many buildings, trees, and many such things that may obstruct the landing and take-off of a flight. So this entire law is related to that and let me tell you already, if you see, there are many such airports in India, you will find many such structures around those airports which can prove to be dangerous for the aircraft. So, I will tell you everything in detail. Let's move on.  Look, first of all, let me tell you that the new draft that has been released here is named Aircraft Demolition of Obstructions Rules 2025 and this has basically been issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  This is a draft for now.  The public opinion of the people will be known and after that it will finally be implemented.  But what is its main purpose?  The purpose is to empower authorities if they believe that there is any obstruction around the airport which may cause issues in take off and landing of aircraft.  There may be issues regarding his safety. So it should be broken and demolished on immediate basis. And look, the obstruction here is called obstacle limitation surfaces.  It is basically an imaginary surface.  Let me show you.  For suppose this is the airport. And from here the flight takes off and lands.  Meaning, as you already know here, there is a runway around the airport and the flights take off and land here. So what's in here?  If you look, this is an imaginary surface.  It is made like this.  So there should not be any obstruction on this imaginary surface.  There should be no tree, no building , no tower.  For example, if you look at this one, this tower here is going upwards on this imaginary surface.  So this should not happen.  We will have to break it.  On the other hand, if you look, this is a very tall building.  But the ground level here is a little lower.  So there is no problem in this because it is below the imaginary surface.  So, in a way, this surface is decided for whatever flights are landing and taking off.  I hope they don't face any issues.   There will be no problem in communication with the control tower at the airport. Because of this, whatever area above this has to be kept clear.  There should not be any kind of obstruction here. So what is said in these rules that are being brought ?  In this, DGCA has basically been empowered. To the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.  It will be their responsibility to identify all the airports in the country and if they find any structure like a tower etc. around those airports, then it should be demolished on immediate basis.  So what will DGCA do for this ?  It will identify it and declare those structures as hazardous obstacles.  And this will basically be told to the district administration and the local authorities that without any delay, you should break and demolish those obstacles.  So what was the problem now, that if you look currently, there was a lot of bureaucratic structure in place here.  If a building has to be demolished or a tree has to be cut, then a lot of issues would arise in it. And because of this things couldn't happen quickly. But now under the new rules it is being fast tracked so that there is no problem of any kind.  Suppose, if the local authorities demolish a building, then it should not happen that they are blamed and a case is filed in the court, these rules have been brought in a way to prevent all these things from happening. Yes, here, suppose someone has a building, then the government declares it to be an obstacle.  So what is here is that he can file a case in the court.  But even if this happens, that building should be demolished first.  It should not happen that now you know how long the cases in our country continue for 10 years, 20 years. So it is not the case that nothing will happen to the building here until a decision is taken in the case.  So considering all these things, it became very important to bring these rules. Now look, let me tell you why it is important. If you look inside India, there is already a huge crisis going on.  For example, if you look at Nagpur airport, there are more than 60 such structures.  Yes, there are more than 60 such structures around Nagpur Airport which were identified as hazards in 2023.  But you know nothing has been done to them yet. Those structures remain the same. If you look at Mumbai Airport, recently more than 90 illegal buildings were also declared hazards. But till now only seven of them have been demolished and that too after the intervention of the High Court. Similarly, it is being said recently that in Trivandrum Airport, a local campaign was conducted in which more than 600 notices were given and finally 141 obstructions were removed, which was a big step.  Let me tell you that in and around Kolkata Airport there are 377 such obstacles that have been identified. But till now he has not even been touched. He is the same as before.  So you are understanding that this crisis is already there in India and keeping this in mind, this entire rule has been brought in.  Now what could be the risk to air safety?  These obstacles can basically cause mid-air turbulence whenever a flight takes off or lands. Landing can cause misjudgement.  Suppose there is poor visibility, then it is possible that it might collide with that structure. Apart from this, the runway can get overrun.   There is danger if emergency diversion has to be made.  I mean that you must have seen many times that a flight is about to land but an emergency arises because of which it has to take off again without landing. In that case, if there is any diversion or any action has to be taken in the emergency, it could be a big risk for it.  Well, how many stakeholders are there here?  As I told you, the primary responsibility of DGCA is to identify the obstructions and notify the concerned parties that these are creating problems.  Then it will be the responsibility of the district authorities to implement whatever has been told to DGCA that these buildings are obstructions.  So you demolish them.  And there are many airports run by airport operators like Airport Authority of India. Mumbai Airport, Ahmedabad Airport which is under Adani.  Delhi airport is in GMRC.  So, it will be the responsibility of all such airport operators that if they see any obstruction, they should immediately inform about it.  And yes, builders and land owners can complain.  You can appeal in the court.  But that will happen through a process.  So what is the legal and public response here? The draft rule that has been issued is open for public comments. Builders, civil rights groups, residents, they can submit their suggestions by visiting the website.  But aviation experts and safety analysts have supported the move.  I appreciate that yes, this should have happened. Steps should have been taken earlier. Well, whatever it is, the government is taking this step now. But yes, who will cause conflict here ?  There are property developers, housing societies which already have buildings built, which are politically bad constructions, there can be problems in that too. Municipalities will also face problems as to whether they will listen to voters, listen to people, comply and what should they do? So what's in here?  Now if we talk about its future implications, there are a lot of good things.  There is a positive outcome. Like runway safety will improve.  We will be able to show the world that we keep our airport compliant with ICAO standards. Turn around time will be a little quicker for obstacle removal.  Then public awareness will also increase that yes, there cannot be anything above this height around the airport.  Apart from this, India's image regarding global safety compliance will also improve.  Yes, there are challenges as I told you, there can be a lot of resistance from local politicians and land mafias.  Those people will create obstacles saying do not demolish the building.  Then you may have to face legal battles also.  There may be pressure from local officials to execute orders swiftly.  So let's see what happens regarding this. But at the same time, friends, let me tell you some updates now.  As you all know, the two black boxes related to the Air India plane crash have been recovered. But the second black box was recovered after a few days.  The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) is said to be severely damaged.  So here it is being said that somewhere the black box may be sent to the US so that the data can be recovered. So this has been updated.  Secondly look here, I was seeing that many people were commenting about the rat.  Many people had the question, what is this?  For example, in the Air India plane accident that happened, experts believe that a rat was seen. Now rat does not mean that mouse.  Please understand this carefully.  Rat here means ram air turbine.  What a ram air turbine is basically is a small propeller like device that automatically deploys in the event of a dual engine failure. Suppose this is a plane.  You can see this near the wheel.  So this is a small device.  Ok?  So this is called rat ram air turbine which is a small propeller.  So what happens is that suppose both the engines of the plane fail then what it does is that it generates power in times of emergency by using the wind speed.  Meaning there was a power failure and both the engines failed. So it is deployed only in extreme emergencies when both the engines fail. This means that it is very difficult to handle the plane.  But ultimately an effort is made that if both the engines fail then something should happen.  So this RAM is useful.  So here also it is being said that the videos and audio that have surfaced are of the crash of Air India A flight.  So it has been observed somewhere in it that the sound of both the engines, that sound of the jet engine, is probably not coming.  So most likely it could be that both the engines failed and this RAM in that plane got deployed. This is what experts believe.  So now let's see what ultimately happens regarding this. What decision comes out in the investigation?  But definitely it could be a very big one.  In fact, experts are saying that either both the engines would have failed or there would have been an electronic failure or a hydraulic failure. In all three cases the RAM gets deployed. Meaning, rum was deployed in the Air India plane. This definitely means that one of these three things must have happened.  So let's see what happens regarding this.  But I hope that you have understood the news that came today related to a very important aviation rule and before leaving, a very interesting question.
