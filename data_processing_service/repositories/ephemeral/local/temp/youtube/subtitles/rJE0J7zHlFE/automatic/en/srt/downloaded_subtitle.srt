1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
Brother, which Sharp don't you like? not that

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
There are many.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,840
hey be careful. Save that audio and put your name in it

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,599
Is.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,280
Look friend, it's not that I don't like it

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,960
Is. I am different. Those people are different.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
I like people who have their own

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
The company is doing well. to me that

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,720
I like people who are original

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,720
Are. The character who has not come to correct himself.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
Whose is right from the beginning. we the original

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,240
Those original branches branch out. Many people have come.

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,039
The character which is loose is fine

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,920
Have come to do it. It's fine here.

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,559
Did you guys get so much sunshine?

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
good and true yes this is true it is true

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,840
There is another thing like this brother, first of all that which that which

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,680
New vegetables have arrived, I am not naming them anywhere

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,440
I want to take it otherwise it will become a controversy

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
So Shark Tank was rejecting itself first

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
And now they saw that this is a peace hero

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
He became a unique hero amongst them

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,199
I became furious and said make me a shark too

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
I kept writing and kept reading behind that to us

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
Make a shark now they are coming as sharks

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,239
so I'm saying brother I

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
I like originality very much. We are the people who are

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
It is original. if you watch season one carefully

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Watch Aman Gupta from Season 4

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
It must have evolved. But Aman Gupta's

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,360
The character is the same. Correct is our bean. We

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,119
He is the one. Nor do we do useless things. No

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
We have to improve our character. Our

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,759
This is the character. Those who came in the beginning are the ones

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,520
Were. Love us and haters we this is who we are.

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,960
Namita used to say that I don't have any expertise

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,040
Is. I'm out. Correct? one of his famous lines

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
Was. I had a way of life that we too could

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,400
I will take it. It is the same even today. I will do it too.

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
what is there in you? I will do it too. Tax

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,040
I will take it. I don't feel any fear. incomparable

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,600
They were different from the start. Vineeta was different. Piyush is different

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
Were. Everyone was there. Many people are now trying to correct their character

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
I am coming. I don't like that shark

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
Time. and that's why i sometimes don't

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,159
Like some of these new sharks. But

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,640
Otherwise it's okay. on shark time if my

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
If anyone wants to pitch something, I can pitch it

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,600
Am. Means some system works by paying money like that

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,280
Is. No friend, nothing.

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
Twice two two became nil score.

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,360
No one takes any money. no no means

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
It isn't there at all. My reasonable question is

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
In this whole situation when I first

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,920
I told you guys I saw Shark Tank

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
Friend, now the man has torn so many cheques today

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
The cheque of Rs 2025 crore was torn at night.

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
How much money does he have? 20 means this

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
If you tear it apart then I will give you 202 crores

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Will it happen or will there be some issues later as well?

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,959
Will be. No, the average would have been 10-12 crores

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,599
Is. not an episode not an episode a season

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
Looks like around 12 crores. but out of that

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
I am telling you. That means, first we

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
It is also said that it does not happen that all deals

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
Lets do it. Most of all, entrepreneurs

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
They reject us. they come

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,840
to do marketing and make them as

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
That shark tank air increases their sales

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
When it increases they feel that their sales are increasing

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,040
Went. Now why do we need sharks?

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
They did this on valuation. second to them

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,080
You realise what happens when you are there

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,920
Sometimes we break down so much

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
They don't even understand it at that time

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
that you know what should be done. So take the deal

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,879
Let's take it. we will realise it later friend

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
This was not good. good with us

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,720
The deal was done. Then the deal might not happen. And

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,160
Sometimes the numbers aren’t right. which he

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,760
If you say anything, we reject it

82
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,760
that brother you said this is the number and

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,319
Actually these are your numbers then ours

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,080
That deal won't work out. so i think 50% off the

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,840
Deals don't go through. 50% wow a lot of people

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,840

Nah you have so many views from Shark Tank

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,319

What happened on that pitch among all the pitches

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
I am saying 1 crore is on that, 1 crore

this has 90 lakhs on it let me see one

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,280
If I give you an example, I was talking about food

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
Why am I talking about eating that

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,159
Food Pitch has 1 crore views. And me

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Let me tell you about the second order. something to me

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,760
I didn't know about startup funding. These

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,239
See this, after the presentation Aman said

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,879
Asked what is there to eat? How many views are there?

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,799
Brother 12 million. Yes. And see the next page.

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,400
Next goes the next popular. Aman said

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
Who asked what is there to eat? see this also

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,159
It is for eating. The second one. Crazy. Third too

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,799
It is for eating. Came to the restaurant. in that

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,040
How much is it? 80 lakhs. 84 lax.

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,479
Then there are some fights. Then this Rahul Dua

120
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,880
We had those fights

121
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,600
Insane fight it is written friend insane fight

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,680
I will get it done brother. Then Shahrukh Shahrukh Khan's

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
Rahul Dua roasted us.

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Seeing this, 70 lakh views and then after that one

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,479
Jorko had come in it, how much so

126
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
There is viewership. There is a lot of viewership brother.

127
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,120
There is a lot of viewership. And you educational value

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,960
Understand this. means i had no

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
The concept of how to evaluate my work

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
What is? what is the business in that which I have

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,919
I heard the keywords from here and googled them.

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
Because then a culture gets created

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
A man's education keeps on improving

134
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
Now everybody knows about the valuation

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
what does it mean so second third order

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
There are many consequences but you should think that you

137
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,880
what you, what we said, what splits

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,120
You have grown up watching the villa, right Roadies Roadies

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,040
don't speak splits villa

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Why have we all seen it, even me

141
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,680
Have you seen Splitsvilla or Roadies?

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,919
Splits villa you know these are serials

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
The types were right and she used to look at moms etc.

144
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,320
There was a lot of breath too and those serials

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
There was a bomb in it. yes yes in every serial

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,440
Ok. And now think about today's generation,

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,880
Shakana is growing up watching this. Think about the next 5 minutes

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,800
When these kids will come out in a year who are these

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,759
Will you enter the entrepreneurship field or

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,400
Then you will do some business or your work

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
I will do a job. Imagine how much knowledge they have

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
Brother. That's correct. Brother, I just want you to know this

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,199
I want to ask. By the way you used to get beaten in childhood

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
They would either use it or get beaten. like were you the

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,000
The Bullied and the Bully?

156
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,680
Friend, I was not like this in my childhood

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
I was a strong guy so when I

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
If I wanted to fight, I would hit him with a bat and run away

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,400
Was.

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,759
There is a saying that kill and run away, eat and then sleep

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,520
Go, this is our North India brother, kill me

162
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,280
Go away, eat and sleep, I will tell you one thing

163
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,199
what does he say turn me on

164
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,840
We left from there by car in Delhi

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
It was wide so I said this and we got out of the car

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,600
We fought for years and our car sank

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
So the guy turned out to be a 7 feet tall man

168
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,039
I came out going to the Hattawatta Gym

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
He said, brother, this fight cannot happen

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
why did I say you are very strong you will hit me a lot

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,199
That's why I don't want to fight with you

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
you won, you negotiated, you did it

173
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
I won by talking realistically

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
Interest I can't fight you. if you

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,160
If you were normal I would have beaten you,

176
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
I would fight. You are not very much like me

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
If you were fighting then it must have happened to you sometime

178
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,400
battle. The fight continues. Means school

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
If I talk about my schooling, I

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Schooling has been very different. and you know me

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,479
Just met a friend. Found in Kanpur

182
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
me to him and I told him that brother

183
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,800
Thank you. Why do you say that? tell me no bro

184
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,479
You bullied me a lot. what are you saying

185
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
had been? I bullied you. then so

186
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,919
This bully is so much bullied even in school

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,520
It doesn't happen. And then ragging would also be going on

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,520
Was. Bullying was also going on. Anti

189
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,759
Bullying doesn't work anymore. anti ragging now

190
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
school parents all you know they are all concern

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
about that this thing should not affect you and

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,199
it can go very negative or anybody can live like that

193
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,440
We are all concerned and careful at my time

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
they were not concerned about what was happening

195
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
I have been bullied, I went and told him

196
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,759
why do I say thank you, I said you saved my life

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,599
Life is a big thing, it is a big thing

198
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,479
It never happened to me, I tell you how I

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,639
You used to bully me, I was like that and such

200
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,919
He stands in front of me and says I will bully you

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
I used to do that, you didn't even know that I

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,919
I was in 9th or 10th and you used to bully me

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
Was. You bullied me for two-three weeks

204
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,440
And I used to go home and cry that friend, do this guy

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
what's going on? But I am thankful to myself

206
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,880
because if you didn't

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
If that happened, then I would have become a human being.

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
Because I've been hit by it

209
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I knew that this guy had done something to me

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,759
I have done so much wrong that I became

211
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,319
Will have to do Stronger King. Thank you. that

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,440
because that i one over me and after that

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,800
I have become much stronger in my life. i could

214
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,680
handle people like you at that time then

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
things after that you know people may have come in

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,599
my life who have tried to bully me but they

217
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
couldn't bully me but you are probably the

218
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,520
first one so thank you for bullying me at

219
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,879
that time wow this is a real conversation

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Real conversation wow bro I know it

221
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
Bullying also has a wholesome ending like this

222
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,199
I thought they would have got beaten up and gone away

223
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,680
Then you keep on remembering useless things

224
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,199
brother I used to talk nonsense

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,960
I used to make fun of him, I used to tease him in public

226
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,800
He is doing all this, he is diminishing, he is doing this

227
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
he is laughing. The rest of the people are my law

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
But I am laughing. So it was bad at that time

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,199
But now someone laughed, an answer, a question

230
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
there was an answer that question answer question answer long

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
Silence

232
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,759
Is this your favourite movie?

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,599
no no guess my good one of my

234
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,120
Favorite movie. What is your favourite movie?

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't have one favourite. I have a lot of

236
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,599
Favorite movies. I think it depends on my

237
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,599
Time and mood of my day, right? So Some

238
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,560
Times I'm Feeling Romantic Then I

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
I will watch DDLJ. yes and ever

240
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,080
If you miss your friends then life is not

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
I will see you again but not Dil Chahta Hai

242
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
I watch Dil Chahta Hai a lot, Dil Chahta Hai

243
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
I like it and Dil Chahta Hai Masti

244
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,000
it's it's it's amazing today puja

245
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,959
So tomorrow someone else means not in that sense to me

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I miss you but generally my heart doesn't want to

247
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,959
I miss you, tell me if it's a good picture

248
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
We will explain to you if there is any problem here

249
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
Not there.

250
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,279
Dil Chahta Hai means remembering the dialogues

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,080
My heart wants to tell you that you like it very much

252
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,000
And when this one pursues me

253
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
Happiness feels so right. Top movie. I

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
Love it. that's what inspires me a lot

255
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
Person. That climax scene of that

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
Where he finally tells the whole story. This way

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
He cries like this. I've got the job. I

258
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,279
I've got the job. Brother I am doing fine

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Mike. Take the wireless. Take the wireless. So

260
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
There will be something here too. So it will be removed. away

261
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
It will stay like that. then you can do it from there

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
Adjust. I did it by boat. Yes. Yes. Big

263
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,000
Work hard and get a wireless mic. You

264
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,839
Make it for the boat. Wireless Mic We Deal

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Sitting to do it. Which one? and me

266
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,800
I like that very much. Style as your own

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,519
We talked and I like it very much. Band

268
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Baja Baraat looks really good. Right right.

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,360
This is Ranveer Singh's first movie na? Me

270
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
It looks very nice. and he was a badger

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
When he came on the scene. that whole movie is very

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,560
It is top. What else? and this is it my friend

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,640
There are movies. my range is welcome my friend

274
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Run, one two three. which is very much like this

275
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,600
These are big movies. Welcome is also very good.

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Welcome to Kya Movie Dhamaal? Dhamaal. o brother

277
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
I have seen the picture so many times, that one in it

278
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
I have the name of a South Indian man, right?

279
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
I completely remembered such a great movie in my childhood

280
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,079
yes he is doing it jai surya atappattu

281
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Lakshman Rajasekhar Srinivasan Yagna will be performed like this

282
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,200
Brother, he does something, I remember it completely

283
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,880
What happened to him about Sri Lankan cricket

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,480
were fighting for the definition of management so this

285
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,959
I was fighting, I am looking at our differences

286
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,279
So I mean what was the movie Dhamaal Golmaal when

287
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,279
Golmaal had come brother, Golmaal was also good yes

288
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,279
no entry no entry bhai no entry

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,600
It's undertalk because she's a bit like that

290
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,040
It is an 18 plus movie right, yes guys

291
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
let's not talk about that, that's it

292
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
You like manipulation, isn't it? It is like that brother

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Then there was some fraud and I did not see it again

294
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
So these 10-15 things that I was saying

295
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
These are movies so I don't like these movies very much

296
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,920
I have just started, this means I have just started, a little bit

297
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
A little bit of movies can change my mood a lot

298
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,519
It depends but I watch these movies only

299
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
hmm new movies more i mean you

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,720
where do you like to travel where you like to

301
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,760
travel to mean internationally what is your

302
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
Favorite Destination Internationally

303
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,640
I don't have any favorites like that

304
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,560
What keeps me going to San Francisco?

305
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
It seems very far away to me

306
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,519
No, when I go it takes me two days

307
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,040
Let's just go, I heard I will go there until

308
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
It is time to come back in four days

309
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
If things get bad here I hate us

310
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,519
The stand must be going to Europe then Europe is easy

311
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,160
Take the night flight and reach South in the morning

312
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,079
East Asia is good, Singapore looks good

313
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,399
I used to go to Hong Kong earlier, now this is Europe

314
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,320
Should I reach there or should I go to London?

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
If the match is happening then it is not fixed but

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
I like this international so much and locally

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,040
Where do you like to travel? Local is also good friend.

318
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
What is out there that we don't have here?

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
Everything is not okay in our country

320
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,800
but still where do you go locally, even in local

321
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
Changes keep happening just like we used to in childhood

322
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,000
We used to go to Nainital a lot, yes now I

323
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,480
likes Udaipur very much Goa Goa very much

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,079
I still like those who say it is not Goa

325
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
You should come, I like it very much. to me

326
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
I feel like there's less crowd now

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
After going there I started feeling a little more in Goa.

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
Earlier there were too many people in between. Me

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
I have loved Goa since childhood. I said

330
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
Actually I and I want to be friends

331
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Dil Chahta Hai has made more noise than ever before

332
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
I don't know from where you saw our story and

333
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
I put it in. Meaning, it was our story. when the heart

334
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,800
He wants me to be like this, how old was I, friend?

335
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
I am eight seven eight years old. yes and also

336
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,959
It's small but I shed tears after watching the movie

337
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I remember you brother. So there was a time when we

338
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,639
If I had gone there, there wouldn’t have been a place

339
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,279
Anjana Beach. And Anjana is not empty in the middle

340
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,000
Azraelij used to get a place. I remember this

341
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,760
That was Goa when we allowed Indians there

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,320
There wasn't even enough space to live

343
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,639
Because Israelis used to lead that place.

344
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,519
and this all these goan people actually did

345
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,079
not actually respect indians also that

346
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,800
Much. And if you see today, and Indians can

Guys. So India has evolved and India.

349
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,160
The Tourist Welcoming of Indian Tourists

Good. Anjana Deep from Anjana Beach. then goes

354
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,560
Was. I am telling you. Forest used to be one

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,440
Electric Forest. No. Now stop.

There used to be a Club Cabana. Good. Ok. One

357
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,440
What was the name of this forest, friend?

358

There used to be a forest. There used to be forest parties

359
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Was. Ok? And those were the parties that

360
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
because we are all there no one knows us

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
I never knew where those parties were

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,959
It has been happening. So we used to go on a scooter and

363
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
Many of the foreigners became friends. From them

364
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,200
He used to ask where is the party today? So he tells

365
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,440
That was by making bamboo forest. Bamboo Forest.

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,519
So right now you will search for the old one online

367
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
I used to buy bamboo forest for Rs 200. So

368
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
We used to have parties by making bamboo forests.

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
There used to be a hill top. yes the hill top is still there

370
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,839
Is. This is the time of Goa Gill etc. Goa

371
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,320
Gill? Have you come across that name? no but this

372
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,720
This, this was the time when we used to go

373
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
Look there, this is lying there. Now!

374
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
Put some bamboo, look at this bamboo forest

375
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,720
I saw it. See this party, see the Indians in this

376
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,440
Look and find. anybody but us

377
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,800
It will not be visible.

378
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,040
Look, look, Indians look. Look at this, this was it. These

379
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,880
We used to go here. Yes. yes look at this. so I

380
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,480
I am saying that we used to go like this

381
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,480
Boss Goa. yes if anyone sees this then they will be indians

382
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320
There was no trace of Boss Indians

383
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
they were not there what would have been there here

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
What has happened to all the techno these days?

385
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,600
Now he is coming back as if he is not a culture

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
It happens that he goes away first and then he comes back

387
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
It used to come when there was bell bottoms in the middle

388
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
They say she was obsessed with bell bottoms

389
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,920
Then she came back, so it comes back

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Think culture, when this techno was going on

391
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
At that time it would ring on our speakers

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
and after seeing all the speakers, he was trans

393
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
and used to do techno then started in the middle

394
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
Everybody started playing that different type of music

395
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,279

There is a DJ, I have specially booked Polytech

413
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
To play his DJ at my wedding

You can also mix African music with techno

It has been kept. South Asian This Bollytech Will For

425
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,680
Polytech is torn. because it has a little

426
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,360
It is relative. There is relatability. plus in that

427
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,760
There are lyrics. Plus it has that exoticness

428
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,199
What did you say for the international crowd?

429
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,199

say good luck, I know you came in

461
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,920
I wanted to ask first of all, what is this?

462
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
This is this type of messaging brother everybody sucks this

463
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
what are you trying to do is this true

464
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
What is a statement, what does it mean

465
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
yes it is your truth bro everybody sucks you know

466
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
Don't understand English? No problem?

467
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,079
I am a problem, it is a problem for me.

468
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,039
I don't know what you want to say? Oho

469
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,760
yaar it is very easy it is a message that this is human

470
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,000
Key T-Shirt And I Love That Guy is Amazing

471
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,799
And he is a good friend also in front of.

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,559
So what does it mean? everybody sucks ass in

473
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,919
What is the intended meaning here. Who

474
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,039
This is not what you want to hear. Its

475
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,600
The actual meaning is that nobody is perfect

476
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,240
In their life. everybody sucks at some point of

477
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,919
Time. So it's okay not to be perfect.

478
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,960
sec I think people judge a lot

479
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,240
are to each other. Right? and fear of judgement

480
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,520
Whatever happens, those are wrong things to a person

481
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,280
She gets it done. like if what are you thinking

482
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
If my decision is about me then

483
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,600
If it gets bad in making then I will always do this

484
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,520
I keep thinking that I'm working for you

485
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,960
Am. I am working according to you. I

486
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,799
Mean right? so there is a fear of judgement which

487
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,360
I think we should all think that

488
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,440
Everybody sucks. Right? so, i should do what

489
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,039
I feel right, not what you think is

490
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,120
Right. your judgement should not affect me

491
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,760
Decision making. And I also think this one

492
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,679
that everybody sucks has another meaning

493
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
Friend, when we become successful, we grow up

494
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,760
If we go then ego comes into everybody.

495
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Ego comes in that you are doing very well

496
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,799
yes. You can't fail. and to you

497
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,280
one should always think that that was everybody

498
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,520
success at something in their life and at

499
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,000
Stages of life. that's as big as you are

500
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,840
go to there will be something is someone who is

501
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,360
better than you in something else and you should

502
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,400
Not

503
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,600
Feeling Fear That Fear of Feeling Should Go

504
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,640
away because everyone sucks at some point of time

505
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,400
At something which they do in their life. Meaning

506
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,000
Keeps life quite realistic in that sense

507
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
In. Right? Because you are right brother.

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
What do people think of him as a dream killer?

509
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,880
This is the situation. Isn't it? And if you think about it

510
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,799
that this person is thinking about me

511
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,799
You might be thinking so, but it sucks on its own

512
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,559
Everyone sucks at their work, everybody is

513
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,640
bad at their stuff and everybody is trying

514
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,360
and learning then you can do a little you don't know

515
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,880
everybody suck everybody suck ya ya get it

516
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,960
Because normally people don't take care of themselves very much.

517
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,280
They demoralize themselves

518
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,840
ke yaar [ __ ] yaar I suck at this boss he also

519
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,000
suck something right so just forget him do

520
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,559
what you think is right everyone sucks something

521
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
and the other so I am saying don't go back

522
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
brother I have been here for the last two months

523
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
Been on this tour. I booked a plane ticket

524
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,360
all of India

525
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,280
Top Entrepreneurs Billionaires. good for

526
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
whatever lucky reason i have company with them

527
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
I am getting it. I sit and talk with them

528
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
I have been there for two-three-four hours. Correct

529
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,880
Is? And I'm not sitting with anybody right now

530
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,240
and somebody in their team was telling me

531
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,480
they said this person has done so well in life

532
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,400
that now they feel that whatever they touch

533
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,919
It is gold. I mean, a sense of that comes

534
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
That I can do anything. You think if

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,039
10 Dis You Will Know By Thinking 10

536
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,840
The decision line will be right then you start

537
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,200
carrying weight one by one and i understand that

538
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Confidence is also required, otherwise the man

539
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,640
He just sits on the other side waiting for me to do that

540
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,720
I don't do anything, man is always scared of man

541
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I don't take long leaps but I am sure with it

542
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,559
a lot of success that comes as well that

543
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
it's called god syndrome a lot of people

544
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,120
get that god syndrome i feel that good

545
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,679
People start talking about them and the media is theirs

546
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,280
He starts writing about it, that means it's bigger

547
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,559
hey family is congratulating you

548
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
messages are coming whats ever start

549
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,919
feeling or i know at all and that is where i am

550
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,440
think the downfall of everybody starts and ends

551
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,200
that is where you need to understand that

552
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
You know, as my mother says, pride is

553
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
Even Ravana could not hold his ground and that thing bothered me

554
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,840
I also believe that boss ego is pride

555
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,960
you should not keep that you know you are not wrong

556
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,159
You could be wrong and better than you

557
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,080
Someone else is doing some work, something else is better than you

558
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
Life has been better somewhere, somewhere

559
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,400
if something is getting better somewhere

560
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,320
You should not think that you are the best

561
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
You are not the center of evidence. you too

562
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,960
You can make mistakes. You will make a mistake. Yours

563
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,720
Mistakes will happen. You need an acceptance

564
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,320
You must be wrong. you also suck

565
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
everybody suck in view of that and bean

566
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,679
asking this privately to all these very

567
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Successful people. I ask you why

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,480
Do you think you are so successful? My

569
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,400
To. Yes. So what are the common reasons

570
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
are you there brother? Hard work, smartness. to me

571
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
One unexplored reason seems to be that

572
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
The game I have picked up is very large in size

573
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
It is big. People don't talk about this.

574
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,200
You could be someone who is equally hardworking

575
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,280
if he is smart and he is an accountant then his

576
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Growth will be limited at one level. But he

577
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,840
Is a business owner. He is in real estate. They

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
The scope increases in consumer electronics

579
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,520
He goes away. What do you think it is?

580
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,120
Hard work, smartness, picking the right

581
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,640
Game, Something Else. what has your life been

582
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,799
In?

583
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,960
Been God Loves Me? God loves you. What? Ok.

584
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,320
This is a direct talk with God, friend. please beach

585
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,320
Don't come in, friend. You have your own settings.

586
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,400
Bro this is a great attitude brother. These

587
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,640
Correct. It seems to me that my

588
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,480
I am very scared of God. hmm i am in

589
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
I am very into things. the things of god

590
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,960
Do you know what me and Fatu are? I think that

591
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,640
If I did wrong to anyone then God

592
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,039
He will do wrong to me. I have never lied till now

593
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,600
I am speaking. I have never done bad to anyone

594
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,280
Didn't do it. Intentionally Unintentionally God

595
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
forgive me because they know that I

596
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,640
After performing the puja, I will ask him to forgive me. Some?

597
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,919
There may be a mistake but intentionally I have not heard it

598
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,440
anybod I don't I don't if I have to weather

599
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,000
it's my teammates when i was working

600
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,320
weather it's my seniors when i'm working

601
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,200
I had employees who worked with me

602
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,799
I have as many shareholders as I have till now

603
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,320
Yes, I told them well from my side

604
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:29,039
I didn't say anything wrong

605
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,960
Investors are my friends, whom I

606
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,120
I don't even know that anyone is wrong

607
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,799
I did and God did not do anything wrong to me.

608
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,880
God has given me as much as I want

609
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,559
I have given more than what was required. to me

610
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
I shouldn't say this much, I shouldn't say this much

611
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
Was. God gave me a lot. No. No.

612
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
God, I need more. yes and I need more

613
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Want and need. Let it come, let it come.

614
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,600
We are told to refuse Laxmi who comes to our home

615
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,840
does not. We say come, come. And

616
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,919
What's going on?

617
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,120
Stay seated. Stay seated. Sit here. Butt means

618
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,720
you are saying to some extent it is divine

619
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,159
Intervention. Some god damn 100% boss. 100%

620
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,159
near about luck you can say near about

621
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
Luck, there is no luck in this, I am saying that I

622
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm a smart guy I'm not saying that

623
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,080
I made a lot of pap from Hardonia

624
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,400
Hey brother I wandered here and there and ate like

625
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,360
You were saying that if I do CA then I will give you 500

626
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,840
51 people went to my station at 5:30

627
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,480
Hoss was a back station Archani so our

628
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,559
Buses used to run from Archani to ITO to Haas Beach

629
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,720
I used to come but I used to go to Archani first

630
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,400
So that I can get a seat and go sit down

631
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
and I can read a book on the side

632
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
because or I can sleep because of the arcani

633
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,080
It is 2 hours journey to ITO. If

634
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
I used to wait till the bus stop, then in between

635
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,559
used to go. Earlier I used to go to the back and sit in the bus

636
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
so that I could get a seat and take the seat from there

637
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,240
Then I used to go there and I would get that

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
I used to get 1.5 hours in which I could study.

639
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,799
Was. Right? I used to study for one and a half hours. here my

640
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,320
When I had to sleep, I used to sleep for 1 and a half hours

641
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,159
Because that was the first stop. it lasts

642
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Since I was on top, I did it like this also. I have hard

643
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,520
Did a lot of work. I have suffered a lot.

644
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,520
16-1 Worked 16 hours. I have found jobs

645
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,120
I have changed it. when all my friends are doing well

646
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,200
Were living. very good jobs

647
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,440
While I was doing CA, I got a good job.

648
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
When I was doing my MBA, many people

649
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
Was doing well. An investment banker

650
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,400
became. Someone went on Facebook. Any

651
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Went to HUL. very good jobs

652
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,799
It hurt. You are doing very well. she left

653
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,120
It is after that. So I'm about to turn 40

654
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,360
Till then I was not with my wife

655
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,960
Our house was run with money. so I have done it

656
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,720
A lot of hard work. I have done a lot of

657
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,480
Struggle. I've burnt the midnight oil. I

658
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,919
don't remember a lot of times when my

659
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,679
daughter was growing up and I could not

660
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
spend a lot of time with her because i was

661
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,400
Busy in my work. there so many

662
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,559
Instances which I miss on her life. But

663
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,559
Am I not happy about it? I am ok

664
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
Because if I had not missed those instances,

665
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,640
I wouldn't have been here. yes bro it's a son

666
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,120
No. Now the things you can give your daughter

667
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,159
Are so disproportionately different. donation

668
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,720
Before. I am okay. This brother is with time. I

669
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,480
Have no regrets. So, do hard work also.

670
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
I am not a donkey even if I work smartly. I say

671
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,120
Fort

672
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,880
It's not like that. I have worked hard. brainwashed

673
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
Is. God gave me the brain. uses the brain

674
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Am. I use jugaad. of one's own business

675
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,159
I follow the principles of business. does

676
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Am. But I God love you. Not love you. I love

677
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,760
That. I love that. have you ever spoken

678
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,840
About why you called this boat? I don't know

679
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,840
May be I have. I don't know. or there's a reason

680
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,559
And it's just like a name that came up? No

681
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,159
No there is a reason. there are couple of reasons

682
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,480
And you can decide which one you like. Correct

683
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,880
Is? I will give you the first. yes first

684
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
Reese's A for Apple, B for Boat. as if speaking

685
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Isn't it A for Apple B for Boat? So Apple

686
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
If someone had taken it, we can't take it

687
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,480
So we kept the boat. Ok. ok this is

688
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,240
Like a nine on 10 for me. what is the other

689
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,080
Forest? It is a second as is Jio

690
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
Greatest of all times. It would have been a BO80

691
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,720
It is the best of all times. Oh [ __ ]. Its

692
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,400
How much is Rain ranking? I Think The First

693
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
One was kind of more impressive. and this

694
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
is still at. Still I will give this at.

695
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,960
This is very good reasons. You Marketing

696
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:52,400
You look like one. what are you talking about?

697
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,559
Brother what line do you have he gave it to you

698
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Archana Purat Singh in Yaar Kapil Sharma

699
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:01,039
This one is the greatest of all. third third one

700
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,679
The reason is that our tagline is The Plug Into

701
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,840
Nirvana. so you go on a boat you know you leave

702
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,240
The Land Behind, You Leave the Worries Behind

703
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,480
Same way, if you wear a Boat headphone, you

704
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,400
Plug into your own zone Plug into Nirvana.

705
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
So, this is actually the real reason why it

706
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
Was boat plug in to N1. And if you look at A

707
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,320
If you look carefully, there is a boat built inside it

708
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,960
If it has happened, then she looks very cool. by bridge

709
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,720
show. Prove it. Yes, okay. We have brothers

710
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,559
This has happened because I got this TV installed. yes that

711
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
If anything needs to be bridged, talk to these general people.

712
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,080
That's the logo inside the A. So that too

713
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
The icon turns out very nice. ok my

714
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,080
always wondered why A was capitalized.

715
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,960
Yes. But that makes sense. and the other one a

716
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,440
and reece i tell you that the fourth

717
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,200
there's a reason what happens isn't it when we

718
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
You were starting it so many didn't you?

719
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
There were brands whose names were not even pronounced

720
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,480
It used to be okay, all these were Chinese

721
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,480
Brands yes and boat see how easy the name is

722
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,159
So that everyone understands what the boat is right

723
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
so it's not a tongue twister it's a very

724
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,360
Relatively simple and an easy name and the

725
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,200
The story can always be made behind it very

726
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,919
interesting this is how you think about

727
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,279
marketing and you you you you you you you you

728
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,279
about it's very simple and generally this

729
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,960
Things probably are complex on the way

730
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,200
but simply towards the end means in the middle

731
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
Brother, your mind must be going crazy when you name such a thing

732
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
Deciding is probably one of the most

733
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,960
What should I say about bottle-necked places?

734
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,240
How many people get stuck in starting a business?

735
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
Brother, I am unable to decide the name of the car

736
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
The boat goes away, it floats away, then it is no more

737
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,960
I used to do it, but it has to be simple

738
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
Decision at the end of the day yes this this and

739
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,039
don't complicate life it's easy for me

740
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,799
So it didn't take that much time, we named 10 names

741
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,559
You used to choose it like you choose a child's name

742
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,559
isn't it so it happens that this is the name you choose

743
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,640
I took it to Sameer, Sameer Bhai this

744
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,840
These are names that sound a little nice. Who

745
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,520
Are you feeling good? Friend, you keep it friend

746
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,080
Whatever you want to keep. So suck the name like this

747
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,000
Did. start your business, do business my friend, all this brother

748
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,960
Show profits, don't get stuck in this name no.

749
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,559
Show profits. This is useless. bro one thing

750
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,880
Tell. well you i told you that

751
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,640
I have almost done CA. No. Good

752
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,279
We never discussed this. Ok.

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
Yes brother, I have studied CA till finals.

754
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,080
Did not pass the final. means given only once

755
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,640
In the meantime, I got admission outside. I

756
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,200
It went out. Good. Have you done it from Delhi?

757
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Yes Delhi ITO ITO ITO ITO 501

758
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,399
512 502 511 Whose class did you sit in

759
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Who were all the friends at that time?

760
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,799
what is this name i don't remember it

761
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,200
It is not ND Gupta, he was the tax officer

762
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,240
Who was the tax collector, friend? I forgot. Wait.

763
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,799
Let me tell you, this was Girishuja

764
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,960
Girish Auja sir is top SRC faculty

765
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,200
Girishuja, he used to teach here, Father Agnel

766
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,039
Correct at school

767
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,840
Ajay Jain used to be in ITO, he used to be the tax officer

768
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,000
Indirect tax right used to be Ajay Jain

769
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,279
Then there used to be someone in a very Shalimar Bagh

770
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,960
ND Gupta or something, he was in Shalimar Bagh

771
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:43,919
There used to be another one, this Kapileshwar Bhalla

772
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,440
I used to teach accounts, so what about here?

773
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,600
Praveen Sharma Read anywhere from Praveen Sharma

774
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,520
It happened that Praveen Sharma used to teach accounts

775
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,039
I will tell you, I teach in CP

776
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,760
Those would have been online halls in our time

777
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,520
The auditorium is of the entire metro station

778
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,000
5000 people booked the entire ground floor

779
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,320
friend he is awake since 6:00 in the morning in winter

780
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,080
It was the right time, he told me, it felt right that

781
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,000
Neither me nor I can get up in the morning

782
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,880
So my friend used to come down and blow the horn

783
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,640
p p p p p p p p p by doing this

784
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,799
If there was a signal, it would ring three or four times

785
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,799
I used to go and if I had not woken up

786
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,159
I used to go many times, but I got 50%

787
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,000
I used to miss classes because of that

788
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,880
I was not able to get up early in the morning but in the morning we

789
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,880
I used to go to class from 6:00 am to 9:00 am

790
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,720
Then our articleship would start

791
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
Internship: 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

792
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,679
Where were the articles? Luthra & Luthra. Good

793
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,600
And then we have classes again after 5:00 pm

794
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
It would start. He used to come home at 9-10 o'clock and

795
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,760
then repeat or else separate on saturday and sunday

796
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
The classes go on. yes that is a separate class

797
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,559
The day goes on. That's a full 12-13 hours. to me

798
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,559
remember brother and mean

799
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,159
Brother, to me it is absolutely that

800
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
study environment i think teachers are great

801
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
That's why they are fantastic. that he is 5000

802
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,480
They are keeping the man tied up. or on which

803
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,840
There was study material and these were the study conditions

804
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,440
I could never get fit. Brother I

805
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
So I used to miss half the class like that

806
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,320
I will go and do it. You did this very well

807
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,159
Languages. Do you know what used to happen to me?

808
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I thought I should leave CA midway.

809
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,799
Yes. I was thinking in the middle of it, come on friend I

810
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,720
I left CA because I understood it

811
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,120
that I am not may be I will not be the

812
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,799
Best Accounts Finance Ever. so i

813
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,480
I thought I would leave it midway. butt what

814
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,880
It would happen if you left something in the middle now

815
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,399
Yes, it has become very stylish now

816
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
Leave. now it's like you're a drop

817
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,080
Out. you know ya school drop out special drop

818
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,919
Out. you know it feels fancy right to say

819
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
About it. But if you had not said anything at that time

820
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,880
Then we would have said that the loser would not have happened

821
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,559
Times than you. Right? in CA then in CA

822
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
So, you can say it as well. He might not have become a CA.

823
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,640
So I was very stressed about that

824
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,159
People shouldn't think that it didn't happen on my own

825
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,760
I left it because I would tell everyone

826
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
I will stay then because I had left it, I left it

827
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,559
Was. No one should trust you people

828
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,000
did. They have to think what they

829
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
Had to think. I said let's finish one turn

830
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Am. It will take me a year to finish it. Then

831
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,440
Life is completely free to do anything. So

832
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,039
I finished mine in one go

833
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Was. Yes, I had taken it out. good good good

834
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,799
good respect. I did not take it out.

835
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
But I never thought of this angle.

836
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,440
I will have to justify it. I

837
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,960
I am actually a drop out. my whole family

838
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,320
Isn't it right brother? Here we have ancestral

839
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,399
It is handed down to us. What are you doing?

840
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,640
Well, you also have the same thing. yes then you understand

841
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,159
Yes that pain. I have finished doing it.

842
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,720
I was 21 years old and had become a CA. Good.

843
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
Foundation Course. And before you go to school

844
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,279
There were schools and colleges. I have talked about college.

845
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
School: Where was the school? DPS R Kepur.

846
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,960
Good DPS R K Puram. so that is one of

847
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,279
The Best Schools. ya ya even now but back

848
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,880
then particularly DPS RK Puram was I

849
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,399
I used to love my school. Our Schools

850
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,000
I was also on my way. it seems to me

851
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,180
that there weren't many schools at that time

852
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,489
Not even.

853
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,489
[music]

854
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,559
DPS used to call itself and their

855
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
The score would have been good anyway. so brother in law

856
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,399
All the toppers always were from there.

857
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,960
There was selection after selection, brother. Selection

858
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,559
would stay. I also gave the 10th exam. So all the

859
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,559
All of them were toppers. all whose 95% and above

860
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,159
There are three or four sections in this. come all of you

861
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,240
In DPS. At DPS R K Pur

862
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
Coker-The curricular was also very good brother. Yes

863
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,679
Correct. I don't know about you because we

864
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
I studied in DPS Faridabad. so i am

865
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,480
Assuming in comparison.

866
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,120
It was ok. One debate quizzes used to go on

867
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,840
At least it used to be running in RK, I don't know

868
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,760
Friend, I don't like me this much

869
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,000
We don't like our schooling system but

870
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,320
yes I don't remember yes that

871
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
There was a sports facility also. I am

872
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,000
are you actually very interested in schooling

873
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,559
you are talking about the system are you able to

874
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,600
Comment on that man our schooling system

875
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,480
See, I think it teaches discipline well

876
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,640
gives hard work but teaches me

877
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,440
Our system seems a bit flawed

878
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,519
Of schooling. There are many reasons for this, which

879
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,760
In our India or I don't know world

880
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,600
What is wide. But friend, I don't like it that much

881
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,880
They say follow the system,

882
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,559
If you do not follow the structure then

883
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,640
You will be thrown out of the class. Right

884
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,720
If you don’t follow the rules. And I get this

885
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,320
It seems that the entrepreneurial system that would have been

886
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,159
The thing about life is that you do your own thing.

887
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,320
You you know do what is right. break the rules

888
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,080
And then only you will do well in life. So

889
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,919
You do not follow too much structures.

890
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,159
And not in our school like we have here

891
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,720
like in dps what happens in it not

892
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,320
There is a lot of focus on studying. Ok?

893
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,559
This is our schooling system. i should name

894
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,960
DPS only but schooling system. Schooling

895
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,799
The system is all about studying and not rote learning

896
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,200
Beat. I have also memorized it a lot. I

897
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,559
I am telling you that I still remember

898
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,399
This is what I have memorized. I will tell

899
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,720
Am. As we had a rote learning, we would speak in it

900
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,720
What is the definition of management? So

901
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,399
I used to say that management is the art of

902
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,840
Getting to the process of planning

903
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,360
Organizing Staffing Director &

904
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,720
Controlling so that workers can work

905
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,440
Effectively and Efficiently Towards

906
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,559
Achievement of organizational goals. Machine

907
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,120
up down up down management people

908
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,120
Handling done problem solved. So ours is not

909
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,440
used to focus a lot on rote learning that school

910
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,159
I will cram it in, cram it in. if you cram

911
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,919
If you don't hit, you won't get marks. and who

912
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,120
There are businesses and those who do entrepreneurship

913
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
it happens in it it is said that you

914
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,760
You will not do creative thinking, you will be creative

915
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,600
You will not do decision making. If you are the same

916
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,080
There is no answer to the question in a creative way

917
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,320
If you remove it, you will never be able to earn money.

918
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,440
so you have to think very differently not as

919
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,800
a rote but come out with solutions to the

920
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,919
Problems and in a very creative way. So

921
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,679
This is my view, as he used to say

922
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,119
Not stand in line. and rightwise

923
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,480
Stand up. Stand in line height wise.

924
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,119
Stand in line in line. And

925
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,359
Entrepreneurship says break the line and

926
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,520
Create your own line. Right? you can not

927
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,520
B. You stand in line, people will follow you

928
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,440
People. This system of ours seems a little to me

929
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,960
Looks like it's a bit floppy. but we are also right

930
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,119
You are saying this. Yes, we too are from the same system.

931
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,720
Are. So no brother, I am like a CA

932
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,480
I used to do it, then everybody would say this to me

933
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,320
Well, a CA would have taught me to work hard

934
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,079
Is. I said this donkey works hard

935
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,800
By speaking you are probably engaged in hard work and donkey labour

936
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,760
You are not making any difference. And it is such that

937
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,520
I don't need any subject or course

938
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
There is no problem in doing this. But if I

939
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,599
Eventually just taking these brownie points

940
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm going to work hard

941
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,879
And I can't make up my mind. myself

942
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,400
I cannot solve the problem. My Agency

943
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,119
It's not so much that I thought it was a problem

944
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Solved it and moved ahead. so then how

945
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,359
Will work? and this as a matter of fact

946
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,520
Education system of India or globally too

947
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,440
But this thing of India was made only to create labour

948
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,800
Is. yes to make labour and I will make you

949
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,040
Let me tell you what happens as we

950
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
He was becoming head boy. Ok? Become a Head Girl

951
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,320
Were living. It is like school in our place

952
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,320
It happens to me, what can you do?

953
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
it's about

954
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,480
Individualism. Right? How do you do well?

955
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,119
How do you become a blue court

956
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,680
Holder? But life is all about specifically its

957
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,760
About teamwork. It's about us. it's

958
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,520
About how do you lead, how do you delegate?

959
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,920
How do you manage people? how do you manage

960
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,800
Relationships? it's not just you it's us in

961
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,839
The Real World. So schools push that development

962
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,000
does that how I I you would do that. Good.

963
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,839
so that individualism comes into the picture

964
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,520
Rather than the group teamwork. so i came i

965
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,400
Personally feel that what you are saying is

966
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,320
No, I totally relate to that. there is one

967
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,520
thing for example which is management

968
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
Definition of our Business Studies Keys

969
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,160
It is written in the book in 11th. I I am

970
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,280
Assuming you were talking about the same thing

971
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,440
I was explaining the definition. and now there is a

972
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,920
Different angles you have to manage.

973
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
you might even say

974
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,119
I will tell you my opinion. Ok? The

975
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,280
The Last Couple of Months Have Been Very

976
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,440
Interesting. Brother, I don't want you to be a shark

977
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Any number of tops, tank or non-Shark Tank

978
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,880
He is an entrepreneur from India, I am one of them

979
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,960
I have stayed at their homes or offices.

980
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,520
I have just been going for the last two months

981
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,920
and saying hello because till now i am a

982
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,839
type of yes please I am a type of content

983
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,440
Was doing. I said friend I am also

984
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,800
Found of Entrepreneurs Edge Profiles

985
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
I find them very interesting. So

986
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,359
If I meet you I will see how you think

987
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,240
Are. The End of the Many Places I've Seen

988
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,160
And I have seen something really very interesting

989
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,200
Stuff. Stuff That People Will Not Believe

990
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,359
Otherwise. but as an office your office is

991
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Probably the chilliest office I've seen.

992
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,480
I you understand that I have

993
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
I didn't see you again at the disco disco

994
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,680
People are sitting, they are not dancing. But

995
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,280
The atmosphere is very open for you people. End

996
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,839
what i am trying to get at is i am

997
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,640
sure you are problematic

998
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:10,079
Top 1% of Managers of People and Teams Now in

999
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,680
The Country. and i'm only bringing this

1000
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,760
A Definition of Up Because You Said Management

1001
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,440
You understood it by memorizing it. what do you understand now

1002
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,960
are you there?

1003
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,760
How do you think of management now?

1004
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,920
or i think it's

1005
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,000
it's what human relations is about

1006
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
Understanding the People It's About

1007
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,400
Management for me is management you know I

1008
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,200
Work With a Lot of Young People Right If You

1009
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,960
scene my office when you came did you come to the office

1010
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Have you seen so many young people in our office?

1011
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,160
Everyone I worked with knew me, yes everyone

1012
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,280
I knew you were a little older

1013
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
I didn't know, no, I actually

1014
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,880
I had stopped doing podcasts

1015
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,440
I was not even doing it, did you see the last one

1016
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,680
I had not done a podcast for one and a half years, but then

1017
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,760
When my team and I told the people, friend

1018
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,960
Please deny it saying that we are missing you.

1019
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,240
Someone do a podcast. then your name is recommended

1020
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,480
People said yaar please I plus you

1021
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,079
No it is true. You look at mine

1022
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,119
I haven't done a podcast for a long time.

1023
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,079
I see, everything is going well for you. Is good

1024
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,920
so you know we all thought i also thought that you

1025
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,800
No you should be you are a good. so i think

1026
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,119
People know their stuff. i think the young guys

1027
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,280
you are very smart and i work with a lot of

1028
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,839
these gens and young people in our company and

1029
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,400
This is different friend, their thinking is very different

1030
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,760
You cannot restrict them, you think

1031
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,480
what did we do when we were born

1032
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,880
We were thinking that we had much knowledge, not right

1033
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,520
There weren't that many phones, where were the smartphones?

1034
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,839
Even the internet had not come so openly then this

1035
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,280
people you know the world you know the globe

1036
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,440
very well right you you can't they are they have

1037
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
Instant access 15 minutes ago so mom

1038
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,119
She used to slap me and tell me to go and get something

1039
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,240
Come and meet me, you know some guest is coming

1040
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,560
come on go get four chips and three Pepsi

1041
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,400
At the click of a button everything would come home here

1042
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,560
hey right everything is correct you are saying absolutely right yes

1043
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,520
The kids of today are like Ramu and we have become

1044
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,640
I was going on a bicycle to buy cheese 250

1045
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,640
Village Mummy Pakoras

1046
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,440
Nowadays, everyone has instant access to

1047
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,599
things right there they have global

1048
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,359
Perspectives and things so you can understand these

1049
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,280
This is not the same generation that used to say earlier

1050
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,760
No, when we were starting out people used to say

1051
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
the boss is always right yes sir if you want to say

1052
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,040
Nowadays these people ask why

1053
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,920
sir why should we do it so it's a different

1054
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,960
Generation It You Have To Know How To Manage This

1055
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,839
Generation It has a very different way of life

1056
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,440
right first what are we like one and one

1057
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,320
Let me give you an example of work life balance

1058
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,000
The question everybody is asking these days is I am 5

1059
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,599
I did not know this question six years ago

1060
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,400
There was no talk about work life balance

1061
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,760
There is also a discussion about who these young kids are.

1062
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,079
I have brought it just like that. It is the youngsters who have brought it.

1063
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,280
This is the Genjis who has brought it. they don't only

1064
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,119
Work for money. They enjoy working

1065
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,480
Me too. but it's more fun than that

1066
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,640
Spending time with your friends

1067
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
in, in having experiences. so for them

1068
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,200
That is not a question that is given. Give

1069
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,800
To have work life balance is a necessity in

1070
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Companies. you cannot force them to work

1071
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,960
Today. they will do a thing for them so that

1072
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,880
If I don't feel like working then I won't do it. I

1073
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
It has been said earlier also once that at their place

1074
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,160
Like that resignation letter of Akshay Kumar

1075
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,079
It used to be there in my pocket, take this

1076
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,359
I am going. Ok? yes to me so

1077
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
I had to keep it with them. No

1078
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,040
No, stop friend, don't go. then they have a you

1079
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,640
no they have a very different i would say

1080
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,400
Outlook Outlook Towards Life They Are You Know

1081
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,359
We had less risk taking ability.

1082
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,760
These people keep taking risks. Isn't it? apart

1083
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,520
Is. I understand. and to me generally no

1084
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,640
Brother, this bashing that goes on on the internet

1085
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,400
Judge so and so has come, do I know

1086
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
Seems like? I remember my MTV

1087
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,839
I was abused for watching it. and then say

1088
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,920
These were young kids. watching mtv

1089
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,440
They lose their minds. before that when

1090
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,640
My parents must have been young, my elders

1091
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,240
Brothers and sisters must have been young, they didn't know anything else

1092
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
You must be abused for watching it. this is it

1093
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,960
It is a universal phenomenon. where the old people

1094
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,240
Looks like he is very intelligent. and the children

1095
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,520
Looks like we are wiser than the old people

1096
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,800
Are. And they keep abusing each other

1097
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,640
Are. What do they know, what do they know.

1098
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,040
Right? We used to read history books and

1099
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,520
These days these are not 16 year old kids, not even 16

1100
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,520
14 year old boy hits a century and turns 18

1101
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
I am making history by setting up a business

1102
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,000
And we were studying history. yes right

1103
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,839
Exactly and if you think about it then there is one thing that

1104
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,680
See what software and hardware is available

1105
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,560
The entire generation that has access to technology

1106
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,240
He will change it. and in that sense yes you can chat

1107
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,079
Brother, look at GPT, the most illiterate man

1108
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,480
What message does he write and send? you fight

1109
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,480
Try it with someone. Legal letter is coming brother

1110
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,839
written. Ok? so now things have

1111
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Changed.

1112
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,800
And it is also very interesting. this which

1113
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,640
The observation is that a judge earns money by working

1114
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
He wants to go somewhere and spend his earnings.

1115
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,079
Because where did our parents spend money

1116
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,839
Brother? He is the one who saves our education

1117
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,119
are doing it. Right? Like that was a way

1118
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,640
Different generation if you go back. but it's how

1119
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,839
do you manage this because my question was

1120
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
Basically what do you think of management

1121
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,640
Now? like how are you managing

1122
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,040
Relationships?

1123
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,000
And how much do you think about it? I don't think you

1124
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,440
Should the question be how do you manage them? The

1125
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,760
the question should be how do you use there

1126
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
Perspectives to grow with them? The

1127
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,440
The question should not be that how do you manage?

1128
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,520
The question should be how do you grow with

1129
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,680
Them? ok let them give them you know they may not

1130
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,160
They have the experience but they have the exposure.

1131
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,319
hmm they may not

1132
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,720
they may not mean if i tell you about my

1133
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:14,640
Company in a Boat. ah the lot of people who are

1134
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,640
So young who gives the best opinions.

1135
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,880
Because they know the audience very well. Now, give

1136
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,200
Know How the Market and the Market Changes

1137
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,079
Very fast. if you still have the old ways

1138
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,640
of doing things, you may not know how to get

1139
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,400
To the audience and the consumer. however much you

1140
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,760
Do an analysis, do you know how many people

1141
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,839
They tell the agencies that I need a

1142
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,960
You have to do a campaign and make it viral. this which

1143
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,200
They have agencies, they are 18, 19, 20 years old

1144
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,720
There will be people. They must know how to violency

1145
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,880
I have to bring it, what is working, what is not working

1146
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,560
how to edit, how to work

1147
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,359
what to say, how to talk to the consumer

1148
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,760
Have to do it. Authenticity is known for the first time

1149
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,960
Today I know that people on Shark Tank also

1150
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,960
why do they like me because of who I am

1151
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,240
I am in front of you, authenticity, people like

1152
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,760
Authenticity the people can read through who

1153
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,560
Who is acting and who is doing drama

1154
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,920
who is authentic so very smart generation do

1155
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,680
You ever wonder between India and US

1156
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
How similar are the markets and how different are they?

1157
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,200
Is India catching up or not at all

1158
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,760
Ever thought about the sense in which things are going different

1159
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,599
Yes my friend, you are like India, I never saw you before

1160
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,599
When I saw sharks in the US it was India

1161
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,800
not only that when the shark used to see us then

1162
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,200
There used to be a word, it was called the

1163
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,440
American Dream. Not the same thing in today's date

1164
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,200
The Indian Dream is happening in India

1165
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,280
also the people who are coming, pitching in,

1166
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,040
Coming from the village, in some places small

1167
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,880
Coming from town and pitching in and

1168
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,119
Big companies are being formed. We too are people

1169
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,880
So, everybody is already seeing how it evolves.

1170
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,880
It is happening in India. So if you see it

1171
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560
The basics of entrepreneurship are the same

1172
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,200
How to do business, what to do. India

1173
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,640
has its own nuances. work in india

1174
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,000
It is not easy to do. in india they say

1175
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,520
that if you make business in India then the whole

1176
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,760
You will know how to start a business in the world.

1177
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,240
Right? But India is a tough market to crack

1178
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,960
The Consumer Market Is Too Cracked But You Know How

1179
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,960
business work what is the expectation of

1180
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,599
The Shark Investor Wants Money

1181
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,680
How will you give returns and how will you grow your businesses

1182
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,359
what negatives can there be and how

1183
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,359
Risk assessment is done by the entrepreneur

1184
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,560
What skills are there, they are all similar

1185
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:06,160
yes friend the basics will remain similar

1186
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,920
Or else our population is so amazing

1187
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,359
There is so much that you can sell it in India

1188
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,280
So you don't need to go out.

1189
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,440
It would be good if you go there as there is such a huge population. You

1190
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,359
will become a global brand but if you crack

1191
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,800
The Code of the Indian Consumer It Is

1192
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,480
amazing. but and you don't think that that's enough

1193
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,839
It is a hard challenge in itself because it is big

1194
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,359
It will be a price sensitive market. India Eye

1195
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,560
M assuming that India price is sensitive

1196
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,800
It isn't there, brother. I say India

1197
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,119
Is value sensitive. Most in India

1198
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,760
Which was the cheapest car? no maruti 800

1199
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,560
Cheaper than that. The cheapest car is Nano

1200
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,839
She had come. What happened to Nano? It got stopped. Close

1201
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,680
It's done. I can't see it now. Why? Because

1202
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,760
It was the cheapest. not cheap in india

1203
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,560
Brother for sale. It sells well. in india

1204
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,119
Your consumer is very valuable

1205
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,520
Is driven. He is brand conscious. You

1206
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,079
You can ask any villager

1207
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,079
Then he will tell which brand is popular in the city

1208
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,520
Used to be. Ask any city dweller and he'll tell you

1209
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,119
Which brand is running in the city?

1210
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,119
Needed Ask any city dweller, he will tell you whatever

1211
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,319
I want the brand that is running in the metro. So

1212
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,319
The consumer is very aspirational. Yet

1213
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,920
Price conscious. So in India price from

1214
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,960
It doesn't sell brother. Price is not the cheapest

1215
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,960
It will be sold. Good. The cheapest one will be eliminated.

1216
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,720
People would say that I buy an expensive motorcycle

1217
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,440
I will take the cheapest car

1218
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,680
I will not buy the car at that price.

1219
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,280
interesting

1220
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,040
interesting

1221
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,920
because my impression was that you were asking the price

1222
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,839
If you multiply 10 by 12 then the car will stop. if you

1223
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,440
If you do it for 10, the other guy will do it for nine.

1224
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,599
If you sell it then you will be finished. Yes. so it means

1225
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,119
Then it becomes a race to the bottom. You

1226
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,119
One should never contest in that race. Good

1227
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,800
Wow there are many brands available. our our

1228
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,960
Let me tell you about the competition. I won't take names

1229
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,400
I want it. But every year a new guy comes.

1230
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,000
Eats up a little market share. next year

1231
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,000
It closes down because there is someone cheaper than that

1232
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,520
It comes. So we're never in that game

1233
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,040
We wanted to go as if we were the cheapest.

1234
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,319
Because someone else can buy it for cheaper than that

1235
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,359
will come. His expenses will be less. her you know

1236
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,359
Its cost offsourcing will be much less.

1237
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,560
He will arrange it from somewhere and get it. but not today

1238
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,440
then it will end tomorrow because

1239
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,200
It will come cheaper. all this telecom which

1240
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,960
Hardware manufacturers taught us

1241
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,280
Was. when they started fighting

1242
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,040
Curry used to sell it by calling the cheapest one

1243
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,119
And from him we learnt that brother is the cheapest

1244
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,119
If we do this and sell it then we too will be shut down. We

1245
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,800
Our condition will be the same as theirs.

1246
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,040
So we never sold it at a cheap price.

1247
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,359
We sold it in style, at a slight premium

1248
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,440
It was sold and people bought it and are not buying it.

1249
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,680
Got it very interesting. Wow. I am a thing

1250
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Should I tell you? t-shirt tere ko kya jaate hain once

1251
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,520

You said that now there is no secularism in India

1300
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,680
It is difficult to build a brand because secular

1301
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,440
The content is over. What now?

1302
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,920

eating around her and making all this is

1308
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,359
Probably crazy. Yes. it is interesting

1309
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,119
Me too think about it. or me two years ago

1310
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,520
No, a lot of these interns came with me

1311
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,839
of school and I used to ask them to tell me this

1312
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,079
friend i called them to the meeting that you

1313
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,599
Were you talking about the young people of today?

1314
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,200
I would definitely take their perspective

1315
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,920
Am. So I called them to a meeting and

1316
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,760

1319
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,079
I first tried these some four years ago

1320
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,319
I heard it from people and they say why

1321
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:01,760
Don't you keep these Korean Kpop stars?

1322
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:04,800

Did she choose a different type of person than me?

1330
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,520
I had ordered the case cover, I had ordered the road cover

1331
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:28,319

Nowhere to India. I have a roommate

1372
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,880
It used to be Korean. he had explained it to me

1373
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,119
The way in which his government organized

1374
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,800
By doing this they have started pushing this culture out. Give

1375
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,680
Organized it. Their training is like ours

1376
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,359
IIT has the training and not theirs

1377
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,599
Make dancing and singing groups

1378
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,359
These are for five year old children. and then to them

1379
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,680
I train until they can be international

1380
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,440
Sensation. and this is basically soft power

1381
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,280
Establishing on the world. That's good. Or

1382
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,720
That's cool. This is a target for an industry

1383
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,880
It is run by the South Korean government.

1384
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,720
That's amazing. And you are advertising their tourism

1385
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,559
You will see only Kpop stars do it.

1386
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,760
Because there is an agreement with the government that

1387
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,599
You will also bring tourism later

1388
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,280
In. Oh nice. or Nice. this is smart

1389
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,680
Move.

1390
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,559
Do you ever and I'm I'm curious. do you

1391
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,880
Ever get asked about your net worth?

1392
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,640
Yes, I ask. People must keep asking. But

1393
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,640
You think it's a useless question? Why

1394
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,400
Do you want to ask? no i mean i am in general

1395
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,559
I am from a young entrepreneur stand

1396
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,319
the point do you think first of all what is

1397
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,640
Net worth and is that a goal that people should be

1398
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:57,839
Aspiring towards?

1399
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,599
Dude it's each one's own. Good. You Know

1400
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,359
Like now I will tell you simple. Many

1401
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,640
People like to run that today my

1402
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,079
I have ₹ lakh. Then I have ₹1 crore today.

1403
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,000
Is. Then I have 10 crores. then 100

1404
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,760
It is crores. This will become countless, right?

1405
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,400
He will say that I have 000 crores. The 000 one

1406
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,160
He will say now you should think simply. The tea which is available outside is ₹5/-.

1407
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,079
He is also selling tea. They feel it is

1408
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,920
Dude, this man comes in a car. Tea Drinks

1409
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,400
Is. Throws away half the cup. drink half a cup

1410
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,400
Slip out. Right? half a cup for me

1411
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,079
He is giving money to. Then he says the second

1412
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,240
There is a shop open in front where the same

1413
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,040
The guy is drinking tea worth ₹100. then you hotel

1414
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,240
I am going and drinking tea worth ₹1000.000

1415
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,400
My point is that your perspective is yours

1416
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,160
It depends on how rich that guy is. So

1417
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,160
This will never end, right? he is thinking

1418
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,440
He is so rich. It is thinking that

1419
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,760
I would be happy if I had a car

1420
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,520
I will go. The driver thinks I am a plane

1421
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,800
I would switch to economy class someday

1422
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,079
So should I be happy? say economy class

1423
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,920
Friend, these business class people are good

1424
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,960
Are. The business guy is saying it's first class

1425
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,960
Is good. The first class guy is saying

1426
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,319
Private J is good. Private Z Wala

1427
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,760
He is saying that I should have my own planes.

1428
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,040
The one who has his own plane is saying

1429
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,119
I don't have that plane. to me

1430
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,640
I want that plane. then the bigger one

1431
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,079
The guy in the plane is saying this to Elon Musk

1432
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,559
So the guy went into space.

1433
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,880
I got robbed, brother. Where are you in this cycle?

1434
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,599
Decide it. Make your own decision. so this

1435
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,240
It's never ending. Money is never ending. money

1436
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,559
are ending but you should mean a little to me

1437
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,160
It is different. i think that you know you

1438
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,160
should be just be happy in what you are

1439
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,880
Doing and money will follow. I was not

1440
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,280
Happy in what I was doing and

1441
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,280
It wasn't about money. I am four years old

1442
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,359
When I left my job I bought his JBL

1443
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,599
I left my job and stayed at home. four to five years

1444
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,359
There was no money. But I was happy. I was

1445
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,000
happy because i was doing what i love

1446
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,520
Doing. And eventually money came. which was

1447
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,520
what what did you like doing in

1448
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,240
That time? When I was starting the boat

1449
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,640
Ever since we were working, we used to have a lot of fun

1450
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,640
Were working and making good products

1451
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,480
Keeping the consumers in mind

1452
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,559
I was making a product, I had never thought that

1453
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,400
Today, such a big company will be formed here

1454
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,960
Touch wood, earn as much money as you can

1455
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,000
do good work be happy do it well

1456
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,599
and believe it on the god know that concept

1457
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,480
Arjun, he does not say in Gita that Arjun and

1458
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,720
You do your duty, yes then I feel that what is

1459
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,640
there is truth even today you are not worth money

1460
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,319
If you run after it, maybe even the money will run away from you.

1461
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,920
He says that if you run after the shadow

1462
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Shadow will also run away. You will run after money

1463
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,680
Then the money will run away. I am trying

1464
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,520
To imagine which neighbourhood you are in in Delhi

1465
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,359
Did you grow up in? Hoscus. Good Hoschas

1466
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,440
In. only in village area or not

1467
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,440
The one from Hoss Enclave. Enclave side

1468
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,880
In. Or my office was in the village. Good

1469
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,520
You had your office in the village. Yes, I was telling you.

1470
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,359
six years old. And what is your net worth now?

1471
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,200
Quite well.

1472
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,839
How good is it? Ask your question

1473
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,359
It's work, it's my job to answer. you can

1474
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:42,400
Ask what you want to? I can answer what

1475
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,119
I want to.

1476
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
I heard you say this I think when we

1477
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,400
You were sitting together for the first time, right?

1478
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,480
I said, I don't read books, I read people.

1479
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,000
What does it mean? I don't know books

1480
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,760
Buddy. I find it very boring. feel sleepy

1481
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,480
She goes after reading the book. I am more interested

1482
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,880
In I Read People. something about books too

1483
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,920
It's not special brother. Sometimes he says say it again

1484
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,680
He says don't tell me. then it says

1485
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,839
It is confidential. I told me books

1486
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,359
I don't like it, I don't like it. No. she like what

1487
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,960
do you mean reading people and and and what

1488
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,880
does that look like? I had told you this

1489
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,280
that I don't even like books and I

1490
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,640
I haven't seen a single podcast in my life till now.

1491
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,640
Yes, I haven't seen even one. Haven't seen it till today

1492
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,640
Is. Now I have to see this one. probably not

1493
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,079
Let me see. I haven't even seen mine till today. They

1494
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,920
I have done it before, one or two means to them too

1495
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,520
I haven't seen it till today. Good. on The Brother Podcast

1496
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,280
Then it will look good. I like reels a lot

1497
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,200
it occurs. You can learn everything in reels too

1498
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,800
goes. Do you see memes in reels. Memes

1499
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,359
whatever comes in my algo, anything

1500
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,119
It comes. what is your your your your your your

1501
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,520
Your algo. Right now the algo is very confused.

1502
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,240
they don't know if it is a 13 year old boy

1503
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:41,040
from Delhi and a 55 year old man from

1504
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,599
Delhi you will be 55

1505
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,040
So this algo of mine is also getting confused

1506
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,720
because sometimes I feel like it

1507
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,880
He keeps coming to see the motivational

1508
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,040
You know motivation comes automatically then

1509
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,440
A friend automatically sends it to you

1510
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,520
The reel of devotion starts running, send the wife

1511
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,760
When she gives the reel of the family it starts moving

1512
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,839
So sometimes something is coming, sometimes something is coming

1513
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,599
but it's very interesting reels this just

1514
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,119
It’s just so addictive man. one one and half

1515
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,680
Our eyes just keep watching reels. it's

1516
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,000
Crazy. I actually I recently got off

1517
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,920
Reels. But his trade of the year is on Twitter

1518
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,160
I am here. And brother, my sleep has been disturbed. Oho

1519
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,760
Pal guys only fight on Twitter

1520
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,480
yes brother. Do you understand what that platform is?

1521
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,559
Is. You will get likes on criticism. Negativity

1522
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,240
Brother, you will get likes on that only. as a creator

1523
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,400
I was telling you. if my followers grow

1524
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,079
If you want to do it on your Twitter then I am negative

1525
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,680
I will post the stuff. taking any thing

1526
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,640
I will grow. Good. This is what it means

1527
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,880
I took a side but what you are saying today

1528
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,640
Taking sides in a date is a very big thing.

1529
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,680
Earlier, people were more diplomatic.

1530
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,400
You people of today's generation, who are young people, we

1531
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,720
People, we take sides together.

1532
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,799
ok please your

1533
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,000
No sound, the veins are turning a little white. You are mine

1534
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:48,880
Generation, you speak your mind

1535
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,680
You say your thing. Title of this podcast you

1536
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,040
Say your thing. Is not correct. but but on a serious

1537
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,599
not that people are taking people are not shy

1538
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,599
In Taking Sides and Giving Opinions.

1539
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,119
It's good. You know people are more free. Ficus religiosa

1540
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,200
can say what they want to, think what they

1541
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,880
Want to ride what they want to. it's

1542
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,240
Fine. but your question was about

1543
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,400
Books. Yes Books and People. reading books

1544
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,280
I feel sleepy so I don't read.

1545
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,960
seconds I think if I could be with you now

1546
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,920
I am with you. If I sit with you today, I

1547
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,240
I will learn four or five things. And I love people

1548
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,640
talking to people, understanding people,

1549
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,720
He likes discussing things together more. Me

1550
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,200
Looks like there's so much to learn around

1551
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,520
With people. if i if i am in office i like

1552
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,280
Two seats with many people. I mean my office

1553
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,960
Remains open. Someone come to my room

1554
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,720
We will sit and talk, I will learn from him

1555
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,839
I will take it and they will learn from me. I slept

1556
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,920
That's my way of learning. I don't read. We

1557
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,760
And other people's lives don't affect me.

1558
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,000
I would do it. I feel as if you are the one

1559
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,160
We studied the case of Southwest Airlines

1560
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,559
I was in MBA. and after that how many airlines

1561
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,200
came who thought that we too will take a low course

1562
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,760
I will make a career. but all these others

1563
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,000
Airlines failed who tried to be a low

1564
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,720
Cost airline right. you can't live there

1565
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,680
life because your circumstances might be

1566
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:06,079
Different. your ah you and your friend who is

1567
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,799
Doing see together. Like in my case, me

1568
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,680
And my friend hur doing ca together. His

1569
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:14,240
The Journey and My Journey Till a Point Was the Same

1570
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,319
but after that we all we were both in different

1571
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,119
because he wanted to pursue different

1572
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,119
Things He Aspires From Life Ver

1573
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,160
Something else my aspiration something else.

1574
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,160
So Everybody Is Different and You Can't

1575
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,680
Follow one set pattern. My

1576
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,040
Circumstances,

1577
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,599
my timing, my knowledge, my

1578
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,400
environment, my access, my

1579
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,880
information, my friend who at that time

1580
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,920
With me are my colleagues, my team,

1581
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,559
What is the opportunity at that time?

1582
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,160
It would be different from what it was at that time. us and today

1583
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,400
Maybe I will do better than that opportunity

1584
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,240
Or I should not do it. So I don't think anyone else

1585
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,240
will there be any effect on your story from that story

1586
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,960
It will have to be Your story is your story. You

1587
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,760
If you go to follow someone else's story then they

1588
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:02,480
This is his story. You make your own story.

1589
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:04,000
Right? don't follow inspire and and see

1590
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,760
what you can know you have what you call

1591
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,920
it the art of

1592
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,200
FORGETTING. what does he say? Unlearning.

1593
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,799
Unlearning. Unlearning. Variant. we he

1594
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,319
If you did this then I will do this too. not necessary

1595
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,079
Isn't it friend? Half the people who know about India

1596
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,920
Startups had come which are making losses

1597
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,280
It was said that Amazon was also in loss for many years

1598
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,599
If you did it then we will do it too. Hey Amazon's

1599
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,760
The story was different. by causing loss to you people

1600
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,640
Don’t follow his story. Your own story

1601
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,359
Make it. There are many entrepreneurs like this

1602
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:35,839
If you do it, it will happen. no my now you can't do that

1603
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:38,839
Learn. Be inspired but don't follow it.

1604
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,839
Or

1605
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,400
You told me one more thing at that time.

1606
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,480
it was when we were sitting. you said ah i don't

1607
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,319
Treat my team like family. I treat them

1608
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Like a cricket team. Yes. what does it mean

1609
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,960
Is? you know i am telling you that this is not

1610
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,400
Corporates are very important

1611
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,240
I think that in corporates

1612
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:01,920
There are too many useless lines. O V

1613
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:05,280
Treat our team as our family. more than this

1614
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,000
There is no stupid line. Because the friend who

1615
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,720
We are a family, right? You and I are our family.

1616
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,559
You never remove members from today

1617
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,960
So I don't have a sister. From today, my sister

1618
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,319
There is another one. Yes. Right. Isn't it? the sister who is

1619
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,559
I have a sister. Yes.

1620
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:21,200
You don't treat your employees like that

1621
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,040
Do. You can play your team like IPL

1622
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,440
There is a team, today you can see even Kohli retires

1623
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,520
It is done with correct test. but once upon a time

1624
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:33,839
Kohli was like the God, Kohli the guy right.

1625
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:37,119
but he had to give way to somebody who is may be

1626
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:39,760
younger and may be doing at that position might

1627
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,160
Play better. Even Sachin gave way to a Kohli.

1628
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,640
and may be a new one is giving you know them

1629
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,040
The new one is coming out and Kohli is leaving now

1630
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,000
Is Rohit Sharma like India?

1631
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,880
Dhoni will be the test captain and today someone else will be

1632
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,720
Kohli or right Dhoni giveaway to what you

1633
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,799
call dhoni give way to a rohit and now rohit

1634
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,240
is giving way to who ever the new captain will be

1635
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:03,200
be right so i think in that position if you

1636
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,440
You are playing against your best batsman

1637
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,680
The best player should be put in that position

1638
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,400
Will you go and bat here or

1639
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,520
You go here and bowl or you bowl in this over

1640
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,760
Will you bowl the 49th over or the 50th over?

1641
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,079
Will you bowl or will you bowl in the first four overs

1642
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,720
Give. it has to be dependent on that person

1643
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,200
and the situation and what is this guy's strength

1644
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,480
Is and What You Think Is the Right Strength

1645
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:29,599
You can use from him. you so you have

1646
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,680
to treat it like today if today is the best

1647
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:34,480
Was an accountant. but that accountant was the best

1648
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,480
My. As long as it was a company of this size.

1649
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,119
But now if our company is of this size

1650
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,119
So bringing you Better CFO Better Accountant

1651
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,440
It will be necessary because this guy will not do that work.

1652
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,440
can do what this guy can. Marketing

1653
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,960
This guy of yours can do this work.

1654
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,200
But now let me talk about the editor.

1655
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,799
The editor is coming. New editor is coming now

1656
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,720
Because they are doing better work. give no

1657
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,040
Better Ways of Editing Things. but that old

1658
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,280
The editor is not able to up his skills. I slept

1659
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,160
Will you give him an option? Brother up your skills.

1660
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,160
be better because if i don't if i don't hire

1661
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,400
this new guy who is doing much better than this

1662
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,160
Old Guy. I am never going to say that you

1663
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,480
Leave the company to the younger one and you leave

1664
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,079
Go. But when the big guy is coming and better

1665
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,400
Editing skills are coming in the market

1666
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,280
If I keep him then my company will be ruined

1667
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,920
No. So you always have to up your game. Ask

1668
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,200
Your team to up your game. if they can't up your

1669
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,760
game then please give way because for me, i

1670
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,160
Have to grow. The company has to grow. that is

1671
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,319
That's how I'm tuned and that's how I want

1672
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,799
Sameer and I want to take the company. so if

1673
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:33,440
there are people who want to grow with us

1674
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:35,119
so please keep yourself up

1675
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,799
If our products sell the same products

1676
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,480
if we stay like we were four years ago then we would have also closed down

1677
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,000
If we go then we need better product managers

1678
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,520
If that product manager wants to improve himself

1679
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,280
If you are able to do it then keep it, if you are not able to do it

1680
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,720
so you are saying something else basically

1681
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,640
It should be performance based, not like this

1682
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,000
Love cannot be based on affection, it is not

1683
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,599
100% and any company which does this, yes we

1684
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,400
So he has been running on loyalty for 20 years

1685
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:58,480
companies will shut down

1686
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,160
you by any chance this type what do you mean

1687
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,760
read on you is i probably i'm not saying

1688
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:06,079
that I will take it out but now those people are mine

1689
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,720
If he wants to run a good team in IPL

1690
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,200
So we need to keep better talent and hire better

1691
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,200
Talent and Keeping Up the Talent Ask This

1692
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,920
Team to keep up with themselves and that is

1693
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,799
How can you run a very good company I love my

1694
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,480
team you know i love all of them they all love us and

1695
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,079
It is not the case that if these people

1696
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,520
If they get another job, then everybody goes there too

1697
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,480
if we meet good people then we

1698
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,839
if you search for it then it is it is like that

1699
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,079
it's

1700
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,520
Bhai Family I think you are right like us

1701
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,680
I also can't decide from today onwards

1702
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,280
Papa, no you, it can't happen like this

1703
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,200
This is how we say it here, hey audience

1704
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,680
our family

1705
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,920
where which family means this is one

1706
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,520
India Family Family We are all family

1707
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,039
Like that one brings some sentiment

1708
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,480
I think you are a very useless sentiment

1709
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,799
right it should be performance base it's a

1710
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,720
Work Profile It's Not and Family Baggage

1711
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,799
yes brother i mean this is on one level with the family

1712
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,720
Even your laughter brings bad things to us

1713
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:58,079
You'll see I get that bit treat them as

1714
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,240
humans of treat them as your team hmm or

1715
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,200
or of course i can replace myself if i

1716
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,599
I'm not having a good job I think my job is

1717
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,440
is to make sure all the 24 years who worked

1718
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,839
for me by the time they are 30 they are richer

1719
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,000
More successful and better than meeting 100% me

1720
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,440
the effort that will be required for that which will take as long as

1721
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,440
I will have to talk about the training I will do

1722
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,520
You will need to get the modules, I will get them, you do them

1723
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,760
your brother is standing behind this is my good

1724
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,119
yes i like it but brother you are obsessive type

1725
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,720
you must be there friend I think you must be sleeping

1726
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,240
It won't be easy for me to go from 8 to 10

1727
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,400
I sleep for hours brother, it would be good if you get a full sleep

1728
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,079
yes but are you still like stable it is not coming

1729
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,440
If it happens, take melatonin after three to four days.

1730
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,359
I will take it. Then it would be fine after that. By the way

1731
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,359
You can read the book. Why? Why not

1732
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,880
Do you like reading the book? You were the one saying that.

1733
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,280
I will send you two-four books. You

1734
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,200
Sleep well. Come back after reading two pages. No

1735
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,880
But Methonin is also a top thing in itself.

1736
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,520
even if i can't sleep but are you

1737
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,119
Still the obsessed types? Obsessed over?

1738
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,880
means if you have breakfast in the morning then you still

1739
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,920
Thinking work? and that is an early stage

1740
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,640
The Thing That Later Disappears? I am not I

1741
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,799
Am I an extreme personality? If

1742
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,319
I am working, I will keep working. who came

1743
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,760
I will enjoy it if I enjoy my work

1744
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,119
I don't want to come, I feel like partying

1745
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,119
So let's have a party. if we afternoon

1746
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,799
At 2:00 pm I feel like going to the office

1747
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,400
Leave it my friend, there is no such urgent work

1748
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,760
Is. Let's all go and sit down to watch the movie

1749
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,160
Let's go and see a movie

1750
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,079
Are. Let's go out from there, somebody has to go out

1751
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,720
I have to go to some discus, let's go

1752
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,680
Whenever I have to go somewhere, I go there. I

1753
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:19,039
Personally, I do what makes me happy

1754
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,799
It is available. Whether it is work. but it has to

1755
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,160
Balanced with discipline. not just like that

1756
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:25,440
It may not be possible that the happiness that is being obtained

1757
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,160
I continue doing it. Edge An Advice. Do the same.

1758
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,240
You have to do the work. Yes. I am bored of you

1759
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,760
I know, now there is one that is very good

1760
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,359
had come. Someone has very nicely written that

1761
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,880
Let me tell you my own example.

1762
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,200
I did not think that why is this

1763
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,119
Do you work for Reliance? you know its so big

1764
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,440
There is a company. Still, everyone is working.

1765
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,359
There is so much profit. look at elon musk

1766
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,200
There is money. Still working though. As such

1767
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,039
Why do you do it? I feel for a while

1768
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,799
why do we do that friend has come so much

1769
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,559
why do it? You know life is boring

1770
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,160
She goes. It's not about money. they are not

1771
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,039
Working for Money. they will not start for

1772
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,880
money. it is life is boring if you only go

1773
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,559
For the holidays. if you keep going on holiday

1774
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,160
I also got a holiday from the holiday.

1775
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,520
There came a time when I felt empty

1776
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,720
I will take a holiday. I used to go on holiday.

1777
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,960
I got bored of him. then I go to work

1778
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,160
I had to go because I had to do the work. I have

1779
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:14,079

1780
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:16,240
Of people who start getting very rich. that

1781
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,480
Eventually it was not about the money. Husband's younger brother

1782
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,559
Just know you as an entrepreneur

1783
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,119
Entrepreneurs They Like Growth They Like

play it ain't just for money so for me

1790
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,680
The obsessing obsession I am talking about

1791
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,200
I was so obsessed with work that I

1792
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,799
I used to work 16 hours a day at a time when the boat

1793
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,799
start was starting 16 hours 17

1794
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,559
I have been sleeping for hours and getting up to check reviews

1795
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:52,559
People used to come to my house, I used to do that to them

1796
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,839
I used to send the product, see how it is sounding

1797
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,240
One of my friends even got angry

1798
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:58,079
Friend, we come to you every time for testing

1799
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,280
They are models, today I thank them

1800
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,039
I hope you guys did well

1801
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,640
If the testing goes bad then friend you

1802
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,400
Consumers were shocked to see that the test was not done properly

1803
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,319
I am taking this tea product ok

1804
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,319
I don't have any but all those who were my friends

1805
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,920
They also used to look at me thinking how crazy I am.

1806
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:12,079
How obsessed I was with this work

1807
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,520
This is how I am, if I need something

1808
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,200
I follow him a little bit

1809
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,880
I'm the type of person who gets cheap

1810
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,319
Be it my wife or my girlfriend

1811
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,319
There was a chip behind it. whether that work

1812
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,520
Be alert behind him. If I want success

1813
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,359
If you want to run behind, I have to run. Me

1814
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,280
I want success. I got my India top

1815
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:27,680
If I had to build a company, I had to build it, so I ran

1816
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,760
Behind him. Very interesting. to me i

1817
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,000
I am this type of man, brother. my vacation too

1818
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,839
It will be for 10 days. 7 to 8 days out of 15 days

1819
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,440
It's taking me a while to get over the intoxication of my work

1820
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,599
goes. that you are not working? Holiday

1821
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,680
You have come to convince me, Prakhar. Celebrate the holiday. and as long as

1822
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,000
My wife doesn't scold me, brother, leave it.

1823
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,359
Work goes on in my mind as soon as I wake up in the morning.

1824
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,359
Yes, that's a good thing. Right? to me

1825
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,760
It seems so too. you need to know how you do

1826
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,039
Switch off? Or how do you switch off? Brother I

1827
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,559
No, I am not even interested for two-three years

1828
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,319
In switching off. is that a fair thing to

1829
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,400
So that it doesn't get dragged out for two-three years

1830
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,160
You just need to switch off a little. such as the

1831
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,079
the thing looks good to me

1832
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,599
The concerts look great. so I

1833
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:02,400

I really enjoy playing paddle

1858
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,239
I thought about it for about two and a half hours

1859
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,759
when I'm playing paddle

1860
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:53,600
I don't think anything about my work

These are the issues related to work life balance

1873

But personally? I said it was work right now

1874

T-shirt. Or the doe line. Everybody Success I

Imbalance. If I told you this then I would

1883
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:41,199
I had told you, just see what happens if you

1884
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,040
You are studying when I am studying, right?

1885
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,120
when we were doing CA what did it matter to you

1886
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,640
It seems that I am following the love life at that time

1887
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,239
could have been done while you were doing CA

1888
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,080
There is no scope at all when you are so

1889
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:52,159
You are going in the morning, you are going in the afternoon, you are going at night

1890
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,920
If you are working then you are crazy about CA

1891
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:55,840
If you want to do that CA then you should work under it

1892
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,560
kare ho that's your that is what you are

1893
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,480
doing then after that in between me my

1894
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,000
As soon as Priya came into my life, I followed her

1895
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,840
I kept running so I started working

1896
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,159
I kept on focusing on work and not on my mind

1897
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,600
I kept roaming around like this, then

1898
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,120
Later it was useful in my life. The boat arrived

1899
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,840
So I kept running after the boat, kept running,

1900
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,239
I kept running. so i mean it also

1901
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,199
Depends on which stage of life you are

1902
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:19,840
in, whatever you are where you are and that

1903
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:22,480
sometimes work takes an imbalance and

1904
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,480
Sometimes personal life too. Personal Life to

1905
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,880
An Imbalance. So it depends on that. End

1906
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,679
the second i say i tell i keep telling my

1907
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,440
Team. and that's how i am also that it is

1908
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,520
It's not like you're working for 10 hours

1909
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,760
You have to work for 8 hours, you have to work.

1910
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
Our team has 8 hours of work. if you are 4

1911
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,960
what are you doing in one hour what will you do in the next 4 hours

1912
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,320
It doesn't matter to me. week

1913
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,080
if you are doing the work in 3 days

1914
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,360
It doesn't matter to me. so it's all

1915
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,840
About Efficiency. it's not about

1916
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,520
It's not about quantity. it's more about

1917
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,440
Quality. It's about the efficiency. What

1918
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,120
They tell me that those hours long debates are

1919
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,679
It doesn't look good. I just arrived at a place

1920
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,600
I had told you. So I don't care about hours.

1921
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,480
Would have fallen.

1922
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,800
So Courteous Brow is the perfect quotable line

1923
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,400
Brother, this reel is true, you will not cut it from here

1924
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,159
Tell me Himanshu I have been

1925
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,000
The hour doesn't matter, it's true, yes, very true

1926
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,920
It's a matter brother, it doesn't matter to me brother

1927
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,520
And the man who is intoxicated, his

1928
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,719
More or less hours, it doesn't matter

1929
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,159
It doesn't matter, some days I

1930
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,320
I don't get up from bed because I

1931
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:19,360
I will take rest for some days brother exactly 12-15

1932
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,880
16 18 19 20 25 hours same day I will go to Bombay

1933
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,400
I will come back the same day and shoot the next day

1934
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,280
It doesn't matter, it's your job brother

1935
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,159
Work is our work 100% but in view of that

1936
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,679
What is your end goal? Have you ever thought about it?

1937
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:32,560
And goal means I know you been asking this

1938
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:36,239
Question. Or I don't mean death bhaiya. I

1939
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,159
Don't, well that's why I stopped. I this

1940
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,880
I am not talking about death. I in General

1941
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,960
I am saying, with your work? you are there an

1942
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,280
Aspiration work wise that you follow. one goal

1943
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,120
A note to yourself Star. friend when the company is big

1944
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,080
It happens, then you have to start having

1945
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,320
Goals. you start doing things which are

1946
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:55,040
You know you have to have a plan. and and

1947
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,800
Sameer is very good in doing that analysis

1948
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,440
Data.

1949
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,840
he is he is he is running the company in a

1950
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,480
where it is more structured and I am a

1951
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:07,520
More Gutfeel Guy. I will do things which I

1952
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,360
You feel right. and i don't look at me

1953
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,320
What were you saying that I am more important than the data

1954
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,320
I believe in the donor.

1955
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:22,320
Write without any reason madam. That is true. Yes its true friend.

1956
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,760
end data so I think I'll take a turn

1957
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,440
I will tell you just that. I work in a company

1958
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,920
Had been. This is what came out of it from him. so I

1959
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,719
When I went to the company I was doing consulting

1960
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,679
Was in the company. so my boss there

1961
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,560
He said you know let's go there and pitch.

1962
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,560
Are. So that was not an acquisition, that was a

1963
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,040
To demerge. So the pitch for the demerger

1964
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,360
How was that to differentiate them? We will do it differently.

1965
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,000
Ok? So when I went there, the company

1966
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,239
wasn't it, its CEO tells my boss but

1967
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,280
You only suggested that we should do this with them

1968
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:53,360
We need amalgamation and together with them

1969
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,040
should do joint venture and now

1970
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,040
You must have come, we should resolve and work

1971
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,040
So that was my boss's answer to which I replied

1972
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,719
When it was over he said friend I

1973
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,480
I had given the data correctly, please correct it

1974
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,600
You did not implement it properly

1975
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,600
I gave you the right strategy

1976
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,600
The implementation was not done properly since that time

1977
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,120
My heart got distracted from the data, I said

1978
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,520
Brother, I am not able to work with data

1979
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:14,320
Do it right, do it well, do it well.

1980
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,239
It's not that data is not important. Butt which I

1981
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,480
I'm a gut field guy. Sameer Data's guy

1982
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:21,760
Is. and that's why both of us run this

1983
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,719
Company Differently. we so you know not

1984
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,199
Differently both this Sameer is a data guy.

1985
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,760
I am a servant of the donor and I feel

1986
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,679
There is a lot of mixture. if not then but now that

1987
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,920
The feel of an entrepreneur is varied. Got

1988
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:39,600
It. And you never think about personal legacy

1989
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:42,640
You think that's what you should mean

1990
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,080
from a man's work for a long time or his

1991
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:49,800
Do you ever think like this for children too, friend?

1992
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,800
me to mine

1993
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,040
Good point and I know that now

1994
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,640
What does one like about me or no one else

1995
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,120
Didn't help me when I was trying to grow my business

1996
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,640
I was doing it right, I didn't have any mentors

1997
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,920
Many people have mentors in their lives

1998
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,360
Those who become mentors are not my mentors

1999
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,280
I live. But I like it now

2000
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,040
When I help young startups

2001
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,880
I invest in them and their

2002
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,640
If there is any growth then I would feel very good

2003
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,719
that you know I gave advice to some who

2004
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,239
I have made mistakes so that others do not make them

2005
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,600
They ask me for them and I

2006
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:18,640
I will give them the answer. advice to them

2007
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,800
I will give it. it feels so good that you know

2008
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,960
I am being able to help new

2009
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,880
Entrepreneurs

2010
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,560
Do well in their businesses. I like it very much

2011
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,600
I feel like when I meet people and they say

2012
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,040
Yes sir you inspire me. Hmm. yours yours

2013
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,280
It feels great to hear the story. Because

2014
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,000
Friend I am the only one so look when I see a shark

2015
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,560
Even when I go to the tank, I wear jeans and sneakers

2016
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,239
I reached there wearing a T-shirt. and normally

2017
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,480
There used to be people, all dressed in suits

2018
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:44,159
Are. So you too see this generation of ours

2019
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,239
He is wearing jeans, he is wearing a T-shirt. So

2020
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,159
It is okay. It doesn't matter appearance. whatever

2021
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,600
It doesn't matter what you wear. Brother work

2022
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,040
Doing it makes a difference. What are you doing

2023
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,800
That makes a difference. How the company is formed

2024
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,159
That makes a difference. how big is the business

2025
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,840
are you making it? How are you making it? why make

2026
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:57,520
had been? Who are you making it for? What to do

2027
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,360
had been? That makes a difference. Do that.

2028
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,120
Who cares if you wear a suit or clothes?

2029
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,800
Is? One can't build business by wearing a tie.

2030
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:08,239
so I gave you a little bit of that a little bit of that

2031
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,560
The suit culture was prevalent in India, right?

2032
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:12,320
After saying this I said, this is how I am.

2033
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,360
I am not that good at English.

2034
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,440
It is not that I don't know English.

2035
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,520
English is stuck somewhere in the middle

2036
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,440
She goes. Ok. so i you know people

2037
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,880
started saying or sir look at yours

2038
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,280
The article has arrived. Now if you pay attention

2039
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,199
You will see it will be written Amans English.

2040
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,520
It is written somewhere in it. amnes english is broken

2041
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,120
burst. So ok brother this is how English is

2042
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,040
It's a little better to perfect your English

2043
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,040
Making your business perfect is your business

2044
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,280
We know how to run the business, we are strong players

2045
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,440
You know how to do it right with a little English

2046
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,480
It is not necessary that the business is made or not

2047
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,640
So it is not necessary that you know then I

2048
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:45,040
Stereotypes that were there to build a business

2049
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,760
Leaving that aside, when people meet me they say Sir

2050
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,840
We are also like this, you have fun as well as get torn

2051
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,080
You do it and you are running such a big company too.

2052
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,080
If you are just like us then it feels so right

2053
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,400
no that gives a lot of hope to the people that they

2054
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,400
can also probably build something and

2055
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,840
that gives a lot of inspiration to lots of

2056
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,600
Young Guys Which I'm Very Happy About

2057
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,920
That I am able to inspire them. correct.

2058
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,159
Whatever I do, this is who I am.

2059
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,000
And people get hope and inspiration from

2060
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,520
There. I will tell you exactly what

2061
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,280
That is it. Like you said, I have a mentor

2062
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,960
were not there. Many times I feel myself in it

2063
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,080
I wish I had some mentors. then to me

2064
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,600
Seems like I'm doing something wrong. What

2065
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,280
I don't go out and look for a mentor. then to me

2066
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,360
One gets peace. He says, brother, I have a mentor

2067
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,520
were not there. I made so many companies

2068
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,960
Worth so many crores. Then the man says friend

2069
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,600
And you should take this English thing lightly

2070
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,120
had been. Brother, when I was young I

2071
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,719
Access to courts etc. is available very quickly

2072
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,320
Went. Papa is a lawyer and also a chartered accountant

2073
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,840
After. I used to see a lawyer standing there now

2074
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,920
Is. He tries to speak in English

2075
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,440
Used to be. I understand the judge's condition and

2076
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,440
I felt bad that how could he understand this

2077
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,880
What is the lawyer saying? you speak in hindi

2078
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,960
Well brother, Hindi is allowed in our courts

2079
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,880
Speak in. But that is an English style

2080
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,560
Is. yes sir that test gets removed now

2081
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,960
You have to speak in English only. no matter how broken

2082
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,400
I have to speak in English. And I'd be talking

2083
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,679
Needed We say that this should be a matter

2084
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,360
Needed If you do not understand the point

2085
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,520
What is happening in English and Hindi? Yes

2086
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,640
yes you understand this is not much no and

2087
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,640
I know very well why I feel this way

2088
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,960
Show of culture has become a special South

2089
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,719
Delhi, South Bombay and these metros

2090
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,239
no if you if you look properly

2091
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,719
If you don't speak English, people judge you

2092
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:07,440
I go [ __ ] myself what man what are you

2093
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:10,480
saying or please in english what are your

2094
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,159
english yaar butt and brother i mine

2095
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,760
experience because I lived abroad when

2096
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,520
I spent my first 6 months abroad

2097
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,120
I had some trouble, I don't know English so fast

2098
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,719
I could have spoken then I said now I

2099
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,159
I will learn when I have learned then I will

2100
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,360
When I started speaking the white people would turn around and say

2101
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:24,560
How come you have better English than me?

2102
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,800
does it come? So I would sort it out for myself

2103
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,040
Am. It is just a language. 18 more languages

2104
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,040
Brother, I have to learn. Yes. so that's english

2105
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,480
imposition of

2106
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,719
This is one thing I've seen, like for

2107
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,880
Instance is in Faridabad, you can find one here

2108
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,560
Open a good restaurant and see how it works. 2

2109
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,719
Closes in a year. Why? Because

2110
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,560
The man has to go to Delhi and spend the money. the one that you

2111
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:45,040
You were talking about aspirationality, right? Man

2112
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,040
doesn't want his health food tasty.

2113
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,560
A man needs his health food a little bitter.

2114
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,960
Because he should have to pay the cost

2115
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,840
I have decided to enjoy this luxury. So

2116
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,679
it is kind of like this that english and that

2117
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,239
In the pursuit of aspirationality, the man says

2118
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,400
I should feel pain if I speak English

2119
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:02,719
Otherwise I learned a little English, that's why

2120
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,080
I became high status. This is a game which Indians

2121
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,320
has invented it. We just keep playing

2122
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,239
Are. it's not that they are right or wrong but

2123
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,159
You know it's them. but i am just saying

2124
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:12,320
I normalize the fact that it's not

2125
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:14,880
The Necessary That You Need to Have to Be Very Fluent

2126
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,080
English. My English is not bad. But

2127
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,440
Mine isn't as good as

2128
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,719
Problem is there for many of my fellow shorts too

2129
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,640
Will be. He also shares knowledge so well.

2130
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,080
But my business is probably going better than theirs.

2131
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,760
But it is not necessary that only by sharing knowledge

2132
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,080
Sir it is something. Everything is possible by speaking good English

2133
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,960
Something happen. You are what you are. you your game

2134
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,800
Play. You make your game better. and others

2135
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:34,159
Don't watch the game. Your biggest fear

2136
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,679
What is? My fear. Hmm. My fear is that

2137
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,360
I

2138
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:40,719
Irrelevance.

2139
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:45,760
Dam at deep. yes, is it? Or, of course. No

2140
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:49,920
Bad. I don't but irrelevance and all areas

2141
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:52,159
that I will be left behind. yes but brother your

2142
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,320
This race is going to be very tough on the stakes

2143
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,080
Because your stakes are that high.

2144
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,679
For me it has to be relevant that I'm a YouTuber

2145
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,239
I am becoming relevant, right? For you

2146
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:02,480
It has to be irrelevant that brother I am in business now

2147
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:04,400
shark Tank. Now brother startup

2148
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,239
Maha Kumbh everywhere because then he and

2149
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,640
There must be pressure building up. I don't take pressure.

2150
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,400
It's fun. It's fun. but i'm scared

2151
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,800
If there is no fear then life will become boring

2152
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:15,920
Buddy. A little bit of paranoia is variant. I am

2153
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,600
very and I said it I said that you I am

2154
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,520
Very passionate about what I do. but i am

2155
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,400
Very Paranoid About What Others Can Do Too

2156
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,080
Me. Right? So paranoia is variant. tell me

2157
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:28,000
Peacock. parano is very important because if you are here today

2158
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,440
You are sitting on the date of. you might be thinking

2159
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,440
You are the best. There's no one better than you

2160
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,280
Can. The other guy has a better product than you

2161
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,800
It is bringing it. I talk about my company cheaply

2162
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,120
I will do it first. Ok? you are thinking of

2163
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,120
that boss if you are the best then there is no one better than you

2164
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,640
can't. You know it is like this. This way

2165
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,640
People with the same thinking had abandoned us

2166
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,719
What will that boat do, friend? How big is the bun

2167
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,480
He will go and you will become big. Today he is for us

2168
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,600
Let's see. They copy brands like us

2169
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,040
Are. What we are doing is the

2170
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,440
We get inspired and see that friend

2171
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,440
We should do this too. Correct. such if

2172
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,840
We let go and someone else comes and takes over

2173
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,920
So it won't feel good, right? So I always came

2174
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,040
keep up the game the boss how to fight them

2175
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,120
Is? What is the plan? What is he supposed to do?

2176
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:04,320
Strategy. Be it small or big, you have to

2177
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,640
keep it up and it's a lot you can learn from it

2178
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,880
These young companies, young startups. not in

2179
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,960
My field in any field. there is so much

2180
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,800
Change is Happening and If You Don't Change With It

2181
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,600
The Changing Times You Will Die. so i in

2182
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,000
my company also i like to see whats

2183
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,719
Happening around me.

2184
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,520
I like to see how I can make my company

2185
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:26,560
better and i don't want my company to go

2186
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:30,320
Down. so i want to keep adopting my

2187
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,880
Strategies on Consumer Marketing

2188
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,400
Product distribution as of today

2189
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,280
If I tell you the truth do it offline

2190
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:39,920
If people were ignoring me online

2191
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,360
If it would have happened then today when we started with many companies

2192
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,960
were you doing it so he was offline with us

2193
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,800
says brands don't pay attention to online

2194
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,719
It is a small market, how big will it become today

2195
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,440
When we grew up, we became online and offline

2196
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,840
we are also going to do the same thing if we had a date today

2197
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,679
Many companies have adopted Quick Commerce in the past

2198
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,520
Today Quick Commerce has been ignored, if it is big

2199
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:57,120
It is done and you are not on it, then the other one

2200
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,920
The company that was born in Quick Commerce and

2201
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,920
When she grows up, she will come to you here. True

2202
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,280
Brother, did you understand? yes absolutely bro if you

2203
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,199
If you ignore YouTube then your old

2204
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,120
The media brand has become outdated because it

2205
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,760
Now the world has changed as it was supposed to be

2206
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,760
Can't do it. yesterday he came tomorrow something else came

2207
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,520
Is reels gone or some other new platform has come

2208
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,880
if I went and you guys don't go then you are finished and

2209
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,760
Brother now the iteration cycle is so short isn't it

2210
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:22,080
Has the reel become old or four years old?

2211
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,760
Shots came 2 years ago, even the old ones came

2212
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,679
It's done, it's become difficult to grow on it

2213
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,840
So the iteration cycle of things is so short

2214
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,280
Friend at this time you feel very dynamic

2215
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,719
You have to stay at least to work

2216
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,120
In my field, I am sure in every field

2217
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,520
In every field, I tell you simple things, bro.

2218
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,159
Am

2219
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,159
There is a change in the field of shampoo as well

2220
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:41,840
Is. Earlier we used to use normal shampoo

2221
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:44,640
I used to use it. Then came new types of shampoos

2222
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:47,520
In which they say no free chemical free

2223
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,280
What do you say jargon? paraben free free

2224
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,960
everything free everything free free free free free

2225
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,560
by doing this and if he had not come these days

2226
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,560
So the consumer has changed now, right?

2227
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,960
He doesn't need so many chemicals. then now new

2228
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:02,080
type if something is coming then they also have

2229
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:04,560
To adapt to the new change. so every very

2230
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,800
And I love the fact that the market is very

2231
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,000
Dynamic.

2232
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,480
The market is so dynamic that even if you sleep

2233
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,800
if you sleep

2234
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,440
You may end up losing the market. You

2235
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:20,560
Connaught. any industry you are in whatever you

2236
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:23,040
Are you a youtuber whether you are even in employees

2237
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,880
Even in your team if you are you know what and

2238
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,960
sometimes you get people who are better

2239
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,040
Performance and you see them growing. donation

2240
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:33,440
sometimes the performer who is not so ah good

2241
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,440
Good.

2242
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,360
It is a sales channel. Make the second sales channel better

2243
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,679
Used to be. So as a company we would always like

2244
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:50,000
to give

2245
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,840
you know better growth than somebody who is

2246
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,520
Performing Then to Somebody Is Not

2247
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,920
Performing. and if this guy who sees that the

2248
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,239
another guy is performing then he will either he

2249
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,400
will he leave the job and he will know he won't

2250
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:03,040
Grow in our company because this guy is

2251
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,960
Performing. so i am not i am saying that

2252
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,800
Weather it's youtuber. like you guys

2253
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,400
A simple example is that you have not changed your

2254
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,320
Did. You will continue doing the same. do the same thing

2255
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,920
You will stay. You will ask the same question. we are bored

2256
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,320
I won't go and watch your podcast, dad.

2257
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,760
Brother, we will not see this every year

2258
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,520
you have to reinvent it without even knowing it

2259
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,840
Chalo the audience has been reinvented

2260
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,520
Because the audience knows that it is just

2261
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,360
goes into the background yes but if

2262
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,520
If you don't think, you will be finished

2263
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,440
Poor creators, I feel so

2264
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,880
Creators come and keep doing the same thing

2265
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,199
We all like it for a while

2266
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,960
it feels new but if you keep yourself

2267
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:35,120
If you don't change then you and I will get bored too

2268
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,960
You will not go away and keep hearing the same thing

2269
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,520
A new creator arrives or I can speak

2270
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,600
volumes about that butt means you look

2271
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,520
Any person's growth is visible on Instagram

2272
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,199
Is. Went from here to here and then stopped. Why?

2273
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,560
Because that newness became a hit brother. Now he

2274
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,159
got older. Now there is no one in this item

2275
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,840
Not interested. Six more men are doing the same thing

2276
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:51,280
Are. Now there is no growth in your goods.

2277
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,760
And the man says hey why should I get money

2278
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,679
Are you closed? they do not understand. so it means

2279
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,679
I think this is the first generation

2280
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,440
They are career creators. Write the playbook now

2281
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,040
It has been happening. just figured out how to do it

2282
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,960
If it is there then how to do it. will it last or not

2283
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,199
It will last. AI will not come. 50 ways

2284
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,719
That's it. But give me this internal conversation

2285
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:08,400
The creators sit and think about how to do it

2286
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,080
The platform runs from. and most of it

2287
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,440
There is an important demand for reinvention, otherwise you

2288
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:15,360
You are dead. Forget about yesterday. then talk to him

2289
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,760
Took. I talked about my industry,

2290
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:20,880
We talked about the teams. you look anywhere

2291
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,639
Take. Put an example anywhere that means

2292
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,400
Throw a stone and see, we have to talk about it. So

2293
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,840
Let's talk about this. Let's talk about TV. TV

2294
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,440
They are getting smaller. if its good

2295
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,679
TV has not become smaller, it has not become better

2296
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,120
it hasn't happened, it hasn't happened, it's light

2297
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,600
yes, if the color and sound are not better then this too

2298
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:36,880
They will be finished. we are improving everything

2299
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,400
It has been happening. Everything You Told Me Your Mentors

2300
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,000
There was no building stage etc. at that time

2301
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,320
me but i am sure there are things you

2302
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,600
Learn from your father or can you recall one

2303
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,719
and three things that you learn from your

2304
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,800
My Father My Father Na Modi Stone Me

2305
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:52,320
Modi used to sell tyres and had a company by making stones

2306
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:56,800
There was Modi Rubber, there was no sales manager and

2307
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:58,480
Used to go to sell tyres to retailers

2308
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,320
When I was doing CA, I

2309
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,320
When I was leaving in the middle, he

2310
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,760
What happened to I had a friend Siddharth

2311
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,239
I had a very good friend, he was doing CA

2312
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,080
Was. When he came home I was older at that time.

2313
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,639
I had friends from school who were very close to me

2314
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,800
I used to party in college sometimes

2315
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,800
OS are you ever going to face any customer

2316
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,960
we are going somewhere and he keeps reading

2317
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,400
He had started studying CA so he came to me

2318
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:22,320
I used to tell my father uncle look at this

2319
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,840
He is having fun and dad was watching

2320
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,600
that he is studying and doing well in life

2321
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,199
My dad asked me why don’t you do it

2322
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,440
You also do something, he pushed me

2323
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:31,440
I told you to do it too so I did CA for them

2324
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,840
In the process, today I became their CA

2325
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,440
if he didn't push me

2326
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,600
If it had happened then I would not have become a CA today, so they

2327
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,360
He pushed me. seconds and he's my friend

2328
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,120
Even today I tell this to anyone who came to my house

2329
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,960
Thank you Siddharth bhai, in your affair

2330
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,800
ok i read it, you would not have come home

2331
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,880
I don't even know at the time

2332
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,320
that is it, that picture, which picture is that

2333
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,239
That is not the Lakshya picture that my friend

2334
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,960
If I am doing it then I will also do it, if he did it then

2335
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:54,480
Dad saw me and told me I did it too

2336
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,400
The thing to learn is that they didn't do much

2337
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,080
I had taught you a good thing when you work

2338
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,800
They used to do it, then when they went to another company

2339
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:03,679
I joined VTI and was given a company and there

2340
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:06,000
But he got the office car

2341
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:08,560
So when I used to use the house for home

2342
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,120
no his car so he used to say that you have returned home

2343
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,440
If it is used for then get petrol filled in it

2344
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,440
I gave you ₹500 because you used that much.

2345
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,360
I have done it. I don't understand what Papa is doing

2346
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:21,040
had been? Who is getting to know? I did not say

2347
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:23,280
Keep company, professional and personal use separate

2348
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,159
Should be different. today is my date

2349
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,080
Does anyone in the company even ask for samples?

2350
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:29,679
He doesn't even give his sample. I want Priya

2351
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,280
yes, you are my wife, you are my mother, mother

2352
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,800
So, she has fought as well. yours is so big

2353
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,880
Cannot give samples to companies. myself

2354
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,639
I buy samples and give them. I

2355
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,560
Nowhere does one give free samples. I have

2356
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,480
Kept my professional life and my personal

2357
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Life is totally separate. and the company is so

2358
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,320
Clean. How many auditors come? How many?

2359
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,719
The investors come. IPO is also happening

2360
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:50,000
Is. It's different that you keep it separate.

2361
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,600
that you are just you know it is you are just

2362
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,840
You are a founder but you are also working

2363
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,760
For the company which is separate. so do not

2364
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,199
A scandal has just happened, what is its name?

2365
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,960
Is? Blue Smart has no problem with that

2366
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:03,440
I had done the lines. It's variant. that's what I

2367
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,199
I had learnt in my childhood that keep your brothers separate and she

2368
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,440
Things become a habit which starts in childhood

2369
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:09,760
Let's learn it separately. Seconds my dad who

2370
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,520
They taught me this, they used to say back still borrow

2371
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,000
Eventually you have to order

2372
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,000
If you need any kind of business then I

2373
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,239
My mindset was that I should bring in business

2374
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,400
Is. The consumer has to win. Now the consumer

2375
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:22,159
How to win? It's going through his mind.

2376
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,920
My mind is running the same way. Consumer

2377
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,600
I want to win over her because she likes this color

2378
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,679
It seems. This is why the consumer has to win

2379
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,239
He wants it at this price and he wants this model

2380
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,560
Needed Have to take order from consumer. How

2381
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:34,639
I have to take it, I have to take it from him. I have to impress her.

2382
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,120
His marketing has to do what he likes

2383
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:38,719
Come. I have to do something for him

2384
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,719
May it be good. Not be good to me.

2385
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,800
Sometimes companies start becoming products

2386
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,600
Forward. I believe best companies are

2387
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,600
Consumers Backward. if you are a consumer

2388
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,920
Backward. And that's what I learned. you have

2389
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,840
to get PO from that customer in a bee to

2390
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,560
B. Language. and you get love from the

2391
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,800
Customer in A to C language.

2392
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,600
Got it. Very interesting. how is yours

2393
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:03,040
Relationship with him? Your father? Love, It's

2394
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,960
Love. He supported through all of this. now then

2395
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,760
It’s fun. You must be wondering that what I mean

2396
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,440
I have a son. The width is different. different fun in it

2397
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,120
It's no fun. In seeing daddy widen.

2398
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,800
It is very correct. It's a lot of fun, friend.

2399
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,880
My father is so happy. I so much

2400
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,560
I feel happy to see them, how much

2401
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,920
They thought I was worthless and useless

2402
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,880
will be. You must be happy. no not very

2403
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,040
It’s fun. And as they said in the beginning

2404
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,040
I didn't even have money. So my dad

2405
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,360
He also supported me a lot in this business

2406
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,360
Take this. do this a little bit and remember me

2407
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,800
isn't it the best Diwali would have been and

2408
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,239
Gifts had to be given on Diwali. We people

2409
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,120
Nothing used to happen. not even our name

2410
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:36,719
It used to happen. So papa, every year during Diwali our

2411
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,880
I used to buy gifts for the child as well

2412
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,719
It will be beneficial. We will also get a name. They

2413
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,960
I will give it also. Even if you show it to someone there

2414
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:45,600
He used to go and say that this is Aman's company. See

2415
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,600
How are you feeling? So from inside there is no one

2416
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,120
It used to be there, we would have got support there. First

2417
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,120
So we started an office as well so their office

2418
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,040
Started from there only. Yes. So support me friend

2419
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,520
Family is very important. sometimes

2420
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,520
you take it them for granted but i came

2421
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,400
I love it. And what about aunty? from aunty

2422
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:04,960
What did you learn? I learnt it from aunty. mine is

2423
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:07,040
It's mom. From this I learned how to say sorry

2424
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,760
great joke great joke great timing you

2425
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:12,480
You have been sitting with Rahul for a long time. No.

2426
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,960
No, actually I really liked it.

2427
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,920
I learnt it from my mom. Mummy is a go-getter.

2428
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,760
Yes.

2429
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:22,159
Mummy had a complete goiter, you know who her

2430
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,639
internal thing like ethics etc from papa

2431
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:26,560
If you learn well then you can win the competition from your mother

2432
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,800
How to manage mom, we both commit ourselves

2433
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,000
she kept making me do that, your friend see

2434
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,159
How well he is doing I love it

2435
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,040
He is doing well so she came inside me

2436
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:38,560
competitiveness, falling behind, getting caught

2437
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:42,719
If you want something then you should go after it and then

2438
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:46,080
to me that was what do you call it

2439
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,480
Go Getter Dynamism That's Competitiveness

2440
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:53,520
that

2441
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:55,600
that craziness is from my mom and this joe

2442
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,920
This is his way of being proud of his uncle

2443
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,520
Is he different or the same as my father

2444
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,800
Mummy has a mummy like she knows

2445
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,480
If I am doing well then talk to me

2446
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,960
Give me the money every month, I will pay you

2447
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,320
I am as many as they need every year

2448
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,560
Now they say I want more and more

2449
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,320
Papa keeps taking it, she is his different style

2450
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,719
they say its not me i am my i

2451
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:17,400
My money is different, your money is different, I am that

2452
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,400
I will tell them quietly from somewhere

2453
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,560
He keeps the money in my room at his house.

2454
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,320
There was a party last week so I told Papa

2455
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,000
take my whiskey otherwise it will be yours

2456
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:28,000
Mummy bought whiskey and said Amman

2457
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,560
Take out your whiskey and have some for me too my friend

2458
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,639
Are

2459
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,199
what bro so I told you to take it out from the locker

2460
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:37,920
Here you bring this, Papa is saying that I am not the one

2461
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:40,960
which I will feed

2462
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,199
It is very different, I enjoy it, yes brother, yes I came

2463
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,679
Think it is one of the lightest joys of success

2464
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:47,199
along with your family who stays with you day one

2465
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,960
those who invested money in you then

2466
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:51,440
Or did I set my heart on you then that you would do it

2467
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,520
the happiness on your friend's or their face

2468
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,440
Look at me and give me a genuine try on this matter

2469
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,040
I differ a little bit because in between

2470
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,719
So they all thought that I could not do anything

2471
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,800
Whether he is my friend or

2472
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,400
Be it the family, everybody felt that friend, he is capable of it

2473
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,560
No, because so many businesses failed

2474
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,080
At that time I had no faith in myself

2475
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,760
Even the family members were left scared

2476
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,000
It seemed that brother, I should have invested more money in this

2477
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,880
So there will be no loss, yes you are sure

2478
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,120
The journey has been a little rocky brother, so brother you

2479
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,719
But trust has also been loose. The flag was also rocky

2480
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:19,040
And my way of life is also rocky and randy

2481
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,560
Is. yes right. do you like movies

2482
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,760
Enough? I like it very much. well you

2483
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,080
Do you watch these Bollywood movies a lot?

2484
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,320
etc? It is not enough. means I am not mine

2485
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,719
There are fixed patterns. was telling me so

2486
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,480
no what we were just talking about I have many

2487
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,520
I watch movies. meri naa 10 movies

2488
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,199
My app has been downloaded on that phone. And

2489
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,960
I keep seeing the same 10. look over and over again

2490
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:38,719
I can. I like it very much.

2491
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,320
I also go to the hotel. So I first

2492
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,760
Since childhood I have been loving Nainital a lot

2493
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,960
Was. So there was a hotel in Nainital called Grand

2494
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,480
hotel. I would stay there now, it's like I go to Udaipur

2495
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,080
I have a fixed hotel in Udaipur and

2496
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,760
It has fixed rooms which I like

2497
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,440
Is. I always like being in the same room

2498
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,920
It seems that I don't like any other room.

2499
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:56,639
I know what to do with expensive hobbies

2500
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,679
Are? What to do if a person has a test

2501
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:02,480
What should I do? press it, press it, what are we

2502
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,080
What will a person do with expensive hobbies? What can a poor person do?

2503
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,760
They are expensive, what can one do if one wins

2504
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,840
will take

2505
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,760
love it this india actually is

2506
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,360
Attitude is very much needed brother, why money

2507
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,960
Having so much estrangement from money and creating so much distance

2508
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,920
keep money in such a way

2509
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,239
yes brother he has resources and he has his purpose

2510
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,400
I mean, generally I think money is a very

2511
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:24,000
Sensitive topic in India needlessly not

2512
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,760
it's not like that no you don't think so now

2513
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,600
India is changing friend, it is now India

2514
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,120
What you were saying earlier about Divers

2515
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,639
There are opinions. Somebody likes something,

2516
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,840
Nobody likes it. show off to me

2517
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:33,040
I don’t like doing it at all. to me

2518
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,880
If I feel good then I wear it. No

2519
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,320
If I like it then I wouldn't wear it. I T-shirt

2520
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,159
Have to wear it. I am also very fond of HNM

2521
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,440
There are t-shirts. If I am human then so is she

2522
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,960
I wear it. I need to take more

2523
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,480
I take more. If I have a T-shirt

2524
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,960
If it looks good then I will take it. Me

2525
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,480
I don't see why I'm taking this

2526
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,239
Because its brand is very good. My

2527
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,360
I am not interested in this thing but go back to Nainital and

2528
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,040
Udaipur. What were you saying? I am saying

2529
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,280
Whenever I went to Nainital, I used to go to Udaipur.

2530
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,280
I have not been through the same things many times

2531
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:58,000
It's so much fun doing the same old thing

2532
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:00,560
Is. Like every Saturday many of my friends

2533
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,120
It is good to meet them and talk about the same things

2534
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,520
Seems like go to the same hotel and the same room

2535
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,280
I enjoy staying here. go to the same city

2536
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,120
It feels good. doing the same old things

2537
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,800
It feels very good. new things sometimes

2538
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,960
I don't want to do it because I don't enjoy it

2539
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,639
Comes. Now during the holidays my wife and

2540
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,800
I am very different in these things. Priya's

2541
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,960
I always feel like exploring new places

2542
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,560
We will do it, we will go somewhere new and live a great life.

2543
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,159
I too feel like it sometimes but sometimes

2544
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,239
I feel like I have to go there,

2545
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:26,080
That's what I have to do. So a holiday we will take her

2546
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:27,760
Let's proceed accordingly. a holiday on my own

2547
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,600
Let's go from. So many things in life are like that

2548
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,360
I am not able to do that in many places

2549
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,280
Need to grind. Brother you are absolutely right

2550
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,679
Buddy. Somewhere it feels like the same old thing,

2551
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,520
same old days yes otherwise everything is so

2552
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:39,360
Everything remains dynamic. I I get it.

2553
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,199
I have no friends from school. His Wives

2554
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,880
We all meet. Ok? sometime every

2555
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:46,960
See you on Saturday. Mostly we every once

2556
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,199
I meet you every month. and on the same things

2557
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,960
Those who laughed last month laugh. and very

2558
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:53,360
We enjoy it. and his wife says so

2559
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,800
We did not hear anything.

2560
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,639
you remember it exactly, that's why then this

2561
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,560
What a stupid thing you did. Yes, that's it. First

2562
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,000
At first they didn’t like that we

2563
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,520
I am laughing at the same things. Now them

2564
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,719
those things also seem good and if we don't

2565
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,719
If I do that, he says the same thing, my friend

2566
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,280
Every time one or two new things are added.

2567
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:14,239
But the fun you get with the old one is that

2568
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,679
Addiction is something else. We do not know what this

2569
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,840
What will you say about this analysis

2570
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,560
It's nostalgia, I mean look at this, I mean the old

2571
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:23,120
friend i feel like 23 24 25

2572
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,639
You can't even have that fun later

2573
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,880
It starts decreasing with your friends

2574
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:30,239
You start making fewer friends after the age of 28 or 29.

2575
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,000
A real friend is one who lives in an era where

2576
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:33,520
But you get naked in front of your friends

2577
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,840
Your embarrassments in front of you

2578
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,400
All your vulnerability is always in front of you

2579
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,480
Things came together in these formative years

2580
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,400
That story happens even if you eat it 100 times

2581
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,320
it's fun at least that's what I

2582
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,159
Feel. Yeah ur right. I look at our

2583
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,840
What actually happened in between when we

2584
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:49,280
People, everyone has to struggle in their life

2585
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,840
had begun. Everyone in their own life

2586
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:54,639
They were going separately. so i think last few

2587
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,719
Years is when we have to come back again

2588
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:58,560
What We Were. Meaning, they were lost somewhere in the middle.

2589
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,880
They were managing their own lives. and you know

2590
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,199
Then we realised that the fun was in them

2591
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,600
Is. Like starting a project

2592
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:07,440
who became a company brother man in doing kids

2593
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,800
The time is definitely wasted. being on

2594
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:12,719
This side you know young company almost married.

2595
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,560
I can see that I have four years in between

2596
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,560
If there are children to disappear. no bro now

2597
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,520
So I will get married in 6 months. But technically

2598
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:21,760
Meaning it is the same thing. so what about the kids

2599
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,639
I was speaking like this. I thought they wouldn't.

2600
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,080
I think about it, I take care of it. Pressure

2601
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,719
It keeps getting made brother. what from here to there

2602
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,239
Let me tell you that you have experienced a great sadness. Saying

2603
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:32,960
There is so much trust involved in cutting a child.

2604
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:37,120
Waji is awesome. You must know it. I mean brother

2605
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:39,360
It is my friends'. It doesn't mean brother.

2606
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,280
Brother, I can't say if he brought it by stealing it.

2607
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:44,400
But you can see that now his life is a

2608
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:46,080
there is a suck in at the level now and that too

2609
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,159
He must be a very interesting person brother

2610
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,400
I don't know what the kids angle even means.

2611
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:52,000
I did not hit you so that's fine then

2612
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,280
Do you have any questions brother? No, no

2613
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,320
I don't have any question brother, I am

2614
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,000
What does one want overall in their thoughts about marriage?

2615
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,280
I was thinking about that man, he is yours

2616
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,600
mouth went down

2617
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,120
what happened this kids are behaving like this

2618
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,520
he is saying this and asking himself, well this

2619
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:10,159
Tell me if you have any questions for me or

2620
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,719
Some people talk about things from around the world. do you have

2621
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:15,199
A question for me? Generally this is this is

2622
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,719
How do I end the show? Yes? Yes. It appears like that

2623
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,520
I ask people this in interviews.

2624
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,199
do you do you do you do you I want to ask

2625
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,880
Anything? no it happens many times man

2626
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:22,719
If you are replying very late then give me

2627
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,880
Sometimes we have questions. used to say earlier

2628
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,239
I saw your show, I didn't see your show

2629
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,239
Have you seen it yet? You didn't even tell about Rahul

2630
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,760
saw. After asking around the world till the lift

2631
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:31,360
They went. Which one should I see? tell me best

2632
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,600
The one. The best one. Rahul is coming to see

2633
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,760
Was. I was making you happy. No, bro.

2634
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,400
I had no such part, no sadness

2635
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,239
Was. I was fine brother. Yesterday you felt

2636
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,600
That and Aman Gupta will watch my show. I

2637
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:43,679

2638
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,679

2639
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,679

2640
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,880

01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,800
Whenever you get the best from Rahul. To you

You will like it. you know rahul you know rahul

2644
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,719
Happen. Well you see a side of him. Who

2645
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,880
You probably don't know how much

2646
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:03,600
Have you seen it interpersonally? That means it's very good

2647
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:07,199
It was an episode brother. I mean he is a man of willfulness

2648
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,360
It also came along with the opening. Generaly

2649
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:11,119
He is a comedian. He's been on stage he gets it.

2650
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:14,000
Like he gets that I want to talk to him. And

2651
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:15,600
Then that matter went to such a place. I Just I

2652
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,840
Have really good regards for him. Yes. Very

2653
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,679
This is a very venerable raw conversation. My

2654
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,199
Don't ask anything. you have some questions

2655
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,880
If you are left out in the list then ask. No, bro.

2656
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,960
I've already made the list a while back

2657
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,040
Am. I was just watching. there's something left in it

2658
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,400
But I could not ask anything in the list. You

2659
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,920
Where ever you go you go there brother. Now

2660
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:32,239
No one can do anything about this. all this is correct

2661
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:34,560
Is. Everything is going well. Are you happy? or super

2662
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:37,920
Happy bro. Super happy. it's nice to

2663
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,920
No. or thank you.
