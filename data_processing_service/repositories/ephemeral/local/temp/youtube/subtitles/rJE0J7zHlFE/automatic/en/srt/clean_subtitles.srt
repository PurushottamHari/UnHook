Brother, which Sharp don't you like? not that There are many. hey be careful. Save that audio and put your name in it Is. Look friend, it's not that I don't like it Is. I am different. Those people are different. I like people who have their own The company is doing well. to me that I like people who are original Are. The character who has not come to correct himself. Whose is right from the beginning. we the original Those original branches branch out. Many people have come. The character which is loose is fine Have come to do it. It's fine here. Did you guys get so much sunshine? good and true yes this is true it is true There is another thing like this brother, first of all that which that which New vegetables have arrived, I am not naming them anywhere I want to take it otherwise it will become a controversy So Shark Tank was rejecting itself first And now they saw that this is a peace hero He became a unique hero amongst them I became furious and said make me a shark too I kept writing and kept reading behind that to us Make a shark now they are coming as sharks so I'm saying brother I I like originality very much. We are the people who are It is original. if you watch season one carefully Watch Aman Gupta from Season 4 It must have evolved. But Aman Gupta's The character is the same. Correct is our bean. We He is the one. Nor do we do useless things. No We have to improve our character. Our This is the character. Those who came in the beginning are the ones Were. Love us and haters we this is who we are. Namita used to say that I don't have any expertise Is. I'm out. Correct? one of his famous lines Was. I had a way of life that we too could I will take it. It is the same even today. I will do it too. what is there in you? I will do it too. Tax I will take it. I don't feel any fear. incomparable They were different from the start. Vineeta was different. Piyush is different Were. Everyone was there. Many people are now trying to correct their character I am coming. I don't like that shark Time. and that's why i sometimes don't Like some of these new sharks. But Otherwise it's okay. on shark time if my If anyone wants to pitch something, I can pitch it Am. Means some system works by paying money like that Is. No friend, nothing. Twice two two became nil score. No one takes any money. no no means It isn't there at all. My reasonable question is In this whole situation when I first I told you guys I saw Shark Tank Friend, now the man has torn so many cheques today The cheque of Rs 2025 crore was torn at night. How much money does he have? 20 means this If you tear it apart then I will give you 202 crores Will it happen or will there be some issues later as well? Will be. No, the average would have been 10-12 crores Is. not an episode not an episode a season Looks like around 12 crores. but out of that I am telling you. That means, first we It is also said that it does not happen that all deals Lets do it. Most of all, entrepreneurs They reject us. they come to do marketing and make them as That shark tank air increases their sales When it increases they feel that their sales are increasing Went. Now why do we need sharks? They did this on valuation. second to them You realise what happens when you are there Sometimes we break down so much They don't even understand it at that time that you know what should be done. So take the deal Let's take it. we will realise it later friend This was not good. good with us The deal was done. Then the deal might not happen. And Sometimes the numbers aren’t right. which he If you say anything, we reject it that brother you said this is the number and Actually these are your numbers then ours That deal won't work out. so i think 50% off the Deals don't go through. 50% wow a lot of people have made their own business brother. You are on show in it Come and show me your product. It's true. Yes This is real. That's right, it's a good thing. Meaning I can't tell you. from four to five places So, I ordered food. which I Only those who have this written on them - Shark In Tank Fame. Hey brother it's shark time.

What happened on that pitch among all the pitches I am saying 1 crore is on that, 1 crore this has 90 lakhs on it let me see one If I give you an example, I was talking about food Why am I talking about eating that Food Pitch has 1 crore views.

And you educational value Understand this. means i had no The concept of how to evaluate my work What is? what is the business in that which I have I heard the keywords from here and googled them. Because then a culture gets created A man's education keeps on improving Now everybody knows about the valuation what does it mean so second third order There are many consequences but you should think that you what you, what we said, what splits You have grown up watching the villa, right Roadies Roadies don't speak splits villa Why have we all seen it, even me Have you seen Splitsvilla or Roadies?

This is this type of messaging brother everybody sucks this what are you trying to do is this true What is a statement, what does it mean yes it is your truth bro everybody sucks you know Don't understand English? No problem? I am a problem, it is a problem for me. I don't know what you want to say? Oho yaar it is very easy it is a message that this is human Key T-Shirt And I Love That Guy is Amazing And he is a good friend also in front of. So what does it mean? everybody sucks ass in What is the intended meaning here. Who This is not what you want to hear. Its The actual meaning is that nobody is perfect In their life. everybody sucks at some point of Time. So it's okay not to be perfect. sec I think people judge a lot are to each other. Right? and fear of judgement Whatever happens, those are wrong things to a person She gets it done. like if what are you thinking If my decision is about me then If it gets bad in making then I will always do this I keep thinking that I'm working for you Am. I am working according to you. I Mean right? so there is a fear of judgement which I think we should all think that Everybody sucks. Right? so, i should do what I feel right, not what you think is Right. your judgement should not affect me Decision making. And I also think this one that everybody sucks has another meaning Friend, when we become successful, we grow up If we go then ego comes into everybody. Ego comes in that you are doing very well yes. You can't fail. and to you one should always think that that was everybody success at something in their life and at Stages of life. that's as big as you are go to there will be something is someone who is better than you in something else and you should Not Feeling Fear That Fear of Feeling Should Go away because everyone sucks at some point of time At something which they do in their life. Meaning Keeps life quite realistic in that sense In. Right? Because you are right brother. What do people think of him as a dream killer? This is the situation. Isn't it? And if you think about it that this person is thinking about me You might be thinking so, but it sucks on its own Everyone sucks at their work, everybody is bad at their stuff and everybody is trying and learning then you can do a little you don't know everybody suck everybody suck ya ya get it Because normally people don't take care of themselves very much. They demoralize themselves ke yaar [ __ ] yaar I suck at this boss he also suck something right so just forget him do what you think is right everyone sucks something and the other so I am saying don't go back brother I have been here for the last two months Been on this tour. I booked a plane ticket all of India Top Entrepreneurs Billionaires. good for whatever lucky reason i have company with them I am getting it. I sit and talk with them I have been there for two-three-four hours. Correct Is? And I'm not sitting with anybody right now and somebody in their team was telling me they said this person has done so well in life that now they feel that whatever they touch It is gold. I mean, a sense of that comes That I can do anything. You think if 10 Dis You Will Know By Thinking 10 The decision line will be right then you start carrying weight one by one and i understand that Confidence is also required, otherwise the man He just sits on the other side waiting for me to do that I don't do anything, man is always scared of man I don't take long leaps but I am sure with it a lot of success that comes as well that it's called god syndrome a lot of people get that god syndrome i feel that good People start talking about them and the media is theirs He starts writing about it, that means it's bigger hey family is congratulating you messages are coming whats ever start feeling or i know at all and that is where i am think the downfall of everybody starts and ends that is where you need to understand that You know, as my mother says, pride is Even Ravana could not hold his ground and that thing bothered me I also believe that boss ego is pride you should not keep that you know you are not wrong You could be wrong and better than you Someone else is doing some work, something else is better than you Life has been better somewhere, somewhere if something is getting better somewhere You should not think that you are the best You are not the center of evidence. you too You can make mistakes.

No No there is a reason. there are couple of reasons And you can decide which one you like. Correct Is? I will give you the first. yes first Reese's A for Apple, B for Boat. as if speaking Isn't it A for Apple B for Boat? So Apple If someone had taken it, we can't take it So we kept the boat. Ok. ok this is Like a nine on 10 for me. what is the other Forest? It is a second as is Jio Greatest of all times. It would have been a BO80 It is the best of all times. Oh [ __ ]. Its How much is Rain ranking? I Think The First One was kind of more impressive. and this is still at. Still I will give this at. This is very good reasons. You Marketing You look like one. what are you talking about? Brother what line do you have he gave it to you Archana Purat Singh in Yaar Kapil Sharma This one is the greatest of all. third third one The reason is that our tagline is The Plug Into Nirvana. so you go on a boat you know you leave The Land Behind, You Leave the Worries Behind Same way, if you wear a Boat headphone, you Plug into your own zone Plug into Nirvana. So, this is actually the real reason why it Was boat plug in to N1. And if you look at A If you look carefully, there is a boat built inside it If it has happened, then she looks very cool. by bridge show. Prove it. Yes, okay. We have brothers This has happened because I got this TV installed. yes that If anything needs to be bridged, talk to these general people. That's the logo inside the A. So that too The icon turns out very nice. ok my always wondered why A was capitalized. Yes. But that makes sense. and the other one a and reece i tell you that the fourth there's a reason what happens isn't it when we You were starting it so many didn't you? There were brands whose names were not even pronounced It used to be okay, all these were Chinese Brands yes and boat see how easy the name is So that everyone understands what the boat is right so it's not a tongue twister it's a very Relatively simple and an easy name and the The story can always be made behind it very interesting this is how you think about marketing and you you you you you you you you about it's very simple and generally this Things probably are complex on the way but simply towards the end means in the middle Brother, your mind must be going crazy when you name such a thing Deciding is probably one of the most What should I say about bottle-necked places? How many people get stuck in starting a business? Brother, I am unable to decide the name of the car The boat goes away, it floats away, then it is no more I used to do it, but it has to be simple Decision at the end of the day yes this this and don't complicate life it's easy for me So it didn't take that much time, we named 10 names You used to choose it like you choose a child's name isn't it so it happens that this is the name you choose I took it to Sameer, Sameer Bhai this These are names that sound a little nice. Who Are you feeling good? Friend, you keep it friend Whatever you want to keep.

Praveen Sharma Read anywhere from Praveen Sharma It happened that Praveen Sharma used to teach accounts I will tell you, I teach in CP Those would have been online halls in our time The auditorium is of the entire metro station 5000 people booked the entire ground floor friend he is awake since 6:00 in the morning in winter It was the right time, he told me, it felt right that Neither me nor I can get up in the morning So my friend used to come down and blow the horn p p p p p p p p p by doing this If there was a signal, it would ring three or four times I used to go and if I had not woken up I used to go many times, but I got 50% I used to miss classes because of that I was not able to get up early in the morning but in the morning we I used to go to class from 6:00 am to 9:00 am Then our articleship would start Internship: 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Where were the articles? Luthra & Luthra. Good And then we have classes again after 5:00 pm It would start. He used to come home at 9-10 o'clock and then repeat or else separate on saturday and sunday The classes go on. yes that is a separate class The day goes on. That's a full 12-13 hours. to me remember brother and mean Brother, to me it is absolutely that study environment i think teachers are great That's why they are fantastic. that he is 5000 They are keeping the man tied up. or on which There was study material and these were the study conditions I could never get fit. Brother I So I used to miss half the class like that I will go and do it. You did this very well Languages. Do you know what used to happen to me? I thought I should leave CA midway. Yes. I was thinking in the middle of it, come on friend I I left CA because I understood it that I am not may be I will not be the Best Accounts Finance Ever. so i I thought I would leave it midway. butt what It would happen if you left something in the middle now Yes, it has become very stylish now Leave. now it's like you're a drop Out. you know ya school drop out special drop Out. you know it feels fancy right to say About it. But if you had not said anything at that time Then we would have said that the loser would not have happened Times than you. Right? in CA then in CA So, you can say it as well. He might not have become a CA. So I was very stressed about that People shouldn't think that it didn't happen on my own I left it because I would tell everyone I will stay then because I had left it, I left it Was. No one should trust you people did. They have to think what they Had to think. I said let's finish one turn Am. It will take me a year to finish it. Then Life is completely free to do anything. So I finished mine in one go Was. Yes, I had taken it out. good good good good respect. I did not take it out. But I never thought of this angle. I will have to justify it. I I am actually a drop out. my whole family Isn't it right brother? Here we have ancestral It is handed down to us. What are you doing? Well, you also have the same thing. yes then you understand Yes that pain. I have finished doing it. I was 21 years old and had become a CA. Good. Foundation Course. And before you go to school There were schools and colleges. I have talked about college. School: Where was the school? DPS R Kepur. Good DPS R K Puram. so that is one of The Best Schools. ya ya even now but back then particularly DPS RK Puram was I I used to love my school. Our Schools I was also on my way. it seems to me that there weren't many schools at that time Not even. [music] DPS used to call itself and their The score would have been good anyway. so brother in law All the toppers always were from there. There was selection after selection, brother. Selection would stay. I also gave the 10th exam. So all the All of them were toppers. all whose 95% and above There are three or four sections in this. come all of you In DPS. At DPS R K Pur Coker-The curricular was also very good brother. Yes Correct. I don't know about you because we I studied in DPS Faridabad. so i am Assuming in comparison. It was ok. One debate quizzes used to go on At least it used to be running in RK, I don't know Friend, I don't like me this much We don't like our schooling system but yes I don't remember yes that There was a sports facility also. I am are you actually very interested in schooling you are talking about the system are you able to Comment on that man our schooling system See, I think it teaches discipline well gives hard work but teaches me Our system seems a bit flawed Of schooling. There are many reasons for this, which In our India or I don't know world What is wide. But friend, I don't like it that much They say follow the system, If you do not follow the structure then You will be thrown out of the class. Right If you don’t follow the rules. And I get this It seems that the entrepreneurial system that would have been The thing about life is that you do your own thing. You you know do what is right. break the rules And then only you will do well in life. So You do not follow too much structures. And not in our school like we have here like in dps what happens in it not There is a lot of focus on studying. Ok? This is our schooling system. i should name DPS only but schooling system. Schooling The system is all about studying and not rote learning Beat. I have also memorized it a lot. I I am telling you that I still remember This is what I have memorized. I will tell Am. As we had a rote learning, we would speak in it What is the definition of management? So I used to say that management is the art of Getting to the process of planning Organizing Staffing Director & Controlling so that workers can work Effectively and Efficiently Towards Achievement of organizational goals. Machine up down up down management people Handling done problem solved. So ours is not used to focus a lot on rote learning that school I will cram it in, cram it in. if you cram If you don't hit, you won't get marks. and who There are businesses and those who do entrepreneurship it happens in it it is said that you You will not do creative thinking, you will be creative You will not do decision making. If you are the same There is no answer to the question in a creative way If you remove it, you will never be able to earn money. so you have to think very differently not as a rote but come out with solutions to the Problems and in a very creative way. So This is my view, as he used to say Not stand in line. and rightwise Stand up. Stand in line height wise. Stand in line in line. And Entrepreneurship says break the line and Create your own line. Right? you can not B. You stand in line, people will follow you People. This system of ours seems a little to me Looks like it's a bit floppy. but we are also right You are saying this. Yes, we too are from the same system. Are. So no brother, I am like a CA I used to do it, then everybody would say this to me Well, a CA would have taught me to work hard Is. I said this donkey works hard By speaking you are probably engaged in hard work and donkey labour You are not making any difference. And it is such that I don't need any subject or course There is no problem in doing this. But if I Eventually just taking these brownie points I'm going to work hard And I can't make up my mind. myself I cannot solve the problem. My Agency It's not so much that I thought it was a problem Solved it and moved ahead. so then how Will work? and this as a matter of fact Education system of India or globally too But this thing of India was made only to create labour Is. yes to make labour and I will make you Let me tell you what happens as we He was becoming head boy. Ok? Become a Head Girl Were living. It is like school in our place It happens to me, what can you do? it's about Individualism. Right? How do you do well? How do you become a blue court Holder? But life is all about specifically its About teamwork. It's about us. it's About how do you lead, how do you delegate? How do you manage people? how do you manage Relationships? it's not just you it's us in The Real World. So schools push that development does that how I I you would do that. Good. so that individualism comes into the picture Rather than the group teamwork. so i came i Personally feel that what you are saying is No, I totally relate to that. there is one thing for example which is management Definition of our Business Studies Keys It is written in the book in 11th. I I am Assuming you were talking about the same thing I was explaining the definition. and now there is a Different angles you have to manage. you might even say I will tell you my opinion. Ok? The The Last Couple of Months Have Been Very Interesting. Brother, I don't want you to be a shark Any number of tops, tank or non-Shark Tank He is an entrepreneur from India, I am one of them I have stayed at their homes or offices. I have just been going for the last two months and saying hello because till now i am a type of yes please I am a type of content Was doing. I said friend I am also Found of Entrepreneurs Edge Profiles I find them very interesting. So If I meet you I will see how you think Are. The End of the Many Places I've Seen And I have seen something really very interesting Stuff. Stuff That People Will Not Believe Otherwise. but as an office your office is Probably the chilliest office I've seen. I you understand that I have I didn't see you again at the disco disco People are sitting, they are not dancing. But The atmosphere is very open for you people. End what i am trying to get at is i am sure you are problematic Top 1% of Managers of People and Teams Now in The Country. and i'm only bringing this A Definition of Up Because You Said Management You understood it by memorizing it. what do you understand now are you there? How do you think of management now? or i think it's it's what human relations is about Understanding the People It's About Management for me is management you know I Work With a Lot of Young People Right If You scene my office when you came did you come to the office Have you seen so many young people in our office? Everyone I worked with knew me, yes everyone I knew you were a little older I didn't know, no, I actually I had stopped doing podcasts I was not even doing it, did you see the last one I had not done a podcast for one and a half years, but then When my team and I told the people, friend Please deny it saying that we are missing you. Someone do a podcast. then your name is recommended People said yaar please I plus you No it is true. You look at mine I haven't done a podcast for a long time. I see, everything is going well for you. Is good so you know we all thought i also thought that you No you should be you are a good. so i think People know their stuff. i think the young guys you are very smart and i work with a lot of these gens and young people in our company and This is different friend, their thinking is very different You cannot restrict them, you think what did we do when we were born We were thinking that we had much knowledge, not right There weren't that many phones, where were the smartphones? Even the internet had not come so openly then this people you know the world you know the globe very well right you you can't they are they have Instant access 15 minutes ago so mom She used to slap me and tell me to go and get something Come and meet me, you know some guest is coming come on go get four chips and three Pepsi At the click of a button everything would come home here hey right everything is correct you are saying absolutely right yes The kids of today are like Ramu and we have become I was going on a bicycle to buy cheese 250 Village Mummy Pakoras Nowadays, everyone has instant access to things right there they have global Perspectives and things so you can understand these This is not the same generation that used to say earlier No, when we were starting out people used to say the boss is always right yes sir if you want to say Nowadays these people ask why sir why should we do it so it's a different Generation It You Have To Know How To Manage This Generation It has a very different way of life right first what are we like one and one Let me give you an example of work life balance The question everybody is asking these days is I am 5 I did not know this question six years ago There was no talk about work life balance There is also a discussion about who these young kids are. I have brought it just like that. It is the youngsters who have brought it. This is the Genjis who has brought it. they don't only Work for money. They enjoy working Me too. but it's more fun than that Spending time with your friends in, in having experiences. so for them That is not a question that is given. Give To have work life balance is a necessity in Companies. you cannot force them to work Today. they will do a thing for them so that If I don't feel like working then I won't do it. I It has been said earlier also once that at their place Like that resignation letter of Akshay Kumar It used to be there in my pocket, take this I am going. Ok? yes to me so I had to keep it with them. No No, stop friend, don't go. then they have a you no they have a very different i would say Outlook Outlook Towards Life They Are You Know We had less risk taking ability. These people keep taking risks. Isn't it? apart Is. I understand. and to me generally no Brother, this bashing that goes on on the internet Judge so and so has come, do I know Seems like? I remember my MTV I was abused for watching it. and then say These were young kids. watching mtv They lose their minds. before that when My parents must have been young, my elders Brothers and sisters must have been young, they didn't know anything else You must be abused for watching it. this is it It is a universal phenomenon. where the old people Looks like he is very intelligent. and the children Looks like we are wiser than the old people Are. And they keep abusing each other Are. What do they know, what do they know. Right? We used to read history books and These days these are not 16 year old kids, not even 16 14 year old boy hits a century and turns 18 I am making history by setting up a business And we were studying history. yes right Exactly and if you think about it then there is one thing that See what software and hardware is available The entire generation that has access to technology He will change it. and in that sense yes you can chat Brother, look at GPT, the most illiterate man What message does he write and send? you fight Try it with someone. Legal letter is coming brother written. Ok? so now things have Changed. And it is also very interesting. this which The observation is that a judge earns money by working He wants to go somewhere and spend his earnings. Because where did our parents spend money Brother? He is the one who saves our education are doing it. Right? Like that was a way Different generation if you go back. but it's how do you manage this because my question was Basically what do you think of management Now? like how are you managing Relationships? And how much do you think about it? I don't think you Should the question be how do you manage them? The the question should be how do you use there Perspectives to grow with them? The The question should not be that how do you manage? The question should be how do you grow with Them? ok let them give them you know they may not They have the experience but they have the exposure. hmm they may not they may not mean if i tell you about my Company in a Boat. ah the lot of people who are So young who gives the best opinions. Because they know the audience very well. Now, give Know How the Market and the Market Changes Very fast. if you still have the old ways of doing things, you may not know how to get To the audience and the consumer. however much you Do an analysis, do you know how many people They tell the agencies that I need a You have to do a campaign and make it viral. this which They have agencies, they are 18, 19, 20 years old There will be people. They must know how to violency I have to bring it, what is working, what is not working how to edit, how to work what to say, how to talk to the consumer Have to do it. Authenticity is known for the first time Today I know that people on Shark Tank also why do they like me because of who I am I am in front of you, authenticity, people like Authenticity the people can read through who Who is acting and who is doing drama who is authentic so very smart generation do You ever wonder between India and US How similar are the markets and how different are they? Is India catching up or not at all Ever thought about the sense in which things are going different Yes my friend, you are like India, I never saw you before When I saw sharks in the US it was India not only that when the shark used to see us then There used to be a word, it was called the American Dream. Not the same thing in today's date The Indian Dream is happening in India also the people who are coming, pitching in, Coming from the village, in some places small Coming from town and pitching in and Big companies are being formed. We too are people So, everybody is already seeing how it evolves. It is happening in India. So if you see it The basics of entrepreneurship are the same How to do business, what to do. India has its own nuances. work in india It is not easy to do. in india they say that if you make business in India then the whole You will know how to start a business in the world. Right? But India is a tough market to crack The Consumer Market Is Too Cracked But You Know How business work what is the expectation of The Shark Investor Wants Money How will you give returns and how will you grow your businesses what negatives can there be and how Risk assessment is done by the entrepreneur What skills are there, they are all similar yes friend the basics will remain similar Or else our population is so amazing There is so much that you can sell it in India So you don't need to go out. It would be good if you go there as there is such a huge population. You will become a global brand but if you crack The Code of the Indian Consumer It Is amazing. but and you don't think that that's enough It is a hard challenge in itself because it is big It will be a price sensitive market. India Eye M assuming that India price is sensitive It isn't there, brother. I say India Is value sensitive. Most in India Which was the cheapest car? no maruti 800 Cheaper than that. The cheapest car is Nano She had come. What happened to Nano? It got stopped. Close It's done. I can't see it now. Why? Because It was the cheapest. not cheap in india Brother for sale. It sells well. in india Your consumer is very valuable Is driven. He is brand conscious. You You can ask any villager Then he will tell which brand is popular in the city Used to be. Ask any city dweller and he'll tell you Which brand is running in the city? Needed Ask any city dweller, he will tell you whatever I want the brand that is running in the metro. So The consumer is very aspirational. Yet Price conscious. So in India price from It doesn't sell brother. Price is not the cheapest It will be sold. Good. The cheapest one will be eliminated. People would say that I buy an expensive motorcycle I will take the cheapest car I will not buy the car at that price. interesting interesting because my impression was that you were asking the price If you multiply 10 by 12 then the car will stop. if you If you do it for 10, the other guy will do it for nine. If you sell it then you will be finished. Yes. so it means Then it becomes a race to the bottom. You One should never contest in that race. Good Wow there are many brands available. our our Let me tell you about the competition. I won't take names I want it. But every year a new guy comes. Eats up a little market share. next year It closes down because there is someone cheaper than that It comes. So we're never in that game We wanted to go as if we were the cheapest. Because someone else can buy it for cheaper than that will come. His expenses will be less. her you know Its cost offsourcing will be much less. He will arrange it from somewhere and get it. but not today then it will end tomorrow because It will come cheaper. all this telecom which Hardware manufacturers taught us Was. when they started fighting Curry used to sell it by calling the cheapest one And from him we learnt that brother is the cheapest If we do this and sell it then we too will be shut down. We Our condition will be the same as theirs. So we never sold it at a cheap price. We sold it in style, at a slight premium It was sold and people bought it and are not buying it. Got it very interesting. Wow. I am a thing Should I tell you? t-shirt tere ko kya jaate hain once I remember there used to be a time when you There were t-shirts of many foreign brands Of ₹4000,000. At today's date, so many There are brands which are available in Indian market worth Rs. 45,000 There are brands. A different brand is being run in Bombay Used to be. Different brands are running in Delhi Are. There are different brands of bore. Joe 44 Also selling T-shirts worth Rs 55,000. people that are also buying it. Indian T-Shirts Whatever is there in street wear system. It is going solid. yes yes and very thick and The control is very strong. Solid Tshirts People are buying it, right? Right? and that style It is nowadays. That is much better. It is not that You can buy branded T-shirts which you know are foreign Those are the brands, wear those. Butt Indian Aspirational Value Style of Brands The value is high. interesting one there is This New Indo Korean Flavor Also Emerging. if you look at eatables everything by doing this because that too i think that Drama started because everybody is here I started listening to Kpop etc. and then from there or Now Maggi is also coming. Kichi speaks Isn't he needing something? kimchi is theirs The pickle remains. He likes that pickle there Is. It can't be eaten brother. some one would have Isn't it true that their chowmein is called something? Their chow mein is called Korean chow mein as Ramen what are you doing? something like that raman yes that The Japanese don't live there but they have some The spice is gochu gochu jang gochu Gochu Jaan says brother Gochu Jaan is sauce There is a flavour of laughter in them, brother There is no need to turn your face upside down there I don't know what happens but yes yes but Brother, did he get into everything, or did I mean that The day he was opening it I was going to order He said so much Korean stuff came to us There was no scope or I saw Gochujang This is their seed gochujang. how much ghchu The name is. yes brother really how to eat this Can anyone see the face and name of this thing I will read it brother. yes but this is Gorian's The influence is coming and it is in beauty It's too much. Beauty is in beauty crazy korean beauty you know what someone said to me in one of these billionaire meets You said that now there is no secularism in India It is difficult to build a brand because secular The content is over. What now? Secular Age in Across Socioeconomics Straight. Content now in India Pockets He is consuming it. Brands Around Them Banana is the future. Oh! so in that that if If people are consuming career content then eating around her and making all this is Probably crazy. Yes. it is interesting Me too think about it. or me two years ago No, a lot of these interns came with me of school and I used to ask them to tell me this friend i called them to the meeting that you Were you talking about the young people of today? I would definitely take their perspective Am. So I called them to a meeting and I asked him if we can choose a brand ambassador. Were living. So, someone told us about our team keep this. Someone told me to keep it. So I first tried these some four years ago I heard it from people and they say why Don't you keep these Korean Kpop stars? it was a you know eye opener that these guys are Listening to Kpop. Right? So the Evolution is there and if you don't cater to this Changing dynamic. The dye will flow away. flow You will go. now my daughter road At Drunk Elephant I was going out. Did she choose a different type of person than me? I had ordered the case cover, I had ordered the road cover Just because that's Halle Berry's brand. Right? so these guys are you know the young people They're They've They're on YouTube on Snapchat Instagram what are they seeing what's happening trending and those people They want it.

I have a roommate It used to be Korean. he had explained it to me The way in which his government organized By doing this they have started pushing this culture out. Give Organized it. Their training is like ours IIT has the training and not theirs Make dancing and singing groups These are for five year old children. and then to them I train until they can be international Sensation. and this is basically soft power Establishing on the world. That's good. Or That's cool. This is a target for an industry It is run by the South Korean government. That's amazing. And you are advertising their tourism You will see only Kpop stars do it.

Negativity Brother, you will get likes on that only. as a creator I was telling you. if my followers grow If you want to do it on your Twitter then I am negative I will post the stuff. taking any thing I will grow. Good. This is what it means I took a side but what you are saying today Taking sides in a date is a very big thing. Earlier, people were more diplomatic. You people of today's generation, who are young people, we People, we take sides together. ok please your No sound, the veins are turning a little white. You are mine Generation, you speak your mind You say your thing. Title of this podcast you Say your thing. Is not correct. but but on a serious not that people are taking people are not shy In Taking Sides and Giving Opinions. It's good. You know people are more free. Ficus religiosa can say what they want to, think what they Want to ride what they want to. it's Fine. but your question was about Books. Yes Books and People. reading books I feel sleepy so I don't read. seconds I think if I could be with you now I am with you. If I sit with you today, I I will learn four or five things. And I love people talking to people, understanding people, He likes discussing things together more. Me Looks like there's so much to learn around With people. if i if i am in office i like Two seats with many people. I mean my office Remains open. Someone come to my room We will sit and talk, I will learn from him I will take it and they will learn from me. I slept That's my way of learning. I don't read. We And other people's lives don't affect me. I would do it. I feel as if you are the one We studied the case of Southwest Airlines I was in MBA. and after that how many airlines came who thought that we too will take a low course I will make a career. but all these others Airlines failed who tried to be a low Cost airline right. you can't live there life because your circumstances might be Different. your ah you and your friend who is Doing see together. Like in my case, me And my friend hur doing ca together. His The Journey and My Journey Till a Point Was the Same but after that we all we were both in different because he wanted to pursue different Things He Aspires From Life Ver Something else my aspiration something else. So Everybody Is Different and You Can't Follow one set pattern. My Circumstances, my timing, my knowledge, my environment, my access, my information, my friend who at that time With me are my colleagues, my team, What is the opportunity at that time? It would be different from what it was at that time. us and today Maybe I will do better than that opportunity Or I should not do it. So I don't think anyone else will there be any effect on your story from that story It will have to be Your story is your story. You If you go to follow someone else's story then they This is his story. You make your own story. Right? don't follow inspire and and see what you can know you have what you call it the art of FORGETTING. what does he say? Unlearning. Unlearning. Unlearning. Variant. we he If you did this then I will do this too. not necessary Isn't it friend? Half the people who know about India Startups had come which are making losses It was said that Amazon was also in loss for many years If you did it then we will do it too. Hey Amazon's The story was different. by causing loss to you people Don’t follow his story. Your own story Make it. There are many entrepreneurs like this If you do it, it will happen. no my now you can't do that Learn. Be inspired but don't follow it. Or You told me one more thing at that time. it was when we were sitting. you said ah i don't Treat my team like family. I treat them Like a cricket team. Yes. what does it mean Is? you know i am telling you that this is not Corporates are very important I think that in corporates There are too many useless lines. O V Treat our team as our family. more than this There is no stupid line. Because the friend who We are a family, right? You and I are our family. You never remove members from today So I don't have a sister. From today, my sister There is another one. Yes. Right. Isn't it? the sister who is I have a sister. Yes. You don't treat your employees like that Do. You can play your team like IPL There is a team, today you can see even Kohli retires It is done with correct test. but once upon a time Kohli was like the God, Kohli the guy right. but he had to give way to somebody who is may be younger and may be doing at that position might Play better. Even Sachin gave way to a Kohli. and may be a new one is giving you know them The new one is coming out and Kohli is leaving now Is Rohit Sharma like India? Dhoni will be the test captain and today someone else will be Kohli or right Dhoni giveaway to what you call dhoni give way to a rohit and now rohit is giving way to who ever the new captain will be be right so i think in that position if you You are playing against your best batsman The best player should be put in that position Will you go and bat here or You go here and bowl or you bowl in this over Will you bowl the 49th over or the 50th over? Will you bowl or will you bowl in the first four overs Give. it has to be dependent on that person and the situation and what is this guy's strength Is and What You Think Is the Right Strength You can use from him. you so you have to treat it like today if today is the best Was an accountant. but that accountant was the best My. As long as it was a company of this size. But now if our company is of this size So bringing you Better CFO Better Accountant It will be necessary because this guy will not do that work. can do what this guy can. Marketing This guy of yours can do this work. But now let me talk about the editor. The editor is coming. New editor is coming now Because they are doing better work. give no Better Ways of Editing Things. but that old The editor is not able to up his skills. I slept Will you give him an option? Brother up your skills. be better because if i don't if i don't hire this new guy who is doing much better than this Old Guy. I am never going to say that you Leave the company to the younger one and you leave Go. But when the big guy is coming and better Editing skills are coming in the market If I keep him then my company will be ruined No. So you always have to up your game. Ask Your team to up your game. if they can't up your game then please give way because for me, i Have to grow. The company has to grow. that is That's how I'm tuned and that's how I want Sameer and I want to take the company. so if there are people who want to grow with us so please keep yourself up If our products sell the same products if we stay like we were four years ago then we would have also closed down If we go then we need better product managers If that product manager wants to improve himself If you are able to do it then keep it, if you are not able to do it so you are saying something else basically It should be performance based, not like this Love cannot be based on affection, it is not 100% and any company which does this, yes we So he has been running on loyalty for 20 years companies will shut down you by any chance this type what do you mean read on you is i probably i'm not saying that I will take it out but now those people are mine If he wants to run a good team in IPL So we need to keep better talent and hire better Talent and Keeping Up the Talent Ask This Team to keep up with themselves and that is How can you run a very good company I love my team you know i love all of them they all love us and It is not the case that if these people If they get another job, then everybody goes there too if we meet good people then we if you search for it then it is it is like that it's Bhai Family I think you are right like us I also can't decide from today onwards Papa, no you, it can't happen like this This is how we say it here, hey audience our family where which family means this is one India Family Family We are all family Like that one brings some sentiment I think you are a very useless sentiment right it should be performance base it's a Work Profile It's Not and Family Baggage yes brother i mean this is on one level with the family Even your laughter brings bad things to us You'll see I get that bit treat them as humans of treat them as your team hmm or or of course i can replace myself if i I'm not having a good job I think my job is is to make sure all the 24 years who worked for me by the time they are 30 they are richer More successful and better than meeting 100% me the effort that will be required for that which will take as long as I will have to talk about the training I will do You will need to get the modules, I will get them, you do them your brother is standing behind this is my good yes i like it but brother you are obsessive type you must be there friend I think you must be sleeping It won't be easy for me to go from 8 to 10 I sleep for hours brother, it would be good if you get a full sleep yes but are you still like stable it is not coming If it happens, take melatonin after three to four days.

If I want success If you want to run behind, I have to run. Me I want success. I got my India top If I had to build a company, I had to build it, so I ran Behind him. Very interesting. to me i I am this type of man, brother. my vacation too It will be for 10 days. 7 to 8 days out of 15 days It's taking me a while to get over the intoxication of my work goes. that you are not working? Holiday You have come to convince me, Prakhar. Celebrate the holiday. and as long as My wife doesn't scold me, brother, leave it. Work goes on in my mind as soon as I wake up in the morning. Yes, that's a good thing. Right? to me It seems so too. you need to know how you do Switch off? Or how do you switch off? Brother I No, I am not even interested for two-three years In switching off. is that a fair thing to So that it doesn't get dragged out for two-three years You just need to switch off a little. such as the the thing looks good to me The concerts look great. so I I've just started watching a few concerts Year. What type of music? I nowadays I really like techno. Afrotec I just learned a new word listen are you doing this? I went. these earring guys Me or the one in Dubai? Delhi and Bombay In. I came to Bombay. yes why not had come. Black Coffee Afrotrotech Very I started enjoying it. Black Coffee Legend. So we We exactly do it on holidays Me and my wife. Isn't it right? Yes. Us I am thinking of some use in that. when you think So I mean, I'm going to Albania right now. Am. Anjana Deep Exploration 5-7 days There is a festival on the coast of Albania. Correct Is. And I am guaranteeing it. I am there I am thinking the same thing as well. Himanshu please edit Went. There will be no problem. tell me Give it. Because my mind is fine right now. But Do you also know how to switch it off, what you say had been. If you are at the concert you will be there Pay to I lay every lead. you will take me Switch off my mind by doing anything Let me play paddle paddle in the evening I really enjoy playing paddle I thought about it for about two and a half hours when I'm playing paddle I don't think anything about my work He really enjoys doing that in it Or I spend time with my kids I spend it, I feel very good so everybody has their own ways i get what you Mean I get what you mean that type of things So it's okay, it's switched off right right right right madness madness And intoxication is necessary, obsession is good for life right right right right right right got it got it it in view of that do you have ah your koi These are the issues related to work life balance But personally? I said it was work right now I have a stand on life balance So I believe in imbalance. you believe in Imbalance. S powerful. Yeah! you should own That. I believe in imbalance should be on a T-shirt. Or the doe line. Everybody Success I Believe in immaculateness. I believe in new new T-shirt. Yes. no bro but actually that's it Because you will definitely have stretches. Imbalance. If I told you this then I would I had told you, just see what happens if you You are studying when I am studying, right? when we were doing CA what did it matter to you It seems that I am following the love life at that time could have been done while you were doing CA There is no scope at all when you are so You are going in the morning, you are going in the afternoon, you are going at night If you are working then you are crazy about CA If you want to do that CA then you should work under it kare ho that's your that is what you are doing then after that in between me my As soon as Priya came into my life, I followed her I kept running so I started working I kept on focusing on work and not on my mind I kept roaming around like this, then Later it was useful in my life. The boat arrived So I kept running after the boat, kept running, I kept running. so i mean it also Depends on which stage of life you are in, whatever you are where you are and that sometimes work takes an imbalance and Sometimes personal life too. Personal Life to An Imbalance. So it depends on that. End the second i say i tell i keep telling my Team. and that's how i am also that it is It's not like you're working for 10 hours You have to work for 8 hours, you have to work. Our team has 8 hours of work. if you are 4 what are you doing in one hour what will you do in the next 4 hours It doesn't matter to me. week if you are doing the work in 3 days It doesn't matter to me. so it's all About Efficiency. it's not about It's not about quantity. it's more about Quality. It's about the efficiency. What They tell me that those hours long debates are It doesn't look good. I just arrived at a place I had told you. So I don't care about hours. Would have fallen. So Courteous Brow is the perfect quotable line Brother, this reel is true, you will not cut it from here Tell me Himanshu I have been The hour doesn't matter, it's true, yes, very true It's a matter brother, it doesn't matter to me brother And the man who is intoxicated, his More or less hours, it doesn't matter It doesn't matter, some days I I don't get up from bed because I I will take rest for some days brother exactly 12-15 16 18 19 20 25 hours same day I will go to Bombay I will come back the same day and shoot the next day It doesn't matter, it's your job brother Work is our work 100% but in view of that What is your end goal? Have you ever thought about it? And goal means I know you been asking this Question. Or I don't mean death bhaiya. I Don't, well that's why I stopped. I this I am not talking about death. I in General I am saying, with your work? you are there an Aspiration work wise that you follow. one goal A note to yourself Star. friend when the company is big It happens, then you have to start having Goals. you start doing things which are You know you have to have a plan. and and Sameer is very good in doing that analysis Data. he is he is he is running the company in a where it is more structured and I am a More Gutfeel Guy. I will do things which I You feel right. and i don't look at me What were you saying that I am more important than the data I believe in the donor. Write without any reason madam. That is true. Yes its true friend. end data so I think I'll take a turn I will tell you just that. I work in a company Had been. This is what came out of it from him. so I When I went to the company I was doing consulting Was in the company. so my boss there He said you know let's go there and pitch. Are. So that was not an acquisition, that was a To demerge. So the pitch for the demerger How was that to differentiate them? We will do it differently. Ok? So when I went there, the company wasn't it, its CEO tells my boss but You only suggested that we should do this with them We need amalgamation and together with them should do joint venture and now You must have come, we should resolve and work So that was my boss's answer to which I replied When it was over he said friend I I had given the data correctly, please correct it You did not implement it properly I gave you the right strategy The implementation was not done properly since that time My heart got distracted from the data, I said Brother, I am not able to work with data Do it right, do it well, do it well. It's not that data is not important. Butt which I I'm a gut field guy. Sameer Data's guy Is. and that's why both of us run this Company Differently. we so you know not Differently both this Sameer is a data guy. I am a servant of the donor and I feel There is a lot of mixture. if not then but now that The feel of an entrepreneur is varied. Got It. And you never think about personal legacy You think that's what you should mean from a man's work for a long time or his Do you ever think like this for children too, friend? me to mine Good point and I know that now What does one like about me or no one else Didn't help me when I was trying to grow my business I was doing it right, I didn't have any mentors Many people have mentors in their lives Those who become mentors are not my mentors I live. But I like it now When I help young startups I invest in them and their If there is any growth then I would feel very good that you know I gave advice to some who I have made mistakes so that others do not make them They ask me for them and I I will give them the answer. advice to them I will give it. it feels so good that you know I am being able to help new Entrepreneurs Do well in their businesses. I like it very much I feel like when I meet people and they say Yes sir you inspire me. Hmm. yours yours It feels great to hear the story. Because Friend I am the only one so look when I see a shark Even when I go to the tank, I wear jeans and sneakers I reached there wearing a T-shirt. and normally There used to be people, all dressed in suits Are. So you too see this generation of ours He is wearing jeans, he is wearing a T-shirt. So It is okay. It doesn't matter appearance. whatever It doesn't matter what you wear. Brother work Doing it makes a difference. What are you doing That makes a difference. How the company is formed That makes a difference. how big is the business are you making it? How are you making it? why make had been? Who are you making it for? What to do had been? That makes a difference. Do that. Who cares if you wear a suit or clothes? Is? One can't build business by wearing a tie. so I gave you a little bit of that a little bit of that The suit culture was prevalent in India, right? After saying this I said, this is how I am. I am not that good at English. It is not that I don't know English. English is stuck somewhere in the middle She goes. Ok. so i you know people started saying or sir look at yours The article has arrived. Now if you pay attention You will see it will be written Amans English. It is written somewhere in it. amnes english is broken burst. So ok brother this is how English is It's a little better to perfect your English Making your business perfect is your business We know how to run the business, we are strong players You know how to do it right with a little English It is not necessary that the business is made or not So it is not necessary that you know then I Stereotypes that were there to build a business Leaving that aside, when people meet me they say Sir We are also like this, you have fun as well as get torn You do it and you are running such a big company too. If you are just like us then it feels so right no that gives a lot of hope to the people that they can also probably build something and that gives a lot of inspiration to lots of Young Guys Which I'm Very Happy About That I am able to inspire them. correct. Whatever I do, this is who I am. And people get hope and inspiration from There. I will tell you exactly what That is it. Like you said, I have a mentor were not there. Many times I feel myself in it I wish I had some mentors. then to me Seems like I'm doing something wrong. What I don't go out and look for a mentor. then to me One gets peace. He says, brother, I have a mentor were not there. I made so many companies Worth so many crores. Then the man says friend And you should take this English thing lightly had been. Brother, when I was young I Access to courts etc. is available very quickly Went. Papa is a lawyer and also a chartered accountant After. I used to see a lawyer standing there now Is. He tries to speak in English Used to be. I understand the judge's condition and I felt bad that how could he understand this What is the lawyer saying? you speak in hindi Well brother, Hindi is allowed in our courts Speak in. But that is an English style Is. yes sir that test gets removed now You have to speak in English only. no matter how broken I have to speak in English. And I'd be talking Needed We say that this should be a matter Needed If you do not understand the point What is happening in English and Hindi? Yes yes you understand this is not much no and I know very well why I feel this way Show of culture has become a special South Delhi, South Bombay and these metros no if you if you look properly If you don't speak English, people judge you I go [ __ ] myself what man what are you saying or please in english what are your english yaar butt and brother i mine experience because I lived abroad when I spent my first 6 months abroad I had some trouble, I don't know English so fast I could have spoken then I said now I I will learn when I have learned then I will When I started speaking the white people would turn around and say How come you have better English than me? does it come? So I would sort it out for myself Am. It is just a language. 18 more languages Brother, I have to learn. Yes. so that's english imposition of This is one thing I've seen, like for Instance is in Faridabad, you can find one here Open a good restaurant and see how it works. 2 Closes in a year. Why? Because The man has to go to Delhi and spend the money. the one that you You were talking about aspirationality, right? Man doesn't want his health food tasty. A man needs his health food a little bitter. Because he should have to pay the cost I have decided to enjoy this luxury. So it is kind of like this that english and that In the pursuit of aspirationality, the man says I should feel pain if I speak English Otherwise I learned a little English, that's why I became high status. This is a game which Indians has invented it. We just keep playing Are. it's not that they are right or wrong but You know it's them. but i am just saying I normalize the fact that it's not The Necessary That You Need to Have to Be Very Fluent English. My English is not bad. But Mine isn't as good as Problem is there for many of my fellow shorts too Will be. He also shares knowledge so well. But my business is probably going better than theirs. But it is not necessary that only by sharing knowledge Sir it is something. Everything is possible by speaking good English Something happen. You are what you are. you your game Play. You make your game better. and others Don't watch the game. Your biggest fear What is? My fear. Hmm. My fear is that I Irrelevance. Dam at deep. yes, is it? Or, of course. No Bad. I don't but irrelevance and all areas that I will be left behind. yes but brother your This race is going to be very tough on the stakes Because your stakes are that high. For me it has to be relevant that I'm a YouTuber I am becoming relevant, right? For you It has to be irrelevant that brother I am in business now shark Tank. Now brother startup Maha Kumbh everywhere because then he and There must be pressure building up. I don't take pressure. It's fun. It's fun. but i'm scared If there is no fear then life will become boring Buddy. A little bit of paranoia is variant. I am very and I said it I said that you I am Very passionate about what I do. but i am Very Paranoid About What Others Can Do Too Me. Right? So paranoia is variant. tell me Peacock. parano is very important because if you are here today You are sitting on the date of. you might be thinking You are the best. There's no one better than you Can. The other guy has a better product than you It is bringing it. I talk about my company cheaply I will do it first. Ok? you are thinking of that boss if you are the best then there is no one better than you can't. You know it is like this. This way People with the same thinking had abandoned us What will that boat do, friend? How big is the bun He will go and you will become big. Today he is for us Let's see. They copy brands like us Are. What we are doing is the We get inspired and see that friend We should do this too. Correct. such if We let go and someone else comes and takes over So it won't feel good, right? So I always came keep up the game the boss how to fight them Is? What is the plan? What is he supposed to do? Strategy. Be it small or big, you have to keep it up and it's a lot you can learn from it These young companies, young startups. not in My field in any field. there is so much Change is Happening and If You Don't Change With It The Changing Times You Will Die. so i in my company also i like to see whats Happening around me. I like to see how I can make my company better and i don't want my company to go Down. so i want to keep adopting my Strategies on Consumer Marketing Product distribution as of today If I tell you the truth do it offline If people were ignoring me online If it would have happened then today when we started with many companies were you doing it so he was offline with us says brands don't pay attention to online It is a small market, how big will it become today When we grew up, we became online and offline we are also going to do the same thing if we had a date today Many companies have adopted Quick Commerce in the past Today Quick Commerce has been ignored, if it is big It is done and you are not on it, then the other one The company that was born in Quick Commerce and When she grows up, she will come to you here. True Brother, did you understand? yes absolutely bro if you If you ignore YouTube then your old The media brand has become outdated because it Now the world has changed as it was supposed to be Can't do it. yesterday he came tomorrow something else came Is reels gone or some other new platform has come if I went and you guys don't go then you are finished and Brother now the iteration cycle is so short isn't it Has the reel become old or four years old? Shots came 2 years ago, even the old ones came It's done, it's become difficult to grow on it So the iteration cycle of things is so short Friend at this time you feel very dynamic You have to stay at least to work In my field, I am sure in every field In every field, I tell you simple things, bro. Am There is a change in the field of shampoo as well Is. Earlier we used to use normal shampoo I used to use it. Then came new types of shampoos In which they say no free chemical free What do you say jargon? paraben free free everything free everything free free free free free by doing this and if he had not come these days So the consumer has changed now, right? He doesn't need so many chemicals. then now new type if something is coming then they also have To adapt to the new change. so every very And I love the fact that the market is very Dynamic. The market is so dynamic that even if you sleep if you sleep You may end up losing the market. You Connaught. any industry you are in whatever you Are you a youtuber whether you are even in employees Even in your team if you are you know what and sometimes you get people who are better Performance and you see them growing. donation sometimes the performer who is not so ah good Good. It is a sales channel. Make the second sales channel better Used to be. So as a company we would always like to give you know better growth than somebody who is Performing Then to Somebody Is Not Performing. and if this guy who sees that the another guy is performing then he will either he will he leave the job and he will know he won't Grow in our company because this guy is Performing. so i am not i am saying that Weather it's youtuber. like you guys A simple example is that you have not changed your Did. You will continue doing the same. do the same thing You will stay. You will ask the same question. we are bored I won't go and watch your podcast, dad. Brother, we will not see this every year you have to reinvent it without even knowing it Chalo the audience has been reinvented Because the audience knows that it is just goes into the background yes but if If you don't think, you will be finished Poor creators, I feel so Creators come and keep doing the same thing We all like it for a while it feels new but if you keep yourself If you don't change then you and I will get bored too You will not go away and keep hearing the same thing A new creator arrives or I can speak volumes about that butt means you look Any person's growth is visible on Instagram Is. Went from here to here and then stopped. Why? Because that newness became a hit brother. Now he got older. Now there is no one in this item Not interested. Six more men are doing the same thing Are. Now there is no growth in your goods. And the man says hey why should I get money Are you closed? they do not understand. so it means I think this is the first generation They are career creators.

Everything You Told Me Your Mentors There was no building stage etc. at that time me but i am sure there are things you Learn from your father or can you recall one and three things that you learn from your My Father My Father Na Modi Stone Me Modi used to sell tyres and had a company by making stones There was Modi Rubber, there was no sales manager and Used to go to sell tyres to retailers When I was doing CA, I When I was leaving in the middle, he What happened to I had a friend Siddharth I had a very good friend, he was doing CA Was. When he came home I was older at that time. I had friends from school who were very close to me I used to party in college sometimes OS are you ever going to face any customer we are going somewhere and he keeps reading He had started studying CA so he came to me I used to tell my father uncle look at this He is having fun and dad was watching that he is studying and doing well in life My dad asked me why don’t you do it You also do something, he pushed me I told you to do it too so I did CA for them In the process, today I became their CA if he didn't push me If it had happened then I would not have become a CA today, so they He pushed me. seconds and he's my friend Even today I tell this to anyone who came to my house Thank you Siddharth bhai, in your affair ok i read it, you would not have come home I don't even know at the time that is it, that picture, which picture is that That is not the Lakshya picture that my friend If I am doing it then I will also do it, if he did it then Dad saw me and told me I did it too The thing to learn is that they didn't do much I had taught you a good thing when you work They used to do it, then when they went to another company I joined VTI and was given a company and there But he got the office car So when I used to use the house for home no his car so he used to say that you have returned home If it is used for then get petrol filled in it I gave you ₹500 because you used that much. I have done it. I don't understand what Papa is doing had been? Who is getting to know? I did not say Keep company, professional and personal use separate Should be different. today is my date Does anyone in the company even ask for samples? He doesn't even give his sample. I want Priya yes, you are my wife, you are my mother, mother So, she has fought as well. yours is so big Cannot give samples to companies. myself I buy samples and give them. I Nowhere does one give free samples. I have Kept my professional life and my personal Life is totally separate. and the company is so Clean. How many auditors come? How many? The investors come.

Seconds my dad who They taught me this, they used to say back still borrow Eventually you have to order If you need any kind of business then I My mindset was that I should bring in business Is. The consumer has to win. Now the consumer How to win? It's going through his mind. My mind is running the same way. Consumer I want to win over her because she likes this color It seems. This is why the consumer has to win He wants it at this price and he wants this model Needed Have to take order from consumer. How I have to take it, I have to take it from him. I have to impress her. His marketing has to do what he likes Come. I have to do something for him May it be good. Not be good to me. Sometimes companies start becoming products Forward. I believe best companies are Consumers Backward. if you are a consumer Backward. And that's what I learned. you have to get PO from that customer in a bee to B. Language. and you get love from the Customer in A to C language. Got it. Very interesting. how is yours Relationship with him? Your father? Love, It's Love.

They are expensive, what can one do if one wins will take love it this india actually is Attitude is very much needed brother, why money Having so much estrangement from money and creating so much distance keep money in such a way yes brother he has resources and he has his purpose I mean, generally I think money is a very Sensitive topic in India needlessly not it's not like that no you don't think so now India is changing friend, it is now India What you were saying earlier about Divers There are opinions. Somebody likes something, Nobody likes it. show off to me I don’t like doing it at all. to me If I feel good then I wear it. No If I like it then I wouldn't wear it. I T-shirt Have to wear it.

Me I don't see why I'm taking this Because its brand is very good. My I am not interested in this thing but go back to Nainital and Udaipur. What were you saying? I am saying Whenever I went to Nainital, I used to go to Udaipur. I have not been through the same things many times It's so much fun doing the same old thing Is. Like every Saturday many of my friends It is good to meet them and talk about the same things Seems like go to the same hotel and the same room I enjoy staying here. go to the same city It feels good. doing the same old things It feels very good. new things sometimes I don't want to do it because I don't enjoy it Comes. Now during the holidays my wife and I am very different in these things. Priya's I always feel like exploring new places We will do it, we will go somewhere new and live a great life. I too feel like it sometimes but sometimes I feel like I have to go there, That's what I have to do. So a holiday we will take her Let's proceed accordingly. a holiday on my own Let's go from. So many things in life are like that I am not able to do that in many places Need to grind. Brother you are absolutely right Buddy. Somewhere it feels like the same old thing, same old days yes otherwise everything is so Everything remains dynamic. I I get it. I have no friends from school. His Wives We all meet. Ok? sometime every See you on Saturday. Mostly we every once I meet you every month. and on the same things Those who laughed last month laugh. and very We enjoy it. and his wife says so We did not hear anything. you remember it exactly, that's why then this What a stupid thing you did. Yes, that's it. First At first they didn’t like that we I am laughing at the same things. Now them those things also seem good and if we don't If I do that, he says the same thing, my friend Every time one or two new things are added. But the fun you get with the old one is that Addiction is something else. We do not know what this What will you say about this analysis It's nostalgia, I mean look at this, I mean the old friend i feel like 23 24 25 You can't even have that fun later It starts decreasing with your friends You start making fewer friends after the age of 28 or 29. A real friend is one who lives in an era where But you get naked in front of your friends Your embarrassments in front of you All your vulnerability is always in front of you Things came together in these formative years That story happens even if you eat it 100 times it's fun at least that's what I Feel. Yeah ur right. I look at our What actually happened in between when we People, everyone has to struggle in their life had begun. Everyone in their own life They were going separately. so i think last few Years is when we have to come back again What We Were. Meaning, they were lost somewhere in the middle. They were managing their own lives. and you know Then we realised that the fun was in them Is. Like starting a project who became a company brother man in doing kids The time is definitely wasted. being on This side you know young company almost married. I can see that I have four years in between If there are children to disappear. no bro now So I will get married in 6 months. But technically Meaning it is the same thing. so what about the kids I was speaking like this. I thought they wouldn't. I think about it, I take care of it. Pressure It keeps getting made brother. what from here to there Let me tell you that you have experienced a great sadness. Saying There is so much trust involved in cutting a child. Waji is awesome. You must know it. I mean brother It is my friends'. It doesn't mean brother. Brother, I can't say if he brought it by stealing it. But you can see that now his life is a there is a suck in at the level now and that too He must be a very interesting person brother I don't know what the kids angle even means. I did not hit you so that's fine then Do you have any questions brother? No, no I don't have any question brother, I am What does one want overall in their thoughts about marriage?
