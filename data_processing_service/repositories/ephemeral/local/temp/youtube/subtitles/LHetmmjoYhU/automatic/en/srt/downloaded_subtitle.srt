00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello Friends.  Friends, it does not seem that the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,240
Israel Iran war is going to end very soon

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,480
because things can escalate very quickly from here

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,120
because two very big

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,200
news have come.  First of all, the UK has

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,759
decided that it will take all its

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
assets and fighter jets towards the Middle East.

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,640
Meaning, it may happen very soon that

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
UK too may jump into this war.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,880
And the second news that has come is that

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
Donald Trump has given a very big warning

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,920
to Iran.  You can see the news if we are

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
attacked in any way by Iran.  Donald

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,840
Trump's big warning, we will

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
understand both these things in a little detail and let me

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
tell you that just before I was recording this video, the

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,120
news came that

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,280
Britain's fighter jet F35

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,640
suddenly landed in Kerala in an emergency,

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
I will tell you about that too, let's move ahead

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,879
but before that let me tell you all that those of you who are

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
in the comment section.  Let's get started.

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
First let us see

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,720
what Donald Trump has said.  Donald Trump has

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,280
issued a statement and made one thing very

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
clear and also

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,200
given a warning to Iran.  See, he said, if the

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
United States is attacked in any weather,

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
directly and through its allies and

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,320
interests, it will respond with

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,799
overwhelming force.  Or if you look at the

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,880
social truth, the media, basically

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
they have posted here

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,759
that the US had nothing to do with the attack

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
on Iran.  Now one thing needs to be understood here.

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
You might remember that a few days ago there was

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,479

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
talk of removing personnel from the Middle East.  Donald Trump had said

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,079
that we are withdrawing our personal from the Middle East

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
and he had said that

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,159
it is going to be a very dangerous place.  So

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,159
it is a clear cut thing that Donald Trump

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
and America knew that

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
Israel was going to attack Iran very soon.

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
Then the second thing here is

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,439
that if you listen to Netanyahu's speech, you

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,439
listen to Netanya's words.  He is repeatedly

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,759
saying that America is standing behind us.

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
Whatever attacks we are carrying out on Iran, we are

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
doing it with full support of America.  But on the other hand, if you

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
look at Trump, he is saying that

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,840
we have nothing to do with this war.

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,480
Here he said that if we are

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,280
attacked on any of our things

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,319
then we will attack Iran with full force

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,640
and will attack in a way that probably no

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
one has ever seen before.  However he

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,519
also said that

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,560
we can end this entire bloody conflict here.

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
So, in a way, they are

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,480
trying to give all the support they can to Israel.

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,160
Well, this is its context

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
because as you can see, for the last

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,200
three-four days, there has been continuous missile exchange between Israel and Iran.  There

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,800

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
are constant attacks.

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
Israel started it.  The

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,800
entire Operation Rising Land was started and

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
it was said here that we are attacking the nuclear sites etc.

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
so that we do

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,800
not want Iran to be able to make a nuclear bomb.

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,959
So in a way it seems

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
that this is slowly converting into a full blown Middle Eastern war.

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
So

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,760
here America fears that its

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
interests may be harmed somewhere.

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
Because if you

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
look in the Middle East, there is Syria, Iraq, Saudi

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,560
Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain.

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,480
You will find US military bases at many places

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,040
here.  So basically

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,360
America is warning Iran and

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,920
Iran's proxies, whether it is Hezbollah or the

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Houthis or the Iraqi

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,760
groups, in a way an

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,959
attempt is being made to warn them that they should

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,360

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
not even try to touch our American assets here

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
because if something happens there, then we will

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
jump into a full-fledged war here.  So,

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
what may happen now is that

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
whenever such things have happened, you will often

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,239
see that the American bases,

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
American assets have also been attacked and

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
most likely, there may be an

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
attack there and taking that as an excuse,

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,080
America jumps into this war on a big scale.

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,080
What is happening right now is that it is

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,560
going through Israel.  But

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,959
America has not yet directly attacked Iran.

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
Now look here, those who are saying this,

111
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,400
end this bloody conflict.  so

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
what does that mean?  Meaning, Donald Trump is

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,159
trying to signal in a way

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
that our military action will be

115
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,880
very swift.  It will be so fast that Iran will

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,479
not even know.  This means that we will launch air

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
strikes on the Iranian military

118
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,040
infrastructure and the

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
facilities of the IRGC.  Here

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,800
Donald Trump is indicating that as

121
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,720
you know about the aircraft carriers,

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
many aircraft carriers of

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
America keep operating all across the world.  So we will attack you using aircraft carriers here

124
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Sea.

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
Our special forces have been

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
deployed; the cyber warfare

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
unit has already been deployed.  So in

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
a way Donald Trump has said that

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
we are ready and if you look at it politically,

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
here he is fully helping Israel from behind the scenes

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,680
and telling Iran to

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,759
back down.  Don't retaliate here.

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,080
Now its strategic and political

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
implication is that

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,479
they have, in a way, drawn a red line for Iran

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
that they should not attack anything of ours.

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,639
Otherwise we will attack very fast

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,320
and we have given assurance to Israel

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,479
that we stand with you.

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
So you will see this situation right now.

142
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,520
But on the other hand, another

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,759
big development that happened here was that the UK

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Prime Minister Keir Starmer

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,560
announced here that our

146
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,720
assets are being moved towards the Middle East.

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,960
Here you can see that

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,360
UK has said that its jets,

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,280
you know, are called the Royal Air Force of UK.

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
So their Typhoon

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
fighter jets, Vajra aerial refueling

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
aircraft or warning

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
planes are being shifted to the Middle Eastern

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,240
bases

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,560
and let me tell you that

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,479
if you see here, the UK's assets are already

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
deployed in the Middle East

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,520
under Operation Shadar. What it is is an

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
operation, a coalition of many

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
European countries, under which they

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,560
fight against ISIS, but its presence is

162
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
still very less, so here the UK is saying

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
that we are increasing our presence on a large scale.  In

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
fact, if I tell you about the

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
strategic positioning of the assets,

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,199
because if you look, you will find many assets of UK also

167
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
in the Middle East.

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,120
For example, if we talk about

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
Jordan, there is limited presence of

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
military here.  Even in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia,

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
you will

172
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
see UK's military presence in small amounts.  The

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
logistics support base here in Oman,

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,919
which monitors the

175
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, can also be

176
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,919
seen.  In UAE, you can

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,759

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,759
see the military facilities of UK at the air force station there.

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
Even in Qatar, if you look, what the UK

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,759
does is they use the US's Al Udeid Air Base.

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,319

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,880

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,720
You will get to see HMS Jufer, the UK's British Naval Support Facility in Bahrain.

184
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,720
You can also see small numbers of British soldiers in Kuwait.  That

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,639
means the

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,120
UK also has a huge presence in the entire Middle East.

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
But gradually it had

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
diminished somewhere.  So now

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
efforts are being made to continuously increase that presence.  And the

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
pilots of the Royal Air Force and the command

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
system have gone on 247 alert that if

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,440
any type of ballistic missile,

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,800
drone or hostile aircraft comes, they will

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,840
intercept it.  Because in fact,

195
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,639
if you see here, whenever Iran attacks

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,960
Israel.  So whatever missiles

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,039
etc. are fired, here America

198
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
also keeps tracking them and

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,639
tries to blow them up mid-air.  So this

200
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
situation somehow looks like that

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
UK will also help Israel from behind.

202
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
Why is the UK doing this now?  Look, one

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
thing is that UK Prime Minister Chris

204
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,039
Starmer said that actually those people are going to Canada.

205
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
PM Modi is also going for the G7 summit.

206
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,759
So before going here he

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,160
said we are sending assets as contingency

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,720
support.  This is not escalation.  This is about

209
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,880
readiness.  It is said here that it

210
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
shows that we are not going to fight

211
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,160
but are going to provide support.

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
We are going to be ready.  And

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,800
why is that so?  Because the UK has major economic

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
and diplomatic military ties within that entire

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,360
region.  There are energy and trade routes.   There

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,919
are British nationals in Israel.  There

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
are Royal Air Force bases, naval outposts.  So

218
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,919
they are going to protect him.

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,520
And London's fear is that whenever this type

220
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,080
of violence happens, it has a domino

221
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
effect.  This means that the entire Middle East

222
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,160
peace process may collapse.

223
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Oil prices may go up.  Mass

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
evacuation may be required.  So

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
they are ready for that as well, that if there is a

226
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,960
need for evacuation from there, then UK should be ready

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
and it will have different roles.  The assets that Britain is

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
sending its forces here, the

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,840
Typhoon jets, will be

230
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,320

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,240
used for Combat Air Patrol intercept missions.  Vajra tankers will be

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
used for mid air refueling.  Apart from this there is

233
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
AWACS which is used for radar system.  The

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,560
Royal Navy is done.  Maritime

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,720
patrol operates in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.

236
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,040
So these are all the things.  Well, keep one thing in

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
mind, the UK has not openly said

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,519
that we fully support Israel.

239
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,519
Yes, Israel has the right for self-

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,279
defense, it has said so.  But he’s

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,519
trying to do a balancing act.  Meaning it is saying

242
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,399
that this should be de-escalation.  There

243
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,440
should be a ceasefire.  The

244
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,760
UK does not want to participate directly in Israeli offence.

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,519
So in a way, we are trying to build a bridge so that

246
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,320
if any kind of

247
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
agreement has to be reached then it can happen.  Now

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
look, I was just telling you this.

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Just before I was making this video,

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
a notification came on my mobile.

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,959
Here, the British F35 fighter jet had to make an

252
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
emergency landing

253
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,959
at the Kerala airport, which is the airport in Trivandrum.

254
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,600
Here you can see its

255
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,080
latest photo.  The F35 fighter

256
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
jet here is again taken from America.  It

257
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,240
had to make an emergency landing because

258
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,640
I learned that the fuel inside it had run

259
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,560
out.  Because of this, a landing had to be

260
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,120
made and in fact it is being said

261
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,360
that it had taken off from the aircraft carrier itself.

262
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
So this shows

263
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,800
that the UK is increasing its presence in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East.

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320

265
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,320
And look at its strategic aspect, the overall

266
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,880
strategic implication is that the presence of UK and

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,120
NATO forces will

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
either bring stability in the Middle East

269
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,680
or Iranian attacks will increase further.

270
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
So things can go both ways.

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,600
Ultimately here we have to see

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
what happens in which direction.  How Iran's

273
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
retaliation comes about.  What things will happen?

274
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,040
But I hope you have understood the latest news that came here

275
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,240
and

276
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,839
before leaving, a very interesting question:

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,079
can you tell me

278
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,880
which of these

279
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,360
states is the most vulnerable because of the Iran-Israel conflict, the

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,800
