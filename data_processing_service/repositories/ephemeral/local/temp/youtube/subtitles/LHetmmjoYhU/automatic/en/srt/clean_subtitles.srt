Hello Friends.  Friends, it does not seem that the Israel Iran war is going to end very soon because things can escalate very quickly from here because two very big news have come.  First of all, the UK has decided that it will take all its assets and fighter jets towards the Middle East. Meaning, it may happen very soon that UK too may jump into this war. And the second news that has come is that Donald Trump has given a very big warning to Iran.  You can see the news if we are attacked in any way by Iran.  Donald Trump's big warning, we will understand both these things in a little detail and let me tell you that just before I was recording this video, the news came that Britain's fighter jet F35 suddenly landed in Kerala in an emergency, I will tell you about that too, let's move ahead but before that let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026, you have a chance till 12:00 pm tonight, the Great Learning Festival is going on with extra discount, you can take any of our course batches with extra discount. All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that you can get maximum discount and you will get its link in the comment section.  Let's get started. First let us see what Donald Trump has said.  Donald Trump has issued a statement and made one thing very clear and also given a warning to Iran.  See, he said, if the United States is attacked in any weather, directly and through its allies and interests, it will respond with overwhelming force.  Or if you look at the social truth, the media, basically they have posted here that the US had nothing to do with the attack on Iran.  Now one thing needs to be understood here. You might remember that a few days ago there was talk of removing personnel from the Middle East.  Donald Trump had said that we are withdrawing our personal from the Middle East and he had said that it is going to be a very dangerous place.  So it is a clear cut thing that Donald Trump and America knew that Israel was going to attack Iran very soon. Then the second thing here is that if you listen to Netanyahu's speech, you listen to Netanya's words.  He is repeatedly saying that America is standing behind us. Whatever attacks we are carrying out on Iran, we are doing it with full support of America.  But on the other hand, if you look at Trump, he is saying that we have nothing to do with this war. Here he said that if we are attacked on any of our things then we will attack Iran with full force and will attack in a way that probably no one has ever seen before.  However he also said that we can end this entire bloody conflict here. So, in a way, they are trying to give all the support they can to Israel. Well, this is its context because as you can see, for the last three-four days, there has been continuous missile exchange between Israel and Iran.  There are constant attacks. Israel started it.  The entire Operation Rising Land was started and it was said here that we are attacking the nuclear sites etc. so that we do not want Iran to be able to make a nuclear bomb. So in a way it seems that this is slowly converting into a full blown Middle Eastern war. So here America fears that its interests may be harmed somewhere. Because if you look in the Middle East, there is Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain. You will find US military bases at many places here.  So basically America is warning Iran and Iran's proxies, whether it is Hezbollah or the Houthis or the Iraqi groups, in a way an attempt is being made to warn them that they should not even try to touch our American assets here because if something happens there, then we will jump into a full-fledged war here.  So, what may happen now is that whenever such things have happened, you will often see that the American bases, American assets have also been attacked and most likely, there may be an attack there and taking that as an excuse, America jumps into this war on a big scale. What is happening right now is that it is going through Israel.  But America has not yet directly attacked Iran. Now look here, those who are saying this, end this bloody conflict.  so what does that mean?  Meaning, Donald Trump is trying to signal in a way that our military action will be very swift.  It will be so fast that Iran will not even know.  This means that we will launch air strikes on the Iranian military infrastructure and the facilities of the IRGC.  Here Donald Trump is indicating that as you know about the aircraft carriers, many aircraft carriers of America keep operating all across the world.  So we will attack you using aircraft carriers here in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Sea. Our special forces have been deployed; the cyber warfare unit has already been deployed.  So in a way Donald Trump has said that we are ready and if you look at it politically, here he is fully helping Israel from behind the scenes and telling Iran to back down.  Don't retaliate here. Now its strategic and political implication is that they have, in a way, drawn a red line for Iran that they should not attack anything of ours. Otherwise we will attack very fast and we have given assurance to Israel that we stand with you. So you will see this situation right now. But on the other hand, another big development that happened here was that the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced here that our assets are being moved towards the Middle East. Here you can see that UK has said that its jets, you know, are called the Royal Air Force of UK. So their Typhoon fighter jets, Vajra aerial refueling aircraft or warning planes are being shifted to the Middle Eastern bases and let me tell you that if you see here, the UK's assets are already deployed in the Middle East under Operation Shadar. What it is is an operation, a coalition of many European countries, under which they fight against ISIS, but its presence is still very less, so here the UK is saying that we are increasing our presence on a large scale.  In fact, if I tell you about the strategic positioning of the assets, because if you look, you will find many assets of UK also in the Middle East. For example, if we talk about Jordan, there is limited presence of military here.  Even in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, you will see UK's military presence in small amounts.  The logistics support base here in Oman, which monitors the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, can also be seen.  In UAE, you can see the military facilities of UK at the air force station there. Even in Qatar, if you look, what the UK does is they use the US's Al Udeid Air Base. You will get to see HMS Jufer, the UK's British Naval Support Facility in Bahrain. You can also see small numbers of British soldiers in Kuwait.  That means the UK also has a huge presence in the entire Middle East. But gradually it had diminished somewhere.  So now efforts are being made to continuously increase that presence.  And the pilots of the Royal Air Force and the command system have gone on 247 alert that if any type of ballistic missile, drone or hostile aircraft comes, they will intercept it.  Because in fact, if you see here, whenever Iran attacks Israel.  So whatever missiles etc. are fired, here America also keeps tracking them and tries to blow them up mid-air.  So this situation somehow looks like that UK will also help Israel from behind. Why is the UK doing this now?  Look, one thing is that UK Prime Minister Chris Starmer said that actually those people are going to Canada. PM Modi is also going for the G7 summit. So before going here he said we are sending assets as contingency support.  This is not escalation.  This is about readiness.  It is said here that it shows that we are not going to fight but are going to provide support. We are going to be ready.  And why is that so?  Because the UK has major economic and diplomatic military ties within that entire region.  There are energy and trade routes.   There are British nationals in Israel.  There are Royal Air Force bases, naval outposts.  So they are going to protect him. And London's fear is that whenever this type of violence happens, it has a domino effect.  This means that the entire Middle East peace process may collapse. Oil prices may go up.  Mass evacuation may be required.  So they are ready for that as well, that if there is a need for evacuation from there, then UK should be ready and it will have different roles.  The assets that Britain is sending its forces here, the Typhoon jets, will be used for Combat Air Patrol intercept missions.  Vajra tankers will be used for mid air refueling.  Apart from this there is AWACS which is used for radar system.  The Royal Navy is done.  Maritime patrol operates in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. So these are all the things.  Well, keep one thing in mind, the UK has not openly said that we fully support Israel. Yes, Israel has the right for self- defense, it has said so.  But he’s trying to do a balancing act.  Meaning it is saying that this should be de-escalation.  There should be a ceasefire.  The UK does not want to participate directly in Israeli offence. So in a way, we are trying to build a bridge so that if any kind of agreement has to be reached then it can happen.  Now look, I was just telling you this. Just before I was making this video, a notification came on my mobile. Here, the British F35 fighter jet had to make an emergency landing at the Kerala airport, which is the airport in Trivandrum. Here you can see its latest photo.  The F35 fighter jet here is again taken from America.  It had to make an emergency landing because I learned that the fuel inside it had run out.  Because of this, a landing had to be made and in fact it is being said that it had taken off from the aircraft carrier itself. So this shows that the UK is increasing its presence in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. And look at its strategic aspect, the overall strategic implication is that the presence of UK and NATO forces will either bring stability in the Middle East or Iranian attacks will increase further. So things can go both ways. Ultimately here we have to see what happens in which direction.  How Iran's retaliation comes about.  What things will happen? But I hope you have understood the latest news that came here and before leaving, a very interesting question: can you tell me which of these states is the most vulnerable because of the Iran-Israel conflict, the right answer to this, you all know, will be available on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get the correct answer from Telegram and most importantly, friends, whoever of you wants to take the UPSC course, should take it with Study IQ by 12:00 pm tonight because in this Pratigya batch, you are getting an extra discount, from tomorrow the full price will increase again.
