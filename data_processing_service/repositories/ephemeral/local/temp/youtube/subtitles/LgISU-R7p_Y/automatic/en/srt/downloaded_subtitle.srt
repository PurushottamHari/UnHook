00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,920
Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,920
and I am Varun Johri.  Hail

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,320
India.  Today in this video we will talk

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,960
about a topic that has

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,760
shocked people across the world.  This topic

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,680
is Trump Epson files.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,160
Extremely rich and powerful people of the world.  The

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,480
secrets of his dark world which people do

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,679
not notice.  Normally people do

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,760
not look at them.  But when the name of the President

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,480

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,719
of America, which calls itself the most powerful country in the world,

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
comes up in these dark secrets, then it is

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,120
natural for the attention of the whole world to be drawn to such a case.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,640
And something similar

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,480
happened recently.  Actually, tech billionaire Elon Musk,

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,719
owner of SpaceX, Elon Musk, who

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,199
earlier supported Donald Trump's campaign.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
After taking the oath, Donald

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,879
Trump made Elon the head of one of his most essential

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,960
departments, the Department of Government

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,080
Efficiency.  But in May 2025,

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,320
suddenly distance started coming between the two.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
Elon actually resigned from this position,

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,680
and not just resigned, he

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,000
also posted a tweet on Twitter in which

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,280

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,360
Elon claimed that Trump's name

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
is in the sealed Austin files and that is why these

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,439
documents, secret documents, are being

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
held.  These are

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,759
not being exposed before the public.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Now the question is,

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,600
what exactly are these Estin Files?

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,920

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,040
What has been the relationship between Donald Trump and child sex trafficking offender Jeffrey Epson

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,200
?  What is Estin Private Island?

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,280
What are his secrets?  Astine's private

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
jet, called the Lalitha Express,

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,399

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,840

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,680
transports high-profile individuals to private properties with underage girls, including Jeffrey Epson.  So did Trump really

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
travel in Epstein's private jet?  Did he also go to any such private

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
property?  Was there a relationship between these two

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,200
?  And apart from Trump, who are the

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,439
other famous US people whose

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,679
name is in Esteen Piles and what is the

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
story behind it,

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,680
you are going to know today friends,

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,239
how suddenly Trump got into a fight over a mansion, a

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
very big house in Palm Beach

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
in the US, and suddenly after that he

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,239
distanced himself from Esteen,

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,239
and after that Esteen was arrested for child sex

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,959
trafficking,

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,680
and one day suddenly,

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,720
Jeffrey Esteen dies inside the jail under mysterious

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,519
circumstances.  What

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,920
is the relation between all these things?  Today we are

us start today's episode.  So first of all let me

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,440
tell you who is this Jeffrey Epstein

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
?  Many of you might have heard its name for the

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,480
first time.  But it

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
is quite notorious.  It

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
is quite famous in the US.  Talk about Jeffrey Epstein's whole

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
background.  Astin was

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,680
born on January 20, 1953

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,080
in Brooklyn, New York.  His father,

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
Simard, was a gardener with the NYC Parks

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Department, the New York City

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
Parks Department.

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
Used to do gardening work.

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,799
Astin was a very average student during his schooling days in school.

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,280
But it is said that

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
he was very sharp in Maths.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,159
He also pursued further studies in Maths and Physics in the university.

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,319
But one thing was

91
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,000
different with him that he never had any

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,799
degree.  He never

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,959
completed his graduation.  Despite this, he was around 21 years

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,560
old.  He did

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,599
not even have a graduation degree.  Still

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,400
in the month of September in 1974, Astin was appointed a teacher of

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,040
Physics and Maths in the very renowned Dalton School of the US.

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,159
Actually

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,120
at that time Donald Barr was the head master of Dalton School.

100
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,599
Donald Barr made

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
many such hirings during that period in which

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
people's degrees were not looked at.

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,639
Epson was also one of them.  He is

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,720
made a teacher here.  But

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,120
his behavior was not right.  After some time,

106
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
it was observed that Astin was seen behaving inappropriately with the

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,400
under-age female students, who were

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,240
girls, in the school.

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,199
Allegations were made against him

110
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,400
and in June 1976, i.e. after only 2 years,

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,160

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
he was expelled from the school citing poor performance as the reason.

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,639
A student after leaving Dalton was the

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,639

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,280
father of a student when Epstein taught at Dalton.  He used to

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,280
meet Epson many times.  Because of this

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
he was very impressed with him.  Meaning,

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,000
these could be useful to him for the work he had to do next.

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,000
What Effstein did was he

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
started meeting with him, and he

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
was so impressed with Effstein that

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,199
he

123
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,600

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,400
connected him with a senior partner at Bear Stearns, a Wall Street investment bank.

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,039
Effstein met Jeffrey Effstein, a teacher when he was

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,720
just 23 years old.   I

127
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,479
left from here after finishing my teaching job.

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,080
Esten joined Beardstown's investment bank in 1976.

129
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,160

130
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,520

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
He started working here as a junior level assistant.  Working

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
under a floor trader,

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,680
Ebstein was so quick at work.

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,400
Almost 4 years passed from here.  By 1980, he

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,800

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,639

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
worked as a junior assistant under the same floor trader under whom he worked as a Lower Lower Jun Lower.

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,560
Within 4 years, he

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
becomes his partner under him.  But it was

140
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,320
always seen that whenever Jeffrey Effstein used to do any work

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
and you will come to know this further, he was

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,919
always involved in some wrong activity

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,960
and he did the same here as well

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,639
because of which he spent almost 5 years in the next year i.e.

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,000
here in Bear Stearns.

146
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,800
In 1981, Astin was

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,960
fired from Bear Sterns due to regulatory deregulation.

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
Regulation Devaluation, actually let me

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
tell you here that

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,680
he was working in the trading firm, basically

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,840
in the investment bank, he had started giving

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,560
investment tips to people apart from the bank or he had

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,319

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
started doing the transactions of taking money from them.  That means here also he had got

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
involved in wrong activities.

156
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,120
Well, from here he was removed from the beer stun as well.  It was

157
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,240
August 1981 of this year.

158
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,199
Astin formed his own company

159
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,080
called Intercontinental Asset Group (

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,319
IAG).  He formed his own company with this name.

161
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
What this company basically did was to

162
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,080

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,319
recover funds from their clients.  Mainly

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,479
he used to keep and recruit many people here as fund recovery agents.

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479

166
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,400
After forming this company, he started telling his

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,160
friends and people around him

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,720
that he actually

169
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,039

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
recovers embezzled funds from rich people in the US for the government.  Meaning, he

172
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
basically works for them and sometimes he

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
says things that are

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
hard to believe.  Many times he

175
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,880
told his friends and close ones,

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,919
who were colleagues, that he was

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,400
an intelligence agent of the CIA.  Meaning he

178
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,240
is a spy agent.

179
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,919
Someone gave the task to the person working here.  He used to talk like this.

180
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,160
He was also found to be carrying a fake Austrian passport in 1980, which

181
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,560

182
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,520
stated his address as that of a resident of Saudi Arabia.

184
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
Now where did he get this from?  This was also a secret.  There are

185
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,199
many secrets associated with Efstein.

186
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
You will know more about it later.  Well

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,039
during this time, he got a very big deal when he

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,440
became his own company.  How he

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,080
came in contact with this person is

190
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,160
also a mystery till today because during this time

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
one of his biggest

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,919
clients was Adnan Khashoggi, if you all

193
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,759
know Adnan Khashoggi is a very famous

194
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,639
arms dealer, a very big arms dealer,

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,759
Epstein had managed Khashoggi's assets worth

196
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,479
more than 1 billion dollars through his firm

197
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,879

198
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,199
and because of this Epstein had a

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,759
lot of money, and money

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
started coming to him.  Now when this huge amount of money

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
started coming to Austin, since he was already involved

202
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
in wrong activities, now it

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,960
started going in that direction.  Estin

204
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,120
bought a Florida mansion with all the money.

205
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Bought a home in New Mexico.

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,520
Bought a very big private home in New York.  Meanwhile,

207
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
he started meeting different celebrities at all these places.   I

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,960

209
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,120

210
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,279
started meeting artists, politicians and leaders.  Basically

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,760
he had started socializing himself now that he

212
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,399
was now the owner of a very big company and especially a

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
company which had contacts with people like Adnan Khachkhi.

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,240
He used to tell many people that

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
I am a CIA agent, hence I have

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
work with many governments as well.

217
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
These were all the things.  Now another

218
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,519
turning point was about to come in his life from here.  Was

219
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,880
running my own company.  But

220
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,160
despite this, it started working with people again.  The year

221
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,120
1987 arrives.  In 1987,

222
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,920
Effstein met Stefan Hoffenberg.

223
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320

224
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,560
Who actually introduced Effstein to Stefan Hoffenberg?  You will be surprised to hear this.

225
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,760
Former US Attorney

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,440
General John Mitchell introduced

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,399
Epstein to Hoffenberg.  Hoffenberg brought

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,480
Epson into his company, basically both of them

229
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,000
started working for Hoffenberg's company.  Estin

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,800
founded Tower Financial Corporation.  In this

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,040
company, Astin

233
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,959
started working as a consultant.   The

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,120
company used to collect depth

235
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,440
from hospitals, banks, phone companies and

236
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,519
it started working very closely with Hoffenberg

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
because it was a very big company.

238
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,519
Tower Financial was very famous

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,680
in the US.  Epson of Hoffenberg traveled with him in his private jet.   I used to

240
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600

241
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,959
go with him everywhere.  His

242
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
lifestyle also changed during this time

243
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,880
considering Hoffenberg.  But in 1989,

244
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,000
Epstein suddenly left the company.  In fact,

245
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,360
here too he had secretly started some different work,

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
after which he was going to

247
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,760
leave Hoffenberg alone.  He was a

248
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
very clever, very smart man.

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,360
What he had done just a year earlier was

250
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,160
work for Hoffenberg in 1988 when he was continuing.

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,880
Epstein had secretly set up his own

252
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
financial management firm called

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,480
J jostin@

254
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,440
company.

255
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,079
What happened in 1993 was that he left the company a

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,399
year earlier, in 1993, finally an

257
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,399
investigation was conducted on Tower Financial,

258
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
this entire company and one of its businesses was

259
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,440
exposed, and then it was revealed that he was

260
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,279
running a very big Ponzi scam in the US. Ponzi

261
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
schemes are scams, many of them are caught in India as well

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,920
many times.  In this,

263
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,040
all the overall investors of the US suffered a loss of around

264
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,600
450 million dollars.  It

265
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,959
was a big scam.

266
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
When all these documents reached the court,

267
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,680
punishment was announced against Hoffenberg.

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,839
Hoffenberg claimed that Epsin was

269
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,920
deeply involved in the scheme along

270
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,480
with me.  I am not the only culprit.

271
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,560
But because Epstein knew all of this

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,720
when he left the company.  He

273
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,720
left the company in 1989.  They formed their own company in 88,

274
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
and till this time these people were

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
doing all this fraudulent work.  But no

276
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,320
charges were filed against Astin here

277
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,800
because he had left the company a year ago.

278
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,200
Cephali had left.  Now

279
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,880
a very big turn was about to come in his life

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,959
because he had now set his next target.

281
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480

Now let's move ahead with our episode.  So now on to

306
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,560
Epstein's next target.  Actually,

307
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,639
he had set this target while he was working

308
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
with Hoffenberg.

309
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,079
And there was a very big person from the US.

310
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,920
Astin met Leslie Waxner in 1986 while he was

311
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
working with Hoffenberg.

312
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,399
Leslie

313
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
Waxner You all might know Victoria's

314
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,160
Secret, you might have heard the name,

315
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,000
Chairman and CEO of Victoria's Secret, Leslie Waxner was

316
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,639
introduced to Epson by

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,120
someone who knew him.  Just a

318
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,360
year later, in 1987, Epstein

319
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
also became a financial advisor to Wexner.  You should

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,160
think about it that on one hand, it is also creating its own companies.  On the

321
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,959
other hand, he becomes

322
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,279
his right hand man with Waxner of Victoria's Secret.  He

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,760
became one of his advisors.

324
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,480
By 1991 he had thus brought Waxner

325
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,120
under his control.  He had

326
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,680
made a proper clientele and in a way

327
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Waxner had given full power to Astin.  Now he

328
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,399

329
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,639
could have paid what the attorney for Victoria's Secrets to Waxner.  That means that

330
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,600

331
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,000
Waxner of that company had in a way given him the power of attorney.

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,920
What could I do after fst?  I could have signed cheques on his behalf.  I

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
could buy and

334
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,279
sell properties and hire people.

335
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,120
He used to borrow money from anyone in the

336
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,720
name of Waxner.  In the name of Leslie Waxner.

337
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,360
Astein Waxner's Yacht is

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,440
very famous.  In fact it is

339
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
called the largest corporate yacht.

340
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,680
Limitless is its name.  He managed

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,920
projects such as construction for Leslie Wexner.

342
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,320
This earned Efstein millions of dollars.

343
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,440
It is said that he earned a lot of money and

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,279
wealth here.  He was

345
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,360
not limited to this only with all these works.  Was always involved in wrong things.  The

346
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,000

347
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,079
attitude he had, especially towards females,

348
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
his perspective was very wrong.

349
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,720
He regularly

350
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,959
attended the Victoria's Secret fashion shows that were held here.  He used to

351
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120

352
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,680
host the models who were there in his house in New York.  I used to

353
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,920
call him there.  He used to handle aspiring

354
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,199
models

355
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,600
in a wrong manner to get them work in the company.

356
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680

357
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Epstein continued doing all these things here.  These

358
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
were Astein's clients, Waxner basically

359
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
became his clients later on, so

360
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
his company would manage all of their work.

361
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,279
This is the only well known

362
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,600
billionaire client of Abstein,

363
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,680
till date his name has been linked with Donald Trump and

364
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
Bill Clinton,

365
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
this has come out in the files, this has come out

366
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,440
later in the investigation but

367
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,320
till now Leslie Waxner was one of his official

368
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,880
clients.  Well, here comes 1996.  In 1996,

369
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,240
Epson renamed his firm

370
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,959
Financial Trust Company and

371
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,199
based it in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.

372
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,839
Why was this done?

373
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,920
Because now the time had come to avoid taxes.   I was

374
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,800
doing all the wrong things.  It was also

375
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,440
necessary to do this.

376
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,920
He basically called this St. Thomas an

377
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,040
offshore tax haven for tax advantages.

378
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
This means that the federal income tax there is reduced by 90%.

379
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,040
So it started working here.

380
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
Made my base there.  Around

381
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,399
this time, Efstein installed hidden cameras in both

382
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,760
his home in the Virgin Islands as well as the

383
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,240

384
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,320
mansion he purchased in New York.

385
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,920

386
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,160
He had installed hidden cameras in such hidden places

387
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,680
that he could alert people from outside who were in

388
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,560
his social circle,

389
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,399
which included politicians, big people and

390
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
film stars.  He used to call all of them here

391
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,279
and whatever activities they did,

392
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,560
sexual activities, he used to

393
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,480
call some girls there and then he used to

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,399
record them and later he used to find out

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,199
why he had done this so that he could

396
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,360
blackmail them in future.  From here it

397
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,079
started showing its true colours.

398
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,920

399
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:12,720
After going to such a big place and earning so much money, he got involved in all these jobs.

400
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:15,120
In this, Austin was

401
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,360
not alone.  He was joined by his

402
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,920
long-term girlfriend and

403
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,959
companion Ghislaine Maxwell.

404
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,839
Ghislaine remained with Maxwell Epson

405
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,399
for a very long time, until the very end, until his death.

406
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
He also had a role.  What did Epsino and

407
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,759
Maxwell do?  Young girls were

408
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,279
recruited here and according to a source,

409
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
which is

410
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
mentioned in the middle of this report.  He

411
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,240
says that Apsino

412
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,240
videotaped everyone on Maxwell Island.  Whichever

413
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,480
guest came to them, whatever

414
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
people from their social circle came, they used to video tape them all.  They used to

415
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
make their video tapes and

416
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320

417
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,959
these people kept it as their insurance policy so that they could

418
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,680
blackmail them in the future.  Well, Epson's

419
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,440
social circle was also very big

420
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,320
and kept growing.  Now there were

421
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,559
celebrities, politicians and powerful

422
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,280
people in it.  He was constantly seen with all of them.

423
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,120
And all these things are

424
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,000
not just in the documents.  There are videos of them, there are photos of them.

425
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,000
All things come to light.

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,480
Now in the 1990s and early 2000s, our main character is

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,439
Donald Trump.

428
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,919
Epstein was seen frequently with Donald Trump from the 1990s to the early 2000s.

429
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,959
Both of them were very close.

430
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,520
Both of them were frequently seen at social events in New York and Palm Beach.

431
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,320

432
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,400
Clicking photos together, dancing, having

433
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,960
drinks.  Mara Lago party in 1992,

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,280
Mara Lago is basically a

435
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
corporate, you can call it a club.  The

436
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,600
owner of Mara Lago is currently also Donald Trump.

437
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,520

438
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200

439
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,080
Estin was also invited to US President Mar Lago's party and was seen with Donald Trump.

440
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,440

441
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,760
NBC News also played it extensively in a 1992 videotape.

442
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,679
When this whole case of the Astin file

443
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,600
happened, when the entire

444
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,679
investigation was focused on Astin.  It was then played

445
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,760
and showed Trump and Estin

446
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,280
at the party along with dancers.

447
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,280
In 2002, Trump told New York magazine

448
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,600
about Epson, "I've

449
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,520
known Jeff (Jeffrey Epstein) because his name was

450
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,280
I've known Jeff for 15 years."

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,400
This is a statement by Donald Trump.

452
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,039
I have known Jeffrey Epstein for a recorded 15 years.  He is a

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
terrific guy.  He is a

454
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:33,280
lot of fun to be with and it is even said that he

455
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,559
likes beautiful women as much as

456
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,799
I do and many of them are on the younger side.

457
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,000
This is a statement by Donald Trump.  And by seeing

458
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,600
this you can clearly understand

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,039
that Astin was an offender of child sex trafficking.

460
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,440
He was also punished for this crime.

461
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,919
And the allegation made by Esten against Donald Trump

462
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,360
seems to be that Donald Trump used to visit

463
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,760
all his

464
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,760
houses and the

465
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,240
under-age girls

466
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,640
who were targeted by Absin and brought here to

467
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
entertain all these big people,

468
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,039
Donald Trump

469
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,880
and some big people of the US were also involved in it.   I

470
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,559
will tell you about all this further.

471
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
Well apart from that let me tell you

472
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,200
what basically are the Estin files?

473
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
First of all, this is a statement from Donald Trump in the Epson file.  The

474
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,720
second thing is his black

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,640
book which contains

476
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,120
contact numbers of many important people.

477
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,679
Estin's black book contains

478
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,080
multiple contact numbers for Trump.   There

479
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,400
are addresses.  Addresses where Trump

480
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,919
previously lived.  lived there before that.  These

481
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
are all the addresses.  This is the address of Trump's office.  This

482
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,640
is the home address.  The address of Maral Aago is

483
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,320
also here in front.

484
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,559
All the contact numbers of Trump are in it.   In

485
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
fact, his wife's contact number is

486
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,039
also there in his black book.

487
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,880
That of Jeffrey Epstein was also found there.   To be

488
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
viewed according to flight locks.

489
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,919
Seen as per flight locks.

490
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,520
Why are flight locks being looked at now?

491
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,919
Because Jeffery Epson had his own

492
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,679
private jet which he called the Lolata Express.  It is

493
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,200
said that

494
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,440
Trump traveled in

495
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,559
Epstein's private jet, the Lolita Express, which

496
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,280
was basically a Boeing plane that he named, at

497
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,160
least seven

498
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,720
times between 1993 and 1997. Trump traveled

499
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,520
in it sometimes with his family, sometimes

500
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,480
with family members and sometimes alone. But there is no

501
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,360
specific public record yet

502
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,200
that Trump visited any of Epstein's private islands,

503
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,159
like Little St. John's,

504
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,559
St. James, or whether

505
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,480

506
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,320
Trump visited his private island, called Epinal Island. No

507
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
such thing has been mentioned here.

508
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Well, know about Jeffrey Epstein's Lolata Express.

509
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,440
This is the nickname

510
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
he had given to his Boeing 7 to 7 jet.

511
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,520
This jet called Lolata

512
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,039
Express was used to transport high profile individuals.

513
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Under age girls were

514
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,760
kept in this plane and these

515
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,679
people were taken to private

516
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
properties which included private properties in New York.

517
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,840
Epstein has

518
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,840
private properties in Palm Beach and on

519
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,320
Vergennes Islands in the US, they were

520
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
taken there and later videotaped,

521
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
which those people were not aware of

522
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,679
because Epstein was

523
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,400
going to blackmail them later, but these people

524
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,240
came in contact with Epstein and

525
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
stayed with him so that they

526
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,360
get an opportunity to do all these things. It is said

527
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,240
that Trump's name also comes up in this.  Well,

528
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,360
this name was basically Lalita Express, it is

529
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,039
said that it came

530
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,760
from Vladimir Navko's novel, his novel was Lalita

531
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,120
in which a man's obsession

532
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,120
for a young girl is shown, so from there he selected this name

533
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,240
and basically all the

534
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,080
evidence is in front of him that Astin was involved in trafficking of young girls,

535
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
child sex trafficking

536
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,360
and he

537
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,720
lived with all these people.  Well, here comes 2002.

538
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,039
In 2002, the name of another very important person

539
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,840
comes to light.  Epstein had planned a trip to Africa with former

540
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,360
US President Bill Clinton,

541
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,440
actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker

542
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,039

543
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,640
and he took them all there

544
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,080
in his private jet, the Laulalitha Express.  It is

545
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,919

546
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
said about his flight jet that Bill

547
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,280
Clinton has made around 26 trips in it.

548
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,440
Donald Trump has travelled in this Lalita Express at least seven times to

549
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,559
different places.

550
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,240
Prince Andrew's name comes up.  And this came to

551
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,039
light not only in the way that the

552
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,520
records that he filed

553
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:46,080
also revealed their victims.  Virginia

554
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,280
Gafari, a female who was an under-teen

555
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,559
age girl at the time.  He claimed

556
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,720
that this jet belonged to Effstein and

557
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
he was also taken there at that time.  He

558
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,799
said that he has seen Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew,

559
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
Donald Trump etc.

560
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,120
there.  So inside that jet,

561
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,520
girls were abused inside this jet.

562
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,840
It had a lavish interior from inside.  There used to be a

563
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,559
bedroom inside that jet.  There were red

564
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,799
velvet seats.  There were mirrors

565
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,840
around.  There used to be mirror walls.  Meaning, inside a jet,

566
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,360
and Asten used to describe it as a playground.

567
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360

568
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,200
Whenever these people talked to him, they used to say

569
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,240
that this is not a jet, this Lolata Express is

570
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,960
our playground.  You can imagine the

571
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,360
mentality of powerful and rich people and the

572
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,640
dark world of these people which is

573
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,360
visible to you here.  Well the very

574
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,159
next year in 2003, Estin tried to buy what you all know as

575
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,320
New York magazine with Harvey Winston

576
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,000

577
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,799
but that bit didn't work out.  I

578
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,120
failed.  This year he

579
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,480
donated $30 million to Harvard University.

580
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,159
Estein

581
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,120
dated Eva Andersson, the winner of Miss Sweden that same year.

582
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,360
He dated many different Miss

583
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,120
World, Miss Universe, actresses and

584
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,520
models

585
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,640
but never married anyone.  But now

586
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,320
things were going to get

587
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,679
worse for Effstein too.

588
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,440
Something that happened is that it is told that

589
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,559
in 2004, Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump made a deal for

590
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,880
a house in Palm Beach

591
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,480
which was said to be named Mansion Di

592
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,039
Lamiti, Mansion Di Lamiti,

593
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,440
both wanted to buy it but

594
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,360
due to its purchase, a fight broke out between

595
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,360
Donald Trump and Jeffrey

596
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,440
Epstein, after this Epstein's

597
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,760
downfall started and suddenly,

598
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,360
after the fight with Donald Trump, it was seen that

599
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,120
in the very next year 2005, suddenly the FBI started the investigation

600
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,400
of child sex trafficking against Epstein.

601
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,799
It started

602
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,960
when the parents of a 14 year old girl in Palm Beach, Florida suddenly

603
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,880
approached the

604
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
police.  They tell him that Estin has

605
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,320

606
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,320
molested his daughter at his Palm Beach home.  When the police saw all these things

607
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
, they searched his house and conducted a search operation.

608
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,919
Photos of girls were found there

609
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,159
because Estien was involved in all those things

610
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,320
but along with him, these big high

611
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
profile people were also present in it,

612
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,919
whose names have not been revealed properly till date,

613
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,080
due to which Elon Musk has

614
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,640
raised questions on Trump and has

615
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,799
directly said that Trump's

616
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,640
name is included in it in Pepstin's files,

617
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,760
that is why it is not being disclosed.

618
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,080
Well, when the police reached here, the

619
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,559
police officers saw that about 36

620
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,440
girls were identified.

621
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,919
Many of them were girls below 14 years of age.

622
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,880
Who was

623
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,320
sexually abused by Estin here.  And it was later

624
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,679
revealed that this person

625
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,840
was at the peak of his career since 1996.

626
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,080
It was basically child sex trafficking

627
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,640
inside the US.  Big people were

628
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,039
involved in it.  So Estin was finally caught.

629
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,080
In 2008, Epson

630
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,960
pleaded guilty in Florida state court.  But

631
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,240
still he was sentenced to only 18 months in jail.

632
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,320
With extensive work release.  I mean, this was such a

633
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
serious case.  Still he does

634
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,840
n't know what kind of policies they have, their

635
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
legal policies here in the US.  He was granted extensive work

636
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,200
release.  Meaning, now if this is

637
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,880
broken down and shown to you,

638
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,840
he could go to his office for 12 hours a day and six days a week.

639
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,640
Meaning, he could go to his office for six days in a row, working for

640
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,880
12 hours a day.

641
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
So only half the time meant that he would

642
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
remain in jail for half the time.  Half the time I

643
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,600
can do whatever I want to do outside.  He was also released after 13 months.  The

644
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,880
federal prosecutor at the time,

645
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,360
Alexander Acosta, later became

646
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
very close to Trump.  There were them earlier also.

647
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,520
He was later

648
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,960
appointed Secretary of Labor in the Trump Administration.  They

649
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,200
basically made a deal with the court on

650
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,480
behalf of Jeffrey Epstein that

651
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,880

652
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,799
he would be given extensive work release relief.  So,

653
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,159
it was he who did this.  It is because of this that

654
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:11,600
Acosta was able to provide such convenience to Astin.

655
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,919
This deal was called the Deal of the Century in the US.

656
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,240
Because this was a

657
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,039
deal that was completely in Astin's favor.

658
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,440
A convict of such a big crime is guilty of such a

659
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
big crime.

660
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,760
Following his conviction, Astin was placed on the New York

661
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Sex Offenders Register as a

662
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,919
Level 3 offender.

663
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,640
That means his name was registered there.  There was

664
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,760
a life long designation.

665
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Meaning, it can be called high risk reoffending

666
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,880
that this person is someone who

667
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,320
can do such an act again.  Well now

668
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,840
in December 2010 the name of Britain's Prince Andrew

669
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,679
comes to the fore.  That means,

670
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,640
you can see that this case of Astin kept on growing with time

671
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,799
till 2019.  How did Britain's

672
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,159
Prince Andrew's name come to light in 2010?

673
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,880
Prince

674
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,120
Andrew is reported to have known Epstein since 1999.  He

675
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
also used to travel in Lolata Express.  I used to go with him to his

676
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,240
different mansions and also to his island.

677
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,159
Everything that was wrong here

678
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,720
included Prince Andrew.  It was

679
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,039
reported that

680
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
the two were spotted together in New York's Central Park.

681
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,520
What explanation did Prince Andrew give on this

682
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,919
?  He said that he had gone to New York.  To

683
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,919

684
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,000
end his relationship, which is their friendship,

685
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,480
with Austin.  But it is wrong that he

686
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,120
stayed there at her house that day.

687
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,559
Stopped there.  Virginia Roberts comes to the fore here.

688
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,240
Virginia Roberts is the same Virgina

689
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,399
Guffrey about whom we told you

690
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,120
that she had accused

691
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,760
Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her

692
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,720
in childhood when she was underage and at

693
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,000
that time this was done as per the instructions of Astin.

694
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,760
Varjana Graff revealed that

695
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,880

696
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,000
Prince Andrew forced her to have a sexual relationship with him beginning in the 2000s when she was 17.

697
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,919

698
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, during this time I

699
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,760

700
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,320

701
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,399
also saw many photos of Victoria with Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old.  Prince

702
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,080
Andrew gave his statement on these photos and said

703
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,480
that he denied these allegations.  He

704
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,200
said that I do

705
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,480
not know at all when these photographs were taken in London

706
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,559
or I am not able to recollect them

707
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,399
because I was not there.  These kinds

708
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,399
of things outright denied it,

709
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,880
but there are photos, the proof is there.  So you

710
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,360
all can understand what happened.  In 2022,

711
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,080
Prince Andrew

712
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,080
finally settled a loss suit with Victoria Guiffre.

713
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,520
In this law suit, Gufrey was asked to

714
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,240
pay millions of rupees to the girl.  So this was a

715
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,080
settlement, this law suit, finally

716
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,799
money was given by Prince Andrew

717
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,880
because he was involved in this at one point.

718
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,120
Under pressure, he made the

719
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,120
full payment of millions of dollars.

720
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,360
After that, finally the matter was

721
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,240
resolved.  In 2016 another woman

722
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,200
filed a loss suit.  She said that Trump and

723
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,840
Estin sexually abused her when she was 13 years old.

724
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,640

725
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,200
She has been sexually assaulted.

726
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,399
Here for the first time Donald Trump's name came

727
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,880
up with Epson.  Well, this loss was

728
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,760
later withdrawn.  The claims

729
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,159
remained unproven.  Journalist Michael Wolf

730
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,159
released some of the recordings.

731
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,320
He said that in these recordings,

732
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,960
Epstein basically described Trump as his

733
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,960
closest friend.  Closest

734
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,039
friend for a decade said.  Meaning that he

735
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,919
said that this is my most special person who is

736
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,000
my friend and I live with him.

737
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,320
I listen to his words and agree with him.

738
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,960
All these things were told and even his

739
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,120
social activities and

740
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,799
his attitudes towards women were

741
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,200
discussed.  So these tapes are

742
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,200
still with a journalist and perhaps

743
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,360
all of them have been included in the Estin files.

744
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,919
So all these allegations kept on being made.

745
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,440
Along with Estin,

746
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,399

747
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,120
names of big people like Donald Trump and Bill Clinton started getting added.  And

748
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,120
these things are non-existent in the US.  In India,

749
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,600
you must have suddenly heard

750
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,520
what Elon Musk is saying that Donald Trump

751
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,440
's name is in the Austin file and who is Austin after all

752
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,840
?  Later it is revealed that he

753
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,480
was a child sex offender.  He used to traffic

754
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,240
children and under age girls.  So

755
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,159
after that, there is a bit of a shock as to

756
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,399
how Trump's name

757
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,640
could be associated with this.  But all this

758
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,120
is common for these people in the US.  He knows everything

759
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,159
about Trump.  Well, time

760
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,600
moved on.  2019 came.  On July 6, 2019,

761
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,679
Epson was arrested in New York on federal charges.

762
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,120
Finally,

763
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,200
he was arrested once again.  When

764
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,760
many activists said that

765
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,640
it cannot be left open like this.

766
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,600
This is a reoffender.  Meaning it is high risk to

767
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,320
leave it outside.  He was arrested.  He was arrested again for cases of sex

768
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,480
trafficking of minors in Florida and

769
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,799
New York.

770
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,200
So anyway,

771
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,760
all these things continued to happen with Epson from time to

772
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,679
time.  Further, names of many people continued to be associated with him.

773
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,159

774
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,080
Basically, whatever documents were

775
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,159
recovered from Estin's files were recovered at different times.

776
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,679
Many

777
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,679
things came out during his interrogation.  His documents

778
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,279
continued to be made.  All these are called Estin Files

779
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,039
which includes his black book that contained

780
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,200
all the people's numbers.

781
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,200
Which big people in the US was he in contact with?

782
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,960
His number is in it.  His

783
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,960
travel logs of Loyal Express, which was

784
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,279
his private jet, on which he used to

785
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,200
provide all this debauchery to people,

786
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,679

787
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,320
names of many big people of the US are included in his travel logs. Apart from this, the

788
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,000
people

789
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,760
whose photographs, videos, video tapes were found in his pen drives in his video tapes,

790
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,320

791
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,399
all of them together

792
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,919
make the Epstein Files.  Well

793
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:50,480
what happened to Epstein?  And understand this,

794
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,000
big times have come in 2019.  It was 6th July 2019.

795
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,000
Astin is

796
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,480
finally arrested on federal charges in New York.  For sex

797
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,799
trafficking of minors in Florida and in

798
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,399
New York.  That means, at these two

799
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,279
places he has done sex trafficking of

800
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,720
minor children.  This is why

801
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,240
he was arrested, because there were

802
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
many activists who were saying that

803
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,840
you cannot leave him open like this.   It

804
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,360
is necessary to arrest him.  Keeping him in jail

805
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,360
is necessary.  And finally he was put in jail.  He

806
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,279
was arrested.  Well, the

807
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,000
prosecutors here wanted to forfeit

808
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,919
his New York mansion.

809
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
Meaning that he

810
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,600
wanted that Estin had called many people to the place where some strange crimes had taken place.

811
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,840

812
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,559
what happened here?  So he wanted that

813
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,200
proper investigation should be done here.  Astin always

814
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,440
denied any wrongdoings he had done.  I kept

815
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,360
saying that I am not guilty and

816
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,919
I have not done anything wrong.  Whereas all the evidence was

817
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,240
there.  The bell deni continued to be his.

818
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,159
He remained in jail.

819
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,519
 

820
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,360
He had to stay in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.

821
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,799
At his court appearance on July 31, 2019, it was made

822
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,360
clear to Estien that he would

823
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,320
remain in prison for at least another year.  The trial will

824
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,240
not take place before summer 2020.   This

825
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,119
means that his next trial will

826
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,599
not take place before 2020.  Suddenly, it was seen

827
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,800
that on August 10, 2019, before the next trial could take place,

828
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,639
Astin was found dead in his prison cell.

829
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,280
He was murdered.

830
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,359
Medical examiners said it was a suicide.

831
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,839
When some medical examiners from the US

832
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,000
came and saw it, they said that it was

833
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,280
suicide by hanging.  That means he has committed

834
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,240
suicide by hanging himself.  But his lawyers

835
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,040
said in this ruling that

836
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,000
this is a disputed claim.  This

837
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,240
is wrong.  Because basically he has been killed.

838
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,800
Many such things came to light.  People

839
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,399
told many conspiracy theories.  It was said that

840
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,639
some big politicians like Astin, who are

841
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,359
currently the US Presidents

842
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,359
or have been former Presidents or some

843
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,680
such people, got him killed

844
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,520
so that their names do not come out.  There are many

845
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,560
big people around the world

846
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,560
who are afraid of ACEN's ACEN file.  This will ensure that no

847
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400

848
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,480
further information comes to light before his next trial.  The investigation should be

849
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,880
stopped completely and totally.

850
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Because of this, he was killed.  So, his

851
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,119
death was so mysterious that

852
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,680
suddenly on 10th August 2019,

853
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,680
he was found dead in his cell and the

854
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,240
doctors came and directly

855
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,800
told him without doing much investigation that it was a

856
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,160
suicide.  Estin has taken his own life.

857
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,119
Due to Astin's death, the criminal charges could

858
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,760
not be pursued.

859
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,800
Just look at August 29, 2019, and only

860
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,119
after 19 days, a judge

861
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,560
dismissed all the US charges against him.

862
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,480
After his death, his partner,

863
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,960
Ghislaine Maxwell, who was his long-term

864
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,520
companion, remained his girlfriend.  Ghislaine

865
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,599
Maxwell who was with him in all his past ventures.

866
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,640
He was also punished later.

867
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,480

868
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,560
Convicted on US federal charges in 2021.  He was also

869
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,440
involved in conspiracy of sex trafficking.

870
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,760
He was punished.  But the main point is

871
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,320
that the relationship between Estin and Trump was

872
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,000

873
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,200
said to be very close from 1980 to the late 1980s to 1990.  After that, everything

874
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,359
went well in the beginning of 2000, but

875
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,079
in 2004, distance started coming between them.

876
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,480
Both were seen together in all the social events in New York and Palm Beach.

877
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,560

878
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Trump's name appears frequently in Estin's Black Book and Flight Locks.

879
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,960
In 2017, it was

880
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,520
seen that Astin had two planes,

881
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,160
one Gulf Stream and one Boeing 727,

882
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,280
which was called Lolita Express,

883
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,359
in which he claimed that Miliana and

884
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,040
Donald Trump first met, that

885
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,480
is, Donald Trump's

886
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,160
first meeting with his wife happened

887
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,079
inside his Lolita Express.  It

888
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,720
happened inside his jet.  But the

889
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,440
two had a falling out after the 2004 Mansion Di Lametti deal.  In

890
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,440
a way, both of them got separated.  So,

891
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,359
all these things are in front of us.  Is

892
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,960
this just a relationship between Donald Trump and Estin or do

893
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,320
they have a whole history?  We told you this today.

894
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,720
Here we would like to inform you

895
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,960
that this is a topic where

896
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,200
people are neither talking about it openly

897
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,440
nor are they saying with certainty that

898
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,800
yes, Trump's name is in the FCC files.

899
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,640
But whatever proofs are there,

900
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,880
