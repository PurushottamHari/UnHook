The secrets of his dark world which people do not notice.  Normally people do not look at them.  But when the name of the President of America, which calls itself the most powerful country in the world, comes up in these dark secrets, then it is natural for the attention of the whole world to be drawn to such a case. And something similar happened recently.  Actually, tech billionaire Elon Musk, owner of SpaceX, Elon Musk, who earlier supported Donald Trump's campaign. After taking the oath, Donald Trump made Elon the head of one of his most essential departments, the Department of Government Efficiency.  But in May 2025, suddenly distance started coming between the two. Elon actually resigned from this position, and not just resigned, he also posted a tweet on Twitter in which Elon claimed that Trump's name is in the sealed Austin files and that is why these documents, secret documents, are being held.  These are not being exposed before the public. Now the question is, what exactly are these Estin Files?

So first of all let me tell you who is this Jeffrey Epstein ?  Many of you might have heard its name for the first time.  But it is quite notorious.  It is quite famous in the US.  Talk about Jeffrey Epstein's whole background.  Astin was born on January 20, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York.  His father, Simard, was a gardener with the NYC Parks Department, the New York City Parks Department. Used to do gardening work. Astin was a very average student during his schooling days in school. But it is said that he was very sharp in Maths. He also pursued further studies in Maths and Physics in the university. But one thing was different with him that he never had any degree.  He never completed his graduation.  Despite this, he was around 21 years old.  He did not even have a graduation degree.  Still in the month of September in 1974, Astin was appointed a teacher of Physics and Maths in the very renowned Dalton School of the US. Actually at that time Donald Barr was the head master of Dalton School. Donald Barr made many such hirings during that period in which people's degrees were not looked at. Epson was also one of them.  He is made a teacher here.  But his behavior was not right.  After some time, it was observed that Astin was seen behaving inappropriately with the under-age female students, who were girls, in the school. Allegations were made against him and in June 1976, i.e. after only 2 years, he was expelled from the school citing poor performance as the reason. A student after leaving Dalton was the father of a student when Epstein taught at Dalton.  He used to meet Epson many times.  Because of this he was very impressed with him.  Meaning, these could be useful to him for the work he had to do next. What Effstein did was he started meeting with him, and he was so impressed with Effstein that he connected him with a senior partner at Bear Stearns, a Wall Street investment bank. Effstein met Jeffrey Effstein, a teacher when he was just 23 years old.   I left from here after finishing my teaching job. Esten joined Beardstown's investment bank in 1976. He started working here as a junior level assistant.  Working under a floor trader, Ebstein was so quick at work. Almost 4 years passed from here.  By 1980, he worked as a junior assistant under the same floor trader under whom he worked as a Lower Lower Jun Lower. Within 4 years, he becomes his partner under him.  But it was always seen that whenever Jeffrey Effstein used to do any work and you will come to know this further, he was always involved in some wrong activity and he did the same here as well because of which he spent almost 5 years in the next year i.e. here in Bear Stearns. In 1981, Astin was fired from Bear Sterns due to regulatory deregulation. Regulation Devaluation, actually let me tell you here that he was working in the trading firm, basically in the investment bank, he had started giving investment tips to people apart from the bank or he had started doing the transactions of taking money from them.  That means here also he had got involved in wrong activities. Well, from here he was removed from the beer stun as well.  It was August 1981 of this year. Astin formed his own company called Intercontinental Asset Group ( IAG).  He formed his own company with this name. What this company basically did was to recover funds from their clients.  Mainly he used to keep and recruit many people here as fund recovery agents. After forming this company, he started telling his friends and people around him that he actually recovers embezzled funds from rich people in the US for the government.  Meaning, he basically works for them and sometimes he says things that are hard to believe.  Many times he told his friends and close ones, who were colleagues, that he was an intelligence agent of the CIA.  Meaning he is a spy agent. Someone gave the task to the person working here.  He used to talk like this. He was also found to be carrying a fake Austrian passport in 1980, which stated his address as that of a resident of Saudi Arabia. Now where did he get this from?  This was also a secret.  There are many secrets associated with Efstein. You will know more about it later.  Well during this time, he got a very big deal when he became his own company.  How he came in contact with this person is also a mystery till today because during this time one of his biggest clients was Adnan Khashoggi, if you all know Adnan Khashoggi is a very famous arms dealer, a very big arms dealer, Epstein had managed Khashoggi's assets worth more than 1 billion dollars through his firm and because of this Epstein had a lot of money, and money started coming to him.  Now when this huge amount of money started coming to Austin, since he was already involved in wrong activities, now it started going in that direction.  Estin bought a Florida mansion with all the money. Bought a home in New Mexico. Bought a very big private home in New York.  Meanwhile, he started meeting different celebrities at all these places.   I started meeting artists, politicians and leaders.  Basically he had started socializing himself now that he was now the owner of a very big company and especially a company which had contacts with people like Adnan Khachkhi. He used to tell many people that I am a CIA agent, hence I have work with many governments as well. These were all the things.  Now another turning point was about to come in his life from here.  Was running my own company.  But despite this, it started working with people again.  The year 1987 arrives.  In 1987, Effstein met Stefan Hoffenberg. Who actually introduced Effstein to Stefan Hoffenberg?  You will be surprised to hear this. Former US Attorney General John Mitchell introduced Epstein to Hoffenberg.  Hoffenberg brought Epson into his company, basically both of them started working for Hoffenberg's company.  Estin founded Tower Financial Corporation.  In this company, Astin started working as a consultant.   The company used to collect depth from hospitals, banks, phone companies and it started working very closely with Hoffenberg because it was a very big company. Tower Financial was very famous in the US.  Epson of Hoffenberg traveled with him in his private jet.   I used to go with him everywhere.  His lifestyle also changed during this time considering Hoffenberg.  But in 1989, Epstein suddenly left the company.  In fact, here too he had secretly started some different work, after which he was going to leave Hoffenberg alone.  He was a very clever, very smart man. What he had done just a year earlier was work for Hoffenberg in 1988 when he was continuing. Epstein had secretly set up his own financial management firm called J jostin@ company. What happened in 1993 was that he left the company a year earlier, in 1993, finally an investigation was conducted on Tower Financial, this entire company and one of its businesses was exposed, and then it was revealed that he was running a very big Ponzi scam in the US. Ponzi schemes are scams, many of them are caught in India as well many times.  In this, all the overall investors of the US suffered a loss of around 450 million dollars.  It was a big scam. When all these documents reached the court, punishment was announced against Hoffenberg. Hoffenberg claimed that Epsin was deeply involved in the scheme along with me.  I am not the only culprit. But because Epstein knew all of this when he left the company.  He left the company in 1989.  They formed their own company in 88, and till this time these people were doing all this fraudulent work.  But no charges were filed against Astin here because he had left the company a year ago. Cephali had left.  Now a very big turn was about to come in his life because he had now set his next target.

And there was a very big person from the US. Astin met Leslie Waxner in 1986 while he was working with Hoffenberg. Leslie Waxner You all might know Victoria's Secret, you might have heard the name, Chairman and CEO of Victoria's Secret, Leslie Waxner was introduced to Epson by someone who knew him.  Just a year later, in 1987, Epstein also became a financial advisor to Wexner.  You should think about it that on one hand, it is also creating its own companies.  On the other hand, he becomes his right hand man with Waxner of Victoria's Secret.  He became one of his advisors. By 1991 he had thus brought Waxner under his control.  He had made a proper clientele and in a way Waxner had given full power to Astin.  Now he could have paid what the attorney for Victoria's Secrets to Waxner.  That means that Waxner of that company had in a way given him the power of attorney. What could I do after fst?  I could have signed cheques on his behalf.  I could buy and sell properties and hire people. He used to borrow money from anyone in the name of Waxner.  In the name of Leslie Waxner. Astein Waxner's Yacht is very famous.  In fact it is called the largest corporate yacht. Limitless is its name.  He managed projects such as construction for Leslie Wexner. This earned Efstein millions of dollars. It is said that he earned a lot of money and wealth here.  He was not limited to this only with all these works.  Was always involved in wrong things.  The attitude he had, especially towards females, his perspective was very wrong. He regularly attended the Victoria's Secret fashion shows that were held here.  He used to host the models who were there in his house in New York.  I used to call him there.  He used to handle aspiring models in a wrong manner to get them work in the company. Epstein continued doing all these things here.  These were Astein's clients, Waxner basically became his clients later on, so his company would manage all of their work. This is the only well known billionaire client of Abstein, till date his name has been linked with Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, this has come out in the files, this has come out later in the investigation but till now Leslie Waxner was one of his official clients.  Well, here comes 1996.  In 1996, Epson renamed his firm Financial Trust Company and based it in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Why was this done? Because now the time had come to avoid taxes.   I was doing all the wrong things.  It was also necessary to do this. He basically called this St. Thomas an offshore tax haven for tax advantages. This means that the federal income tax there is reduced by 90%. So it started working here. Made my base there.  Around this time, Efstein installed hidden cameras in both his home in the Virgin Islands as well as the mansion he purchased in New York. He had installed hidden cameras in such hidden places that he could alert people from outside who were in his social circle, which included politicians, big people and film stars.  He used to call all of them here and whatever activities they did, sexual activities, he used to call some girls there and then he used to record them and later he used to find out why he had done this so that he could blackmail them in future.  From here it started showing its true colours. After going to such a big place and earning so much money, he got involved in all these jobs. In this, Austin was not alone.  He was joined by his long-term girlfriend and companion Ghislaine Maxwell. Ghislaine remained with Maxwell Epson for a very long time, until the very end, until his death. He also had a role.  What did Epsino and Maxwell do?  Young girls were recruited here and according to a source, which is mentioned in the middle of this report.  He says that Apsino videotaped everyone on Maxwell Island.  Whichever guest came to them, whatever people from their social circle came, they used to video tape them all.  They used to make their video tapes and these people kept it as their insurance policy so that they could blackmail them in the future.  Well, Epson's social circle was also very big and kept growing.  Now there were celebrities, politicians and powerful people in it.  He was constantly seen with all of them. And all these things are not just in the documents.  There are videos of them, there are photos of them. All things come to light. Now in the 1990s and early 2000s, our main character is Donald Trump. Epstein was seen frequently with Donald Trump from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Both of them were very close. Both of them were frequently seen at social events in New York and Palm Beach. Clicking photos together, dancing, having drinks.  Mara Lago party in 1992, Mara Lago is basically a corporate, you can call it a club.  The owner of Mara Lago is currently also Donald Trump. Estin was also invited to US President Mar Lago's party and was seen with Donald Trump. NBC News also played it extensively in a 1992 videotape. When this whole case of the Astin file happened, when the entire investigation was focused on Astin.  It was then played and showed Trump and Estin at the party along with dancers. In 2002, Trump told New York magazine about Epson, "I've known Jeff (Jeffrey Epstein) because his name was I've known Jeff for 15 years." This is a statement by Donald Trump. I have known Jeffrey Epstein for a recorded 15 years.  He is a terrific guy.  He is a lot of fun to be with and it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side. This is a statement by Donald Trump.  And by seeing this you can clearly understand that Astin was an offender of child sex trafficking. He was also punished for this crime. And the allegation made by Esten against Donald Trump seems to be that Donald Trump used to visit all his houses and the under-age girls who were targeted by Absin and brought here to entertain all these big people, Donald Trump and some big people of the US were also involved in it.   I will tell you about all this further. Well apart from that let me tell you what basically are the Estin files? First of all, this is a statement from Donald Trump in the Epson file.  The second thing is his black book which contains contact numbers of many important people. Estin's black book contains multiple contact numbers for Trump.   There are addresses.  Addresses where Trump previously lived.  lived there before that.  These are all the addresses.  This is the address of Trump's office.  This is the home address.  The address of Maral Aago is also here in front. All the contact numbers of Trump are in it.   In fact, his wife's contact number is also there in his black book. That of Jeffrey Epstein was also found there.   To be viewed according to flight locks. Seen as per flight locks. Why are flight locks being looked at now? Because Jeffery Epson had his own private jet which he called the Lolata Express.  It is said that Trump traveled in Epstein's private jet, the Lolita Express, which was basically a Boeing plane that he named, at least seven times between 1993 and 1997. Trump traveled in it sometimes with his family, sometimes with family members and sometimes alone. But there is no specific public record yet that Trump visited any of Epstein's private islands, like Little St. John's, St. James, or whether Trump visited his private island, called Epinal Island. No such thing has been mentioned here. Well, know about Jeffrey Epstein's Lolata Express. This is the nickname he had given to his Boeing 7 to 7 jet. This jet called Lolata Express was used to transport high profile individuals. Under age girls were kept in this plane and these people were taken to private properties which included private properties in New York. Epstein has private properties in Palm Beach and on Vergennes Islands in the US, they were taken there and later videotaped, which those people were not aware of because Epstein was going to blackmail them later, but these people came in contact with Epstein and stayed with him so that they get an opportunity to do all these things. It is said that Trump's name also comes up in this.  Well, this name was basically Lalita Express, it is said that it came from Vladimir Navko's novel, his novel was Lalita in which a man's obsession for a young girl is shown, so from there he selected this name and basically all the evidence is in front of him that Astin was involved in trafficking of young girls, child sex trafficking and he lived with all these people.  Well, here comes 2002. In 2002, the name of another very important person comes to light.  Epstein had planned a trip to Africa with former US President Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker and he took them all there in his private jet, the Laulalitha Express.  It is said about his flight jet that Bill Clinton has made around 26 trips in it. Donald Trump has travelled in this Lalita Express at least seven times to different places. Prince Andrew's name comes up.  And this came to light not only in the way that the records that he filed also revealed their victims.  Virginia Gafari, a female who was an under-teen age girl at the time.  He claimed that this jet belonged to Effstein and he was also taken there at that time.  He said that he has seen Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Donald Trump etc. there.  So inside that jet, girls were abused inside this jet. It had a lavish interior from inside.  There used to be a bedroom inside that jet.  There were red velvet seats.  There were mirrors around.  There used to be mirror walls.  Meaning, inside a jet, and Asten used to describe it as a playground. Whenever these people talked to him, they used to say that this is not a jet, this Lolata Express is our playground.  You can imagine the mentality of powerful and rich people and the dark world of these people which is visible to you here.  Well the very next year in 2003, Estin tried to buy what you all know as New York magazine with Harvey Winston but that bit didn't work out.  I failed.  This year he donated $30 million to Harvard University. Estein dated Eva Andersson, the winner of Miss Sweden that same year. He dated many different Miss World, Miss Universe, actresses and models but never married anyone.  But now things were going to get worse for Effstein too. Something that happened is that it is told that in 2004, Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump made a deal for a house in Palm Beach which was said to be named Mansion Di Lamiti, Mansion Di Lamiti, both wanted to buy it but due to its purchase, a fight broke out between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, after this Epstein's downfall started and suddenly, after the fight with Donald Trump, it was seen that in the very next year 2005, suddenly the FBI started the investigation of child sex trafficking against Epstein. It started when the parents of a 14 year old girl in Palm Beach, Florida suddenly approached the police.  They tell him that Estin has molested his daughter at his Palm Beach home.  When the police saw all these things , they searched his house and conducted a search operation. Photos of girls were found there because Estien was involved in all those things but along with him, these big high profile people were also present in it, whose names have not been revealed properly till date, due to which Elon Musk has raised questions on Trump and has directly said that Trump's name is included in it in Pepstin's files, that is why it is not being disclosed. Well, when the police reached here, the police officers saw that about 36 girls were identified. Many of them were girls below 14 years of age. Who was sexually abused by Estin here.  And it was later revealed that this person was at the peak of his career since 1996. It was basically child sex trafficking inside the US.  Big people were involved in it.  So Estin was finally caught. In 2008, Epson pleaded guilty in Florida state court.  But still he was sentenced to only 18 months in jail. With extensive work release.  I mean, this was such a serious case.  Still he does n't know what kind of policies they have, their legal policies here in the US.  He was granted extensive work release.  Meaning, now if this is broken down and shown to you, he could go to his office for 12 hours a day and six days a week. Meaning, he could go to his office for six days in a row, working for 12 hours a day. So only half the time meant that he would remain in jail for half the time.  Half the time I can do whatever I want to do outside.  He was also released after 13 months.  The federal prosecutor at the time, Alexander Acosta, later became very close to Trump.  There were them earlier also. He was later appointed Secretary of Labor in the Trump Administration.  They basically made a deal with the court on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein that he would be given extensive work release relief.  So, it was he who did this.  It is because of this that Acosta was able to provide such convenience to Astin. This deal was called the Deal of the Century in the US. Because this was a deal that was completely in Astin's favor. A convict of such a big crime is guilty of such a big crime. Following his conviction, Astin was placed on the New York Sex Offenders Register as a Level 3 offender. That means his name was registered there.  There was a life long designation. Meaning, it can be called high risk reoffending that this person is someone who can do such an act again.  Well now in December 2010 the name of Britain's Prince Andrew comes to the fore.  That means, you can see that this case of Astin kept on growing with time till 2019.  How did Britain's Prince Andrew's name come to light in 2010? Prince Andrew is reported to have known Epstein since 1999.  He also used to travel in Lolata Express.  I used to go with him to his different mansions and also to his island. Everything that was wrong here included Prince Andrew.  It was reported that the two were spotted together in New York's Central Park. What explanation did Prince Andrew give on this ?  He said that he had gone to New York.  To end his relationship, which is their friendship, with Austin.  But it is wrong that he stayed there at her house that day. Stopped there.  Virginia Roberts comes to the fore here. Virginia Roberts is the same Virgina Guffrey about whom we told you that she had accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her in childhood when she was underage and at that time this was done as per the instructions of Astin. Varjana Graff revealed that Prince Andrew forced her to have a sexual relationship with him beginning in the 2000s when she was 17. Well, during this time I also saw many photos of Victoria with Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old.  Prince Andrew gave his statement on these photos and said that he denied these allegations.  He said that I do not know at all when these photographs were taken in London or I am not able to recollect them because I was not there.  These kinds of things outright denied it, but there are photos, the proof is there.  So you all can understand what happened.  In 2022, Prince Andrew finally settled a loss suit with Victoria Guiffre. In this law suit, Gufrey was asked to pay millions of rupees to the girl.  So this was a settlement, this law suit, finally money was given by Prince Andrew because he was involved in this at one point. Under pressure, he made the full payment of millions of dollars. After that, finally the matter was resolved.  In 2016 another woman filed a loss suit.  She said that Trump and Estin sexually abused her when she was 13 years old. She has been sexually assaulted. Here for the first time Donald Trump's name came up with Epson.  Well, this loss was later withdrawn.  The claims remained unproven.  Journalist Michael Wolf released some of the recordings. He said that in these recordings, Epstein basically described Trump as his closest friend.  Closest friend for a decade said.  Meaning that he said that this is my most special person who is my friend and I live with him. I listen to his words and agree with him. All these things were told and even his social activities and his attitudes towards women were discussed.  So these tapes are still with a journalist and perhaps all of them have been included in the Estin files. So all these allegations kept on being made. Along with Estin, names of big people like Donald Trump and Bill Clinton started getting added.  And these things are non-existent in the US.  In India, you must have suddenly heard what Elon Musk is saying that Donald Trump 's name is in the Austin file and who is Austin after all ?  Later it is revealed that he was a child sex offender.  He used to traffic children and under age girls.  So after that, there is a bit of a shock as to how Trump's name could be associated with this.  But all this is common for these people in the US.  He knows everything about Trump.  Well, time moved on.  2019 came.  On July 6, 2019, Epson was arrested in New York on federal charges. Finally, he was arrested once again.  When many activists said that it cannot be left open like this. This is a reoffender.  Meaning it is high risk to leave it outside.  He was arrested.  He was arrested again for cases of sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. So anyway, all these things continued to happen with Epson from time to time.  Further, names of many people continued to be associated with him. Basically, whatever documents were recovered from Estin's files were recovered at different times. Many things came out during his interrogation.  His documents continued to be made.  All these are called Estin Files which includes his black book that contained all the people's numbers. Which big people in the US was he in contact with? His number is in it.  His travel logs of Loyal Express, which was his private jet, on which he used to provide all this debauchery to people, names of many big people of the US are included in his travel logs. Apart from this, the people whose photographs, videos, video tapes were found in his pen drives in his video tapes, all of them together make the Epstein Files.  Well what happened to Epstein?  And understand this, big times have come in 2019.  It was 6th July 2019. Astin is finally arrested on federal charges in New York.  For sex trafficking of minors in Florida and in New York.  That means, at these two places he has done sex trafficking of minor children.  This is why he was arrested, because there were many activists who were saying that you cannot leave him open like this.   It is necessary to arrest him.  Keeping him in jail is necessary.  And finally he was put in jail.  He was arrested.  Well, the prosecutors here wanted to forfeit his New York mansion. Meaning that he wanted that Estin had called many people to the place where some strange crimes had taken place. what happened here?  So he wanted that proper investigation should be done here.  Astin always denied any wrongdoings he had done.  I kept saying that I am not guilty and I have not done anything wrong.  Whereas all the evidence was there.  The bell deni continued to be his. He remained in jail. He had to stay in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. At his court appearance on July 31, 2019, it was made clear to Estien that he would remain in prison for at least another year.  The trial will not take place before summer 2020.   This means that his next trial will not take place before 2020.  Suddenly, it was seen that on August 10, 2019, before the next trial could take place, Astin was found dead in his prison cell. He was murdered. Medical examiners said it was a suicide. When some medical examiners from the US came and saw it, they said that it was suicide by hanging.  That means he has committed suicide by hanging himself.  But his lawyers said in this ruling that this is a disputed claim.  This is wrong.  Because basically he has been killed. Many such things came to light.  People told many conspiracy theories.  It was said that some big politicians like Astin, who are currently the US Presidents or have been former Presidents or some such people, got him killed so that their names do not come out.  There are many big people around the world who are afraid of ACEN's ACEN file.  This will ensure that no further information comes to light before his next trial.  The investigation should be stopped completely and totally. Because of this, he was killed.  So, his death was so mysterious that suddenly on 10th August 2019, he was found dead in his cell and the doctors came and directly told him without doing much investigation that it was a suicide.  Estin has taken his own life. Due to Astin's death, the criminal charges could not be pursued. Just look at August 29, 2019, and only after 19 days, a judge dismissed all the US charges against him. After his death, his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was his long-term companion, remained his girlfriend.  Ghislaine Maxwell who was with him in all his past ventures. He was also punished later. Convicted on US federal charges in 2021.  He was also involved in conspiracy of sex trafficking. He was punished.  But the main point is that the relationship between Estin and Trump was said to be very close from 1980 to the late 1980s to 1990.  After that, everything went well in the beginning of 2000, but in 2004, distance started coming between them. Both were seen together in all the social events in New York and Palm Beach. Trump's name appears frequently in Estin's Black Book and Flight Locks. In 2017, it was seen that Astin had two planes, one Gulf Stream and one Boeing 727, which was called Lolita Express, in which he claimed that Miliana and Donald Trump first met, that is, Donald Trump's first meeting with his wife happened inside his Lolita Express.  It happened inside his jet.  But the two had a falling out after the 2004 Mansion Di Lametti deal.  In a way, both of them got separated.  So, all these things are in front of us.  Is this just a relationship between Donald Trump and Estin or do they have a whole history?  We told you this today. Here we would like to inform you that this is a topic where people are neither talking about it openly nor are they saying with certainty that yes, Trump's name is in the FCC files.
