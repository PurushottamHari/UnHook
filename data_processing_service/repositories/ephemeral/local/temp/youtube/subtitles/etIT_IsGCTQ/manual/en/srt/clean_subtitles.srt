He took a false oath on the Quran and deceived the Balochs and called them down and captured them.  And this is where Jinnah was made the legal advisor of Kalat and it proved so costly that he got angry because natural gas was extracted from Balochistan but was sent to Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.  How a single 80 year old Baloch Nawab Nauroz Khan single-handedly created a storm in the entire area. But Raja Ranjit Singh was adamant that no army could just step on our land like that.  The reserve of 42 million tonnes was found in Balochistan but China took away 50% of its profit and the Balochs got only 2% of its profit.  There is only one Baloch community in the whole world whose leaders come forward and fight along with their children.  Decisions are not taken sitting in expensive hotels. Neither bow nor sell, just fight, not Sepak, Baloch want their rights, now see the people of Balochistan have been raising their voice for their rights and identity. But this voice does not reach the global level with clarity and impact. Sometimes political noise, sometimes media silence and sometimes lack of framing does not allow this issue to find a place in the world's narrative. And this is not just about Balochistan, it is about every person who has something important to say but is stopped due to lack of tools. So AI is not just a tech revolution.

Economy, military rule, political drama, everything. But in the current time, the situation has become such that the question has now reached the survival of Pakistan.  Right now, pick up any newspaper and in Pakistan, the only discussion going on everywhere is about the problem of Balochistan. And the way Balochistan is creating its own army etc. You will get to hear this name more in the times to come.   But now the question is what kind of problem arose within Pakistan that its Balochistan province started talking about separating from Pakistan and forming its own country.  These people are attacking the Pakistan Army every day. Just a few days ago you might have seen that a train was hijacked and people were ready to sacrifice their lives. But now we cannot live with Pakistan.  We were linked with deception.  Now we have to create our own separate country Balochistan again.  Now look, the word Balochistan, even though it is coming more in the news now, but this problem is a very old problem and many such things have happened in the past due to which the problem has become so big today. And to understand this whole game, we will have to go back a bit.  And before that let me tell you one thing.  See, this Pakistan is mainly divided into four provinces. This is Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa.   It shares its border with Afghanistan.  Then this is Punjab.  It has a border with India. This is the main province of Pakistan. All the army generals you see come from here. And the province of Punjab enjoys the maximum resources. This here, this is Sindh.  It also shares its border with India.  And this is Balochistan which shares its border with Iran and Afghanistan.  So see, this area of ​​Balochistan, in the 12th century, there was really no boundary etc. of this area and neither was this area named Balochistan anywhere.  In this map, you are seeing the pink area, here small Baloch tribes used to live in different areas.  Like Makran Tribe, Kachi Tribe, Sistan Tribe, Turbat Tribe.  There was no political system here.  Every tribe had its own chieftain.  And like this different tribes were living in this area.  And if you look at this map carefully, then at that time these tribes had occupied small pieces of land and were living in the areas near the border of today's Iran and Afghanistan. Because at that time the border was not clearly decided.  Now what happens is that when these tribes were living in this area, a man named Mir Jalal Khan was very famous among them.  So at this particular time Mir Jalal said that look, it is better for us to live together rather than living separately, so that if any trouble arises, we will be united and will be able to help each other. So what did Mir Jalal do?  I went and talked to 44 tribes in this area, brought them all together and formed an alliance.  This was the first time these tribes united within this area. They did not create a new country but rather created a model in which everything was going on like before.  The chieftains were managing their tribes in the same way as they used to do earlier.  The only difference was that 44 tribes had decided to unite by forming an alliance which was being led by Mir Jalal. And the decision to form this alliance, the foundation for creating Balochistan was laid at this time. That is why you will see that even today people consider Mir Jalal Khan as the founding father of the Baloch community.  You can understand their importance from the children of Mir Jalal Khan like Rind, Lashari, Koraie, Bibi Jato.  Today, there are many such areas in Balochistan which are named after their children. Like Rindabad Village, Kurai Village, Jatoi City.  All these are derived from the names of his children. Now see, this model which was made, has been working for a long time. After this, by the time the 15th century came, after Mir Jalal, Mir Chakar Rin also came. He did the same thing and organised it further and kept all the tribes united. And at that time, in this area, people were living in semi-organised structures. At that time people knew this area not as Balochistan but by the name of Rin Lashari Union. Now what happens is that this tribe was living together.  But when the year 1666 came, the Safavid Empire was becoming very big in Iran.  If you look on the other side, you had a Mughal umpire.  So because these two big umpires were next to each other.  Due to this, the Baloch tribes who were living here were under a lot of pressure from time to time. So because of all the pressure that was developing on them, they felt that they needed to create a system to protect themselves. He observed the empires around him to see how they were working.  Getting inspired from him, I also started creating a central authority.  Just like the rest of the empires were working. Started building a structure similar to that. So all these tribes were living in this area.  Among all these tribes, there was another tribe whose name was Ahmed Jai Brah Tribe.  In this map, the area which you are seeing by the name Kalat, this tribe was in this area.  And there was a man in this tribe named Mir Ahmed Khan.  So when the talk of forming a central authority was going on, all the tribes together made Mir Ahmed Khan the Khan of Kalad.  Now what is this Khan of Kalad?  Like the king is the head of the state.  In the same way they named him Khan of Kalad, meaning he will lead. Now see, one thing is worth keeping in mind here that all these tribes had made Mir Ahmed Khan the Khan of Kalat. But the chieftains of some tribes said that we are accepting you as the Khan of Kalat but we will manage our tribe's and our area ourselves. So because of this, the dark green area that you can see in the map was being directly ruled by the Khan of Kalat i.e. Mir Ahmed and the light green area was indirectly ruled by the Khan of Kalat and this entire green area, whether it is light green or dark green, was called the Khanate of Kalat. Later on, this Khanate of Kalat would become Balochistan.  So whenever there is talk of Kalat State or Khanate of Kalat, then you should understand that this entire light and dark green area is being talked about.  So when this Khanate of Kalat became a proper system, then the entire setup of law, trade, military was made and then this system continued for a long time and then gradually when the year 1749 came and after Mir Ahmed Khan, his grandson Mir Nasir Khan became the Khan of Kalat.  The Baloch consider this time as the golden period.   As soon as Nasir Khan came, he created a good political system in the entire Khanate of Kalat. He set up the Baloch Army which included 25,000 soldiers.  Kept 1000 camels in it.  Look, remember this thing, I will also repeat it that there were many tribes in the Khanate of Kalat.  Who had their own separate systems.  Their chiefs used to control them.  But all this was going on under the Khan of Kalat.  So what did the Khan of Kalat do?  The chiefs of all the Baloch tribes of this area were called and a council system was created so that if any decision was to be taken, everyone could agree on it.  This council used to decide everything.  The Council worked in the same manner as the Parliament works. Now after this comes the year 1830 and with the arrival of this year the real problems started.  By this time the British had arrived.  He was ruling over his undivided India. But at the same time, there was a geopolitical battle going on between the British and Russia, which was also called The Great Game. So this area of ​​Central Asia which you are seeing, which includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, this entire Central Asia was considered a very important area. All the important trade routes, silk route, economic activities, everything happened from here.  And if there was presence of any empire and military in this Central Asia, then it would have provided a huge strategic advantage.  So what Russia did was that it gradually expanded its empire by occupying Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan in Central Asia.  And along with this, they were also moving towards Afghanistan. For this, he also sent his diplomat Captain Ivan to Afghanistan in the year 1837.  My friend Mohammad Khan, who was the ruler of Afghanistan at that time, had started talking to him.  Now, when it was entering Russia or Afghanistan, the British who were sitting on India got worried.   The British who were ruling India considered India to be a very important part of their country because there were a lot of resources here and the way Russia was growing and then slowly it was entering into Afghanistan as well.  There was a strong possibility that it would reach the border of India and the British and Russia did not want to fight among themselves.  So now from here the Britishers started using their brains. He wondered if there should be a buffer zone between India and Russia. If this does not happen then a big problem will arise. And whichever country is in this buffer zone should act according to our wishes.  And if this is done then Russia will not be able to reach India. So for this the British had made a plan that we will attack Afghanistan before Russia and remove the ruler of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad Khan and make our puppet ruler Shah Shuja the ruler of Afghanistan.  This would result in the British having more control over Afghanistan than Russia. He had influence.  Now if they wanted to attack Afghanistan and install their ruler there then the British would have to send their army from India to Afghanistan and for that they would need a route.  So one route from here was the Northern Route through Peshawar and Khyber pass.  But there was a Sikh umpire at that time.  So when the British were asking to withdraw their army from this area, then Raja Ranjit Singh ji was the Sikh emperor. He clearly refused, saying that the British Army will not make such a path through our land.  So when the option of the Sikh umpire did not seem right for the British, then their eyes fell on the Khaniyat of Kalat which was also known as the Kalat State, at that time some people of the British made a plan that they will reach Afghanistan from India via Bolan Pass, Kota Chaman and in between, this area of ​​Balochistan around Bolan Pass, Kota Chaman, I am calling it Balochistan now, at that time was not the Balochistan area. What did the British do for this area, they sent their diplomat Alexander Bernies to the then Khan of Kalat Mehrab Khan so that after taking permission etc. and agreement etc., they could make arrangements to leave from here. Basically the British were very powerful.  He had to leave this area.  So he wanted proper control over this area. So for this he first made a deal with the Khan of Kalat.  We told them that we will support you financially and you let us use this area.  Now the Khan of Kalat was also helpless.  He accepted this deal.  Now after this, the year 1839 was the time when the British had to use the Kalat State area to transport their army to Afghanistan for attack.  Now even though the British had signed an agreement with the Khan of Kalat that they would leave this area. But the local people of this area were not happy with this thing even though they had signed with Khan of Kala.  He said that since it is our land, we will not let it go like this. So, going against the agreement made by Khan of Kalat, they launched small attacks on the British Army. Now when these attacks happened, the British felt that this Mehrab Khan was not able to stop his people from attacking. And he also had a doubt that maybe Mehrab Khan is not stopping him intentionally. He may want such attacks to continue. Along with this, there was also a doubt on Mehrab Khan that perhaps he had some links with Afghanistan too. So overall the British felt that even though Mehrab Khan had signed the agreement.  But there is a possibility that he himself is getting attacked from behind. So the British, in anger, attacked the Kalat State in November 1839 and killed Mehrab Khan. Mehrab Khan's opponent, Shahnawaz Khan, was made the Khan of Kalat, who worked according to the British. Now after this the British understood that if they wanted to protect this entire area from Russia and create a buffer zone, then this region of Kalat State would have to be kept under their control.  The British were not interested in taking over the entire Kalat State because at that time there was vacant land far and wide.  There were not that many resources and to take over any land one had to deploy a lot of army etc. So he was not interested in this thing. So what did they do?  The Kalat State was divided into two parts. One part was this region, the Pink area of ​​Quetta, Bolan Pass, Chaman, Chagai. This area was directly controlled by the British with the help of their military.  And the rest of the area was controlled indirectly.  He placed a ruler there who would run things according to his wishes and gave financial support from time to time so that the inside area also remained under control.  But the British never colonised the Kalat State the way they had colonised India.  So the British created their influence in Afghanistan by attacking and negotiating and using different tactics, and in a similar way they increased their influence in Iran.  The British who wanted to create a buffer zone between Russia and India, did it very easily. And while creating this buffer zone, they also started marking the borders of Kalat State, meaning they started officially registering the borders because earlier there were no real borders, there were frontiers, there used to be empty areas far and wide. So when the British started creating the borders of Kalat State, a large area near the borders of Kalat State which touched the borders of Iran and Afghanistan was given to Iran and Afghanistan through the Gold Mines Line Agreement and sometimes through the Treaty of Gandamark, so that Iran and Afghanistan remain happy and stay away from the influence of Russia. And a few days after doing all this, they also signed an official treaty with Kalat State on the 8th of December 1876 so that everything remains on paper, which is called the Treaty of Kalat. These are some of his terms.  Article three of this treaty is very important. Now it will be revealed what the meaning of this article is. Now after this, the British took the foreign policy etc. of the Kalat State under their control and the internal matters on daily basis were given to the Khan of Kalad and told him to handle the internal matters himself. After taking over the foreign policy, Russia lost complete control over this area. In return, the British initially gave ₹000 per year to the Kalat State and then increased it to ₹1 lakh.  Now look, look at the map once again from here.   The British retained the pink area using their military power. This green area was given to the Khan of Kalat to indirectly rule.  And then after this, in the year 1887, this pink area which was under the control of the British was also indirectly taken under British control on paper.  And when it was put on paper through lease, it was named British Balochistan.  And in this way the name Balochistan was used officially for the first time.  The remaining Given Area was still known as Kalat State.  Khanate of Art.  Now see, for the next 50-60 years, no major event took place and then the time for the British to leave came near, undivided India had to be divided and Pakistan was to be formed, so at the same time, the Khan of Kalat, Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, thought that now that the British are leaving, we were not colonized by the British, so we will now become an independent country. Khan of Kalat was confident about this matter because it was legally valid also.  First of all, according to Article 3 of the official treaty that was signed between the British and the Kalat State in the year 1876, the British had officially accepted on paper that the Kalat State is not a British area but an independent state and the area that the British had taken, which they call British Balochistan, was also taken under an agreement and lease.  That means like someone lives on rent.  Along with this, in the year 1886, the British Administration officially mentioned in its official report that Khan of Kalad was an independent ruler who was connected with the British through a treaty.  This thing was from the mansion.  And in the year 1877, Khan of Kalat Khudadad Khan was summoned in the Delhi Imperial Assembly as an independent king. Meaning that the British themselves believed that Kalat State was an independent state.  So legally the British could not say at any stage that the Kalat State was a part of the British Empire.  And if the British had said this, they would have faced a lot of problems internationally too.  But on the other hand, if Kalat State had become an independent country, then the British as well as the US feared that Kalat State was very weak.  It may happen that Russia's influence increases again in this area. And this area was very important strategically.  And if this Kalat State joins with Pakistan, then the whole area becomes strong and Russia's influence cannot increase.  Because the British had a very good influence on Pakistan.  So, it was very important for the British that if the Kalat State joins Pakistan instead of becoming independent, it would be more in their favour.  So now from here a game begins to deal with this complex situation in which the Khan of Art gets trapped.  What happened was that when the British were leaving undivided India, there were two concerned parties, India and Pakistan, that is, Jinnah's Muslim League and Nehruji's Congress, to claim this undivided India.  These two parties had to talk among themselves and decide who would get how much share of this undivided India.  But if it is legally proved that this Kalat State is not a part of the British Empire. This was taken by the British Empire for some time through a lease only, for which the British used to pay money annually. So after the British left, the claims of India and Pakistan on the Kalat State would have ended.  And Pakistan had decided that before the British left, this Kalat State should somehow prove to be an independent state. Because as soon as Kalat State is proved to be an independent state, then India's claim on Kalat State will end and later whenever Pakistan wants, it can take Kalat State under its control. Now your question would be that how was Pakistan so sure that after the British left, it would annex the Kalat State to itself.  So see, this was the area of ​​British Balochistan which was taken on lease by the British. As it is lease, after the British left, whatever was there would have gone with Pakistan.  The British had already said this because, firstly, the Muslim population was in majority here and secondly, it did not share a border with India.  So this pink area of ​​British Balochistan, the lease that was going on after the British left, as it is Pakistan, would have continued that lease. The light green area you can see, whose Sardars were associated with Kalat State but they ran their own regions separately and Jinnah had developed a good bonding with these Sardars. Jinnah had somewhere convinced these Sardars that after the British left, Pakistan would become an Islamic country and if you join Pakistan, the first thing you will get is your autonomy.  The rest of your identity and culture will function better by connecting with Pakistan.  And the Sardars were somehow getting influenced by this statement of Jinnah because the leaders of Kalat State, this dark green area, were talking about making Kalat State a secular country after independence. So Jinnah was confident of all these things once it was legally removed from India's influence. After that, the Kalat State will be easily taken under its control.  And because this thing about Pakistan was suiting the British also, the British were also indirectly in favor of it.  So what did Jinnah do after this?  Khan of Kalat said that it should be like an independent country after the British leave. Supported this.  Jinnah said that Kalat State had no link with the British. They have just signed a lease and a treaty. Therefore Kalat State should be an independent country.  Now after hearing this from Jinnah, the Khan of Kalat became very happy that this is the only person who is supporting me.  Now Jinnah was also a lawyer.  So the Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan made Jinnah a legal advisor of the entire Kalat State in the year 1946.   The Khan of Kalat gave the responsibility to Jinnah that Kalat State should be an independent state. You will represent this case before the British. And as soon as Jinnah was made the legal advisor, Jinnah made a memorandum in March 1946 in which he mentioned all the things that Kalat State was linked with the treaty and lease agreement with the Britishers. And also added references to the entire treaty. And in this memorandum, a demand was made that when the British leave, the Kalat State should be an independent state.  And after preparing all this, it was submitted to the Cabinet Mission of the British.  And when this memorandum was submitted, the discussion started that this Kalat State will remain independent after the British left.  And after this, the British thought that the area of ​​British Balochistan, which they had taken on lease from the Khan of Kalas, they would give it to Pakistan when leaving.  So the British started work for that also. What did the British do?  On the 29th of June 1947, there was a courageous Jirga tribe of this area which was not an elected body. But the British had appointed them for different tasks.  So, somewhere or the other, these people were loyal to the British.  We used to act according to them.  They were called and the non-official members of the municipality of the British Balochistan area, that is, the Kota area, were also called and a voting was conducted as to where British Balochistan should be merged. Now, regarding this voting, the leadership of Kalat State became very angry that you did not involve any of the Kalat leadership.  No referendum was held and voting was done across the state without asking. And when the results of this voting came, it was decided that after the departure of the British, this area which the British had taken on lease, British Balochistan, as it is, will go to Pakistan.  Now, regarding this issue, the Baloch tribe of the Kalat region opposed it a lot. He said that the British had leased it. He was not the owner of this area. So what right do they have to lease this area to Pakistan also? So when all these things were going on, then next comes the date Fourth of August 1947.  Kalat State should become independent on this day.  There was talk about this everywhere and on the same day Lord Mountbatten, Jinnah and Khan of Kalat held a round table conference and here it was decided that the status of Kalat State would remain the same as it was in the year 1838.  This means that Kalat State will remain independent.  Now the Khan of Kalat was very happy with the decision taken by all of them together. He said, do one more thing. A written agreement should also be made that Kalat State will remain independent. Now, this written agreement creates problem for Pakistan.  So the British gave the declaration for the Independent Kalat State but did not sign the written agreement.  He said that it does not have any meaning now. After this the Khan of Kalat said that you should at least make a public announcement. But the British refused to do that too. And then the Khan of Kalat did not make it a big issue that our area , our culture, our identity will now remain in an independent country. And on the same day i.e. Fourth of August 1947, Kalat State and Jinnah of Pakistan signed a Stand Still Agreement. In this agreement, Pakistan officially recognised Kalat State as an independent state.  And as soon as this happened, India's role ends here.  And if you look up the date of this stand still agreement on the internet, it will find 11th of August written somewhere.  But the announcement was made on 11th of August. Actually it was signed on the Fourth of August.  So Pakistan was very happy about this because it had signed the Stand Still Agreement and because of this India was out of the whole game. Otherwise, if this agreement had not been signed, the same situation like that of Kashmir could have arisen again between India and Pakistan. Now after the departure of the British, India got independence on 15th of August 1947. Pakistan became a separate state.  Same day Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan also announced his independence. And then about a month after this announcement, that is, on 12th of September 1947, the British gave a small official statement.  He said that the Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan has announced the independence of the Kalat State, he has done so but the Kalat State is not in a position to handle international responsibilities right now.  Now this statement seems very normal to hear but it has a lot of meaning. This entire statement went in support of Pakistan and after this statement, Pakistan started putting pressure on Khan of Kalat to join Pakistan. Pakistan did two things.  Firstly, they started preparing to attack Kalat State and slowly started deploying the army and along with that, as I told you earlier, Jinnah started talking to the leaders of the Makran, Lasbela and Kharan areas whose chiefs had joined Kalat State, to join Pakistan.  Now after seeing all these things, the Khan of Kalat immediately went to the British in December 1947 and said that this Pakistan is asking to join us.  He is planning to attack us. So we also need military support. But the British flatly refused. After this the Khan of Kalad went to Afghanistan.  He even went to India.  But Afghanistan and India also refused to support. And then in the beginning of January 1948, Pakistan talked to the leaders of Makran, Lujbela and Kharan and made a deal in which it was decided that Pakistan would provide financial support to them.  He will make their leader the state head of Pakistan. Their culture and identity will never be tampered with.  After saying all these things, Pakistan annexed them on 17 March 1948. As soon as all these chieftains met Pakistan, the area of ​​Kalat State got trapped from all sides.  If you see it on the map, it has become like a landlocked area. Completely isolated politically. What was British Balochistan was already with Pakistan.  After getting this, the entire area came under Pakistan and then exactly 10 days after this, Major General Mohammad Akbar Khan of Pakistan started entering Kalat with the Pakistan Army and the destroyers and warships of Pakistan Navy were deployed at the ports of Pasni and Jiwani and after surrounding him from all sides, they took the Khan of Kalat to Karachi and after getting the documents signed here, they took the entire area under Pakistan and now after bringing this entire area under Pakistan, it was named Balochistan.  Now see, Pakistan had forcibly got the documents signed from Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan. But soon after this a problem started. Prince Abdul Karim, brother of the Khan of Kalat, became very angry that Pakistan had betrayed him.  So his brother gathered 100 to 150 people with him in April 1948.  They form a Baloch National Liberation Committee and start a guerilla war against the Pakistan Army.  They go to the South West Balochistan area near the Afghanistan border, Kharan Hills and Nochki Hills, and start attacking Pakistan forces back to back and demand that they return their state to them.  Now see, even though these people were less in number but they knew every inch of the area, so no matter how big the army was, they would have a lot of trouble dealing with them.  These one or two people would come down from the hill, attack and then hide in the hills. So this thing had become a thorn in the side of Pakistan.  No solution was found.  Then what happened was that on this day of 8th July 1948, Pakistan forces started negotiations with Prince Abdul Karim and swore on the Quran that you all come down and surrender, we will forgive you.  Please bring down the rest of your tribes who are sitting up there as well.  There will be no problem.  You should stop this fight.  Now all these people come down after hearing this. Because swearing on the Quran is a big deal for Muslims.  But as soon as these people came down, they denied it. They arrested all of them and put them in Quetta and Marsh jails and on 10th December 1948, they were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.   Every common Baloch considers this incident to be a big betrayal for him that how could they take such a false oath on the Quran.  Now as Pakistan got rid of this problem, another problem arose on 14th October 1955.  What happened was that at that time Pakistan was divided into two parts. One East Pakistan i.e. today's Bangladesh.  Second, West Pakistan.  There were four provinces within West Pakistan.  Sindh Province, NWFP Province, Punjab Province and Balochistan Province.  So, through the One Unit policy, Pakistan wanted to maintain a single identity of West Pakistan by combining the four provinces of West Pakistan.  And Pakistan also implemented this one unit policy.  What I mean to say is that these different provinces which had their own separate authority identities will now be run by a central authority and in this central authority, most of them were the leaders of Punjab province. Now this idea of ​​one unit system was a direct threat to Balochistan.  The problem with this was that Balochistan had its own identity, history, and even constitution.  With the advent of this one unit system, their identity was being lost. Even the name was disappearing. Those who brought the One Unit policy, their name became West Pakistan.  So the name Balochistan was officially disappearing.  Now what happened was that the Baloch had merged with Pakistan so that they could run their own separate system.  He became a second class citizen.  Their entire separate political representation did not remain.  The Punjab leadership of Pakistan started handling everything.  So protests started all over Balochistan regarding this.   The matter escalated so much that by the year 1958, Pakistan had to impose martial law in the entire area. So because of the imposition of martial law, the people of Balochistan also lost their rights. Now what happened was that there was a poisonous tribe in the Jalavan region of Balochistan. An 80 year old man named Nawab Noorus Khan lived there and he became adamant.  They stood against the entire Pakistan force, and seeing Nawab Noors Khan, the young Baloch in the vicinity also came to fight with them.  Achha is a specialty of Balochs and is famous all over the world.  Even today, if you see, whenever there is a revolt, anything happens, the leadership that is there to revolt does not fight itself, nor does it send its children, nor does it send its family members.  Actually poor people go to fight.  But the Baloch leaders always go ahead and fight.   I fight myself.  They also make their children and their family fight later on.  So Nawab Nooruls Khan also started the revolt along with his entire family. So in this way 140 people joined him. He had started a general struggle against Pakistan.  What did these people do? Koem was a mountain of murd. They went and settled in the poisonous hills of Jalavan region. And in the same manner as the Baloch had been carrying out guerilla warfare till now, they would come down and attack the Pakistani forces.  So the same thing happened with them too.  The Pakistani forces got tired of fighting. So Pakistan made a deal with them also. So he said that you do not believe in the one unit policy.  Do n't fight for this.  We will remove this and forgive you all. Here also he took oath on the Quran.  As soon as he came down he was arrested and put in jail and was hanged along with Nawab Noorus Khan's son and others on 15th of July 1960.  But this further enraged the general public. Small groups were formed all over Balochistan and started attacking Pakistani forces, police posts, railways, telecommunications, government supply lines etc. Pakistan also responded by carrying out air strikes etc. and a deadlock like situation was created because everyone in the mountains knew everything about it.  It became very difficult for Pakistani forces to fight them. So, in frustration, on the First of July 1970, General Ya Khan ended the One Unit Policy. Now when this policy was removed, the first general elections were to be held in Pakistan on 7th of December 1970. So these general elections were to be held in all the provinces. So it had to happen inside Balochistan too. So what the Balochis did was that they voted for their local parties like NAP, JUI and got them elected and at the same time, East Pakistan, which is today's Bangladesh, also slipped out of the hands of Pakistan. Now as soon as East Pakistan i.e. Bangladesh separated from Pakistan.  So the entire constitution of Pakistan ended and a new constitution had to be made.  So for this, the local parties of Balochistan were NAP and JUI.  The support of the one who had won the election was also needed. Bangladesh had separated just a few days ago.  So now Pakistan shows some leniency.  So here Zulfikar Ali Bhutto needed the support of the winning parties in Balochistan to make the constitution.  So Zulfikar Ali Bhutto influenced the political parties of Balochistan. Baloch leader Ataullah Mengal was made the CM of Buchistan. Ghosh Bakhsh was made the governor and the different people who lived in the rest of Balochistan were made heads of that area.  The Baloch were very happy with this and the winning Baloch parties gave the kind of support that Pakistan needed in making the constitution and after all this was settled, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became the PM of Pakistan and a few days after that, i.e. on 10th February 1973, the political party of Balochistan, NAP, was banned and a full scale military operation was started.   The army settled in every nook and corner of Balochistan. Bhutto said that this NAP political party of the Balochis was committing treason and planning in connivance with foreign countries. And this entire military operation took place in this entire area, in which thousands of people lost their lives. Crackdown started on Baloch journalists, students, activists and Sardars. Now after this, guerilla warfare started at various places in Balochistan. Somehow, Ziaul Haq made a basic deal for some time.  After talking to all the Sardars, high posts in the government were given to them.  So this thing remained true for quite some time.  But by the year 2000, the Balochs again set up a strong army. Balochistan Liberation Army BLA.  This BALA which was created by the Balochs was their most organised method of fighting till now. And what was happening in Pakistan at this time was that Balochistan was a strategic area.  So Pakistan along with China made a deal to build a port in Gwadar, an area in Balochistan. Their plan was that this would become an international trade hub.  Secondly, this will make it easier for India to counter as well. But seeing all these things the Baloch were becoming very frustrated.  He said that without taking even a single Baloch leader into confidence, they started this Gadar Port area in collaboration with the Chinese.  The second thing that was done in this deal was that in the jobs that were to be given, instead of hiring people from the local Baloch community, Chinese and people from Pakistan’s Punjab Province were hired.  On top of that, a permanent settlement of the Army was made in this entire area. And some time before this, gold and copper were also found in Chagai district of Balochistan.  Reserves of 42 million tonnes were found.  Here too Pakistan worked in collaboration with Chinese engineers. Whatever profit was made. China took 50% of that.  Pakistan took 48% and Buchistan got only 2%. Seeing all this, the Baloch became very frustrated and the group they had formed, BALA, carried out back to back attacks.  The workers working at Gwadar Port, the infrastructure there, the gas pipeline and the Chinese workers were all attacked.  Later on C Pack was also started.  In this, Pakistan along with the Chinese had invested 60 billion dollars.  The plan was to start roads, railways, energy pipelines, fibre optics, special economic zones from China's Kajagar to Gwadar Port in Balochistan. And it was said that Balochistan will now become Dubai. But here also the same problem was there.  Here also the Baloch were ignored. First, land was acquired from local Balochs for a low price. Instead of giving jobs to local people, Chinese were hired. People came from Punjab province of Pakistan.  A permanent army was maintained.  The fisherman was removed.  Whatever employment he had, he lost it all.  So this entire Gwadar Port, CPEC and the whole system that was running, BLA, did so much damage to CPEC that so many Chinese were killed in Balochistan for many years to come.   The situation had become such that China itself said that if we have to complete this peace deal, then we will have to send our own army.  Now, by 2018, the Baloch people who were fighting, had understood one thing that by forming different groups, we are fighting for our own interests.  They are waging guerilla warfare.  This is only causing loss to us. We should be united because we are demanding a separate country so we should be united. We should have a separate army. Only then will we be able to defeat Pakistan and separate Balochistan.  So what did they do?  B R A S Baloch Raji Ajoi Sanghat. Created a structure with this name.  Basically, all the fighters from Balochistan, fighting groups, small people who were attacking Pakistan by forming separate groups, all of them were gathered together and high profile attacks were carried out in a coordinated manner which caused a lot of damage.  The entire project of Seapack was put on hold by the Chinese in this attack.  And now, by the year 2025, after making these BRAS, these people have increased the frequency of attacks even more.  This year, this BRAS has formed the Baloch National Army (BNA).  Considering itself as a country, it is fighting Pakistan like an army. This BNA has caused a lot of damage.  A total of 72 coordinated attacks were carried out on Pakistani forces.  Because of which it no longer seems like some small guerilla warfare is going on.  It seems as if the armies of two countries are fighting face to face. Just a few days ago, on 11 March 2025, Zafar Express train was going from Kota to Peshawar.  There were 450 people.  As soon as the train reached Bolan Pass.  They had planted 8 KG IED bomb on the railway track and as soon as the blast occurred the train derailed. As soon as the train landed, BLA fighters took over the entire train.  The women, children and the Baloch community were left behind but the rest were taken captive and the entire train was taken over.  Now when this incident happened, Pakistan said that our political prisoners should be released within 48 hours. But when they were not released then Pakistan launched an operation.  The operation continued for a long time.  Then Pakistan said that 64 people lost their lives in this operation. BLA said that they have killed more than 50 Pakistani army officers.  Now after this attack the situation has become much worse in this region. Security has been increased in this entire region. Pakistan has increased the presence of its army. Drones are flying throughout the area. And the biggest problem that has arisen for Pakistan at this time is that they are not able to understand that they should fight the Balochs with weapons.  This should be done to stop them or political dialogues should be held with them. And along with this, many other equations are also going on in it.  The strategic location of Balochistan is very important.  It shares its border with Iran and Afghanistan. Foreign players have also joined in this who are supporting Balochistan.  India and Pakistan are already thirsty for each other's blood. But USA's name is also coming up in this that Bhutistan will become a very important player for the US to counter Iran and Afghanistan if it gets separated from Pakistan.  Now see what will happen next?  Only time will tell.  But Pakistan has never been more troubled by the Balochs than it is at this particular time. In the end let me tell you once again that you must do the two day A Master Program of Outskill. I have given you the link in the description. Thank you. [music]
