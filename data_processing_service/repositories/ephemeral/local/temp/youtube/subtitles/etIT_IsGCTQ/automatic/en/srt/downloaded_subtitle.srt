1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
He took a false oath on the Quran and deceived the Balochs and

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,160
called them down and captured them.  And this is where

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,800
Jinnah was made the legal advisor of Kalat and it proved so

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
costly

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,800
that he got angry because natural gas was

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,279
extracted from Balochistan but was

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
sent to Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.  How a

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,160
single 80 year old Baloch Nawab Nauroz Khan

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,439
single-handedly created a storm in the entire area.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
 

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
But Raja Ranjit Singh was adamant that no

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
army could just step on our land like that.  The

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,160

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,000
reserve of 42 million tonnes was

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,960
found in Balochistan but

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,879
China took away 50% of its profit and the Balochs

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,120

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,360
got only 2% of its profit.  There is only one Baloch community in the whole world

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
whose leaders

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,960
come forward and fight along with their children.  Decisions are not taken sitting in expensive hotels.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,559

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,760
Neither bow nor sell, just fight, not Sepak,

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
Baloch

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,520
want their rights, now see the people of Balochistan have been

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
raising their voice for their rights and identity.

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,840
But this voice does

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,320
not reach the global level with clarity and impact.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
Sometimes political noise, sometimes media

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,799
silence and sometimes lack of framing does not allow this issue to

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
find a place in the world's narrative.

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
And this is not just about Balochistan, it is about every

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
person who has something

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
important to say but is stopped due to lack of tools.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
So AI is not just a tech revolution.  There is

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,439
an equalizer that gives every person the

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
power to become skilled.

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
Give structure to your ideas and

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
present them impactfully to the world.  If

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,440
call.  So let's come back to the topic.

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
See, Pakistan has

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,400
seen many big crises in its time.  Economy,

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,800
military rule, political drama, everything.

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,440
But in the current time, the

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
situation has become such that the question has now reached the

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,599
survival of Pakistan.  Right now,

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,840
pick up any newspaper and in Pakistan, the

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
only

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,239
discussion going on everywhere is about the problem of Balochistan.

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,400
And the way Balochistan is

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,959
creating its own army etc.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
You will get to hear this name more in the times to come.   But

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
now the question is what kind of

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,680
problem arose within Pakistan that its

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,239
Balochistan province

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
started talking about separating from Pakistan and forming its own country.  These people are attacking the Pakistan Army every day.

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,239
Just a few

78
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
days ago you might have seen that a train was

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
hijacked and people were ready to sacrifice their lives.

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
But now

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,120
we cannot live with Pakistan.  We were

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,760
linked with deception.  Now we have to create our own

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
separate country Balochistan again.  Now look, the

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,000
word Balochistan, even though it is

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,080
coming more in the news now, but this

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,640
problem is a very old problem

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,280
and many such things have happened in the past

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,760
due to which the problem has become so big today.

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
And to understand this whole game, we will

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
have to go back a bit.  And before that let

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
me tell you one thing.  See,

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
this Pakistan is mainly divided into four provinces.

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
This is Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa.   It

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
shares its border with Afghanistan.  Then

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
this is Punjab.  It has a border with India.

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
This is the main province of Pakistan.

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,840
All the army generals you see come from here.

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
And the

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
province of Punjab enjoys the maximum resources.

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,599
This here, this is Sindh.  It also

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,040
shares its border with India.  And this is

102
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,920
Balochistan which shares its border with Iran and

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Afghanistan.  So see, this

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
area of ​​Balochistan, in the 12th century, there was

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
really no boundary etc.

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,159
of this area and neither was this area named

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
Balochistan anywhere.  In this map, you are

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,880
seeing the pink area, here

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,280
small Baloch tribes used to live in different areas.  Like

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Makran Tribe, Kachi Tribe, Sistan

111
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,320
Tribe, Turbat Tribe.  There was

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
no political system here.  Every tribe had its own

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
chieftain.  And like this different

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,400
tribes were living in this area.  And if

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
you look at this map carefully, then at

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
that

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,520
time these tribes had occupied small pieces of land

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
and were living in the areas near the border of today's Iran and Afghanistan.

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
Because at that time the border was

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,919
not clearly decided.  Now what happens is that when these

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,479
tribes were living in this area,

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,400
a man named Mir Jalal Khan was

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,400
very famous among them.  So at this particular time

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,639
Mir Jalal said that look, it is

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
better for us to

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
live together rather than living separately, so that if any trouble arises, we will be

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
united and will be able to help each other.

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
So what did Mir Jalal do?  I

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,360
went and talked to 44 tribes in this area, brought them

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
all together and formed an alliance.  This

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
was the first time these tribes united within this area.

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,759
They did not create a new country but rather created a model

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
in which everything was going on like before.  The

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
chieftains were managing their tribes in the same way as they used to do earlier.  The

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,960
only difference was that 44 tribes had

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,960
decided to unite by forming an alliance

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,440
which was being led by Mir Jalal.

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,800
And the decision to form this alliance, the

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,039

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,039
foundation for creating Balochistan was laid at this time.

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,360
That is why you will see that even today people

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
consider Mir Jalal Khan as the founding father of the

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
Baloch community.  You

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,479
can understand their importance from the children of Mir Jalal Khan

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,039
like Rind, Lashari, Koraie, Bibi

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,360
Jato.  Today, there are many

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,080
such areas in Balochistan which are named after their children.

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Like Rindabad Village, Kurai Village,

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
Jatoi City.  All these are derived from the names of his children.

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
Now see,

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,039
this model which was made, has been working for a long time.

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,520
After this, by the time the 15th century came, after Mir Jalal,

156
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,039
Mir Chakar Rin also came.

157
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,199
He did the same thing and organised it further

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,280
and kept all the tribes united.

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
And at that time, in this area, people were

160
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,360
living in semi-organised structures.

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
At that time

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
people knew this area not as Balochistan but by the name of Rin Lashari Union.

163
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,639
Now what happens is that this tribe was

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,759
living together.  But when the year 1666

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,759
came, the Safavid Empire was

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
becoming very big in Iran.  If you look on the other side,

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
you had a Mughal umpire.  So because

168
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
these two big umpires were

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
next to each other.  Due to this, the Baloch tribes

170
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,120
who were living here were under

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
a lot of pressure from time to time.

172
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,759
So because of all the pressure that was developing on them,

173
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,600
they felt that they needed to

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,039
create a system to protect themselves.

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
He

176
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,039
observed the empires around him to see how they were working.  Getting

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,039
inspired from him, I also

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
started creating a central authority.  Just like

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
the rest of the empires were working.

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
Started building a structure similar to that.

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
So all these tribes were

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,319
living in this area.  Among all these tribes, there was

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,120
another tribe whose name was

184
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
Ahmed Jai Brah Tribe.  In this map, the

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
area which you are seeing by the name Kalat,

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
this tribe was in this area.  And there was

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,360
a man in this tribe named Mir Ahmed Khan.  So when the

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,479
talk of forming a central authority was going on,

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,960
all the tribes together made Mir Ahmed Khan the

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,280
Khan of Kalad.  Now what is this Khan of

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,759
Kalad?  Like the king is the head of the state.  In the

192
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,919
same way they

193
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
named him Khan of Kalad, meaning he will lead.

194
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,639
Now see, one thing is worth keeping in mind here

195
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,039
that all these tribes had

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,360
made Mir Ahmed Khan the Khan of Kalat.

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,440
But the chieftains of some tribes

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,840
said that we are

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,240
accepting you as the Khan of Kalat but we will manage our

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,639
tribe's and our area

201
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
ourselves. So because of this, the

202
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,240
dark green area that you can see in the map was being directly

203
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,919

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
ruled by the Khan of Kalat i.e. Mir Ahmed and the light

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
green area was

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,080
indirectly ruled by the Khan of Kalat and this entire

207
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,879
green area, whether it is light green or

208
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,560
dark green, was called the

209
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,199
Khanate of Kalat.

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,599
Later on, this Khanate of Kalat would

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,440
become Balochistan.  So whenever there is talk of Kalat State or Khanate of

212
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,120
Kalat, then you should understand that this entire

213
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
light and dark green area is being

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
talked about.  So when this Khanate

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,160
of Kalat became a proper system, then the

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
entire setup of law, trade, military was made and then

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
this system continued for a long time and then

218
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,759
gradually when the year 1749 came and

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,080
after Mir Ahmed Khan, his grandson Mir Nasir Khan

220
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,160
became the Khan of Kalat.  The Baloch

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,640
consider this time as the golden period.   As

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,800
soon as Nasir Khan came, he

223
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
created a good political system in the entire Khanate of Kalat.

224
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,760
He set up the Baloch Army which included

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,360
25,000 soldiers.  Kept 1000 camels

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,279
in it.  Look, remember this thing, I will

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
also repeat it that there were

228
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
many tribes in the Khanate of Kalat.  Who had their own separate

229
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,519
systems.  Their chiefs used to

230
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
control them.  But all this was going on under the Khan of

231
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,680
Kalat.  So what did the Khan of Kalat

232
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,480
do?  The

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,720
chiefs of all the Baloch tribes of this area were called and a

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
council system was created so that if any decision was to be taken,

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
everyone could agree on it.  This

236
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
council used to decide everything.  The Council worked in the

237
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,880
same manner as the Parliament works.

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,560
Now after this comes the year

239
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,720
1830 and with the arrival of this year the real

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,959
problems started.  By this

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,519
time the British had arrived.  He was

242
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,760
ruling over his undivided India.

243
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
But at the same time, there was

244
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
a

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,200
geopolitical battle going on between the British and Russia, which was

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
also called The Great Game.

247
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,800
So this area of ​​Central Asia which you are

248
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,320
seeing, which includes Kazakhstan,

249
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,480
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, this entire

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,720
Central Asia was considered a very important area.

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,959
All the important trade routes,

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,880
silk route, economic activities, everything happened

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
from here.  And if there was presence

254
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,480
of any empire and military in this Central Asia, then

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,880

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,200
it would have provided a huge strategic advantage.  So

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,360
what Russia did was that it gradually

258
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,839

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
expanded its empire by occupying Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan in Central Asia.  And

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
along with this, they were also moving towards Afghanistan.

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,600
For this, he also sent

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,839
his diplomat Captain Ivan to Afghanistan in the year 1837.  My

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
friend Mohammad Khan, who was the ruler of Afghanistan at that time, had

266
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,320
started talking to him.  Now, when it was

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
entering Russia or Afghanistan, the

268
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
British who were

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
sitting on India got worried.   The

270
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,160
British who were ruling India

271
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440

272
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,440
considered India to be a very important part of their country because there were a

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
lot of resources here and the way Russia was

274
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
growing and then slowly it was

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
entering into Afghanistan as well.  There was a strong

276
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,760
possibility that it would reach the border of India

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
and the British and Russia did

278
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
not want to fight among themselves.  So now from here the

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Britishers started using their brains.

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,240
He wondered if there should be

281
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,320
a buffer zone between India and Russia.

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,640
If this does not happen then a big problem will arise.

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
And whichever country is in this buffer zone should act

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
according to our wishes.  And if this is

285
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
done then Russia will not be able to reach India.

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
So for this the British had

287
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,240
made a plan that

288
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480
we will attack Afghanistan before Russia and

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,920

290
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,880
remove the ruler of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad Khan and make our puppet ruler

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,120
Shah Shuja the ruler of Afghanistan.  This would result in the

292
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800

293
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
British having more control over Afghanistan than Russia.

294
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,480
He had influence.  Now

295
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
if they wanted to attack Afghanistan and

296
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,200
install their ruler there then the British would have to

297
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
send their army from India to Afghanistan

298
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
and for that they would need a route.  So

299
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
one route from here was the Northern Route through Peshawar and

300
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
Khyber pass.  But there

301
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,760
was a Sikh umpire at that time.  So when the British were

302
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
asking to withdraw their army from this area, then

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,240
Raja Ranjit Singh ji was the Sikh emperor.

304
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,079
He clearly refused, saying that the

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
British Army will

306
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,360
not make such a path through our land.  So when the

307
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,600
option of the Sikh umpire did not seem right for the

308
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
British, then their eyes

309
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,680
fell on the Khaniyat of Kalat which was

310
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
also known as the Kalat State, at that time some people of the

311
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,279
British made a plan that they will reach Afghanistan

312
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,920
from India via Bolan Pass, Kota Chaman

313
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,920
 

314
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,680
and in between, this

315
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,120
area of ​​Balochistan around Bolan Pass, Kota Chaman,

316
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,640
I am calling it Balochistan now, at that time was

317
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
not the Balochistan area.

318
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,519
What did the British do for this area, they

319
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,600

320
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,920

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
sent their diplomat Alexander Bernies to the then Khan of Kalat Mehrab Khan so that after taking permission etc. and agreement

322
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,839
etc., they could make arrangements to leave from here.

323
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,920
Basically the British were very

324
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
powerful.  He had to leave this area.  So

325
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
he wanted proper control over this area.

326
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,519
So for this he first made a deal with the Khan of Kalat.  We

327
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,519
told them that we will

328
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
support you financially and you let us

329
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,279
use this area.  Now the Khan of Kalat was

330
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,079
also helpless.  He accepted this deal.  Now

331
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,639
after this, the year 1839 was the time when the

332
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,720
British had to use the Kalat State area to

333
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
transport their army to Afghanistan for

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
attack.  Now even though the

335
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,160
British had signed an agreement with the Khan of Kalat

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,120
that they would leave this area.

337
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,600
But the local people of this area were

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,279

339
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,360
not happy with this thing even though they had signed with Khan of Kala.  He said

340
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,760
that since it is our land, we will not let it go like this.

341
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
So, going against the agreement made by Khan of Kalat, they launched

342
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,680
small attacks on the British Army.

344
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,519
Now when these attacks happened, the British felt

345
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,279
that this Mehrab Khan was

346
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
not able to stop his people from attacking.

347
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,079
And he also had a doubt that

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,000
maybe Mehrab Khan is not stopping him intentionally.

349
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
He may want such attacks to continue.

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,160
Along with this, there was also a doubt on Mehrab Khan

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
that perhaps he had some links with Afghanistan too.

352
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,760
So overall the British

353
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,440
felt that even though Mehrab Khan had

354
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,760
signed the agreement.  But there is a

355
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
possibility that he himself is getting attacked from behind.

356
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,440
So the British, in anger,

357
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,320
attacked the Kalat State in November 1839

358
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,120
and killed Mehrab Khan. Mehrab

359
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,959
Khan's opponent, Shahnawaz Khan, was made the Khan of

360
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
Kalat, who worked according to the British.

361
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,480
Now after this the British

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,760
understood that if they wanted to protect this entire area

363
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,000
from Russia and create a buffer zone, then

364
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
this region of Kalat State would have to be kept under their control.  The

365
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,760
British were not interested in

366
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,680
taking over the entire Kalat State

367
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,079
because at that time there was

368
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,320
vacant land far and wide.  There were

369
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,880
not that many resources and to take over any land one had to

370
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,399
deploy a lot of army etc.

371
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,320
So he was not interested in this thing.

372
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
So what did they do?  The Kalat

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,120
State was divided into two parts.

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,800
One part was this region, the Pink

375
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,440
area of ​​Quetta, Bolan Pass, Chaman, Chagai.

376
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,440
This area was directly

377
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,519
controlled by the British with the help of their military.  And the

378
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
rest of the area was controlled indirectly.  He

379
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040

380
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
placed a ruler there who would run things according to his wishes and

381
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,959
gave financial support from time to time so that the inside

382
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
area also remained under control.  But the

383
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,519

384
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,360

385
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,600
British never colonised the Kalat State the way they had colonised India.  So the

386
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
British created their influence in Afghanistan by attacking and

387
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,240
negotiating and using different tactics,

388
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,680
and in a

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
similar way they increased their influence in Iran.  The

390
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
British who

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
wanted to create a buffer zone between Russia and India, did

392
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,279
it very easily. And

393
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
while creating this buffer zone, they

394
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,079
also started marking the borders of Kalat State,

395
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
meaning they started officially registering the borders

396
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440

397
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
because earlier there were no real borders, there were

398
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,839
frontiers, there used to be

399
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,160
empty areas far and wide. So when the British

400
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,639
started creating the borders of Kalat State, a

401
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,199
large area near the borders of Kalat State

402
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,760
which touched the borders of Iran and Afghanistan was given to Iran and Afghanistan

403
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,440

404
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
through the Gold Mines Line Agreement and sometimes through the Treaty of

405
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Gandamark,

406
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
so that Iran and Afghanistan remain happy and

407
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,800
stay away from the influence of Russia. And

408
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,720
a few days after doing all this, they also signed

409
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,040
an official treaty with Kalat State on the 8th of December 1876 so

410
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,760
that everything

411
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,760
remains on paper, which is called the Treaty of Kalat.

412
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,440
These are some of his terms.  Article three of this treaty is

413
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,839
very important.

414
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,399
Now it will be revealed what the meaning of this article is.

415
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
Now after this, the

416
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
British took the foreign policy etc. of the Kalat State under their

417
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
control and the internal matters on daily basis were given

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to the Khan of Kalad and told him to

419
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,480
handle the internal matters himself.

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
After taking over the foreign policy, Russia

421
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
lost complete control over this area. In

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,120
return, the British

423
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
initially gave ₹000 per year to the Kalat State and then

424
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,279
increased it to ₹1 lakh.  Now look,

425
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
look at the map once again from here.   The

426
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,920
British retained the pink area using their military power.

427
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,320
This green area was

428
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,959

429
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,880
given to the Khan of Kalat to indirectly rule.  And then after this, in the year 1887, this

430
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,920
pink area which was under the control of the British was

431
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,759
also

432
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
indirectly taken under British control on paper.  And when it was

433
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
put on paper through lease, it was named

434
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
British

435
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,800
Balochistan.  And in this way the

436
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,560
name Balochistan was used officially for the first time.  The remaining

437
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,639
Given Area was still

438
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,360
known as Kalat State.  Khanate of Art.  Now

439
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
see, for the next 50-60 years, no

440
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
major event took place and then the

441
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
time for the British to leave came near,

442
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,440
undivided India had to be divided and

443
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,759
Pakistan was to be formed, so at the same time, the

444
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Khan of Kalat, Mir Ahmed Yar Khan,

445
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
thought that now that the British are leaving,

446
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
we were not colonized by the British, so

447
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,880
we will now

448
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
become an independent country.

449
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,480
Khan of Kalat was

450
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,360
confident about this matter because it was legally

451
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,519
valid also.  First of all, according to Article 3 of the official treaty that was signed between the British and the Kalat State in the year 1876, the

452
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,000

453
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,240

454
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,559
British had

455
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,640
officially accepted on paper that the Kalat State is

456
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
not a British area but an

457
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,559
independent state and the area that the

458
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,039
British had taken, which they

459
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,959
call British Balochistan, was also

460
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,520
taken under an agreement and lease.  That means like someone

461
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,839
lives on rent.  Along with this, in the year 1886, the

462
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,319
British Administration

463
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,640
officially mentioned in its official report that

464
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,960
Khan of Kalad was an

465
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
independent ruler who was

466
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,919
connected with the British through a treaty.  This thing

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,960
was from the mansion.  And in the year 1877,

468
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,120
Khan of Kalat Khudadad Khan was summoned in the Delhi Imperial Assembly

469
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,760
as an independent king.

470
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,559
Meaning that the British themselves believed that

471
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,559
Kalat State was an independent state.  So

472
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,720
legally the British

473
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,640
could not say at any stage that the Kalat State was a

474
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
part of the British Empire.  And if

475
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,120
the British had said this,

476
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,760
they would have faced a lot of problems internationally too.  But on the other

477
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,000
hand, if Kalat State had become an independent country, then the

478
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,799
British as well as the

479
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
US feared that Kalat State was very weak.  It may

480
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,919
happen that Russia's

481
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,919
influence increases again in this area.

482
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,400
And this area was very

483
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,880
important strategically.  And if this Kalat

484
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,799
State joins with Pakistan, then the

485
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,320
whole area becomes strong and Russia's

486
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
influence cannot increase.  Because the

487
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,080
British had a very

488
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,880
good influence on Pakistan.  So, it was

489
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,280
very important for the British that if the Kalat

490
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
State joins Pakistan instead of becoming independent,

491
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
it would be more in their

492
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,799
favour.  So now from here

493
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,520
a game begins to deal with this complex situation in which the

494
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,679
Khan of Art gets

495
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,600
trapped.  What happened was that

496
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
when the British were leaving undivided India, there were

497
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,720

498
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,760

499
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,919
two concerned parties, India and Pakistan, that is, Jinnah's Muslim League and Nehruji's Congress, to

500
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
claim this undivided India.  These

501
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,360
two parties had to talk among themselves and

502
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,840
decide who would get how much share of

503
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,160
this undivided India.  But if

504
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,480
it is legally proved that this Kalat

505
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,320
State is not a part of the British Empire.

506
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
This was taken by the British Empire for some time through a lease only,

507
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320

508
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,000
for which the British used to pay money annually.

509
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,799
So after the British left, the

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,480

511
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,320
claims of India and Pakistan on the Kalat State would have ended.  And

512
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,559
Pakistan had decided that

513
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,640
before the British left, this Kalat

514
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,720
State should somehow prove to be an independent state.

515
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
Because as soon as Kalat State is

516
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
proved to be an independent state, then

517
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,840
India's claim on Kalat

518
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,919
State will end and later whenever Pakistan

519
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
wants, it can take Kalat State under its control.

520
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,280
Now your question would be that

521
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,520
how was Pakistan so sure that

522
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,840
after the British left,

523
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,919
it would annex the Kalat State to itself.  So see, this

524
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,000
was the area of ​​British Balochistan which was

525
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,640
taken on lease by the British.

526
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,480
As it is lease, after the British left, whatever was there would have gone

527
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
with Pakistan.  The

528
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
British had already said this

529
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,320
because, firstly, the Muslim population was

530
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,960
in majority here and secondly, it did

531
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,799
not share a border with India.  So this pink

532
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,640
area of ​​British Balochistan, the

533
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,520
lease that was going on after the British left,

534
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,520
as it is Pakistan, would have continued that lease. The

535
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,320
light green area you can see,

536
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,640
whose Sardars were associated with Kalat State

537
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,559
but they ran their own regions separately

538
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,320
and Jinnah had developed a

539
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,559
good bonding with these Sardars. Jinnah had

540
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,720
somewhere convinced these Sardars

541
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,720
that after the British left, Pakistan would

542
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,799
become an Islamic country and if you

543
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,799
join Pakistan, the first thing

544
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,039
you will get is your autonomy.  The rest of your

545
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,799
identity and culture will function

546
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,039
better by connecting with Pakistan.  And the

547
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,799
Sardars were somehow getting influenced by

548
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,520
this statement of Jinnah because the

549
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,760

550
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,320
leaders of Kalat State, this dark green area, were talking about

551
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,480
making Kalat State a secular country after independence.

552
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,720
So Jinnah was confident of all these things

553
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
once it was

554
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,200
legally removed from India's influence.

555
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,039
After that, the Kalat State will be

556
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,120
easily taken under its control.  And because

557
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,520
this thing about Pakistan was suiting the British also, the

558
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,200
British were also indirectly

559
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,600
in favor of it.  So

560
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
what did Jinnah do after this?  Khan of Kalat

561
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,520
said that it should be like an independent country

562
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
after the British leave.

563
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,320
Supported this.  Jinnah said that Kalat State had

564
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,320
no link with the British.

565
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,799
They have just signed a lease and a treaty.

566
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,559
Therefore Kalat State should be an independent

567
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
country.  Now after hearing this from Jinnah, the

568
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,960
Khan of Kalat became very happy

569
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
that this is the only person who is

570
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
supporting me.  Now Jinnah was

571
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,640
also a lawyer.  So the Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar

572
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:29,799
Khan made Jinnah a legal advisor of the entire Kalat State in the year 1946.   The

573
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,799

574
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,440
Khan of Kalat

575
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,320
gave the responsibility to Jinnah that Kalat State

576
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,240
should be an independent state.

577
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,400
You will represent this case before the British.

578
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,880
And as soon as Jinnah was made the legal advisor,

579
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,520
Jinnah made a memorandum in March 1946

580
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
in which he mentioned all the things that

581
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,440
Kalat State was

582
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,760
linked with the treaty and lease agreement with the Britishers.

583
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
And also added references to the entire treaty.

584
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,760
And in this memorandum, a demand was made that

585
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,919
when the British leave, the Kalat State should be

586
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,919
an independent state.  And after

587
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,840
preparing all this,

588
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
it was submitted to the Cabinet Mission of the British.  And when

589
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
this memorandum was submitted, the discussion

590
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,679
started that this Kalat State will

591
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,240

592
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,320
remain independent after the British left.  And after this, the British

593
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
thought that the area of ​​British Balochistan, which they had taken on

594
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,120
lease from the Khan of Kalas, they would

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,039
give it to Pakistan when leaving.  So the

596
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,960
British started work for that also.

597
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,480
What did the British do?  On the 29th of

598
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,880
June 1947, there was a courageous Jirga tribe of this area

599
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,039
which was not an elected body.

600
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120
But the British had appointed them for

601
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,799
different tasks.  So, somewhere or the

602
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,960
other, these people were loyal to the British.  We used to

603
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,720
act according to them.  They were called and the

604
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480

605
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640

606
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
non-official

607
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
members of the municipality of the British Balochistan area, that is, the Kota area, were also called and a voting was conducted as to

608
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,320
where British Balochistan should be merged.

609
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
Now, regarding this voting, the leadership of Kalat State

610
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,640

611
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
became very angry that you did not involve any of the Kalat leadership.  No

612
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,880
referendum was

613
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
held and voting was done across the state without asking.

614
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
And when the results of this voting came,

615
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,960
it was decided that after the departure of the British,

616
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,520
this area which the British had

617
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,440
taken on lease, British Balochistan, as it is, will

618
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,600
go to Pakistan.  Now, regarding this issue, the

619
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,600
Baloch tribe of the Kalat

620
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
region opposed it a lot.

621
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,799
He said that the British had leased it.

622
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,480
He was not the owner of this area.

623
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
So what right do they have to

624
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,799
lease this area to Pakistan also?

625
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,240
So when all these things were going on,

626
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,640
then next comes the date Fourth of August

627
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,120
1947.  Kalat State should become independent on this day.  There was

628
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,000
talk about this everywhere

629
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,159
and on the same day Lord Mountbatten, Jinnah and

630
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,080
Khan of Kalat held a round table conference

631
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,039
and here it was decided that the

632
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,679
status of Kalat State would remain the same as it was in the year 1838.  This

633
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,000
means

634
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,000
that Kalat State will

635
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,919
remain independent.  Now the Khan of Kalat was very happy with the decision taken by all of them together.

636
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679

637
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
He said, do one more thing.

638
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
A written agreement should also be made that

639
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,360
Kalat State will remain independent.

640
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
Now, this written agreement creates

641
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,200
problem for Pakistan.  So the

642
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,120
British

643
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
gave the declaration for the Independent Kalat State but did

644
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,400
not sign the written agreement.  He

645
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,320
said that it does not have any meaning now.

646
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
After this the Khan of Kalat said that you should

647
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
at least make a public announcement.

648
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,240
But the British refused to do that too.

649
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
And then the Khan of Kalat did

650
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,919
not make it a big issue that our area

651
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
, our culture, our identity will

652
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,799
now remain in an independent country.

653
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,360
And on the same day i.e. Fourth of August 1947,

654
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,360
Kalat State and Jinnah of Pakistan

655
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,240
signed a Stand Still Agreement.

656
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,480
In this agreement, Pakistan officially

657
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,720
recognised Kalat State as an independent state.  And

658
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,559
as soon as this happened, India's role

659
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,400
ends here.  And

660
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,720
if you look up the date of this stand still agreement

661
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
on the internet, it will find 11th of August

662
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
written somewhere.  But the announcement was made on 11th of August.

663
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
Actually

664
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,159
it was signed on the Fourth of August.  So Pakistan was

665
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
very happy about this because it had

666
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,480
signed the Stand Still Agreement

667
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
and because of this India was out of the whole game.

668
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,919
Otherwise, if this agreement had

669
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,840
not been signed, the same

670
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,919
situation like that of Kashmir could have arisen again between India and Pakistan.

671
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,200
Now

672
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,039
after the departure of the British, India got independence on 15th of August 1947.

673
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,640
Pakistan

674
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,880
became a separate state.  Same day Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed

675
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,880
Yar Khan also announced his independence.

676
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,880
And then about a

677
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,400
month after this announcement, that is, on 12th of September 1947, the

678
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,919
British gave a small official

679
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
statement.  He said that the

680
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,240
Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan has

681
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,480
announced the independence of the Kalat State,

682
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,400
he has done so but the Kalat State is

683
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400

684
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
not in a position to handle international responsibilities right now.  Now

685
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,320
this statement

686
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,320
seems very normal to hear but it has a lot of meaning.

687
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,880
This entire statement

688
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,520
went in support of Pakistan and after this statement,

689
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,520
Pakistan started putting pressure on Khan

690
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,600
of Kalat to join Pakistan.

691
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,679
Pakistan did two things.  Firstly, they

692
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,679
started preparing to attack Kalat State

693
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,919
and slowly started deploying the army

694
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,720
and along with that, as I

695
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,279
told you earlier, Jinnah started talking to the leaders of the Makran,

696
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,520
Lasbela and Kharan areas whose

697
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
chiefs had joined Kalat State, to

698
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520

699
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,679
join Pakistan.  Now after

700
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,320
seeing all these things, the Khan of Kalat

701
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,159
immediately

702
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
went to the British in December 1947 and said that this Pakistan is

703
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
asking to join us.  He is

704
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,520
planning to attack us.

705
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
So we also need military support.

706
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,440
But the British flatly refused.

707
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,679
After this the Khan of Kalad

708
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,679
went to Afghanistan.  He even

709
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,440
went to India.  But Afghanistan and

710
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,559
India also refused to support.

711
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,760
And then in the beginning of January 1948,

712
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,320
Pakistan talked to the leaders of Makran, Lujbela and Kharan and made

713
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,720
a deal

714
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,720
in which it was decided that Pakistan would

715
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,039
provide financial support to them.  He

716
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,520
will make their leader the state head of Pakistan.

717
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,039
Their culture and identity will never be

718
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,840
tampered with.  After saying all these things,

719
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,840
Pakistan annexed them on 17 March 1948.

720
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,640
As soon as all these chieftains

721
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,960
met Pakistan, the area of ​​Kalat State got

722
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,120
trapped from all sides.  If you

723
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,840
see it on the map, it has become like a landlocked area.

724
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,600
Completely isolated politically.

725
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,159
What was British Balochistan was

726
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,559
already with Pakistan.  After getting this, the

727
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,559
entire area came under Pakistan

728
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,600
and then exactly 10 days after this,

729
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,600
Major General Mohammad Akbar Khan of Pakistan

730
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,600

731
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,000
started entering Kalat with the Pakistan Army and the destroyers and warships of Pakistan Navy were

732
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,480

733
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,520
deployed at the ports of Pasni and Jiwani

734
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,440
and after surrounding him from all sides, they took the Khan of

735
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,440
Kalat to Karachi and after getting the

736
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
documents signed here, they

737
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,799
took the entire area under Pakistan and now after

738
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,240
bringing this entire area under Pakistan, it was

739
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,159
named

740
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,720
Balochistan.  Now see, Pakistan had

741
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
forcibly got the documents signed from Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan.

742
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,159
But

743
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,960
soon after this a problem started.

744
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,440
Prince Abdul Karim, brother of the Khan of Kalat, became

745
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,760
very angry

746
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,200
that Pakistan had betrayed him.  So his

747
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,120
brother gathered 100 to 150 people with him in April 1948.  They

748
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,760

749
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,360
form a Baloch National Liberation Committee and

750
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,679
start a guerilla war against the Pakistan Army.  They go to the

751
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,679

752
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,240
South West Balochistan area near the Afghanistan border,

753
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,679
Kharan Hills and Nochki Hills,

754
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
and start

755
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,120
attacking Pakistan forces back to back and demand that they

756
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960

757
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,760
return their state to them.  Now see, even though these people were less in number

758
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,600
but they knew every inch of the area,

759
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
so no matter how big the army was,

760
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,760
they would have a lot of trouble

761
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,440
dealing with them.  These one or two people would come down from the hill,

762
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,600
attack and then hide in the hills.

763
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,760
So this thing had

764
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,559
become a thorn in the side of Pakistan.  No solution was

765
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,520
found.  Then what happened was that on

766
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,000
this day of 8th July 1948, Pakistan forces

767
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,720
started negotiations with Prince Abdul Karim

768
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,440
and swore on the Quran that you all come down and

769
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,520
surrender, we will forgive you.  Please bring down the

770
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
rest of your tribes who are sitting up there as

771
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,039
well.  There will

772
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,559
be no problem.  You should stop this fight.  Now all these

773
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,240
people come down after hearing this.

774
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,159
Because swearing on the Quran is a

775
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,440
big deal for Muslims.  But as soon as

776
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,840
these people came down, they denied it.

777
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,000
They arrested all of them and put them in Quetta and Marsh

778
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,120
jails and on 10th

779
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,760
December 1948, they were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.   Every

780
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,159
common Baloch considers this incident to be a

781
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,760
big betrayal for him that how could

782
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,360
they take such a false oath on the Quran.  Now

783
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,720
as Pakistan got rid of this problem,

784
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,600

785
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,520
another problem arose on 14th October 1955.  What happened was that

786
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,679
at that time Pakistan was divided into two parts.

787
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,720
One East Pakistan i.e. today's

788
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,039
Bangladesh.  Second, West Pakistan.  There were

789
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,760
four provinces within West Pakistan.  Sindh

790
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,080
Province, NWFP Province, Punjab

791
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,799
Province and Balochistan Province.  So,

792
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,279
through the One Unit policy, Pakistan

793
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,559

794
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,039

795
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,440
wanted to maintain a single identity of West Pakistan by combining the four provinces of West Pakistan.  And Pakistan

796
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,600
also implemented this one unit policy.  What I

797
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,640
mean to say is that these different

798
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,679
provinces which had their own separate authority

799
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,840
identities will now be run by a central authority

800
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,159
and in this central authority,

801
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,240
most of them were the leaders of Punjab province.

802
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,080
Now this idea of ​​one unit system was a

803
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
direct threat

804
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,880
to Balochistan.  The problem with this was that

805
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,039
Balochistan had its own identity, history, and

806
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
even constitution.  With the advent of this one unit

807
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,520
system, their identity was being lost.

808
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,159
Even the name was disappearing.

809
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,320
Those who brought the One Unit policy,

810
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,399
their name became West Pakistan.  So the

811
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,320
name Balochistan was officially

812
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,960
disappearing.  Now what happened was that the

813
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,960
Baloch had merged

814
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,520
with Pakistan so that they could run their own separate

815
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,520
system.  He became a second class

816
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,679
citizen.  Their entire

817
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,080
separate political representation did

818
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,919
not remain.  The Punjab leadership of Pakistan

819
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,919
started handling everything.  So protests started all over Balochistan regarding this.   The

820
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,880

821
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,520
matter escalated so much that by the year 1958,

822
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,760
Pakistan had to impose martial law in the entire area.

823
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,760

824
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,240
So because of the imposition of martial law, the

825
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,039
people of Balochistan also lost their rights.

826
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,520
Now what happened was that there was

827
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,600
a poisonous tribe in the Jalavan region of Balochistan.

828
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,640
An 80 year old man named Nawab Noorus Khan

829
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,640
lived there and he became adamant.  They

830
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,520
stood against the entire Pakistan force, and

831
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,320
seeing Nawab Noors Khan, the young

832
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,960
Baloch in the vicinity also came to fight with them.  Achha is

833
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,960
a specialty of Balochs and is

834
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,440
famous all over the world.  Even today,

835
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,120
if you see, whenever there is a revolt,

836
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
anything happens, the

837
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,519
leadership that is there to revolt does not fight itself, nor does it

838
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,440
send its children, nor does it

839
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,600
send its family members.  Actually

840
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
poor people go to fight.  But the Baloch

841
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,640
leaders always go ahead and fight.   I

842
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,480
fight myself.  They also make their children and their family

843
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
fight later on.  So Nawab

844
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,399
Nooruls Khan also

845
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
started the revolt along with his entire family.

846
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,120
So in this way 140 people joined him.

847
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,559

848
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,679
He had started a general struggle against Pakistan.  What did these people do?

849
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,000
Koem was a mountain of murd.

850
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,000
They went and settled in the poisonous hills of Jalavan region.

851
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,320
And in the same manner as the

852
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,480
Baloch had been carrying out guerilla warfare till now, they would come down and

853
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,080
attack the Pakistani forces.  So the

854
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,799
same thing happened with them too.  The Pakistani

855
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,039
forces got tired of fighting.

856
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,559
So Pakistan made a deal with them also.

857
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
So he said that you do

858
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,799
not believe in the one unit policy.  Do

859
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,039
n't fight for this.  We will remove this and forgive you all.

860
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,279
Here also he

861
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,600
took oath on the Quran.  As soon as he came down he was arrested and

862
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,200
put in jail and was hanged along with

863
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,080
Nawab Noorus Khan's son and

864
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,320
others on 15th of July 1960.  But this

865
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,480
further enraged the general public.

866
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,200
Small groups were formed all over Balochistan and

867
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,760

868
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,519

869
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,519
started attacking Pakistani forces, police posts, railways, telecommunications, government supply lines etc.

870
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,240
Pakistan also responded by carrying out air

871
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,159
strikes etc. and a deadlock like

872
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,159
situation was created because everyone in the mountains

873
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,760
knew everything about it.  It became

874
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,880
very difficult for Pakistani forces to fight them.

875
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,919
So, in frustration, on the First of July 1970,

876
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,919
General Ya Khan ended the One Unit Policy.

877
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,360
Now when this policy was removed, the

878
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,200
first general elections were to be held in Pakistan on 7th of December 1970.

879
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,039
So these general

880
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,039
elections were to be held in all the provinces.

881
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,960
So it had to happen inside Balochistan too.

882
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,760
So what the Balochis did was that they

883
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,480

884
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,480
voted for their local parties like NAP, JUI and got them elected and at the same time,

885
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,399
East Pakistan,

886
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
which is today's Bangladesh, also slipped out of the hands of Pakistan.

887
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,039
Now as soon as East

888
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,039
Pakistan i.e. Bangladesh separated from Pakistan.  So the

889
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,960
entire constitution of Pakistan ended

890
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,519
and a new constitution had to be made.  So

891
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,960
for this, the local parties of Balochistan

892
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,960
were NAP and JUI.  The support of the one who had won the election was

893
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,039
also needed.

894
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
Bangladesh had separated just a few days ago.  So now

895
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,960
Pakistan shows some leniency.  So

896
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,480
here Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

897
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,399

898
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,399

899
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,320
needed the support of the winning parties in Balochistan to make the constitution.  So Zulfikar Ali

900
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,159
Bhutto influenced the

901
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,159
political parties of Balochistan.

902
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,560
Baloch leader

903
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,679
Ataullah Mengal was made the CM of Buchistan.

904
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,839
Ghosh Bakhsh was made the governor

905
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,480
and the

906
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,879
different people who lived in the rest of Balochistan were made heads of that area.  The

907
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,720
Baloch were very happy with this

908
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,879
and the winning Baloch parties gave the kind of support that Pakistan needed in making the constitution

909
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,480

910
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,879
and after all this was

911
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,520
settled, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

912
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,839
became the PM of Pakistan and

913
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,440
a few days after that, i.e. on 10th February

914
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,079
1973, the political party of Balochistan,

915
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,320
NAP, was banned and a full

916
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,639
scale military operation was started.   The

917
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,200
army settled in every nook and corner of Balochistan.

918
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,200
Bhutto said that this NAP

919
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,879
political party of the Balochis was

920
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,720
committing treason and planning in connivance with foreign countries.

921
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,639
And this

922
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,040
entire military operation took place in this entire

923
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,040
area, in which thousands of people lost their lives.

924
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,520

925
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,359
Crackdown started on Baloch journalists, students, activists and Sardars.

926
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,079
Now after this,

927
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,240
guerilla warfare started at various places in Balochistan.

928
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,240
 

929
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,560
Somehow,

930
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,359
Ziaul Haq made a basic deal for some time.  After

931
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,599
talking to all the Sardars,

932
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,960
high posts in the government were given to them.  So

933
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,359
this thing remained true for quite some time.  But by the year 2000, the

934
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,440
Balochs again set up a strong army.

935
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,440
Balochistan Liberation Army

936
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,760
BLA.  This BALA which was created by the Balochs was

937
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,680
their most organised method of fighting till now.

938
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
And what was happening in Pakistan at this time was

939
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,000
that Balochistan was a

940
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,160
strategic area.  So Pakistan

941
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,480
along with China made a deal to

942
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,880
build a port in Gwadar, an area in Balochistan.

943
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,359
Their plan was that this would

944
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,280
become an international trade hub.  Secondly,

945
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,760
this will make it easier for India to counter as well.

946
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
But seeing all these things the Baloch were

947
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,160
becoming very frustrated.  He

948
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,320
said that

949
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,320
without taking even a single Baloch leader into confidence, they started this Gadar Port

950
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,160
area in collaboration with the Chinese.  The

951
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,400
second thing that was done in this

952
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,599
deal was that in the jobs that were to be given,

953
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,680

954
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,000
instead of hiring people from the local Baloch community, Chinese and people from Pakistan’s Punjab

955
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,640
Province were hired.  On top of that, a

956
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,400
permanent settlement of the Army was made in this entire area.

957
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,800
And some time before this,

958
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,599

959
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,760
gold and copper were also found in Chagai district of Balochistan.  Reserves of 42 million tonnes were

960
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,760
found.  Here too Pakistan

961
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,240
worked in collaboration with Chinese engineers.

962
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,920
Whatever profit was made.

963
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,560
China took 50% of that.  Pakistan took 48%

964
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,200
and Buchistan got only 2%.

965
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,640
Seeing all this, the Baloch became very

966
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,280
frustrated and the group they had

967
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,280
formed, BALA, carried out back to back attacks.  The

968
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,880
workers working at Gwadar Port, the

969
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,119
infrastructure there, the

970
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
gas pipeline and the Chinese workers were all

971
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,280
attacked.  Later on C Pack was also

972
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,520
started.  In this, Pakistan

973
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,760
along with the Chinese had invested 60 billion dollars.  The

974
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,880
plan was to start

975
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,760

976
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,160
roads, railways, energy pipelines, fibre

977
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,599
optics, special economic zones from China's Kajagar to Gwadar Port in Balochistan.

978
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,079
And it was said

979
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,079
that Balochistan will now become Dubai.

980
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,079
But here also the same problem was there.  Here

981
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,560
also the Baloch were ignored.

982
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,800
First, land was acquired from local Balochs for a low price.

983
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,880

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Instead of giving jobs to local people, Chinese were hired.

985
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,440
People came from Punjab province of Pakistan.  A permanent army was

986
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,440
maintained.  The fisherman was removed.  Whatever

987
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,680
employment he had, he lost it all.  So this

988
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,520
entire Gwadar Port, CPEC and the whole

989
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,720
system that was running, BLA,

990
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,280
did so much damage to CPEC that

991
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,200
so many Chinese were killed in Balochistan for many years to come.   The

992
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,359
situation had become such that China itself

993
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,440
said that if we have to complete this peace deal, then

994
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,000
we will have to send our own army.  Now,

995
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,240
by 2018, the Baloch people who were fighting, had

996
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,160
understood one thing that by

997
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,599
forming different groups, we are

998
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,680
fighting for our own interests.  They are waging guerilla

999
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
warfare.  This is only causing loss to us.

1000
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,359
We should be united because we are demanding a separate

1001
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,520
country so we should be united.

1002
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,160
We should have a separate army.

1003
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Only then will we be able to defeat Pakistan and

1004
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,440
separate Balochistan.  So what did they do?  B

1005
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,440
R A S Baloch Raji Ajoi Sanghat.

1006
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,760
Created a structure with this name.  Basically,

1007
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,760
all the fighters from Balochistan, fighting

1008
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
groups, small people who were

1009
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,720
attacking Pakistan by forming separate groups,

1010
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,440
all of them were gathered together and

1011
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,680
high profile attacks were carried out in a coordinated manner which caused a lot of

1012
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,000
damage.  The entire project of Seapack was

1013
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,320

1014
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,359
put on hold by the Chinese in this attack.  And now, by the

1015
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,680
year 2025, after making these BRAS, these people have

1016
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,920

1017
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,640
increased the frequency of attacks even more.  This year, this

1018
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,640
BRAS has formed the Baloch National

1019
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Army (BNA).  Considering itself as a

1020
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,760
country, it is fighting Pakistan like an army.

1021
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,320
This BNA has caused a lot of damage.  A

1022
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,000
total of 72 coordinated attacks were carried out

1023
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,520
on Pakistani forces.  Because of which it

1024
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,599
no longer seems like some small

1025
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,839
guerilla warfare is going on.  It seems as

1026
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,000
if the armies of two countries are fighting face to face.

1027
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,119
Just a few days ago, on 11 March

1028
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,160
2025, Zafar Express train was going from Kota to Peshawar.  There

1029
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,079
were 450 people.  As soon as the train

1030
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,720
reached Bolan Pass.  They had

1031
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,800
planted 8 KG IED bomb on the railway track

1032
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,599
and as soon as the blast occurred the train derailed.

1033
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,520
As soon as the train landed, BLA fighters took over the

1034
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,599
entire train.

1035
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
They left behind the women, children and the Baloch community

1036
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
but took the rest captive and took over the entire

1037
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,359
train.  Now when this

1038
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,200
incident happened, Pakistan said that

1039
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,359
our political prisoners should be released within 48 hours.

1040
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,520
But when they were not

1041
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,320
released then Pakistan

1042
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,560
launched an operation.  The operation continued for a long time.  Then

1043
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,560
Pakistan said that 64 people lost their lives in this operation.

1044
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,560
BLA said that

1045
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,720
they have killed more than 50 Pakistani army

1046
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,720
officers.  Now after this attack the

1047
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,560
situation has become much worse in this region.

1048
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,240
Security has been increased in this entire region.

1049
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,160
Pakistan has increased the presence of its army.

1050
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,000
Drones are flying throughout the area.

1051
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,000
And the biggest problem that has arisen for Pakistan at this time is

1052
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,160
that they are

1053
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,040
not able to understand that they should

1054
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,960
fight the Balochs with weapons.  This should be done to stop them

1055
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
or political dialogues should be held with them.

1056
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,520
And along with this, many other equations are also

1057
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,599
going on in it.  The strategic location of Balochistan is

1058
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,680
very important.  It

1059
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,359
shares its border with Iran and Afghanistan.

1060
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,440
Foreign players have also joined in this who are

1061
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,200
supporting Balochistan.  India and

1062
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,960
Pakistan are already thirsty for each other's blood.

1063
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
But USA's name is also coming up

1064
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
in this that

1065
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Bhutistan will

1066
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,720
become a very important player for the US to counter Iran and Afghanistan

1067
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,960
if it gets separated from Pakistan.  Now

1068
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,280
see what will happen next?  Only time

1069
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,280
will tell.  But Pakistan has never been

1070
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,880
more troubled by the Balochs than it is at this particular time.

1071
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,359
In the end let me

1072
