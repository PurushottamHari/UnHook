Hello Friends.  Friends, for the last few days you must have been continuously hearing about the F-35 fighter jet.  The reason for this is that it landed in India on 14th June and it has been only 7 days now. It has not been able to fly back yet. Earlier it was being said that there was some shortage of fuel here.  Then it was said that something went wrong and it will be fixed soon.  But as of now it is stuck at Trivandrum airport. And see, here we talk about F-35 which is considered to be the best fifth generation stage fighter jet in the world. So what is it here that has gone wrong?  Questions are being raised regarding this. Now what is this is that it is kept in the open. Because there is a lot of discussion about its secrets and what things are there inside it and if you see, the UK Navy has refused to take help from India.  India was ready for everything.  You can buy a hanger, even if you need technical help.  So they are like no no no you stay away from our fighter jets. So you will get to see such situations. So, let us discuss this in some detail, what is happening at this time?  What is the present situation?  And what is the secrecy here?  Why do these people repeatedly say to stay away?  Meaning, this fighter jet cannot be placed anywhere.  So you will get to know a lot. But before that friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC next year 2026, must avail our Pratigya batch, use code Ankit Live to get maximum discount. Whatever information you need related to this batch, you can call on this number, all your doubts will be cleared, our personal team is on this and if you have any problem, you will be able to avail this batch by calling on this number and optional courses are also available here.  If you want, you can take it.  Let's get started.   The first question is what exactly happened?  See, on 14th June, the UK's Royal Navy F35B Lighting stealth fighter jet made an emergency landing at Trivandrum International Airport and this air aircraft is basically the carrier of UK's HMS Prince of Wales, you can see, this aircraft carrier was returning, as you all know, the fighter jets are deployed there.  In a way, it is a mobile airbase. So where it can land, it can take off. So this fighter jet was deployed on the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier and basically you can say that these people keep carrying out various operations like surveillance etc. and this was available in the Indian Ocean.  So when it was returning, something went wrong with it and the nearest airport was Thiruvananthapuram and it landed there and as I told you earlier it was being said about the fuel that there was a shortage of fuel, so the landing was done, later now it is being said that some things can go wrong due to some hydraulic failure, bad weather conditions and this is very important that you see, the climatic conditions of India and the surrounding areas are quite different, if you compare it with European countries, then there can be many reasons due to which it had to be landed at the nearest airport. Now why is this incident so significant?  Why is this being given so much importance?  Why is this being talked about?  See F35 B as I was telling you it is one of the most advanced and highly classified.  This is very important.  Meaning that the western countries do not want to expose to anyone what things are available in it and what are not.  So this is the most highly classified fighter J jet in the whole world.  It was the first time that an unscheduled landing of UK's F35B has been made in India.  And this aircraft, as I told you, is currently parked in the open.  You can see this, it is parked in the open in Thiruvananthapuram. Meaning everyone can see it. Due to which global interest has been aroused and you will see a lot of interest in its sensitive technologies, its stealth coating, which means that it remains hidden from radar. By the way, it is also being said that the radar system of our Indian forces had also caught it. Well, whatever it is here, its radar coat i.e. cells coating is considered to be quite superior. It has the facility of vertical take off and landing. Think about it; we are talking about vertical take off and landing, which is very useful in aircraft carriers.  Then in addition to this the sensors got fused, it became an AI based combat system.  There is a lot of interest in this about all of this. Well, what did India offer?  See, as I told you, it was parked in the open when it landed.  Keeping this in view, what is Air India's hangar hangar ?  If any aircraft needs to be maintained or parked at a safe place, a hangar like this is built where it is kept under and if any repair work etc. has to be done, it can be done easily by closing it. This is called hanger.  So after the emergency landing, Air India offered its own hangar at Thiruvananthapuram airport so that it could be kept away due to weather, dust and public visibility. It should be kept protected. But the UK Royal Navy rejected this offer. Now there can be many reasons for this.  The first thing is that the F35B contains top secret stealth and iononic systems which are kept very secret. And who developed it?  This was done by Lockheed Martin and NATO alliance.  And basically, if you see, it is not usually parked in a civilian hangar. Because if we assume that UK's F35B is parked inside a hangar in India.  So now the UK will have this fear and in fact the NATO alliance will have this fear.  America will be afraid that India might get hold of that technology.  Meaning, whatever material is there in it, we cannot see it here through surveillance.  Photography, drone footage could be a lot of things. It should be kept away from civilian mechanics and staff.  There should be no interference of electronic signals.  So NATO and US protocol says that it cannot be kept in non- military certified facilities. Meaning the fear is that his secrets will be leaked.  Then secondly here is the operational sobriety, meaning only those people who are authorized engineers can work on F35. You need military grade clearance.  The UK Navy has a sovereign maintenance chain. Meaning, only military contractors can go there or anywhere near it. Even touching the fuselage.  It means that the main body part of the aircraft, the main structure, in a way no one else is allowed to touch it. Meaning it is kept under such strict protocol.  Secondly, here the issue of insurance also comes into play, suppose it is parked in some hangar in India and tomorrow a fire breaks out there, something falls, debris, or anything happens, then a lot of issues can arise regarding it. Because they are not insured. Especially for military stealth fighters worth more than $ million, any type of incident or leakage could cause problems.  So diplomatic protocol basically says that foreign military aircraft will protect the host nation but will not mix with civilian aviation.  So most likely this can also be a big reason.  Then secondly here is this, suppose if this is kept in the hangar as I told you, then there are many footage, photos, etc., as they say, military PR typically wants to keep away the civilian media exposure.  So this is a civilian hangar.  So if anything gets leaked from there then there could be trouble again. So these are all the reasons.  Well now the question here is what is happening now ?  First of all, let me tell you that this F35B fighter jet of UK has been currently kept under the security of CISF.  That means the CISF is deployed nearby 247, meaning they are protecting it so that no issue arises and the maintenance crew reached there from the UK aircraft carrier.  In fact it is also being said that he also tried to do many things. Things haven't gone well yet. Hydraulic module failures can be a number of things.  Suppose if things do not go well then it is possible that military transport aircraft will be called in.  After putting it inside it, whatever is there will be taken back.  So there are a lot of possibilities here.  But for now, as I told you, it has been kept under CISF protection 247 so that no civilian can have access there. And they are also shielding the technical crew tents etc.  The important parts etc. were being protected when it was being dismantled and manufactured. CCTV surveillance has also been installed so that no one can say in the future that something wrong has happened there. Well now the question is what is its broader implication?  First of all, look, India has allowed these things to happen.  So, you will see the sign of the exchange between India and UK which is a deep strategic trust. So in a way it also gives reassurance that yes, tomorrow if any of our fighter jets face any issue then it can stop there.  If they have any issue then they can keep it. Then secondly here the biggest problem now is for the F35.  As I was telling you, it is considered to be the best fighter jet in the world.  It is very powerful and in a way, the technical issues arising in it, especially in such things, show that this fighter jet can work. May be one of the best.  But what happens is that the climatic conditions are such that India was working in the Indian Ocean.  There may be some issues during heavy monsoon rains.  So there is a huge requirement of technical support infrastructure here. If suppose tomorrow India thinks of buying or leasing whatever it is, then somewhere or the other all these things will come into focus now.  A dedicated landing site may be required for this.  Its maintenance chain is quite expensive.  So many factors are now slowly getting exposed. And this is somewhere strategic for India too, the geography of India also shows here that it is growing rapidly. Like Trivandrum used to be a minor airport once.  So if we look at today's date, it will also be known as Strategic Emergency Base where it landed.  This is how things happened.  So there are many things.  Well, if I tell you an interesting fact about F35, it is the only stealth jet in the world capable of vertical take off and landing.  There is no other fifth generation steel jet in which you will get to see such technology.  It is used by the US Marine Corps, Royal Navy and Japan. In this you get distributed aperture system, electro optical targeting, helmet mounted display and such classified things about which the world has no knowledge. This is the first known incident of a fighter fifth generation fighter jet used by a Western power. He has been landed at a civilian airport in India. So let's see now what comes forward regarding this.  But I hope that I told you whatever I had known till now and before leaving, there is a very interesting question, the project CATS of Indian Air Force, CATS it refers to what basically you have to tell from four options and the right answer to this, you all know, will be available on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Twitter and friends, as you all know, if you want to take Pratigya batch, in which if you crack even the prelims, then your entire fee is refunded.
