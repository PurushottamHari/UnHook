00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello Friends.  Friends, for the last few

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,560
days you must have been continuously hearing about the F-35 fighter jet.  The

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,200
reason for this is

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,080
that it landed in India on 14th June

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
and it has been only 7 days now.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,480
It has not been able to fly back yet.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
Earlier it was being said that there was some

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
shortage of fuel here.  Then it was said that something went

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,519
wrong and it will be fixed soon.  But as

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,920
of now it is stuck at Trivandrum airport.

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,599
And see, here we talk about

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,160
F-35 which is

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
considered to be the best fifth generation stage fighter jet in the world.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,480
So what is it here that has

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,800
gone wrong?  Questions are being raised regarding this.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,399
Now what is this is that it is kept in the open.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Because there is

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
a lot of discussion about its secrets and

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
what things are there inside it and if you

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,680
see, the UK Navy has refused to

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,440
take help from India.  India was ready

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
for everything.  You can buy a hanger, even if you

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,680
need technical help.  So they are like

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,440
no no no you stay away from our fighter jets.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
So you will get to see such situations.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
So, let us discuss this in some detail,

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,280
what is happening at this

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,600
time?  What is the present situation?  And

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
what is the secrecy here?  Why do these

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,000
people repeatedly say to stay away?  Meaning,

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
this fighter jet cannot be

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
placed anywhere.  So you will get to know a lot.

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,000
But before that friends, let me

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
tell you all that those of you who are

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600

courses are also available here.  If you want,

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
you can take it.  Let's get started.   The

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,920
first question is what

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,600
exactly happened?  See, on 14th June, the UK's

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,399
Royal Navy F35B Lighting stealth

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,200
fighter jet made an emergency landing

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,920
at Trivandrum International Airport and this

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,719
air aircraft is basically the

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,119
carrier of UK's HMS Prince of Wales,

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,880
you can see, this

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
aircraft carrier was returning, as you all know, the

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
fighter jets are

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,119
deployed there.  In a way, it is a mobile airbase.

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
So where it

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,239
can land, it can take off.

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
So this fighter jet was deployed on the HMS Prince of Wales

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,200
aircraft carrier

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
and basically you can say

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
that these people keep carrying out various operations like surveillance etc. and

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,599
this was available in the Indian Ocean.  So when

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
it was returning, something went

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,239
wrong with it and the nearest

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
airport was Thiruvananthapuram

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,239
and it landed there and as

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
I told you earlier it was being

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,760
said about the fuel that there was a shortage of fuel,

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,680
so the landing was done, later now it is being

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
said that some things can go wrong due to some hydraulic failure,

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,519
bad weather conditions and this is very important that you

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
see, the climatic conditions of India and the surrounding areas are

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
quite different,

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,519
if you compare it with European countries, then there

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,760
can be many reasons due to which

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
it had to be landed at the nearest airport.

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,000
Now why is this incident so

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
significant?  Why is this being given so much

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
importance?  Why is this being

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
talked about?  See F35 B as I was

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,480
telling you it is one of the most

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
advanced and highly classified.  This

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
is very important.  Meaning that the western countries do

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,959
not want to expose to

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
anyone what

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
things are available in it and what are not.  So this is the

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,319
most highly classified fighter J jet in the whole

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,720
world.  It was the first time that an

93
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,760
unscheduled landing of

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,440
UK's F35B has been made in India.  And this

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,440
aircraft, as I told you, is

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
currently parked in the open.  You can see this,

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
it is parked in the open in Thiruvananthapuram.

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Meaning everyone can see it.

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,799
Due to which global interest has been

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
aroused and

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,720

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
you will see a lot of interest in its sensitive technologies, its

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,879
stealth coating, which means that it remains hidden from radar.

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
By the way, it is also being said

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,680
that the radar system of our Indian forces had

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,720
also caught it.

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,879
Well, whatever it is here, its radar coat

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,120
i.e. cells coating is considered to be quite superior.

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,439
It has the facility of vertical take off

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
and landing. Think about it;

111
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
we are talking about vertical take off and landing,

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
which is

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,879
very useful in aircraft carriers.  Then in

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
addition to this the sensors got fused, it became an AI based

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,600
combat system.  There is a lot of interest in this about all of this.

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Well, what did India

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,160
offer?  See, as I told you, it

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
was parked in the open when it landed.  Keeping this in

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
view, what is Air India's hangar hangar

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
?  If any aircraft needs to be

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,479
maintained or parked

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,240
at a safe place, a hangar like this is built

123
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,160
where it is kept under

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
and if any repair work etc. has to be done,

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
it can be done easily by closing it.

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,560
This is called hanger.  So

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
after the emergency landing, Air India offered its own

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,759
hangar

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,400
at Thiruvananthapuram airport so that it could be kept away due to weather, dust and

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,479
public visibility.

131
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
It should be kept protected.

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,199
But the UK Royal Navy rejected this offer.

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,320
Now there can be many reasons for this.  The

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,280
first thing is that the F35B

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,199
contains top secret stealth and iononic

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
systems which are kept very secret.

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
And who developed it?  This was done

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
by Lockheed Martin and NATO alliance.  And basically, if you see,

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,639
it is not usually parked in a civilian hangar.

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,680
Because if we assume that

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,479
UK's F35B is parked

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,400
inside a hangar in India.  So now the UK will have

144
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
this fear and in fact the NATO alliance will have

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
this fear.  America will be afraid that India might get hold of

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,199
that technology.  Meaning, whatever

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,120
material is there in it, we

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
cannot see it here through surveillance.  Photography,

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
drone footage could be a lot of things.

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,880
It should be kept away from civilian mechanics and staff.  There should

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,120
be no interference of electronic signals.  So NATO and US

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,000
protocol says that it cannot be kept in non-

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,639
military certified facilities.

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Meaning the fear is

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,280
that his secrets will be leaked.  Then

157
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,560
secondly here is the operational sobriety,

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,360
meaning only those people who are authorized engineers can work on F35.

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,440

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,639
You need military grade clearance.  The UK

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Navy has a sovereign maintenance chain.

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
Meaning, only military contractors

163
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
can go there or anywhere near it.

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Even touching the fuselage.  It means that the

165
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,759
main body part of the aircraft, the

166
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
main structure, in a way no one

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,479
else is allowed to touch it.

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Meaning it is

169
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
kept under such strict protocol.  Secondly,

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,039
here the issue of insurance also comes into play,

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,639
suppose it is parked in some hangar in India and

172
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,120
tomorrow a

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,520
fire breaks out there, something falls, debris, or anything happens, then

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
a lot of issues can arise regarding it.

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,319
Because they are not insured.

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
Especially for military stealth fighters worth more than $ million,

177
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
any

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
type of incident or leakage

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
could cause problems.  So diplomatic

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
protocol basically says that foreign

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,080
military aircraft

182
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,919
will protect the host nation but will

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
not mix with civilian aviation.  So most likely

184
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
this can also be a big reason.  Then secondly

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
here is this, suppose if this is

186
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
kept in the hangar as I told you, then there are

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,599
many footage, photos, etc., as they

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,680
say, military PR typically

189
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680

190
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
wants to keep away the civilian media exposure.  So this

191
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,840
is a civilian hangar.  So if anything gets leaked from there then there

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
could be trouble again.

193
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
So these are all the reasons.  Well now the question

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
here is what is happening now

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
?  First of all, let me tell you that this

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,800
F35B fighter jet of UK has been currently

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,240
kept under the security of CISF.  That means the

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,160
CISF is deployed nearby 247,

199
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
meaning they are protecting it so that no

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
issue arises and the maintenance

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
crew reached there from the UK aircraft carrier.  In

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
fact it is also being said

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,080
that he also tried to do many things.

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
Things haven't gone well yet.

205
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
Hydraulic module failures

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
can be a number of things.  Suppose if

207
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,919
things do not go well then it is possible that

208
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
military transport aircraft will be

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,639
called in.  After putting it inside it, whatever

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
is there will be taken back.  So there are a lot of

211
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,560
possibilities here.  But for now,

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,720
as I told you, it has been

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,039
kept under CISF protection 247 so that no

214
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
civilian can have access there.

215
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
And they are also shielding the technical crew tents etc.  The

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
important parts etc. were being protected when it was being dismantled and

218
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,160
manufactured.

219
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,639
CCTV surveillance has also been installed

220
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
so that no one

221
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
can say in the future that something wrong has happened there.

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,440
Well now the question is what is its broader

223
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,160
implication?  First of all, look,

224
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,360
India has allowed these things to happen.  So,

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,080

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,160
you will see the sign of the exchange between India and UK which is a deep strategic trust.

227
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,160
So in a way it also gives reassurance

228
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
that yes, tomorrow if any of our

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
fighter jets face any issue then it can stop there.  If

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
they have any issue then they can keep it.

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
Then secondly here the biggest

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,839
problem now is for the F35.  As I was

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,479
telling you, it is considered to be the best fighter

234
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
jet in the world.  It is very powerful and in

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,440
a way, the technical issues arising in it,

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,839
especially in such things, show

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
that this fighter jet can work.

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,839
May be one of the best.  But what

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,000
happens is that the climatic conditions are

240
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
such that India was working in the Indian Ocean.  There

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480

242
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,760
may be some issues during heavy monsoon rains.  So there is a

243
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
huge requirement of technical support infrastructure here.

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
If suppose

245
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,000
tomorrow India thinks of buying or

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
leasing whatever it is, then somewhere or the other

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
all these things will come into focus now.  A

248
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
dedicated landing site may be required

249
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
for this.  Its maintenance chain is quite

250
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
expensive.  So many

251
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,519
factors are now slowly getting exposed.

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
And this is somewhere strategic for India

253
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,680
too, the

254
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
geography of India also

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
shows here that it is growing rapidly.

256
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Like Trivandrum used to be a minor

257
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
airport once.  So if we look at today's date, it will

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680

259
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,600
also be known as Strategic Emergency Base where it

260
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
landed.  This is how things happened.  So there

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
are many things.  Well,

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
if I tell you an interesting fact

263
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,920
about F35, it is the only stealth jet in the

264
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,000
world capable of vertical take off and

265
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
landing.  There is no other

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160
fifth generation steel jet in which you will get to

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,560
see such technology.  It is used by the US

268
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Marine Corps, Royal Navy and Japan.

269
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
In this you get

270
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
distributed aperture system, electro

271
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
optical targeting, helmet mounted

272
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
display and such classified things

273
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,560
about which the world has no knowledge.

274
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,279
This is the first known incident of a

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,880
fighter fifth generation fighter jet

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,959
used by a Western power.

277
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,040
He has been landed at a civilian airport in India.

278
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
So let's see now what

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,720
comes forward regarding this.  But I hope that

280
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,240

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,079
I told you whatever I had known till now and before leaving, there is a very

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,880
interesting question, the project CATS of Indian Air Force,

283
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,880
CATS it

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,399
refers to what basically

285
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,760
you have to tell from four options and the right answer to this,

286
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,279
you all know, will be available on my Instagram,
