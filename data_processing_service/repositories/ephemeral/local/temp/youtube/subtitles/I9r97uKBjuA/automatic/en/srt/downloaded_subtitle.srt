people have built a road here by installing wooden doors.

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,400
I have told you earlier also that two big

59

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,680
nothing left here except garbage.   There

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,239
is a problem of drug addiction here.  The

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,120
biggest problem is drug addiction, and

63
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,080
crime is caused by drug addiction.  There are more intoxicants here than the number of castes.

n't take drugs, you will talk nicely.  I

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,159

where will you find work?  Where will he talk properly

72
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,319

73
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,130

the doctor

not able to walk the next day. So the

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,240
I uploaded my brand logo and

116
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,880
got its color palette.  Then

117
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,759

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,780

one ever listened to him, neither his family nor the

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
why do you make videos in such streets, in such places

161
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,760
?  This is dirty.  But are the

162
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,680
people living here not humans?  These streets have

163
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,279

when did you start doing it, it's

173

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,040
we are addicted to only whitener or nothing

178
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,320
It lasts for 3-4 hours.  How much do you take

179
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:59,200
in a day?  One or two times at the most,

₹120 is spent on the bottle every day.  Yes.

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes, gutkhavak in a bottle for ₹100

182
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,200
and mother says that yours

183
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,680
asks me to quit, she beats me for drugs,

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:16,240
all the family members shout at me, I beat her, I ca

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,720
n't stop myself now, yes I don't hide, I

186
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,600
take my hand back like that,

189
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,399
well it is clear here that living here is

190
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,040
deadly and dangerous.  But the irony is

191
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,079
that the government has decided that out of the

192
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,760
300 acre mountain here, half of it, i.e.

193
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,399
124 acres, will be cleared and the

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,200
people of Dharavi, i.e. other slums, will be sent here.  Meaning,

195
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,079
instead of removing people from here, they will

196
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,640
bring more people here and put them in danger.

197
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,959
This garbage is 40 meters high, which is more than a 12-

198
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,140
storey building, and it

199
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:08,760
might take 12 to 14 years to clean it

[Music].

201
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,279
In this mountain, you will find wet and dry waste together,

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,800
which people segregate and sell to

203
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,120
earn Rs. 1200.  But this work is not easy.

204
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,120
Many people have lost their lives doing this.

205
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Some people have even come under the bulldozer.  Many

206
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:40,880
people suffered multiple injuries.

[MUSIC]

208
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
This is a long tease but my whole leg wo

209
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
n't close.  Now the leg doesn't close.

210
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,560
No, it is not stopping completely.  Earlier it would

211
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,920
not stop even for a little while.  Right now,

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,079
say this much is happening.  Yes.  And when did you feel this?  It's done.  It's

213
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
been six months.  What were

214
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,480
you doing when it happened?  I was working.  He had gone

215
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,519
to the mountain to count the work.  Yes.  The

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,399
work of picking.  Yes.  I am not able to work.   I

217
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,760
can't walk.  Look, don't fall and break everything.

218
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,839

219
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,160
We think that only

220
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
people from other cities live in such places.  But it

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,880
is not like that.  There are many such communities in Mumbai itself

222
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,120
which are not accepted by their own family members.

223
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,760
Society does not accept it.  So these

224
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,000
houses provide them shelter.  One of them is the

225
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,399
transgender community of Mumbai.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,160
God sent us into this world

227
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,839
just to make us laugh and feel happy.

228
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Never sent it to hurt anyone.

229
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,880
People would chase us away, people would abuse us.

230
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,040
People look at me with dirty eyes, I do

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,600
n't care about all that.  We live with the support of just one Allah and one

232
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,200
God, neither people accepted us,

233
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,639
 

234
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,519
nor any relative, nor brother or sister, then I

235
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,440
came to him, then he supported me,

236
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,560
talked to my family members, so now that you have

237
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,920
got a home, what is the definition of home for you?

238
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,760
As far as I believe,

239
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,160
for people like us, even our parents' home doesn't exist.

240
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,200
Why?  These things still happen sometimes.

241
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,040
Hey, this is a eunuch right?  This will give us some progeny.  If we

242
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,519
look at home, this is our home.

243
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,000
All these eunuchs of us are here.  This is who

244
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,760
we are.  This is our home, these are our

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
parents, this is our support.  understand.  If we

246
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,519
get even a hut along with a eunuch, it

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,519
is a luxurious palace for us.   There are

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,000
many issues here, hence there are people

249
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,240
who write songs and rap on these issues

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
and then spread these issues to the entire world.  The

251
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,399
journey starts from the ground to the

252
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
sky.  This art of the pen is peace for the soul.

Darkness is the light on the path in life.   He does

254
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,639
n't let me stay with my mother.   I do

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,360
n't talk about age, I don't keep a distance from people,

256
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,079
whatever they say behind my back, today I don't ask

257
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,560
questions from me, but don't listen to the answers, yes,

258
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,639
I know a lot, but I will reveal my secrets, when

259
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,120
I was five years old, I

260
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,240
started writing a diary because I was alone, I didn't have any

261
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,800
friends and then after that that

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,839
thing started coming in the form of art, that

263
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,320
way of writing a diary, that writing poetry, after that

264
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,160
I started rapping, my father is

265
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
very proud of me, I am his son,

266
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,760
he always comes to pick me up,

267
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,519
whenever the performance is over at night, he does

268
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,079
n't come to the performance and I

269
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,480
think it is good, meaning he should

270
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,440
not come to the performance till it is not

271
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,079
too big, till there is

272
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
no crowd of lakhs, it is the

273
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,440
month of Ramadan right now, meaning

274
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,000
more than 70% of the population here

275
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,000
keeps fast, how difficult it would be to

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,279
stay without drinking water for the whole day, without eating food, from

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,160
4:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the night, going and

278
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:01,920
breaking the fast, it is not easy in this place, we

279
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,240
break the fast with dates

280
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,399
because our profiteering people

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,000
prefer this.  And this is also a superstition,

282
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,560
people only know that

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,760
in the slums there is only drug addiction, crime,

284
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,600
fighting, it is not like that

285
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
but there are a lot of

286
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
talented people in the slums.  Our movies

287
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,399
tell us that there

288
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,839
are and will be lots of gangsters, crime, drugs in these streets.

289
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,519
 

290
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,760
But movies do not tell that

291
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,120
tuition centres also run in these same streets.

292
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,680
One of which is this, which is run by the youth here for the youth here.

293
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,399

294
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,920
More than 100 children come to this tuition centre every day.

295
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,760
Read with hope.  It is

296
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,079
important for children to study so that

297
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,160
in the future they

298
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,800

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,759
can think better about their lives, their families, and their area.  He is helping his own family, his

300
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,240
people and the people in the neighbourhood.  If

301
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,839
someone is better educated, then

302
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,480
I would like my children too to become each other

303
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,639
's strength and not their weakness.   There are

304
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
many children here who have very

305
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
good talent but they cannot go out

306
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,000
because of their circumstances or because of the people.  Even

307
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,320
if someone leaves, it is

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,360
suppressed by saying this.  It means that he should

309
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,320
come from such an area where there is a lot of violence,

310
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:27,959
hashish and marijuana, or he will also keep doing the same thing.

311
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,959
So it is not put back.

313
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
Many of you might have already written in the comments

314
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,759
that people here are like this.

315
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,920
These will not change.  So I will

316
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:42,880
ask them, do lotuses not grow in insects?

317
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,519
These children were born here and grew up here.  But if they

318
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,240
still hope for change, then

319
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,399
why can't we?  Why can't we ask our government and the

320
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,440
country whether change is not possible here

321
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
