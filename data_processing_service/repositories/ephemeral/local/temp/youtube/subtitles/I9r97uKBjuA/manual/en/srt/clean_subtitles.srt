All these houses are built on garbage [music].  There's this house and right in front of it is [MUSIC] creek.  This one scene will tell you why life expectancy here is half that of the rest of India.  It is the lowest in entire Mumbai.  Here a person cannot live more than 40 years. handle it [MUSIC] our life is a dog.  Do you understand dog ? Water is not as easily available as intoxicants. This is the largest dumping ground not only of India but of entire Asia. This is also India's oldest dumping ground. Built during the British period, today it is bigger than 200 football fields.  This is our Mumbai's Danar dumping ground which is also home to 2 lakh people. All the houses here are made of blue tin which can break at any time and also leaks during rain.  The rooms in these houses are very small but in many houses up to six to seven people live. Most of the people here work in attaching glass to clothes.  Children also get Rs. 6 to 8 for each piece of clothing. [Music] Somewhere here the road itself has become a drain.  Meaning, the dirty water from the gutter has come on the road.  That's why people have built a road here by installing wooden doors. People coming and going face trouble. We people also suffer.  Water is filled all around.  Where should the man come from? Everybody gets hurt.  Be it big or small.  The children face the most problems because they have to go to and come from school. My leg has been bad since I was one and a half years old. What happened, tell me, if it happened because of polio, what difficulties does a handicapped person face? It is very difficult to walk, look at the pipes, look at the dirt, you can see the dirt and insects keep crawling around, there are a lot of holes here, there is a dug pit, there are a lot of problems here and I have also fallen many times, look, the gutter is broken, my brother has also fallen after falling [Music] and was this always a drain or was it ever clean ?  This was very clean.  This was very clear water. I have told you earlier also that two big boats and ships used to go together.  Now there is nothing left here except garbage.   There is a problem of drug addiction here.  The biggest problem is drug addiction, and crime is caused by drug addiction.  There are more intoxicants here than the number of castes. Ganja, Sulli drugs, even white drugs have reached here.  The only problem is addiction.  If you do n't take drugs, you will talk nicely.  I will go to work.  If you remain famous for your addiction, where will you find work?  Where will he talk properly ?  What happened to the eye?  Our old man got into a fight while drunk and lost his eye.  The man broke his eye while drunk. [MUSIC] People pass through this dirty drain water every day. Children play in it.  There are flies. So it is justified.  It is obvious that people suffer from many diseases too. [Music] One day in his childhood he had a fever so he went to a doctor and the doctor gave him an injection of polio. Because of that his leg got damaged and he was not able to walk the next day. So the police took him to jail, that is the police took him to the doctor and said to him that until this child gets well, he will remain in jail. Greetings. [MUSIC] Water is a great illusion. Sometimes water doesn't even come.  It comes dirty. red Yellow.  Yes, red and yellow water comes. Red yellow water.  Drinking water comes to homes through these pipes. Just two hours every day.  But these pipes are attached to the gutter drain. [MUSIC] It's so expensive.  In some days it seems that in this area, water will be available at the price of petrol.  what do you do by the way sir?  I do sewing work.   I work as a labourer.  Sometimes it happens that one has to go to the company and take a bath. Because there is no water here.

Even today madam I beg.  So this house of mine is also built with donations.  What is your definition of a home ?  What is home? Home  The big people are rich.  He has a very big dream.  Our dream is small.  The rooms were broken in 2004, so our fight started in 2004. That's what I want to say brother.  If you want to destroy something, ruin the poor, then first kill the poor.  Anyway they are lying dead [music] poor people and these mosquitoes, because of mosquitoes I have to get admitted in the hospital every ten days because mosquitoes bite and I get typhoid and malaria, why are you always crying, you mean you are alone like this, I am alone, I have a disease, and I had a son, he died by hanging himself, he was young and whatever he has, he is within himself.  We have God and you people.  Nothing else, son.  Come on son, this is my house.  Poor food. This is a house which is home to the Danar dumping ground.  My aunt lives here.  She lives alone.  She cooks food.  Here, water is kept in a vessel.  There is a place for urinating here and this room gets filled with water during the rainy season. This is the first time that we turned on the camera and as soon as we did it, tears started flowing from the person's eyes. This shows that no one ever listened to him, neither his family nor the country.  Then you will say why do you make videos in such streets, in such places ?  This is dirty.  But are the people living here not humans?  These streets have provided home to many people from India. But these same streets tell us that Mumbai is a city that takes away much more from us than what it gives.   There is an addiction in it, there is the addiction of whitener, this whitener addiction and many such addictions will be found in abundance in these streets, in this area and many people will be found doing it as well, when did you start doing it, it's been 10-12 years.  Well since last 10-12 years we are addicted to only whitener or nothing else, how much does it cost to get only whitener ? For ₹60.  506 for ₹60 and how much does it cost? It lasts for 3-4 hours.  How much do you take in a day?  One or two times at the most, ₹120 is spent on the bottle every day.  Yes. Yes, gutkhavak in a bottle for ₹100 and mother says that yours asks me to quit, she beats me for drugs, all the family members shout at me, I beat her, I ca n't stop myself now, yes I don't hide, I try, after a day or two, I take my hand back like that, well it is clear here that living here is deadly and dangerous.  But the irony is that the government has decided that out of the 300 acre mountain here, half of it, i.e. 124 acres, will be cleared and the people of Dharavi, i.e. other slums, will be sent here.  Meaning, instead of removing people from here, they will bring more people here and put them in danger. This garbage is 40 meters high, which is more than a 12- storey building, and it might take 12 to 14 years to clean it [Music]. In this mountain, you will find wet and dry waste together, which people segregate and sell to earn Rs. 1200.  But this work is not easy. Many people have lost their lives doing this. Some people have even come under the bulldozer.  Many people suffered multiple injuries. [MUSIC] This is a long tease but my whole leg wo n't close.  Now the leg doesn't close. No, it is not stopping completely.  Earlier it would not stop even for a little while.  Right now, say this much is happening.  Yes.  And when did you feel this?  It's done.  It's been six months.  What were you doing when it happened?  I was working.  He had gone to the mountain to count the work.  Yes.  The work of picking.  Yes.  I am not able to work.   I can't walk.  Look, don't fall and break everything. We think that only people from other cities live in such places.  But it is not like that.  There are many such communities in Mumbai itself which are not accepted by their own family members. Society does not accept it.  So these houses provide them shelter.  One of them is the transgender community of Mumbai. God sent us into this world just to make us laugh and feel happy. Never sent it to hurt anyone. People would chase us away, people would abuse us. People look at me with dirty eyes, I do n't care about all that.  We live with the support of just one Allah and one God, neither people accepted us, nor any relative, nor brother or sister, then I came to him, then he supported me, talked to my family members, so now that you have got a home, what is the definition of home for you? As far as I believe, for people like us, even our parents' home doesn't exist. Why?  These things still happen sometimes. Hey, this is a eunuch right?  This will give us some progeny.  If we look at home, this is our home. All these eunuchs of us are here.  This is who we are.  This is our home, these are our parents, this is our support.  understand.  If we get even a hut along with a eunuch, it is a luxurious palace for us.   There are many issues here, hence there are people who write songs and rap on these issues and then spread these issues to the entire world.  The journey starts from the ground to the sky.  This art of the pen is peace for the soul. Darkness is the light on the path in life.   He does n't let me stay with my mother.   I do n't talk about age, I don't keep a distance from people, whatever they say behind my back, today I don't ask questions from me, but don't listen to the answers, yes, I know a lot, but I will reveal my secrets, when I was five years old, I started writing a diary because I was alone, I didn't have any friends and then after that that thing started coming in the form of art, that way of writing a diary, that writing poetry, after that I started rapping, my father is very proud of me, I am his son, he always comes to pick me up, whenever the performance is over at night, he does n't come to the performance and I think it is good, meaning he should not come to the performance till it is not too big, till there is no crowd of lakhs, it is the month of Ramadan right now, meaning more than 70% of the population here keeps fast, how difficult it would be to stay without drinking water for the whole day, without eating food, from 4:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the night, going and breaking the fast, it is not easy in this place, we break the fast with dates because our profiteering people prefer this.  And this is also a superstition, people only know that in the slums there is only drug addiction, crime, fighting, it is not like that but there are a lot of talented people in the slums.  Our movies tell us that there are and will be lots of gangsters, crime, drugs in these streets. But movies do not tell that tuition centres also run in these same streets. One of which is this, which is run by the youth here for the youth here. More than 100 children come to this tuition centre every day. Read with hope.  It is important for children to study so that in the future they can think better about their lives, their families, and their area.  He is helping his own family, his people and the people in the neighbourhood.  If someone is better educated, then I would like my children too to become each other 's strength and not their weakness.   There are many children here who have very good talent but they cannot go out because of their circumstances or because of the people.  Even if someone leaves, it is suppressed by saying this.  It means that he should come from such an area where there is a lot of violence, hashish and marijuana, or he will also keep doing the same thing. So it is not put back. [Music] Many of you might have already written in the comments that people here are like this. These will not change.  So I will ask them, do lotuses not grow in insects? These children were born here and grew up here.  But if they still hope for change, then why can't we?  Why can't we ask our government and the country whether change is not possible here
