1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
What is your analysis Sir, that the speed

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,720
and velocity and heat with which cinema was being consumed

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,480
10-15 years ago at least

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
in theatres etc, what has happened to that

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,320
magic, what do you think, what is your guess,

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,960
see, the theatrical business has definitely reduced, there is no

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,119
doubt about it and I feel

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,640
sad because I am a theatre person,

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,560
my entire career is

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,599
associated with cinema halls,

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
today I am sitting in front of you, whatever

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,160
work I have done, it is

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,600
because of those cinema halls that I have

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,480
reached here.  Well, my belief is complete

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,680
in theatres.  But I think there are two or three things.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,680
Firstly, we should

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
look at the quality of films, I

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
will not talk about this topic because the quality

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
of films will become your colleagues.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
Why would you comment on that so much?  No no, that

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,920
because that is a

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,680
variable.  And that variable is always

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
going to be there.  When you do a formula,

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,240

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,560
how is the film with a variable in it like this is a variable?  It is good and it is bad.  So

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,920
if we keep that aside, the quality of cinema is

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
sometimes good and

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,520
sometimes bad.  We

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,840
also go to circles sometimes.  There is a growth.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
Yes.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
So that's a variable.  If we take it apart, then the

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,040
constants which are a basic business

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,520
method, we follow them in a very strange manner.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,360
So because of that, the

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,920
theatrical business has also reduced significantly.  Hmm.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Ah, we as a film industry have

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,079
taken some steps which have caused losses to us.  The

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,399
theatrical window that we have has become very

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,920
small.  It is obvious that if you

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
can watch the movie at home then why would you

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,479
come to the theatre?  Right and that too without

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,680
paying any extra money.  Absolutely.  So then

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,600
what else should I say?  No sir I know I will

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
give you a young person's perspective.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I meet a lot of people from your industry.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
Maybe, if I muster up the courage,

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
our industry is common in a sense,

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
we are in the entertainment industry and I

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
feel that many times people do

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,400
not realise that it is a hardware thing,

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,560
that the base of technology is hardware

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,080
and when the hardware changes, the

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
user behaviour changes.  Hmm

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,520
hmm.  Now your movie or my podcast or

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
my friend's story, whether it is a normal story.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,120
It is coming with the worst of

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,440
humanity swipe.  And that hardware is now in our

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,920
hands.  So it is not like I

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,720
want to watch a movie on my TV.  When

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,440
I read 25,000 types of nonsense content it turns

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
my brain completely off.  I

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,239
can see it on my hand.  So I do the same thing and go to the

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
cinema and drive the car.  I should buy a ticket worth ₹1000.

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
For two people, there should be no one around who is

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
misbehaving.  Should I take the tension about this thing from my wife?

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,440
And those factors

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,440
start coming into play.  I think

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,280
it's a hardware thing.  You're

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
going straight to YouTube after that, right?  No, we're

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
just coming to the theatre.  After the theatre,

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
nowhere, we are in the theatre.  Then we

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
will see what happens next.  First, we are just

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
coming to the theatre.  Well you're just

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
in the theater.  Yes.  Let's go.  Only

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
in theatres.  Full anxiety.  Full anxiety.  Full

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
anxiety.  Theatrical release is just full

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
anxiety.  Wow.  What does Aamir Khan's anxiety

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
feel like?  What is it?  What are the thoughts

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,360
in your head?  It won't work.  This type

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
of stuff?   A

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,080
yes, actually every film has a

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
different quality.

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,319
I have specifically made this film because

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,000
this is a very important topic for our

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:38,640
society. We have neuro-divergence and

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,120
I feel that as people, sometimes we become very

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,360
insensitive.  Like who people who

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,760
people with ah ah mental disabilities

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,040
okay.  I think this is the legal term for it

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,040
in India.  Sure, there is a

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
neurotypical person, just like the one we

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
call normal is

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
called neurotypical and neurodivergence means

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,560
those whose intellectually they are a little different,

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,920
intellectually they are a little different from us, right

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,879
and so this is a topic on which I feel that

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,400
we have never seen a film made on this on such a large scale on a public platform,

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:17,239

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,239
or as far as I remember, for me

100
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
this is not just a film.  There is the

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
film

102
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,280
but along with it the entire team has made

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
this film because we want to sensitize

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,800
people

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
about this topic.  So, there is also anxiety about

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
whether it will reach everywhere or not.  Will this

107
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,560
film reach the hearts of the people or

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
not?  Whatever we have done to

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520
sensitize people, have we done it right or

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,360
not?  We see how much impact the

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,360
film will have on people.  That is one of the concerns

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
that you were asking about.  Right?  It's one

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,919
of them.  Is there a success failure anxiety

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160
associated with it?  Yes, I definitely

115
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,639
want us to succeed without a doubt.

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,280
I want people to like our film.

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,880
Yes.  Interesting.  The First

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,520
Movie That I Ever Cried In.  Hmm.  Ever were

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,440
stars on the ground.  Ok.  And I Seven Six

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,360
is ​​a 2006 release Sir.  It's probably from 2007 or eight.

121
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,600
Okay sir anything you want me to pull

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
up we have magic.  We can just pull up

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
here and we can talk about it, right?  I

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
think it is from 2007, right?  Because I was in

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
seventh grade.  And I remember that I did

126
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
n't even know that one could cry after watching a movie.  I

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
mean, what does a 10-11 year old child

128
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,039
know?  And I remember watching it

129
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,919
and crying.  And let's focus on the stars

130
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,960
on the ground.  Hmm hmm.  There's something about

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,080
a story that is so well told.  Hmm that goes

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,039
right through the heart.  Hum Hum and You

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,000
have a history of giving cinema like that

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,639
hmm all the way from Andaz Apna Apna but then but then also

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Lagaan you know what I am

136
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,240
talking about what is that what happens in a story

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,560
that touches the heart.   Hmm I

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,039
wonder hmm see

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,479
 

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,880
I believe that when the

141
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,919
writing is good, hmm then no matter what

142
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,639
topic we make a film on, it touches the heart

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,800
if the writing is good, hmm then

144
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,720
writing is very important, there is a structure for every film, is there

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,000
like this if

146
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
I am ever telling a story to my

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
friends, I need to remember something that's going to

148
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,080
help my story land better or if

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,639
I ever write a story well, for

150
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,120
cinema, I can give you some basic

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,639
tips.  One thing is that premise is very

152
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
important.  You need to have a clear

153
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,919
premise.

154
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
What are you trying to say with the story you're telling?  What do you want to say in one line

155
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
?  For example, if

156
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,919
we take the example of Dangal, then the girls are less than the boys, that is

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,160
the main thought of the film.

158
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
Brilliant.  Ok?  So you need a strong

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
premise

160
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,639
and an affirmative premise.  It should be an arbitrary

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
sentence

162
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,800
and there should be a clear premise and

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,440
then the film is made on that premise.

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Secondly, your goal setting should be done

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,160
quickly.  At the beginning of the film,

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,240
you should tell the audience where the film is going.

167
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,639

168
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
Like

169
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,639
any revenge film, Yaadon Ki Baaraat

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
came a long time back in the 70s.  There are three brothers.   He

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,080

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
sees his parents getting murdered with his own eyes.  Then they get separated.  So

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,000
as soon as that prog ended the kids got

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
separated.  The parents have been murdered.  So,

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,199
we as an audience know where this film is

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,520
going.  These three children will

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,560
meet each other when they grow up, find each other

178
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,639
and then take revenge from the villain.  So the

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,680
goal is set very early in the film.

180
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,479
At the very beginning of the film, in the first 101%

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
we understand where the story is

182
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,319
going.  In Lagaan, when Bhuvan says that the

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,800
condition is accepted.  We hope your goal is locked, I see,

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,800
so goal locking is an important aspect early enough

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,560
 

186
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,720
and then there are two-three things that the more

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,440
streamlined you keep the narrative, the character

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,960
development should be good, along with the main plot, the

189
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,639
sub-plots should also be

190
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,680
interesting.  And the resolution of

191
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,160
your sub-plots should end before the main plot ends.

192
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,080
You should wind up the sub

193
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
plots before the main plot.  Because once the

194
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,840
main goal is achieved, the public will

195
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
not pay attention.  She will not pay attention.  The movie is

196
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,520
done for me.  Right right right.  This

197
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
remains an open loop.  There are some basic things.

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Yes.  Which has to be taken care of.

199
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
Sir, in Ghazni, goal setting is a little late, isn't it?

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,120
Because first you are showing all this

201
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,159
happiness and it's all good.  No, no,

202
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
no.  Good.  Ghajini starts

203
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,000
in the present tense when you see that he

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
kills a man, right right right

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
right, then from there you are confused that he is not

206
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
remembering anything, he is taking photos, I do

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
n't know what he is doing, I get it but I get it

208
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,120
you are right because

209
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,279
in the beginning when it shows all that confusion jacked,

210
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
means you all jacked and whatever that is the

211
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,160
moment you are already aware that something is going to happen

212
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,880
there is some strangeness about us or

213
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,600
I C I C that's very interesting it is a

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,360
book of art and dramatic writing by the

215
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
writer, it is very difficult to name it, friend.

216
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,800
I always forget.  Sir I asked him will

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,640
he find Eugene or yes the

218
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,519
Art of Dramatic Writing.  The Art of the

219
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,519
Art of Dramatic Writing,

220
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,440
that book is very helpful.  Not just

221
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,880
for theatre but for cinema.  It

222
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,760
was written for the theatre.  Yes it is.  Lajos

223
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,200
Lajos Ergery.  Agri.  Agri Agri Yes, it

224
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,800
is a very difficult name.  I can't pronounce it.

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
Where is the treatment Agri bhai?  This

226
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,640
is very interesting.  I don't know friend where are you from

227
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,880
?  This is good Hungarian.  is Hungarian.

228
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,200
Well very interesting.

229
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
1888 There's something about stories that are

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
so timeless that he writes the book in 1888.

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,640
We read that book till today.

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,120
Actually he has

233
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,160
made a whole lot of science writing, you know he is

234
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,880
actually broken down writing.  Hum and I

235
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,920
think what he did is that he tried to,

236
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,760
well this what he explains about writing, he

237
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,880
is talking about mainstream

238
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
writing, otherwise you can write anyone, there are no

239
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
rules in writing,

240
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
you can write the way you want to, but

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,079
if you want more people to

242
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
connect with your material, then he

243
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
tells you that there are certain things which

244
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,399
psychologically keep people connected

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
and from the research that he has done,

246
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,720
all these things have come out that the premise should be

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,440
clear, goal setting should be quick,

248
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
all this is interesting

249
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
and sometimes we even break the rules of writing.

250
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,959
But if you have understanding then you

251
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,680
yourself understand that I am breaking this rule

252
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,320
and why I am breaking it.

253
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,640
What is its pay off going to be?  Sometimes you have to

254
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
break the rules.  Hum but you should know why

255
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
you are breaking the rules and what

256
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,240
you are going to do and you know why you are

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
doing it.  I always say you are allowed to

258
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,880
break the rules once you are the master of it.

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,040
That it only comes as a function of now I am the

260
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,279
master of these rules.  Now I can break

261
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,880
it in style.  Now I can break it for

262
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
function.  but before that if to to to to to to to to

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,320
break the rules may be it will crumble

264
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,320
whatever the game might be we are I or there is

265
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
truth in what you are saying

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,279
but I don't think that I am a master

267
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,000
we all are students let me

268
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,160
tell you we are all students yes

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
in any field we all keep learning always

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,160
sure but to what extent sir

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
you can take this compliment that you know you have

272
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,200
done fantastic work the country

273
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
loves you you made cinema I have very rarely

274
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,760
connected with cinema cinema is not my

275
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,920
strength hmmm hmm the only person I am

276
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,000
just the only person like I said I studied

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,600
when I did it with three deeds cadet the

278
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,480
first film I cried in was Tare Zameen Par

279
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,640
Satyamev Jayate gave me my moral fabric I was

280
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,800
right at that as also when

281
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,040
Satyamev Jayate is airing I am like 14

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:55,760
15 like those issues were oh my god and you

283
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,440
know I no  Yesterday I was sitting and thinking that forget

284
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
the podcast if I just talking to Aamir sir what I am going to ask when I

285
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720

286
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
wanted to really ask you this do you think all like

287
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,680
what do you think is arts

288
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,000
responsibility?  You feel there

289
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,240
is a need for art because you

290
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,680
do a lot of social messaging.  Yes.  Look,

291
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,480
I think I am talking about cinema.

292
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Talking about cinema, yes

293
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,200
I think the primary and fundamental

294
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,240
responsibility of an entertainer

295
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,399
in cinema is to entertain.

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,200
If you want sociology lessons you

297
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,839
go to college.  You have come to the cinema hall, so

298
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
obviously you want entertainment.  Yes.  So that

299
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,279
I am sharply aware of that my primary

300
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,440
responsibilities are to entertain.

301
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,079
But I also feel that every profession

302
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,040
contributes something or the other to the society.

303
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,639
 

304
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Just like

305
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:58,079
doctors give us health, they give us health.   A

306
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,839
People who are in the police force maintain law and

307
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,760
order.  Provides security.

308
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,639
Provides security.  Our soldiers

309
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,639
keep us safe.  Every profession

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,960
contributes something or the other to the society.

311
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440

312
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,680
[Music] The

313
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,800
judiciary is what delivers justice.  So

314
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,120
what is the contribution of a creative person

315
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,639
to the society?  So I think that it is definitely

316
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,760
a huge responsibility to entertain people.

317
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,800
But along with that there is

318
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,000
another responsibility if we

319
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,959
want to take that responsibility.  It is up to you and

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,720
us and it is our responsibility that actually you

321
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,120

322
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,079
can contribute to reach the hearts of the people.  You

323
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,440
can gauge their emotions.  You

324
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:50,079
can make them think.  So I

325
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
feel that the job of an artist is not just to

326
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,560
entertain.  Yes, that is the main job.  But at the

327
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
same time it is also the job of an

328
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
artist.  When I say artist, I am

329
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,000
including painters, poets, writers, all

330
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,560
fine arts, whoever is in whichever field,

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,399
in the artistic field, in a way

332
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,880
 

333
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:15,440
you bring grace to the society, we, you

334
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,880
inspire people, you can if you want to and

335
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
in this, there is a huge contribution towards nation building.

336
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
Because a nation is

337
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,120
not built with buildings.

338
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,440
It happens to people.

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,639
And when you influence young minds in the right way,

340
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,720
then you are

341
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,720
able to give the right direction to an entire generation.  I remember when I was growing up, the

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
books I read had a

343
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
very profound impact on me.  The

344
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,199
songs which I have heard, which have been our lyricists

345
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:50,160
in India, Neeraj ji, Shailendra

346
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:53,040
ji, Majroo sahab, all of them, Sahir sahab, they

347
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
say so much in their poetry, it makes

348
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
you think, it makes you feel, it makes you realize so many

349
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,600
things, that are all part of

350
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,360
building you, it builds us, we

351
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,519
listen to amazing poetry, we listen to Kabir's couplet,

352
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,519
it affects us 100%, we

353
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,680
see a painting, it affects us,

354
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,800
we read a story, it affects

355
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,600
us.  So actually

356
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,480
if you mean if one of the things that

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,240
a creative person can also do other than

358
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,199
just entertain people is to bring grace to

359
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,480
society is to inspire people is to give

360
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,839
hope to people very interesting.  Or I

361
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,519
actually think the

362
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,600
potential of poetry in our Indian languages.  Yes sir, that means of

363
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
course I speak only English, otherwise but I do

364
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,880
n't have that in English.  Like I,

365
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,920
Harivansh, probably grew up reading Bachchan ji's Madhushala,

366
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,920
Kabir's couplets, or the qawwalis

367
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
sung by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, whoever has

368
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,560
written them, yes yes sir, what do you

369
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,320
say and when you are saying

370
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,399
poets are amazing, poets are amazing, you

371
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
say such a big thing in two lines that it takes a

372
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
person 8-10-10 years to have that

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
breakdown.  You keep

374
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
thinking that

375
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,600
I have folded everything in my copy of Madhushala and that

376
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
it has to be rewritten again.  This is the

377
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,880
wisdom of the whole life in four lines.

378
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,360
We are very next level, we but I think a

379
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,839
very unique aspect that cinema has

380
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,079
in India is entering people's living room

381
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,920
conversations, we said dyslexia,

382
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,639
stars on the earth, we whole India knows

383
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,519
what dyslexia is, and I will give

384
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,360
you a trivial example, hmm, one of you comes up

385
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,120
with six pack abs, before that there

386
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,120
is no concept in India sir, of six packs,

387
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,440
suddenly six pack abs thing, you come out with

388
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,440
eight pack abs, now eight pack are a thing, then

389
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,240
people start wondering 12 bhi hote hain, like what should we do

390
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,240
now, stick to it and so there is a there is

391
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,920
an influential power in cinema.

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,160
Cinema is a very secular medium that everybody

393
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,160
consumes.  The entire country

394
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
consumes it.  And once a film crosses a

395
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,399
certain threshold the entire world

396
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,560
consumes it.  And you are able to insert

397
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,360
through entertainment a small thought which you should

398
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,199
remember.  Hmm weather that is excellence.   That was

399
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
the lesson I learnt in 3 Idiots.  Chess

400
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,800
Excellence.  Chess Excellence.  Success will come

401
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
chasing you.  That was the message that you will

402
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,160
chase excellence and success will follow you

403
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,280
while he is shaving and waving.

404
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
Correct.  And you are right.  I mean, I probably

405
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,319
undervalued these in my early life and

406
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,000
what impact they could have?  Hmm but

407
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,600
now in this moment when I look back and see

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,679
what three things did for me in my college

409
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,280
career and how it has all come through.  I am

410
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
multidisciplinary.  I have read more books

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
and I can remember.  I have rented more

412
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,959
scientific papers that I can remember.  I

413
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,039
have written more than I can remember.

414
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,679
Purely because somebody said to me to

415
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,280
chase excellence.  And that has currency.  That has

416
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,760
value.  Hum that's what I think or I

417
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
think it is also an additional challenge.  An

418
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,360
artist takes it, I will

419
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,240
also do a messaging in it.  Because I

420
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,280
can leave you laughing.  Yes yes yes I

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,360
can let it go with a chuckle.  Yes.  So I think when a

422
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,360
script comes which is well written which

423
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,679
entertains you also.  It is also

424
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,120
saying something different then I get

425
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,000
very attracted to these kind of

426
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,919
scripts.  Hmm.  This story is also good.   It is

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
entertaining us, but it is

428
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,880
also giving us a lot.  In view of that,

429
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,520
how do you think of Bhagi's

430
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Bose name?

431
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,919
I don't think Delhi Belly had any special social

432
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,400
message.  It was sir.  There was a message about tasty food.

433
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,760
This was the message that you will get laxatives.

434
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,679
You are forgetting.  He had only one message.

435
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,520
She it happens.

436
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes, right.  There was only one message from Delhi, Valley.

437
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
Damn that movie sir, I have shown the pictures to so many white people that I should

438
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000

439
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,880
explain to you where I am from.  Come sit.  That

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Movie Became a Cultural Bridge Today.  Yes yes.  Wow

441
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,880
what a film.  That movie and its opening was

442
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,440
such a bold movie,

443
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
in the beginning, in the world, when the

444
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,760
song starts, it is something like this.  Right?  It's

445
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,480
[ __ ] beautiful.  Cycle Blues.  yes right right.

446
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,799
 

447
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,799
Tell me the story of your favorite childhood

448
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
memory.

449
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,720
o

450
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,720
Favorite childhood memory.  Take a second.   I have

451
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,480
many childhood memories.

452
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:11,880
What do you remember most fondly?

453
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,880
Some birthday party, some friend hang out.

454
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,880
Ah hum I

455
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
spent a lot of time with my mother

456
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,400
growing up.

457
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,559
yes what was that like

458
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,600
lovely she is a very

459
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,480
wonderful warm soft hearted person she is

460
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,120
ranging from all of us to multiple

461
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,960
intelligences and it is not necessary to be

462
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,919
in reading and writing for some of them

463
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,360
you could be a good orator you could be the speciality of Ammi is

464
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,520
that she is a very caring

465
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,000
person.  She has an intelligence of

466
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,880
picking up that dude this guy is

467
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,679
feeling really bad about this thing.  She can sense very

468
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,240
fast that a person is not feeling good.  And

469
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,080
she is very caring.  So that's something I

470
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,840
picked up from her.  What would you do with

471
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
her in your childhood?  Like how would you

472
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
spend time?  What stories did you hear from

473
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,440
him?

474
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
No, I should just hang on with her.  Well,

475
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,320
a lot of times.  She would be doing some housework

476
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,240
or some work of her own.

477
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
You just hang out.  Hey, even when she went shopping

478
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
, she used to take us along.  We used to get

479
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,320
very excited during shopping time.  Yes, I

480
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,840
am sure.  But they lived together.  So I have

481
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,160
spent a lot of time with me growing

482
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,160
up.  One of the worst memories of my

483
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,760
childhood is going shopping with my mother.

484
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,080
Because I'm standing there friend finish it now.

485
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
what are you buying?  I am

486
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,240
already understanding it.  It's been 2 hours, it's been 3 hours, it's still going on.

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,280
Right?  And some of my best

488
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,799
childhood memories are when I was three, four, five

489
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
years old and when I used to go to sleep, my

490
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,240
father used to

491
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,880
narrate stories to me from Panchatantra, Mahabharata, Ramayana every day

492
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,039
and he would fall asleep while narrating and

493
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
we would also fall asleep while listening to it. Hmm but

494
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
again, the foundation that those stories created,

495
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,679
a moral fabric, an

496
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,640
ethical fabric was created, that was very

497
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,480
impactful. And the memory or I also love

498
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
stories, when I was a kid, I used to love listening to

499
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,440
stories,

500
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,840
so

501
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,760
when our cook was done with dinner, she would

502
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,440

503
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
tell us some stories, she told the story of Sheikh Chilli,

504
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
yes, then there used to be the Hawa Mahal programme on the

505
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,840
radio, well, you heard about Hawa

506
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,280
Mahal, it comes even today, you can listen to it,

507
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
yes, what happens in it, there is a radio spot of

508
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:21,440
10-15 minutes, okay, the spot is proper, like

509
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,200
audio, yes, then

510
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,280
because Abba Jaan was a film producer, so

511
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,799
many writers, directors used to come to our house to

512
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,480
narrate stories to

513
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,080
Abba Jaan. I

514
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
loved stories very much, so I used to sit in a corner.  I used to sit and

515
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
listen from the age of five or six

516
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,440
years old, so I think from that age

517
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,080
till the age of 16, 17, 18, when I became an assistant

518
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,720
and started working,

519
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,400
I have heard hundreds of stories at home with Abba Jaan.

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,520
I did not know at that time that I would

521
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,520
enter films, actually my

522
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,159
Gurukul style training was going on, which I, when I did not know,

523
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
yes I did not know that

524
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,480
time, I had never even thought at that

525
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
time that I would enter films.  But today

526
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,640
when I think about it, actually that was my

527
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,440
training ground as the films were being made around us

528
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,679
and we were watching them.  Right?  But sir

529
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,919
how can this happen?  Like I mean I'm

530
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,840
too young to know but cinema cinema is happening around you.

531
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,960
You are living in Bombay.  You are

532
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,960
part of a solid

533
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,039
let's say solid film family.  I don't want to,

534
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,520
your father was a producer you said.  My

535
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,360
father was a producer.  Right!  Is that what it is now it

536
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
is a natural consequence of

537
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
things now if my father was a

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,520
producer most likely I would be

539
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,520
acting it just begs the future to happen

540
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,360
then would you be considering an alternate career

541
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,600
at some point no no I had never thought about it

542
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,760
but actually this is not a thing of now, this has been happening

543
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,280
since before which it is very natural for

544
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,880
children to take on what their parents are

545
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,120
doing because you see that going on around you,

546
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,039
a lot of kids and up

547
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,159
doing what their fathers, parents are

548
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,480
doing it is a very natural process

549
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
but I had never thought that I was

550
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
very interested in sports.  So I wanted to be a

551
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,760
sports person.  How would you

552
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,159
play?  Cricket?  I used to play cricket,

553
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:06,640
all racket games, tennis, adl.  TT.  Adele has just

554
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:09,600
arrived.  I am just joking,

555
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,200
I was very interested in sports and I had

556
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,840
never thought about what I should do in life.  Yes.

557
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,440
But when there were holidays after 10th

558
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,159
, at that time I had a friend named Aditya

559
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,640
Bhattacharya.  Good.

560
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,760
Aditya Bhattacharya is the son of Basu Bhattacharya.

561
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,919
Basuda was a film maker. Aditya

562
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,840
wanted to make a student film

563
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
and he asked for my help. I said I will

564
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,760
help you, so we guys said, I was helping him.

565
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,280
We made the film during the

566
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
holidays after the 10th board exams.

567
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,760
He

568
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,200
directed it, I helped him. There were

569
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
only two of us in all the departments. We were doing everything. So

570
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,880

571
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,640
my experience of that one month was

572
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,640
so much that I enjoyed doing that work that I

573
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
felt, yes this is this world, I want to

574
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
live in this world, the world of stories.  So

575
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,039
I was around 16 and so when I first

576
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,400
decided I want to be in the films very

577
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,039
interesting yes is this that this is Aditya

578
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,559
yes this is Aditya this is Aditya you are still

579
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,360
friends I am assuming ya we are still

580
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,760
friends wow so this man gives you the sort

581
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,279
of impulse once inside I leave you

582
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,600
wondering how the picture looks like yes the

583
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,760
fun of working in films, the madness

584
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,559
that happens, I experienced that

585
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,159
first hand when I worked with Aditya

586
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,480
in his first film his first

587
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,600
film was called Paronoya.  It

588
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,279
was an interesting short film of 40 minutes.  And there were no

589
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
dialogues in it.  There was no background music

590
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,400
, no sound effects, nothing.  There

591
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,799
was no soundtrack.  ok so i

592
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,679
mean that is just visual.  Good.  Just

593
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,080
Visual.  And awkward silence.  Meaning hissing

594
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,760
silence, just there was silence in the entire theatre.

595
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,640
Only some visuals are running on the screen.

596
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,960
And those visuals are some what

597
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,200
psychological paranoia style that

598
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,360
means man it was about a boy growing up.

599
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,320
He is a 16 year old boy, what is

600
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,240
his reaction to experiencing violence

601
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,279
for the first time, it is interesting.  What is

602
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,559
his reaction to his parents?  Hmm what

603
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,279
is his reaction to his first case

604
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,039
what is his reaction to him you know

605
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,679
getting physical for the first time with his

606
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:20,720
girlfriend.  So the

607
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,400
experiences or psyche of a boy of that age and how he is you

608
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
know so it was a

609
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,840
kind of a slice of different

610
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,080
emotions.  It wasn't really a linear

611
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,799
script and you knew there was a specific plot

612
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,000
in it.  It was not like that.  Hum more a collection of

613
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,600
scenes.  I mean, my guess is that you are

614
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,559
probably closer to your mother when you

615
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,640
grow up?  Yes.  Who hit you more

616
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,799
?  Aunty did it, uncle did it or not,

617
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,159
father did it.  Well yes Bajan did.  How many

618
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,279
times would he have hit you?  Meaning was it frequent?

619
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,880
But I don't know.

620
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,720
It's a beau question.  I am sorry.  I am

621
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,039
sorry.  No, it was not that frequent.

622
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,080
We have been beaten up a couple of times.  Once or

623
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,919
twice.  Yes.  Did you have fun like this?  You

624
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
were just young.  We used to keep doing some fun or the other.

625
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,600
Faisal and I were both brothers.  They

626
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,080
used to fight separately.  This or that.  And

627
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,120
Abba Jaan's hand was quite heavy as well.  Every

628
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,960
Baba, that, that's print also used to come.  Then the

629
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,919
next day when he had to go to school, everything was visible to him that

630
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,600
he was studying.

631
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,400
My Baba has probably slapped me a total of

632
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
three times in my life.  But it's been 30 years.

633
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
He has counted 30 years.  do you remember

634
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
?  I beat you once.  do you

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,320
remember?  Oh brother, the man feels so bad.

636
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,840
But yes,

637
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,120
in retrospect it seems right.

638
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,120
Not so bad in retrospect.

639
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Tell me about this idea

640
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,279
of ​​perfect?  What do you think of perfect

641
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,120
or that level of perfectionism got associated

642
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,640
with you for quite a bit.  What do you think

643
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,919
of that label?  Start with the idea.  What

644
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,679
is perfection to you?  I think there is no such

645
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
thing as perfection in creativity

646
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,679
because every person has his own point of view.   There is no

647
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,919
one way to do anything.

648
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
So it's there is no perfect way of

649
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,240
doing anything in the creative world.

650
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,640
Hmm

651
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:15,200
so I don't believe in perfection.  I believe

652
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:17,039
in magic.  More from us?  So when we are

653
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,279
doing any scene or trying to capture any moment, does

654
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,600

655
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,760
magic happen in it or not?  Did we get something which was

656
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,880
really special.  Which may have

657
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,480
happened my mistake also.  So but I am

658
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
looking for magic.  Not Perfection and

659
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,559
How Do You Get a Sense of

660
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,159
Magic?  you just watch it and you you you you you

661
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,720
know it and is it there?  You come to know you

662
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,320
feel it.  Ok.  What do you think of that whole

663
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,840
media labeling that happened around you?

664
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,640
Mr. Perfect.  Mr. Perfectionist

665
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,960
something of that nature?  Yes.  That labelling,

666
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,360
actually, I do

667
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,000
n't know, that labelling happened some 15-20 years ago.

668
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,159
Right.

669
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
I think my films were running one after the other.

670
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,200
So I think the media didn’t know

671
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,720
what to do?  What to do?  Yes.  No

672
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,799
not because

673
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
he thought this is perfect.

674
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,559
This is called perfectionism.  So there I got that

675
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,399
label perfectionist.  But

676
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,960
nothing is perfect in creativity.

677
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,640
Hmm it is different.  Every man does his own thing.

678
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,279
Sure.  But it was also because you are

679
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,960
very hyperfocused on one movie in a year,

680
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,799
something of that nature was also part of

681
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,080
your repeat war at that time that I

682
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,240
would do very focused work.  From Lagaan to Lagaan, I have

683
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,320
done more than one film at a time

684
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,799
because that was how people worked in those days

685
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,799
and for many years, I have been trying to

686
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,399
do only one film at a time.

687
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,640
But my producers and directors were

688
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,399
not ready for that.  Then when I

689
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,399
produced Lagaan, I said that at this

690
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,480
time we will do only one film.  And

691
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,320
from then till now, by and large, I have done only

692
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,320
one film at a time.  Hmm what was

693
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,919
so unique about Lagaan in that it was

694
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,679
made by you I was a producer so I could

695
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,320
decide how it would be made

696
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,320
right so I said I will do the sing sound, I will do it

697
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,159
in one schedule, I will bring in the first AD system,

698
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,880
so these were not the things that I

699
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,200
wanted to do, so as a producer

700
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,840
when I started as a producer,

701
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,760
I included all these things in

702
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,760
my film, I heard I have heard this, I do

703
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,559
n't understand that much what is

704
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,679
this unique first AD thing that you brought for

705
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,399
Lagaan oh I know it's a little bit like

706
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,080
you created that sort of position in

707
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,159
the modern cinema, Hindi cinema ecosystem

708
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,600
what is so unique about this first AD

709
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,559
position and what is this exactly, it

710
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,960
just makes it, it's

711
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,880
a very organised way of working, there's a

712
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,640
lot of paper work in it, so there are

713
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,279
less mistakes because things are

714
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
planned well and advanced and the first AD is the

715
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,760
centre of influence.  And

716
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,960
he and she controls set.

717
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,279
So how much time will it take for prep?

718
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,440
It's so he's the First AD, he's a person who's

719
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,840
not actually a creative person.  Hmm he is an

720
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,919
administrative person.  So it is

721
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,080
his only responsibility to ensure that the work

722
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,679
goes on smoothly and the schedule that I have made as a

723
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,559
First AD is followed.  We should not

724
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,279
go, we should not fall behind schedule.  And things should

725
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,960
happen in time.  So, the First AD

726
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,120
is not really concerned with how well you are

727
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,200
making the film.  Hum,

728
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,240
he is concerned with whether you are doing it in

729
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,120
time or not.  Got it.  Hum and because he is

730
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,279
a centre of information he and she, so he is

731
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,279
the one who

732
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,679
gives that information out to different

733
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,760
departments so that they can

734
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,120
work in synchronization.  Because we have so many

735
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,640
departments working together.  So, there

736
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,720
has to be someone's synchronicity.  Yes.  So that is the

737
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
responsibility of the First ED.  So that was

738
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,399
n’t there earlier.  I used to be the chief assistant.

739
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,279

740
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,880
Why did he exactly not do the paper work at that time?  As an

741
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,440
assistant when I first worked.

742
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840
I was 18 when I started with Zara.

743
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,440
So the shooting of the film had started.

744
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,520
I join you a little late.  So I

745
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,760
asked the Chief Assistant, have you guys completed this paper work?  Let

746
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,679
me just see.  So he

747
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,159
said which paperwork?

748
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,679
So, you must have done something like location breakdown, actor

749
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,039
requirements, property requirements,

750
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,279
costume requirements.

751
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,880
Not only this, we know all this here.

752
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,360

753
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,279
So I said, well

754
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,720
then mistakes happen.  Now tell me, I will

755
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,360
write it.  Yes.  Yes.  Then you start

756
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,760
making mistakes.  You know when you don't do

757
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,159
the paper work properly.

758
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,760
So when you do this systematically,

759
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,840
mistakes are reduced.  It is not that it does not

760
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,679
happen, it happens less.  The chances of these things

761
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,520
going wrong is less is reduced.  So it

762
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,240
's a very planned way of working which I thought is

763
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,640
nice.  So we should bring it in

764
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,519
interesting.  I have a question.  We are What Are

765
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,279
You Self-Conscious About Even Now?  Well,

766
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,519
we are self-conscious about many things.

767
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:50,080
Like when in PK

768
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,480
I had to do that scene when I

769
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,919
come as an alien.  There would be clothes.  Yes.  I was

770
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,200
conscious.  I was definitely self-

771
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,799
conscious.  Right.  So yes.  But like but you

772
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
deal with it.  That's my job, man.  I had to do that scene.

773
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
I am playing a character.  Which

774
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,360
we have used in this film also.

775
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,279
Good.  He is a basketball coach.   There's a

776
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,840
basketball coach and he's Tingu.  Everyone

777
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,840
calls him Tingu.  Good.  So you play

778
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,679
to the insecure.  Or he is very insecure

779
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,640
about his height.  He doesn’t have to listen to it.

780
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,120
He feels very bad when someone calls him Tingu.  Very

781
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
self conscious about his height.  Yes.  So that was one

782
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,120
thing I was self conscious about

783
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,320
earlier when I

784
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,279
started out as an actor isn't it funny that

785
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,159
a lot of very successful people are shorter I don't think about their

786
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,039
height

787
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,200
I don't think so but sir I mean if you feel

788
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,279
wait I think people think that I'm shorter than

789
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,640
you try harder in the world

790
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,960
to achieve things you you you you you you think that

791
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,760
loop exists that does I suppose that does

792
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,919
you see what research finds

793
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,960
but that could play a factor sure hmm

794
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,640
and there was a lot I know many you know taller

795
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,519
people who are successful and very

796
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,200
talented and what is your height I will

797
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,039
take the compliment sir you say no problem yes

798
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,799
yes right right right right right

799
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,840
interesting but this is what happens when

800
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,640
you are

801
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:15,919
struggling with something in your childhood for

802
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,640
example if you are dyslexic and you

803
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,279
see in school that yaar  People are understanding but

804
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,279
I am not able to understand.

805
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,600
So that does drive you to work harder perhaps but that can also depress you it can also

806
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,159

807
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,159
dishearten you and it can also

808
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,880
drive you to work harder it can both

809
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,720
things can happen but I think you are right about one thing

810
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,960
in childhood when you face

811
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,279
challenges it kind of brings out the fight

812
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,760
in you it creates character it creates

813
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,399
character fire yes it creates fire a

814
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,480
hunger is created in me sir all the injuries are a

815
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,399
source of motivation I tell my audience to

816
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,200
remember that you should

817
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,720
not suppress all the injuries you have suffered.  They have to be channeled.  You will understand in a year and a half or two

818
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,480
how to run a channel.  Right now is the

819
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,880
point of grieving.  Grieve your grief.

820
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,120
When eventually it does become

821
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,600
energy there is nothing like a good injury.

822
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,240
Hum Hum

823
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,399
All greatness becomes begins after a great

824
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,720
failure.  I think that's very

825
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,040
well my failures have been my biggest

826
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,679
teachers for sure.  Right?

827
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,159
The most I have learned is from my failures.

828
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,879
My failures have taught me the most.  What do

829
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,800
you think is the film that audiences will

830
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,280
remember the longest from you?  Hmm from

831
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,919
my films?  Yes.

832
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Oh I don't know.  Take a guess.  I will

833
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,159
actually ask taare zameen par.  Tare zameen par

834
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,720
wood you think for me I think it.  Three

835
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,399
dears 3 yes three idiots.  But this is the 3D generation

836
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,839
sir.  These are under 25 children.  They do

837
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,159
n't have much history, no life,

838
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,240
actually Andaz Apna Apna also I think

839
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,879
just me that's all I was waiting for

840
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,520

Tare Zameen Par 3 Idiots dos two and I mean

846

very good Sarfarosh Sarfarosh

849
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
 

850
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,280
Sarfarosh is the one with Naseeruddin sir ji

851
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,960
in which you are a police officer I am an IPS

852
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,359
officer or right right yes why do you think if so

853
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,160
people will remember Tare Zameen Par or

854
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,440
for that matter Andaz Apna Apna and your

855
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,119
favourite movie Tare Zameen Par why do you you you you

856
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,480
think is that difference what is

857
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,400
the audience looking for versus what you

858
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,560
looking for in a movie the reason

859
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,480
Amongst my films I mean it is very difficult

860
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,359
most toh main pehle bolo yaar it is

861
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,200
very difficult for me to choose

862
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,800
but if I have to choose one then I would choose Tare

863
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,160
Zameen Par simply because of the kind of

864
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,400
impact it has on the head.  Tare Zameen Par three years

865
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,640
have a very deep impact on the society.  Helped a

866
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,000
lot of kids.  The lives of many children

867
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,720
changed.  Parents' lives changed.

868
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,960
And so that's why I told him a lot about I,

869
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,280
that's why I think it's a special film for me.

870
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,160
Ok.  It was able to help a lot of people.

871
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,640
Interesting.  Yes.  Do me your favor.  Hmm

872
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,880
explain

873
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,040
the story the plot of Sitare Zameen Par without giving it away give people a bite

874
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,000

875
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,200
yes well it's really a story about

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,079
Tare Zameen Par which is the exact opposite of

877
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,599
my character ok Nikum was very

878
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,800
sensitive

879
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,720
Gulshan is very insensitive he is a rude type of

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,280
man he is quarrelsome he gets angry

881
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,920
quickly I feel that I am always right he

882
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,920
hits the police car after drinking alcohol

883
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,560
and asks them is there any place to

884
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,400
park his vehicle.  So it is always right, it

885
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,000
feels that way.  So that's kind of the character and

886
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,280
it's really the story of how he gets this

887
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,920
punishment actually to teach

888
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,800
basketball to a team of players with

889
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,680
intellectual disabilities.

890
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,680
So, in those three-four months when he is

891
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,440
teaching him basketball, he actually

892
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,440
teaches him to be a good person.  Hum That's the

893
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,119
crux of the film Interesting Or in Tare

894
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,880
Zameen Par the teacher helps the child.

895
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,240
In this, the neuro divergent lot of

896
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,119
players improve the coach.

897
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,160
Interests bring changes in his life.

898
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,400
Hmm it's the opposite of that.  So, it's

899
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,720
almost like its humor.  Well it's

900
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,760
Peremyper was very emotional.  Yes.  This is

901
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,240
very humorous.  Humor is the vehicle.

902
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,640
Are you saying that this is primarily a comedy?

903
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,720
Yes.  Well it's a comedy film.  Ya ya

904
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,960
it's a light hearted film like a Raju

905
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Irani genre.  good OK.  He uses humor.  What

906
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,599
he is saying is very

907
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,000
important.  Like in 3

908
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,320
idiots.  But he uses humor as a vehicle

909
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,200
to tell you.  That is the genre.  A very

910
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,079
interesting this owner.  Ok.

911
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,240
Ok why

912
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,079
no OTT with sitare zameen par yaar

913
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,079
if I tell you to buy this glass from me

914
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,960
and I want to sell it so you

915
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,960
buy it from me and if I tell you that if you don’t

916
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,880
buy it then I will come and drop it at your home

917
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,200
after 8 weeks for which

918
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,240
you don’t have to pay any extra money then

919
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,079
why would you buy it from me I do

920
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
n’t think any other product in the world would be

921
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,920
sold in this model.

922
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,960
We are the only ones that do this.  Right?

923
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,480
So it does make sense to me.  Good.  And so

924
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,880
once the theatrical release of Sitare Zameen Par is

925
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,800
over there is no other way to watch it than that.

926
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
Let's see well let's see you make the decision when it comes.

927
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,160
When it comes.  Right now

928
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,760
I am focusing only on theatres.  I was

929
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:52,000
doing my research and I found that

930
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,880
for this movie you were offered quite a bit

931
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,200
of money from not just OTTs but studios

932
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,920
etc and you had this idea that I will

933
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,320
make it myself and like you rejected the

934
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,040
OTTs,

935
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,119
is there any other specific reason why you would do

936
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,880
that or it's just that you wanted

937
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,359
creative control as no I just feel it's the

938
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,119
wrong way to release a film.  Well or you

939
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,720
just feel it's not the right way to

940
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,800
release a film.  It's not it's you're

941
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,920
not being fair to the material.  So much hard work has

942
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,160
gone into the film.  I am

943
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,880
not comfortable with that.  Got it.  So now,

944
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,400
I am not criticising anyone for whom I work.

945
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,400
It works

946
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
for a lot of people and I appreciate that.

947
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,160
Right.  Doesn't work for me, so I don't want to do that.

948
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,440
Hmm.  I have full

949
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,680
you know, I have full loyalty for the theatres

950
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,560
in the cinema halls.  I feel it's a very

951
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,079
different way of

952
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,520
 

953
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,640
connecting with a film, a little sorry sorry

954
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,320
no sir, yes sorry, so what is it, when we

955
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,079
watch a film, there should be some enjoyment in it,

956
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,560
you sit in a dark theatre,

957
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,119
on a big screen, the way you

958
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,440
connect is probably in an

959
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,920
experience, here bells are ringing

960
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,960
and notifications are also coming, so

961
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,720
what film will you watch in that, so for me you know it's

962
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
really great to watch a film in the

963
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,119
darkness of a theatre where you are, that's the

964
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,760
best way to watch a film.  No I would even say so

965
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,599
much as it's super difficult to watch anything

966
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,079
long form because my phone is ringing.

967
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,599
I just received my food order.

968
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
Right now my friend is saying that you

969
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,079
come online, we will play a game.  What do I do and

970
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,920
how do I focus?  How can I focus on my studies

971
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,520
?  But movies are still secondary for me.

972
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,680
You focus on anything.  How do

973
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,520
I focus?  This is a real problem.  And this real

974
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,640
problem is an issue for all of us.  Right?  So I

975
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,040
completely agree.  Or to

976
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,880
watch it in a theatre, one thing I have a lot

977
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,160
of loyalty for cinema halls and theatres

978
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,920
and I have faith in my audience and if the

979
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,640
film is made well then they will come to

980
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,280
watch it in the theatre, yes I believe that who is he is

981
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,680
your best friend

982
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,079
in the industry, oh I have got a lot of

983
00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:00,400
good friends, okay good friends, very good

984
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:07,000
friends, or Ranbir Ranveer Anil Kapoor, Jackie

985
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Salman Shahrukh, okay or

986
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,520
and would you talk about when you guys hang

987
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,839
out in cinema,

988
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,119
I saw some video of Ranbir being at your

989
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,359
place and then recently, yes walking in,

990
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
those stars were very excited to

991
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,440
see him, actually I did for

992
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,200
them because this is his first film.  These 10

993
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,880
actors who are neuro divergent.  Right right right right

994
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,920
right.  So this is a

995
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,920
very special occasion for them so I want to

996
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,000
give them the best.  Got it, got it, got it.  So,

997
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,359
he wants to meet Ranbir.  So,

998
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,119
actually I surprised them.  They did not know that

999
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,960
Ranbir was coming, Sachin was coming.

1000
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,520
Got it.  They didn't know that.  So let them

1001
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,359
thrill.  Yes.  And like I am keeping the premiere on the 18th.

1002
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,680
I get very irritated at premieres.

1003
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,280
Why?  Hey, it is very difficult to

1004
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,960
organize and then I am

1005
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,200
playing the host.  When all my seniors are coming,

1006
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,960
I get very tensed.  Center of

1007
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,800
attention.  No, I am not the centre of attention, there is a

1008
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,760
lot of responsibility that day, friend.

1009
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,599
Well but I am doing it for them because

1010
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,599
I feel it would be really exciting for them.

1011
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,760
Or they will get to meet the whole industry and

1012
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,079
you know then they will be the stars on that

1013
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,119
evening right so I want to do it for them.

1014
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,119
got got it got it got it.   Do

1015
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,880
you still play chess?  Once in a while or are

1016
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,000
you amazed with what is happening to India and Indian

1017
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,319
chess?  Do you have any ideas

1018
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,160
?  I keep track of it a little bit.  These days I am

1019
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,319
very engrossed in films so I do

1020
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,560
n't keep track of anything actually.  Right.  You

1021
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,400
know that world champion is now Indian.

1022
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,079
Gokesh is now become world champion?  Yes

1023
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,319
sir.  When was this?  This is how many

1024
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,720
months ago?  four five months ago just

1025
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,560
in classical style classical style.  And

1026
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,839
so Magnis basically said I won't play

1027
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,760
anymore.  So that's why I did

1028
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,599
n't play that tournament.  No.  He didn't play that.   he

1029
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,440
gave up.  Yes.  And even the Candidates

1030
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,560
run before he entered the World Championship

1031
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,560
was phenomenal from Gokesh.  And then I mean

1032
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,319
sir as somebody who grows up playing chess I am so

1033
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,560
proud where India is set to chess and I

1034
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,240
make it a point that I mention this

1035
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,760
because people don't realise the kind of

1036
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,680
dominance India has on chess is the kind of

1037
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
dominance India has on cricket.  That's

1038
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,839
right.  This happened at this time.  Yes.  And it's

1039
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,640
only going to get better because I

1040
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,920
start naming under 20-21 years old

1041
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,079
chess players who are top 20 already.  It

1042
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
just doesn't end.  It's just India.  ya ya

1043
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,880
just no.  I think lots of young kids in

1044
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,800
India have taken up chess.  I think Anand

1045
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,119
also had a big hand in this.  These are these are

1046
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,319
wishes kids.  Or, or, or.  This is she's

1047
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,000
kids.  Or.  His impact is 1:1

1048
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,240
and I mean I started playing in the

1049
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
light of Anand becoming world champion.

1050
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,000
Because he infiltrates the culture,

1051
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,920
everybody is like, hey this is the Indian chess

1052
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
champion, this that.  And I remember seeing

1053
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,240
him for the first time.  I was like be

1054
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,000
nine and 10 hero moment.  hero.  Hey amazing

1055
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,480
cow.  Or, I am sure sir.  I never

1056
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,760
met him again after that.  But hero

1057
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,560
moment and now we are seeing what one man

1058
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,640
can do for the rest of the country.  Hmm.

1059
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,800
It's incredible.  As a fin.  Or are you

1060
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,000
philosophical and spiritual about life?  Do

1061
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,000
you believe in God?

1062
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,520
Actually release religion I feel it's a

1063
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,160
very personal thing.  Hmm for people.  So I

1064
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,680
try and not talk about it on public

1065
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,079
platforms.  I get it.  But are you

1066
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,640
spiritual?  I think so.  Hmm.  I think

1067
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,800
so.  Do you meditate?  I do.  Or.  what

1068
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
type?

1069
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,480
Well I had been to Vipassana which I had to

1070
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,920
cut shot after four days my eye I lost

1071
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,560
my friend actually a very close friend my

1072
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,800
mind passed away so I had to go on a boat on the

1073
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,800
fourth night

1074
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,640
but those four days really had a deep impact

1075
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,359
on me.  It's like a boot camp for

1076
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,640
meditation or I have done Vipassana twice or you have done it twice

1077
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,720
and I feel like it is a factory

1078
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,560
reset of life when life goes out of hand, I

1079
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,000
sit there for 10 days and

1080
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:52,800
all the ghosts inside me from which the man is running away, come back.

1081
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,800
Nothing is left behind.  Hum and

1082
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,839
I think I have also read as much as Goenka ji says in

1083
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,680
his lectures.

1084
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,119
Superb no agenda.  Or there is no

1085
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,040
irrelevant thing mixed in it.  There's no

1086
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,119
mixing up of messaging here and there.

1087
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,280
Focus on simple techniques.  If it works then sit, if it does

1088
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:15,440
n't work then leave.  That's it.  Hm but

1089
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:19,200
for a lot of my psychological unwellness hm

1090
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,560
Vipana has been a panacea when my mind goes out of

1091
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,400
my hands and I cannot control it,

1092
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,359
I go and sit in

1093
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,760
meditation, yes yes sir and in 10 days it

1094
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,800
happens that some doctor

1095
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,319
takes out the whole soul from inside it and now you can see it still exists, it's not that it does

1096
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,880
not exist

1097
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,280
but you can see that this is a disease, hey it was

1098
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,720
not being caught at all, it was making me wander, was chasing it away, you know that

1099
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,920
starts happening, no

1100
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,079
meditation I think is it something

1101
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,480
really amazing or I have one

1102
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,720
last question we

1103
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,560
look into the camera and say something to young Aamir

1104
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,599
as an advice oh or it's a new one, what

1105
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,520
advice should I give you friend that whatever

1106
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,079

1107
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,480
mistakes you have made are good,

1108
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,720
do them again,

1109
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,240
right because only by making those mistakes will you reach here.   By

1110
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,079
 

1111
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,880
learning from those mistakes.  Got it.  Got it.
