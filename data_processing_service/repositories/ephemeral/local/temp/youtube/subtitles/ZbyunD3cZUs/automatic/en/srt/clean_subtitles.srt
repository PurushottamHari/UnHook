What is your analysis Sir, that the speed and velocity and heat with which cinema was being consumed 10-15 years ago at least in theatres etc, what has happened to that magic, what do you think, what is your guess, see, the theatrical business has definitely reduced, there is no doubt about it and I feel sad because I am a theatre person, my entire career is associated with cinema halls, today I am sitting in front of you, whatever work I have done, it is because of those cinema halls that I have reached here.  Well, my belief is complete in theatres.  But I think there are two or three things. Firstly, we should look at the quality of films, I will not talk about this topic because the quality of films will become your colleagues. Why would you comment on that so much?  No no, that because that is a variable.  And that variable is always going to be there.  When you do a formula, how is the film with a variable in it like this is a variable?  It is good and it is bad.  So if we keep that aside, the quality of cinema is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  We also go to circles sometimes.  There is a growth. Yes. So that's a variable.  If we take it apart, then the constants which are a basic business method, we follow them in a very strange manner. So because of that, the theatrical business has also reduced significantly.  Hmm. Ah, we as a film industry have taken some steps which have caused losses to us.  The theatrical window that we have has become very small.  It is obvious that if you can watch the movie at home then why would you come to the theatre?  Right and that too without paying any extra money.  Absolutely.  So then what else should I say?  No sir I know I will give you a young person's perspective. I meet a lot of people from your industry. Maybe, if I muster up the courage, our industry is common in a sense, we are in the entertainment industry and I feel that many times people do not realise that it is a hardware thing, that the base of technology is hardware and when the hardware changes, the user behaviour changes.  Hmm hmm.  Now your movie or my podcast or my friend's story, whether it is a normal story. It is coming with the worst of humanity swipe.  And that hardware is now in our hands.  So it is not like I want to watch a movie on my TV.  When I read 25,000 types of nonsense content it turns my brain completely off.  I can see it on my hand.  So I do the same thing and go to the cinema and drive the car.  I should buy a ticket worth ₹1000. For two people, there should be no one around who is misbehaving.  Should I take the tension about this thing from my wife? And those factors start coming into play.  I think it's a hardware thing.  You're going straight to YouTube after that, right?  No, we're just coming to the theatre.  After the theatre, nowhere, we are in the theatre.  Then we will see what happens next.  First, we are just coming to the theatre.  Well you're just in the theater.  Yes.  Let's go.  Only in theatres.  Full anxiety.  Full anxiety.  Full anxiety.  Theatrical release is just full anxiety.  Wow.  What does Aamir Khan's anxiety feel like?  What is it?  What are the thoughts in your head?  It won't work.  This type of stuff?   A yes, actually every film has a different quality. I have specifically made this film because this is a very important topic for our society. We have neuro-divergence and I feel that as people, sometimes we become very insensitive.  Like who people who people with ah ah mental disabilities okay.  I think this is the legal term for it in India.  Sure, there is a neurotypical person, just like the one we call normal is called neurotypical and neurodivergence means those whose intellectually they are a little different, intellectually they are a little different from us, right and so this is a topic on which I feel that we have never seen a film made on this on such a large scale on a public platform, or as far as I remember, for me this is not just a film.  There is the film but along with it the entire team has made this film because we want to sensitize people about this topic.  So, there is also anxiety about whether it will reach everywhere or not.  Will this film reach the hearts of the people or not?  Whatever we have done to sensitize people, have we done it right or not?  We see how much impact the film will have on people.  That is one of the concerns that you were asking about.  Right?  It's one of them.  Is there a success failure anxiety associated with it?  Yes, I definitely want us to succeed without a doubt. I want people to like our film. Yes.  Interesting.  The First Movie That I Ever Cried In.  Hmm.  Ever were stars on the ground.  Ok.  And I Seven Six is ​​a 2006 release Sir.  It's probably from 2007 or eight. Okay sir anything you want me to pull up we have magic.  We can just pull up here and we can talk about it, right?  I think it is from 2007, right?  Because I was in seventh grade.  And I remember that I did n't even know that one could cry after watching a movie.  I mean, what does a 10-11 year old child know?  And I remember watching it and crying.  And let's focus on the stars on the ground.  Hmm hmm.  There's something about a story that is so well told.  Hmm that goes right through the heart.  Hum Hum and You have a history of giving cinema like that hmm all the way from Andaz Apna Apna but then but then also Lagaan you know what I am talking about what is that what happens in a story that touches the heart.   Hmm I wonder hmm see I believe that when the writing is good, hmm then no matter what topic we make a film on, it touches the heart if the writing is good, hmm then writing is very important, there is a structure for every film, is there like this if I am ever telling a story to my friends, I need to remember something that's going to help my story land better or if I ever write a story well, for cinema, I can give you some basic tips.  One thing is that premise is very important.  You need to have a clear premise. What are you trying to say with the story you're telling?  What do you want to say in one line ?  For example, if we take the example of Dangal, then the girls are less than the boys, that is the main thought of the film. Brilliant.  Ok?  So you need a strong premise and an affirmative premise.  It should be an arbitrary sentence and there should be a clear premise and then the film is made on that premise. Secondly, your goal setting should be done quickly.  At the beginning of the film, you should tell the audience where the film is going. Like any revenge film, Yaadon Ki Baaraat came a long time back in the 70s.  There are three brothers.   He sees his parents getting murdered with his own eyes.  Then they get separated.  So as soon as that prog ended the kids got separated.  The parents have been murdered.  So, we as an audience know where this film is going.  These three children will meet each other when they grow up, find each other and then take revenge from the villain.  So the goal is set very early in the film. At the very beginning of the film, in the first 101% we understand where the story is going.  In Lagaan, when Bhuvan says that the condition is accepted.  We hope your goal is locked, I see, so goal locking is an important aspect early enough and then there are two-three things that the more streamlined you keep the narrative, the character development should be good, along with the main plot, the sub-plots should also be interesting.  And the resolution of your sub-plots should end before the main plot ends. You should wind up the sub plots before the main plot.  Because once the main goal is achieved, the public will not pay attention.  She will not pay attention.  The movie is done for me.  Right right right.  This remains an open loop.  There are some basic things. Yes.  Which has to be taken care of. Sir, in Ghazni, goal setting is a little late, isn't it? Because first you are showing all this happiness and it's all good.  No, no, no.  Good.  Ghajini starts in the present tense when you see that he kills a man, right right right right, then from there you are confused that he is not remembering anything, he is taking photos, I do n't know what he is doing, I get it but I get it you are right because in the beginning when it shows all that confusion jacked, means you all jacked and whatever that is the moment you are already aware that something is going to happen there is some strangeness about us or I C I C that's very interesting it is a book of art and dramatic writing by the writer, it is very difficult to name it, friend. I always forget.  Sir I asked him will he find Eugene or yes the Art of Dramatic Writing.  The Art of the Art of Dramatic Writing, that book is very helpful.  Not just for theatre but for cinema.  It was written for the theatre.  Yes it is.  Lajos Lajos Ergery.  Agri.  Agri Agri Yes, it is a very difficult name.  I can't pronounce it. Where is the treatment Agri bhai?  This is very interesting.  I don't know friend where are you from ?  This is good Hungarian.  is Hungarian. Well very interesting. 1888 There's something about stories that are so timeless that he writes the book in 1888. We read that book till today. Actually he has made a whole lot of science writing, you know he is actually broken down writing.  Hum and I think what he did is that he tried to, well this what he explains about writing, he is talking about mainstream writing, otherwise you can write anyone, there are no rules in writing, you can write the way you want to, but if you want more people to connect with your material, then he tells you that there are certain things which psychologically keep people connected and from the research that he has done, all these things have come out that the premise should be clear, goal setting should be quick, all this is interesting and sometimes we even break the rules of writing. But if you have understanding then you yourself understand that I am breaking this rule and why I am breaking it. What is its pay off going to be?  Sometimes you have to break the rules.  Hum but you should know why you are breaking the rules and what you are going to do and you know why you are doing it.  I always say you are allowed to break the rules once you are the master of it. That it only comes as a function of now I am the master of these rules.  Now I can break it in style.  Now I can break it for function.  but before that if to to to to to to to to break the rules may be it will crumble whatever the game might be we are I or there is truth in what you are saying but I don't think that I am a master we all are students let me tell you we are all students yes in any field we all keep learning always sure but to what extent sir you can take this compliment that you know you have done fantastic work the country loves you you made cinema I have very rarely connected with cinema cinema is not my strength hmmm hmm the only person I am just the only person like I said I studied when I did it with three deeds cadet the first film I cried in was Tare Zameen Par Satyamev Jayate gave me my moral fabric I was right at that as also when Satyamev Jayate is airing I am like 14 15 like those issues were oh my god and you know I no  Yesterday I was sitting and thinking that forget the podcast if I just talking to Aamir sir what I am going to ask when I wanted to really ask you this do you think all like what do you think is arts responsibility?  You feel there is a need for art because you do a lot of social messaging.  Yes.  Look, I think I am talking about cinema. Talking about cinema, yes I think the primary and fundamental responsibility of an entertainer in cinema is to entertain. If you want sociology lessons you go to college.  You have come to the cinema hall, so obviously you want entertainment.  Yes.  So that I am sharply aware of that my primary responsibilities are to entertain. But I also feel that every profession contributes something or the other to the society. Just like doctors give us health, they give us health.   A People who are in the police force maintain law and order.  Provides security. Provides security.  Our soldiers keep us safe.  Every profession contributes something or the other to the society. [Music] The judiciary is what delivers justice.  So what is the contribution of a creative person to the society?  So I think that it is definitely a huge responsibility to entertain people. But along with that there is another responsibility if we want to take that responsibility.  It is up to you and us and it is our responsibility that actually you can contribute to reach the hearts of the people.  You can gauge their emotions.  You can make them think.  So I feel that the job of an artist is not just to entertain.  Yes, that is the main job.  But at the same time it is also the job of an artist.  When I say artist, I am including painters, poets, writers, all fine arts, whoever is in whichever field, in the artistic field, in a way you bring grace to the society, we, you inspire people, you can if you want to and in this, there is a huge contribution towards nation building. Because a nation is not built with buildings. It happens to people. And when you influence young minds in the right way, then you are able to give the right direction to an entire generation.  I remember when I was growing up, the books I read had a very profound impact on me.  The songs which I have heard, which have been our lyricists in India, Neeraj ji, Shailendra ji, Majroo sahab, all of them, Sahir sahab, they say so much in their poetry, it makes you think, it makes you feel, it makes you realize so many things, that are all part of building you, it builds us, we listen to amazing poetry, we listen to Kabir's couplet, it affects us 100%, we see a painting, it affects us, we read a story, it affects us.  So actually if you mean if one of the things that a creative person can also do other than just entertain people is to bring grace to society is to inspire people is to give hope to people very interesting.  Or I actually think the potential of poetry in our Indian languages.  Yes sir, that means of course I speak only English, otherwise but I do n't have that in English.  Like I, Harivansh, probably grew up reading Bachchan ji's Madhushala, Kabir's couplets, or the qawwalis sung by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, whoever has written them, yes yes sir, what do you say and when you are saying poets are amazing, poets are amazing, you say such a big thing in two lines that it takes a person 8-10-10 years to have that breakdown.  You keep thinking that I have folded everything in my copy of Madhushala and that it has to be rewritten again.  This is the wisdom of the whole life in four lines. We are very next level, we but I think a very unique aspect that cinema has in India is entering people's living room conversations, we said dyslexia, stars on the earth, we whole India knows what dyslexia is, and I will give you a trivial example, hmm, one of you comes up with six pack abs, before that there is no concept in India sir, of six packs, suddenly six pack abs thing, you come out with eight pack abs, now eight pack are a thing, then people start wondering 12 bhi hote hain, like what should we do now, stick to it and so there is a there is an influential power in cinema. Cinema is a very secular medium that everybody consumes.  The entire country consumes it.  And once a film crosses a certain threshold the entire world consumes it.  And you are able to insert through entertainment a small thought which you should remember.  Hmm weather that is excellence.   That was the lesson I learnt in 3 Idiots.  Chess Excellence.  Chess Excellence.  Success will come chasing you.  That was the message that you will chase excellence and success will follow you while he is shaving and waving. Correct.  And you are right.  I mean, I probably undervalued these in my early life and what impact they could have?  Hmm but now in this moment when I look back and see what three things did for me in my college career and how it has all come through.  I am multidisciplinary.  I have read more books and I can remember.  I have rented more scientific papers that I can remember.  I have written more than I can remember. Purely because somebody said to me to chase excellence.  And that has currency.  That has value.  Hum that's what I think or I think it is also an additional challenge.  An artist takes it, I will also do a messaging in it.  Because I can leave you laughing.  Yes yes yes I can let it go with a chuckle.  Yes.  So I think when a script comes which is well written which entertains you also.  It is also saying something different then I get very attracted to these kind of scripts.  Hmm.  This story is also good.   It is entertaining us, but it is also giving us a lot.  In view of that, how do you think of Bhagi's Bose name? I don't think Delhi Belly had any special social message.  It was sir.  There was a message about tasty food. This was the message that you will get laxatives. You are forgetting.  He had only one message. She it happens. Yes, right.  There was only one message from Delhi, Valley. Damn that movie sir, I have shown the pictures to so many white people that I should explain to you where I am from.  Come sit.  That Movie Became a Cultural Bridge Today.  Yes yes.  Wow what a film.  That movie and its opening was such a bold movie, in the beginning, in the world, when the song starts, it is something like this.  Right?  It's [ __ ] beautiful.  Cycle Blues.  yes right right. Tell me the story of your favorite childhood memory. o Favorite childhood memory.  Take a second.   I have many childhood memories. What do you remember most fondly? Some birthday party, some friend hang out. Ah hum I spent a lot of time with my mother growing up. yes what was that like lovely she is a very wonderful warm soft hearted person she is ranging from all of us to multiple intelligences and it is not necessary to be in reading and writing for some of them you could be a good orator you could be the speciality of Ammi is that she is a very caring person.  She has an intelligence of picking up that dude this guy is feeling really bad about this thing.  She can sense very fast that a person is not feeling good.  And she is very caring.  So that's something I picked up from her.  What would you do with her in your childhood?  Like how would you spend time?  What stories did you hear from him? No, I should just hang on with her.  Well, a lot of times.  She would be doing some housework or some work of her own. You just hang out.  Hey, even when she went shopping , she used to take us along.  We used to get very excited during shopping time.  Yes, I am sure.  But they lived together.  So I have spent a lot of time with me growing up.  One of the worst memories of my childhood is going shopping with my mother. Because I'm standing there friend finish it now. what are you buying?  I am already understanding it.  It's been 2 hours, it's been 3 hours, it's still going on. Right?  And some of my best childhood memories are when I was three, four, five years old and when I used to go to sleep, my father used to narrate stories to me from Panchatantra, Mahabharata, Ramayana every day and he would fall asleep while narrating and we would also fall asleep while listening to it. Hmm but again, the foundation that those stories created, a moral fabric, an ethical fabric was created, that was very impactful. And the memory or I also love stories, when I was a kid, I used to love listening to stories, so when our cook was done with dinner, she would tell us some stories, she told the story of Sheikh Chilli, yes, then there used to be the Hawa Mahal programme on the radio, well, you heard about Hawa Mahal, it comes even today, you can listen to it, yes, what happens in it, there is a radio spot of 10-15 minutes, okay, the spot is proper, like audio, yes, then because Abba Jaan was a film producer, so many writers, directors used to come to our house to narrate stories to Abba Jaan. I loved stories very much, so I used to sit in a corner.  I used to sit and listen from the age of five or six years old, so I think from that age till the age of 16, 17, 18, when I became an assistant and started working, I have heard hundreds of stories at home with Abba Jaan. I did not know at that time that I would enter films, actually my Gurukul style training was going on, which I, when I did not know, yes I did not know that time, I had never even thought at that time that I would enter films.  But today when I think about it, actually that was my training ground as the films were being made around us and we were watching them.  Right?  But sir how can this happen?  Like I mean I'm too young to know but cinema cinema is happening around you. You are living in Bombay.  You are part of a solid let's say solid film family.  I don't want to, your father was a producer you said.  My father was a producer.  Right!  Is that what it is now it is a natural consequence of things now if my father was a producer most likely I would be acting it just begs the future to happen then would you be considering an alternate career at some point no no I had never thought about it but actually this is not a thing of now, this has been happening since before which it is very natural for children to take on what their parents are doing because you see that going on around you, a lot of kids and up doing what their fathers, parents are doing it is a very natural process but I had never thought that I was very interested in sports.  So I wanted to be a sports person.  How would you play?  Cricket?  I used to play cricket, all racket games, tennis, adl.  TT.  Adele has just arrived.  I am just joking, I was very interested in sports and I had never thought about what I should do in life.  Yes. But when there were holidays after 10th , at that time I had a friend named Aditya Bhattacharya.  Good. Aditya Bhattacharya is the son of Basu Bhattacharya. Basuda was a film maker. Aditya wanted to make a student film and he asked for my help. I said I will help you, so we guys said, I was helping him. We made the film during the holidays after the 10th board exams. He directed it, I helped him. There were only two of us in all the departments. We were doing everything. So my experience of that one month was so much that I enjoyed doing that work that I felt, yes this is this world, I want to live in this world, the world of stories.  So I was around 16 and so when I first decided I want to be in the films very interesting yes is this that this is Aditya yes this is Aditya this is Aditya you are still friends I am assuming ya we are still friends wow so this man gives you the sort of impulse once inside I leave you wondering how the picture looks like yes the fun of working in films, the madness that happens, I experienced that first hand when I worked with Aditya in his first film his first film was called Paronoya.  It was an interesting short film of 40 minutes.  And there were no dialogues in it.  There was no background music , no sound effects, nothing.  There was no soundtrack.  ok so i mean that is just visual.  Good.  Just Visual.  And awkward silence.  Meaning hissing silence, just there was silence in the entire theatre. Only some visuals are running on the screen. And those visuals are some what psychological paranoia style that means man it was about a boy growing up. He is a 16 year old boy, what is his reaction to experiencing violence for the first time, it is interesting.  What is his reaction to his parents?  Hmm what is his reaction to his first case what is his reaction to him you know getting physical for the first time with his girlfriend.  So the experiences or psyche of a boy of that age and how he is you know so it was a kind of a slice of different emotions.  It wasn't really a linear script and you knew there was a specific plot in it.  It was not like that.  Hum more a collection of scenes.  I mean, my guess is that you are probably closer to your mother when you grow up?  Yes.  Who hit you more ?  Aunty did it, uncle did it or not, father did it.  Well yes Bajan did.  How many times would he have hit you?  Meaning was it frequent? But I don't know. It's a beau question.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  No, it was not that frequent. We have been beaten up a couple of times.  Once or twice.  Yes.  Did you have fun like this?  You were just young.  We used to keep doing some fun or the other. Faisal and I were both brothers.  They used to fight separately.  This or that.  And Abba Jaan's hand was quite heavy as well.  Every Baba, that, that's print also used to come.  Then the next day when he had to go to school, everything was visible to him that he was studying. My Baba has probably slapped me a total of three times in my life.  But it's been 30 years. He has counted 30 years.  do you remember ?  I beat you once.  do you remember?  Oh brother, the man feels so bad. But yes, in retrospect it seems right. Not so bad in retrospect. Tell me about this idea of ​​perfect?  What do you think of perfect or that level of perfectionism got associated with you for quite a bit.  What do you think of that label?  Start with the idea.  What is perfection to you?  I think there is no such thing as perfection in creativity because every person has his own point of view.   There is no one way to do anything. So it's there is no perfect way of doing anything in the creative world. Hmm so I don't believe in perfection.  I believe in magic.  More from us?  So when we are doing any scene or trying to capture any moment, does magic happen in it or not?  Did we get something which was really special.  Which may have happened my mistake also.  So but I am looking for magic.  Not Perfection and How Do You Get a Sense of Magic?  you just watch it and you you you you you know it and is it there?  You come to know you feel it.  Ok.  What do you think of that whole media labeling that happened around you? Mr. Perfect.  Mr. Perfectionist something of that nature?  Yes.  That labelling, actually, I do n't know, that labelling happened some 15-20 years ago. Right. I think my films were running one after the other. So I think the media didn’t know what to do?  What to do?  Yes.  No not because he thought this is perfect. This is called perfectionism.  So there I got that label perfectionist.  But nothing is perfect in creativity. Hmm it is different.  Every man does his own thing. Sure.  But it was also because you are very hyperfocused on one movie in a year, something of that nature was also part of your repeat war at that time that I would do very focused work.  From Lagaan to Lagaan, I have done more than one film at a time because that was how people worked in those days and for many years, I have been trying to do only one film at a time. But my producers and directors were not ready for that.  Then when I produced Lagaan, I said that at this time we will do only one film.  And from then till now, by and large, I have done only one film at a time.  Hmm what was so unique about Lagaan in that it was made by you I was a producer so I could decide how it would be made right so I said I will do the sing sound, I will do it in one schedule, I will bring in the first AD system, so these were not the things that I wanted to do, so as a producer when I started as a producer, I included all these things in my film, I heard I have heard this, I do n't understand that much what is this unique first AD thing that you brought for Lagaan oh I know it's a little bit like you created that sort of position in the modern cinema, Hindi cinema ecosystem what is so unique about this first AD position and what is this exactly, it just makes it, it's a very organised way of working, there's a lot of paper work in it, so there are less mistakes because things are planned well and advanced and the first AD is the centre of influence.  And he and she controls set. So how much time will it take for prep? It's so he's the First AD, he's a person who's not actually a creative person.  Hmm he is an administrative person.  So it is his only responsibility to ensure that the work goes on smoothly and the schedule that I have made as a First AD is followed.  We should not go, we should not fall behind schedule.  And things should happen in time.  So, the First AD is not really concerned with how well you are making the film.  Hum, he is concerned with whether you are doing it in time or not.  Got it.  Hum and because he is a centre of information he and she, so he is the one who gives that information out to different departments so that they can work in synchronization.  Because we have so many departments working together.  So, there has to be someone's synchronicity.  Yes.  So that is the responsibility of the First ED.  So that was n’t there earlier.  I used to be the chief assistant. Why did he exactly not do the paper work at that time?  As an assistant when I first worked. I was 18 when I started with Zara. So the shooting of the film had started. I join you a little late.  So I asked the Chief Assistant, have you guys completed this paper work?  Let me just see.  So he said which paperwork? So, you must have done something like location breakdown, actor requirements, property requirements, costume requirements. Not only this, we know all this here. So I said, well then mistakes happen.  Now tell me, I will write it.  Yes.  Yes.  Then you start making mistakes.  You know when you don't do the paper work properly. So when you do this systematically, mistakes are reduced.  It is not that it does not happen, it happens less.  The chances of these things going wrong is less is reduced.  So it 's a very planned way of working which I thought is nice.  So we should bring it in interesting.  I have a question.  We are What Are You Self-Conscious About Even Now?  Well, we are self-conscious about many things. Like when in PK I had to do that scene when I come as an alien.  There would be clothes.  Yes.  I was conscious.  I was definitely self- conscious.  Right.  So yes.  But like but you deal with it.  That's my job, man.  I had to do that scene. I am playing a character.  Which we have used in this film also. Good.  He is a basketball coach.   There's a basketball coach and he's Tingu.  Everyone calls him Tingu.  Good.  So you play to the insecure.  Or he is very insecure about his height.  He doesn’t have to listen to it. He feels very bad when someone calls him Tingu.  Very self conscious about his height.  Yes.  So that was one thing I was self conscious about earlier when I started out as an actor isn't it funny that a lot of very successful people are shorter I don't think about their height I don't think so but sir I mean if you feel wait I think people think that I'm shorter than you try harder in the world to achieve things you you you you you you think that loop exists that does I suppose that does you see what research finds but that could play a factor sure hmm and there was a lot I know many you know taller people who are successful and very talented and what is your height I will take the compliment sir you say no problem yes yes right right right right right interesting but this is what happens when you are struggling with something in your childhood for example if you are dyslexic and you see in school that yaar  People are understanding but I am not able to understand. So that does drive you to work harder perhaps but that can also depress you it can also dishearten you and it can also drive you to work harder it can both things can happen but I think you are right about one thing in childhood when you face challenges it kind of brings out the fight in you it creates character it creates character fire yes it creates fire a hunger is created in me sir all the injuries are a source of motivation I tell my audience to remember that you should not suppress all the injuries you have suffered.  They have to be channeled.  You will understand in a year and a half or two how to run a channel.  Right now is the point of grieving.  Grieve your grief. When eventually it does become energy there is nothing like a good injury. Hum Hum All greatness becomes begins after a great failure.  I think that's very well my failures have been my biggest teachers for sure.  Right? The most I have learned is from my failures. My failures have taught me the most.  What do you think is the film that audiences will remember the longest from you?  Hmm from my films?  Yes. Oh I don't know.  Take a guess.  I will actually ask taare zameen par.  Tare zameen par wood you think for me I think it.  Three dears 3 yes three idiots.  But this is the 3D generation sir.  These are under 25 children.  They do n't have much history, no life, actually Andaz Apna Apna also I think just me that's all I was waiting for let's say it game over because ah my favourite is Andaz hum my favourite it's a mad film totally madam what is your favourite film of yourself I think it would be Tare Zameen Par okay or Tare Zameen Par 3 Idiots dos two and I mean Lagaan is no less no Lagaan is no less Dangal is great Dangal is great or Sarfarosh is very good Sarfarosh Sarfarosh Sarfarosh is the one with Naseeruddin sir ji in which you are a police officer I am an IPS officer or right right yes why do you think if so people will remember Tare Zameen Par or for that matter Andaz Apna Apna and your favourite movie Tare Zameen Par why do you you you you think is that difference what is the audience looking for versus what you looking for in a movie the reason Amongst my films I mean it is very difficult most toh main pehle bolo yaar it is very difficult for me to choose but if I have to choose one then I would choose Tare Zameen Par simply because of the kind of impact it has on the head.  Tare Zameen Par three years have a very deep impact on the society.  Helped a lot of kids.  The lives of many children changed.  Parents' lives changed. And so that's why I told him a lot about I, that's why I think it's a special film for me. Ok.  It was able to help a lot of people. Interesting.  Yes.  Do me your favor.  Hmm explain the story the plot of Sitare Zameen Par without giving it away give people a bite yes well it's really a story about Tare Zameen Par which is the exact opposite of my character ok Nikum was very sensitive Gulshan is very insensitive he is a rude type of man he is quarrelsome he gets angry quickly I feel that I am always right he hits the police car after drinking alcohol and asks them is there any place to park his vehicle.  So it is always right, it feels that way.  So that's kind of the character and it's really the story of how he gets this punishment actually to teach basketball to a team of players with intellectual disabilities. So, in those three-four months when he is teaching him basketball, he actually teaches him to be a good person.  Hum That's the crux of the film Interesting Or in Tare Zameen Par the teacher helps the child. In this, the neuro divergent lot of players improve the coach. Interests bring changes in his life. Hmm it's the opposite of that.  So, it's almost like its humor.  Well it's Peremyper was very emotional.  Yes.  This is very humorous.  Humor is the vehicle. Are you saying that this is primarily a comedy? Yes.  Well it's a comedy film.  Ya ya it's a light hearted film like a Raju Irani genre.  good OK.  He uses humor.  What he is saying is very important.  Like in 3 idiots.  But he uses humor as a vehicle to tell you.  That is the genre.  A very interesting this owner.  Ok. Ok why no OTT with sitare zameen par yaar if I tell you to buy this glass from me and I want to sell it so you buy it from me and if I tell you that if you don’t buy it then I will come and drop it at your home after 8 weeks for which you don’t have to pay any extra money then why would you buy it from me I do n’t think any other product in the world would be sold in this model. We are the only ones that do this.  Right? So it does make sense to me.  Good.  And so once the theatrical release of Sitare Zameen Par is over there is no other way to watch it than that. Let's see well let's see you make the decision when it comes. When it comes.  Right now I am focusing only on theatres.  I was doing my research and I found that for this movie you were offered quite a bit of money from not just OTTs but studios etc and you had this idea that I will make it myself and like you rejected the OTTs, is there any other specific reason why you would do that or it's just that you wanted creative control as no I just feel it's the wrong way to release a film.  Well or you just feel it's not the right way to release a film.  It's not it's you're not being fair to the material.  So much hard work has gone into the film.  I am not comfortable with that.  Got it.  So now, I am not criticising anyone for whom I work. It works for a lot of people and I appreciate that. Right.  Doesn't work for me, so I don't want to do that. Hmm.  I have full you know, I have full loyalty for the theatres in the cinema halls.  I feel it's a very different way of connecting with a film, a little sorry sorry no sir, yes sorry, so what is it, when we watch a film, there should be some enjoyment in it, you sit in a dark theatre, on a big screen, the way you connect is probably in an experience, here bells are ringing and notifications are also coming, so what film will you watch in that, so for me you know it's really great to watch a film in the darkness of a theatre where you are, that's the best way to watch a film.  No I would even say so much as it's super difficult to watch anything long form because my phone is ringing. I just received my food order. Right now my friend is saying that you come online, we will play a game.  What do I do and how do I focus?  How can I focus on my studies ?  But movies are still secondary for me. You focus on anything.  How do I focus?  This is a real problem.  And this real problem is an issue for all of us.  Right?  So I completely agree.  Or to watch it in a theatre, one thing I have a lot of loyalty for cinema halls and theatres and I have faith in my audience and if the film is made well then they will come to watch it in the theatre, yes I believe that who is he is your best friend in the industry, oh I have got a lot of good friends, okay good friends, very good friends, or Ranbir Ranveer Anil Kapoor, Jackie Salman Shahrukh, okay or and would you talk about when you guys hang out in cinema, I saw some video of Ranbir being at your place and then recently, yes walking in, those stars were very excited to see him, actually I did for them because this is his first film.  These 10 actors who are neuro divergent.  Right right right right right.  So this is a very special occasion for them so I want to give them the best.  Got it, got it, got it.  So, he wants to meet Ranbir.  So, actually I surprised them.  They did not know that Ranbir was coming, Sachin was coming. Got it.  They didn't know that.  So let them thrill.  Yes.  And like I am keeping the premiere on the 18th. I get very irritated at premieres. Why?  Hey, it is very difficult to organize and then I am playing the host.  When all my seniors are coming, I get very tensed.  Center of attention.  No, I am not the centre of attention, there is a lot of responsibility that day, friend. Well but I am doing it for them because I feel it would be really exciting for them. Or they will get to meet the whole industry and you know then they will be the stars on that evening right so I want to do it for them. got got it got it got it.   Do you still play chess?  Once in a while or are you amazed with what is happening to India and Indian chess?  Do you have any ideas ?  I keep track of it a little bit.  These days I am very engrossed in films so I do n't keep track of anything actually.  Right.  You know that world champion is now Indian. Gokesh is now become world champion?  Yes sir.  When was this?  This is how many months ago?  four five months ago just in classical style classical style.  And so Magnis basically said I won't play anymore.  So that's why I did n't play that tournament.  No.  He didn't play that.   he gave up.  Yes.  And even the Candidates run before he entered the World Championship was phenomenal from Gokesh.  And then I mean sir as somebody who grows up playing chess I am so proud where India is set to chess and I make it a point that I mention this because people don't realise the kind of dominance India has on chess is the kind of dominance India has on cricket.  That's right.  This happened at this time.  Yes.  And it's only going to get better because I start naming under 20-21 years old chess players who are top 20 already.  It just doesn't end.  It's just India.  ya ya just no.  I think lots of young kids in India have taken up chess.  I think Anand also had a big hand in this.  These are these are wishes kids.  Or, or, or.  This is she's kids.  Or.  His impact is 1:1 and I mean I started playing in the light of Anand becoming world champion. Because he infiltrates the culture, everybody is like, hey this is the Indian chess champion, this that.  And I remember seeing him for the first time.  I was like be nine and 10 hero moment.  hero.  Hey amazing cow.  Or, I am sure sir.  I never met him again after that.  But hero moment and now we are seeing what one man can do for the rest of the country.  Hmm. It's incredible.  As a fin.  Or are you philosophical and spiritual about life?  Do you believe in God? Actually release religion I feel it's a very personal thing.  Hmm for people.  So I try and not talk about it on public platforms.  I get it.  But are you spiritual?  I think so.  Hmm.  I think so.  Do you meditate?  I do.  Or.  what type? Well I had been to Vipassana which I had to cut shot after four days my eye I lost my friend actually a very close friend my mind passed away so I had to go on a boat on the fourth night but those four days really had a deep impact on me.  It's like a boot camp for meditation or I have done Vipassana twice or you have done it twice and I feel like it is a factory reset of life when life goes out of hand, I sit there for 10 days and all the ghosts inside me from which the man is running away, come back. Nothing is left behind.  Hum and I think I have also read as much as Goenka ji says in his lectures. Superb no agenda.  Or there is no irrelevant thing mixed in it.  There's no mixing up of messaging here and there. Focus on simple techniques.  If it works then sit, if it does n't work then leave.  That's it.  Hm but for a lot of my psychological unwellness hm Vipana has been a panacea when my mind goes out of my hands and I cannot control it, I go and sit in meditation, yes yes sir and in 10 days it happens that some doctor takes out the whole soul from inside it and now you can see it still exists, it's not that it does not exist but you can see that this is a disease, hey it was not being caught at all, it was making me wander, was chasing it away, you know that starts happening, no meditation I think is it something really amazing or I have one last question we look into the camera and say something to young Aamir as an advice oh or it's a new one, what advice should I give you friend that whatever mistakes you have made are good, do them again, right because only by making those mistakes will you reach here.   By learning from those mistakes.  Got it.  Got it. well sir.  We have to cut this shot.  You be on a very busy tour.  Thank you so much.  Lovely meeting you and chatting with you here.  I hope so sir.  I hope I got you at the fact.  You lovely energy.  Thank you sir.  If you ever need another person to talk to you.  I am here. Offering my.  But thank you so much for your time.
