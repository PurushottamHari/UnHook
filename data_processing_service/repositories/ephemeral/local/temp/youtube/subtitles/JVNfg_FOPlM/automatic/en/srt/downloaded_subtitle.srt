00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello Friends.  Friends, for the

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,560
first time this has been accepted by Canada that

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,280
terrorists operate from their soil and work against India.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,519
You all must be aware that

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,240
about the Canadian spy agency, it has been

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,199
said in that report that they are openly using

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,279
Canada as a base for planning and funding

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,039
violence in India.  So there is a

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
need to understand this in a little detail because very

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
important news has come.  For the first time, Canada is

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,760
accepting this.  So it is obvious that

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
it will have many implications.  I will discuss with you in detail about its impact on

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
India-Canada relations in the future.

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
Let's move on.  But

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,200

because by using this code you will be

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
able to avail maximum discount.  Let's get started.

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
First let's see

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,400
what exactly just happened.  For the first time, Canada's

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,880
top intelligence agency is CSIS, that is

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,360
Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,479
He has publicly acknowledged and said that

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,640
Khalistani extremists are using

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,520
Canadian territory as a base to incite fund

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
and plan violence in India.  So it is being

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,000
said clearly that there are

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
Christian extremists living in the Canadian territory.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,720
They have made a base for themselves in Canada

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
and they are funding, planning and

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,759
finding out where the violence is.

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
Inside India.  So this admission, in some way,

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,560

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,200
validates India's long standing concern and here,

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Canada, in a way, has been supporting Pro-Kashtani

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
separatist group and it is

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,240

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
trying to counter that and keep in mind that this is basically

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,960
a report issued by CSIS

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
and in CSIS Canada, their

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,920
work is to identify the

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
threat to Canada as per the CSIS Act

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
because see what happens whenever you

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,200
promote terrorist activities, it is

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
not as if

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
it will only impact other countries.  It

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
will impact your country too, if not today then tomorrow.

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
You can see the condition of Pakistan.  Pakistan

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,920
gave shelter to terrorism and they

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
thought that it would only create problems for India.

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
But

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
what is the condition of Pakistan today?  You all are

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
seeing that.  So this thing becomes important

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
that even though these people from Canada are

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
trying to create violence in India.

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
But in tomorrow's date this is going to be

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,160
very important for Canada itself.  It is going to be very

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
fatal.  Well,

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,640
what does the CSIS report say?  Here

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,040
only the presence of extremists has been confirmed.

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
And CSIS has confirmed

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,239
that Khastani militants

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,239
raise funds inside Canada.  They

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
use the Canadian soil to commit

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
violence in India, it is promoted,

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
violence is instigated

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
in India and apart from this there is another very

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
interesting thing because when Justin Trudeau

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
was the Prime Minister of Canada, you will

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,680
remember what he used to say repeatedly that

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
we have freedom of speech here.  We

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
give freedom for everything.  So it has been

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,800
said in this report that by misusing this freedom,

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,120

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,120
attempts are made to do extremist things here.

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,519
Meaning

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,760
these people misuse the liberal democratic protection that Canada has.

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
This has been clearly

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,200
stated in the report.  This is

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
not the only thing in this report.  In fact, the name of this report

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,640
is Public Report on Threats to

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,040
Canada's National Security 2024.

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,280
Another thing said in this is that there are many countries which carry out

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,360
intelligence activities of Canada.

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
Interference within canada.  For

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
example, India, China, Pakistan, Iran,

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
Russia, all of these have been named.

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
Obviously India has repeatedly said that

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
we have no role in it.  And India is

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,040
accused of conducting foreign interference

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
likewise referred to.  As you might remember,

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,680
referring to the murder of Nizar in 2023,

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
India is also being

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
blamed for it somewhere.  But India's

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
stand has always been that we have nothing to do with this murder.

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,480
Still here we

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
repeatedly warn you that

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,760
terrorists operate from your area and the same thing has been

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,479
proven.  Well, India's repeated

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
accusation against Canada that they

115
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,400
encourage and tolerate dangerous activists has

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,479
now been proven.  This

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,120
includes Khalistani referendum.  You may remember that

118
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,960
Christian referendums are held repeatedly in Canada.  The

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
people there are called and

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
voting is done to decide whether they

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
want an independent country or not.  Imagine, this kind of

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
thing is clearly happening in Canada.

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,199
Here public glorification of

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
extremist people and terrorists like

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
General Singh Bhindra, Hardeep Singh Nijar is

126
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,880
glorified and at the same time

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,560
you will see hate speech and violent protests in which

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
Indian

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,479
diplomats are targeted.  This

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,479
happened many times.  In fact, you know,

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,520
before PM Modi went on a visit to Canada,

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
these people were

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,759
trying to organize various types of protests.  In

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
fact, there were reports that an ambush was being plotted,

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,800
and things like

136
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,199
tearing of Indian flags, tearing of PM Modi's

137
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,280
posters, burning them, such things were being done

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
continuously by the terrorists.

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,680
But now because Canada's own

140
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,479
intelligence agency has confirmed it.  This

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,199

142
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,440
may not be good news for Canada and the Canadian government.  Canada repeatedly

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
tells India that Canada has become a safe

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
haven for anti-India elements.  In fact,

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
if you look here, for the first time

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
this report becomes important

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,000
because for the first time this term

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,759
extremism has been used

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,759
against Christians.  Till now these people did

150
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,880
not even use harsh words.   In

151
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,280
fact, since mid-1980, India has been repeatedly saying

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,520
that politically motivated violent

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,840
extremists are operating in Canada

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
and in a way they are

155
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
using and misusing the diaspora

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,680
to create a separate independent nation.  I

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,240
mean, especially

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
if you look at Punjab in India, Punjab in

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
Pakistan is two to three times bigger than Punjab in India.

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,759
These people do not give reference to that.

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,759
So somewhere in this link you will

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
also see support from Pakistan that how

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
Pakistan deliberately supports to create such violence

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
from behind the scenes.  So this is what India says.  In fact, if

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
you look at the historical context,

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
it becomes important because

168
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,560
you will remember that in 1985, Air India was

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,880
bombed.  Before 91,

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
this was the biggest terrorist attack till now.  The Air

171
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,120
India plane which was blown up, in a

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,160
way all the passengers were killed.  So

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,080
India has been warned since 1980 that

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,319
Canada is breeding ground for

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,560
radicalised six separatists.  And

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
if you look at the Christian movement, it is

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,039
dead in India.  The dead end has happened.

178
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
But in Western countries,

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,199

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,199
attempts are made again and again to keep it alive through diaspora support.

181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
Now, as far as Hardeep Singh Nijar is

182
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,600
concerned, it had a lot of implications.  Hardeep

183
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,080
Singh Nijar was basically

184
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,160
killed outside a Gurdwara in British Columbia

185
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
by an unknown gunman and the

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
directly blamed India for this

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
and because of this, if you see, a

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
deep diplomatic crisis had arisen,

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
both the countries had expelled their diplomats,

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,960
visa service was suspended temporarily,

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
Canada had

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,360
stopped trade talks with India,

194
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
CSIS, now because they have accepted the fact that

195
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
whether it is Nijar or

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,240
a large Christian extremist

197
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,160
network, it operates inside Canada.

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
Now the question is

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
what will be its repetition?  What will be its implication?   The

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
first is diplomatic relation.  This means that

201
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,720
somewhere or the other

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,880
you will see a cooldown in Canada's relations with India.

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
But yes this will be

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
problematic for Canada.  Because Canada has been

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
building a narrative for quite some time now.  He was

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
blaming India.

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,759
As far as freedom of speech is concerned, it

208
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,840
may not be available that much now.  Now in Canada,

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,160
we will give full freedom of speech instead of what used to happen earlier.  Say what you want to

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,240
say, do what you want to do.

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,039
But now here an attempt will be made to balance the free

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,879
speech right with anti-terrorism enforcement.

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,039

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,440
But yes, its effect

215
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,479
can also be that there will be some pressure on the Sikh diaspora

216
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,720
as well.  Who are law abiding

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
Canadian Sikhs and with whom there is no issue.

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
Obviously these are our

219
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
citizens too.  They are people of Indian origin.

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
Many of our own citizens go there.

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
So there is no problem with them.  But

222
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,919
they, too, may face greater scrutiny.

223
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
Apart from this, diaspora

224
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,400
politics may increase.  The impact comes upon it.

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,720
If

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
you observe, Canadian politicians are often in touch

227
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
with Khastani groups.  But now they too will have to maintain

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,599
distance due to this

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
because their own

230
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
intelligence agency has told them so.  Well, now the

231
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,760
question is what could be India's response

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,159
?  Look, India will make full use of this report.  He will

233
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,800
try to take diplomatic leverage and say,

235
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,880
look, arrest your radical leaders.

236
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,320
Stop the Khalistani related referendums and make the intelligence cooperation

238
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,240
with India more close and

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,560
faster.  And there will be a

240
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
demand that Canada should stop being a

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,360
safe haven for terror financing.  This becomes very

242
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,279
important.  And in fact, if you

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
see, this visit of PM Modi

244
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,080
during the G7 Summit has been a big breakthrough.

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Because due to this the

246
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,080
ties between the two countries have been

247
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
reset again.  For example, in order to maintain

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
diplomatic ties, the High

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Commissioners will be reappointed

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
in both the countries.  Apart from this, the

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
normal diplomatic services will

252
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
resume and the embassies will

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
resume full functionality.  This

254
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,920
is a very good thing.  Then secondly the trade

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,680
negotiation will start here.  India and Canada will

256
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
again start negotiations on the free trade agreement

257
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
which was suspended in 2023

258
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
and this may affect many things like critical

259
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,279
minerals, agricultural exports,

260
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,760
pharmaceutical digital services from India.  Apart from

261
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,680

262
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,920
this, intelligence sharing

263
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
regarding terrorism can also

264
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,160
start rapidly between India and Canada.  Apart from

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,560
this, the visa services will be

266
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
restored again.  Canada Depends on

267
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,959
Indian Immigrants for Tech and Health

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Care Sectors.  Easier student and work

269
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
visas are now probably expected to

270
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,880
start coming in faster.  Apart from this there

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
are many global issues.

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
Joint work will also be done on food security, climate change etc.

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
by both the countries.

274
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
Now look, this breakthrough is so

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
important because India is among the

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
top 10 trading partners for Canada.  And the

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
Canadian farmers

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
rely a lot on the Indian market.

279
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,760
Indian tech companies, students, and

280
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
diaspora contribute significantly to

281
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,240
Canada's economy.  Apart from this, there

282
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,480
is also its strategy.  The Indo-Pacific

283
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,959
Partnership will give a boost here.

284
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Canada

285
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,160
can play the role of a partner in critical minerals.  You can

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
see how many problems China is

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,920
creating.  So, in critical minerals like

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
EVs etc., whatever

289
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,079
resources we need are available with Canada and

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
it can be provided to us to a large extent.  So there

291
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,200
are a lot of things here.  Now let's see

292
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,959
in which direction things go.

293
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
But I hope that

294
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,320
you would have known about this big news that came.  And

295
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
before I go, a very interesting question.   The

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,279
G7 summit which took place, the leaders of India and Canada

297
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,839
met, first meeting after the fall

298
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,920
out, can you tell me in which city this

299
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
meeting of the G7 summit was held,

300
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
