Hello Friends.  Friends, for the first time this has been accepted by Canada that terrorists operate from their soil and work against India. You all must be aware that about the Canadian spy agency, it has been said in that report that they are openly using Canada as a base for planning and funding violence in India.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail because very important news has come.  For the first time, Canada is accepting this.  So it is obvious that it will have many implications.  I will discuss with you in detail about its impact on India-Canada relations in the future. Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC or for 2026 or for 2027, our Pratigya batch must avail the score.

First let's see what exactly just happened.  For the first time, Canada's top intelligence agency is CSIS, that is Canadian Security Intelligence Service. He has publicly acknowledged and said that Khalistani extremists are using Canadian territory as a base to incite fund and plan violence in India.  So it is being said clearly that there are Christian extremists living in the Canadian territory. They have made a base for themselves in Canada and they are funding, planning and finding out where the violence is. Inside India.  So this admission, in some way, validates India's long standing concern and here, Canada, in a way, has been supporting Pro-Kashtani separatist group and it is trying to counter that and keep in mind that this is basically a report issued by CSIS and in CSIS Canada, their work is to identify the threat to Canada as per the CSIS Act because see what happens whenever you promote terrorist activities, it is not as if it will only impact other countries.  It will impact your country too, if not today then tomorrow. You can see the condition of Pakistan.  Pakistan gave shelter to terrorism and they thought that it would only create problems for India. But what is the condition of Pakistan today?  You all are seeing that.  So this thing becomes important that even though these people from Canada are trying to create violence in India. But in tomorrow's date this is going to be very important for Canada itself.  It is going to be very fatal.  Well, what does the CSIS report say?  Here only the presence of extremists has been confirmed. And CSIS has confirmed that Khastani militants raise funds inside Canada.  They use the Canadian soil to commit violence in India, it is promoted, violence is instigated in India and apart from this there is another very interesting thing because when Justin Trudeau was the Prime Minister of Canada, you will remember what he used to say repeatedly that we have freedom of speech here.  We give freedom for everything.  So it has been said in this report that by misusing this freedom, attempts are made to do extremist things here. Meaning these people misuse the liberal democratic protection that Canada has. This has been clearly stated in the report.  This is not the only thing in this report.  In fact, the name of this report is Public Report on Threats to Canada's National Security 2024. Another thing said in this is that there are many countries which carry out intelligence activities of Canada. Interference within canada.  For example, India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, all of these have been named. Obviously India has repeatedly said that we have no role in it.  And India is accused of conducting foreign interference likewise referred to.  As you might remember, referring to the murder of Nizar in 2023, India is also being blamed for it somewhere.  But India's stand has always been that we have nothing to do with this murder. Still here we repeatedly warn you that terrorists operate from your area and the same thing has been proven.  Well, India's repeated accusation against Canada that they encourage and tolerate dangerous activists has now been proven.  This includes Khalistani referendum.  You may remember that Christian referendums are held repeatedly in Canada.  The people there are called and voting is done to decide whether they want an independent country or not.  Imagine, this kind of thing is clearly happening in Canada. Here public glorification of extremist people and terrorists like General Singh Bhindra, Hardeep Singh Nijar is glorified and at the same time you will see hate speech and violent protests in which Indian diplomats are targeted.  This happened many times.  In fact, you know, before PM Modi went on a visit to Canada, these people were trying to organize various types of protests.  In fact, there were reports that an ambush was being plotted, and things like tearing of Indian flags, tearing of PM Modi's posters, burning them, such things were being done continuously by the terrorists. But now because Canada's own intelligence agency has confirmed it.  This may not be good news for Canada and the Canadian government.  Canada repeatedly tells India that Canada has become a safe haven for anti-India elements.  In fact, if you look here, for the first time this report becomes important because for the first time this term extremism has been used against Christians.  Till now these people did not even use harsh words.   In fact, since mid-1980, India has been repeatedly saying that politically motivated violent extremists are operating in Canada and in a way they are using and misusing the diaspora to create a separate independent nation.  I mean, especially if you look at Punjab in India, Punjab in Pakistan is two to three times bigger than Punjab in India. These people do not give reference to that. So somewhere in this link you will also see support from Pakistan that how Pakistan deliberately supports to create such violence from behind the scenes.  So this is what India says.  In fact, if you look at the historical context, it becomes important because you will remember that in 1985, Air India was bombed.  Before 91, this was the biggest terrorist attack till now.  The Air India plane which was blown up, in a way all the passengers were killed.  So India has been warned since 1980 that Canada is breeding ground for radicalised six separatists.  And if you look at the Christian movement, it is dead in India.  The dead end has happened. But in Western countries, attempts are made again and again to keep it alive through diaspora support. Now, as far as Hardeep Singh Nijar is concerned, it had a lot of implications.  Hardeep Singh Nijar was basically killed outside a Gurdwara in British Columbia by an unknown gunman and the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau directly blamed India for this and because of this, if you see, a deep diplomatic crisis had arisen, both the countries had expelled their diplomats, visa service was suspended temporarily, Canada had stopped trade talks with India, CSIS, now because they have accepted the fact that whether it is Nijar or a large Christian extremist network, it operates inside Canada. Now the question is what will be its repetition?  What will be its implication?   The first is diplomatic relation.  This means that somewhere or the other you will see a cooldown in Canada's relations with India. But yes this will be problematic for Canada.  Because Canada has been building a narrative for quite some time now.  He was blaming India. As far as freedom of speech is concerned, it may not be available that much now.  Now in Canada, we will give full freedom of speech instead of what used to happen earlier.  Say what you want to say, do what you want to do. But now here an attempt will be made to balance the free speech right with anti-terrorism enforcement. But yes, its effect can also be that there will be some pressure on the Sikh diaspora as well.  Who are law abiding Canadian Sikhs and with whom there is no issue. Obviously these are our citizens too.  They are people of Indian origin. Many of our own citizens go there. So there is no problem with them.  But they, too, may face greater scrutiny. Apart from this, diaspora politics may increase.  The impact comes upon it. If you observe, Canadian politicians are often in touch with Khastani groups.  But now they too will have to maintain distance due to this because their own intelligence agency has told them so.  Well, now the question is what could be India's response ?  Look, India will make full use of this report.  He will try to take diplomatic leverage and say, look, arrest your radical leaders. Stop the Khalistani related referendums and make the intelligence cooperation with India more close and faster.  And there will be a demand that Canada should stop being a safe haven for terror financing.  This becomes very important.  And in fact, if you see, this visit of PM Modi during the G7 Summit has been a big breakthrough. Because due to this the ties between the two countries have been reset again.  For example, in order to maintain diplomatic ties, the High Commissioners will be reappointed in both the countries.  Apart from this, the normal diplomatic services will resume and the embassies will resume full functionality.  This is a very good thing.  Then secondly the trade negotiation will start here.  India and Canada will again start negotiations on the free trade agreement which was suspended in 2023 and this may affect many things like critical minerals, agricultural exports, pharmaceutical digital services from India.  Apart from this, intelligence sharing regarding terrorism can also start rapidly between India and Canada.  Apart from this, the visa services will be restored again.  Canada Depends on Indian Immigrants for Tech and Health Care Sectors.  Easier student and work visas are now probably expected to start coming in faster.  Apart from this there are many global issues. Joint work will also be done on food security, climate change etc. by both the countries. Now look, this breakthrough is so important because India is among the top 10 trading partners for Canada.  And the Canadian farmers rely a lot on the Indian market. Indian tech companies, students, and diaspora contribute significantly to Canada's economy.  Apart from this, there is also its strategy.  The Indo-Pacific Partnership will give a boost here. Canada can play the role of a partner in critical minerals.  You can see how many problems China is creating.  So, in critical minerals like EVs etc., whatever resources we need are available with Canada and it can be provided to us to a large extent.  So there are a lot of things here.  Now let's see in which direction things go. But I hope that you would have known about this big news that came.  And before I go, a very interesting question.
