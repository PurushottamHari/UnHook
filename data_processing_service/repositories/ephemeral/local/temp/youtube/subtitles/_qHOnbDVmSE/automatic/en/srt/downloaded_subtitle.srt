1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Every Single Book Pitch Has Toppers Like

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,040
But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it wo

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
n't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
then what is the use of reading them again and again

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
?

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
IQ.

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
Hello Friends.  Friends, the

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,239
situation has now become very serious in the Middle East.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,559
Things got to the point that US President Donald Trump, who had gone to the G7 Summit, had to

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,800

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,040
leave it midway.  You all know that

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
recently PM Modi has also reached Canada for the

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,079
G7 Summit.  So here Donald

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,640
Trump gave such a warning and said such a thing

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,360
which caused a stir in Iran's capital Tehran.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,559
He said everyone should

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,760
immediately evacuate Tehran.  You can see this

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,359
news Trump cut shot G7 visit with a

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
warning.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
as to what exactly is happening right now.

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,360

29
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
Why did Donald Trump give this warning?  What is its impact and

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,799
what might happen next?  I will tell you all that in

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
detail.  First of all, here

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
you can see what Donald Trump

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
said.  Donald Trump has

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,439
given a statement here on Truth Social Media and you

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,159
can see what he has to say.  Iran should have

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,400
signed the deal.  I told them to sign.

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
Basically, they are repeatedly redefining this thing

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
that I have been trying to do for the last several days, to

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,640
deal with Iran.

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
Basically they should talk about the nuclear deal.

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
You will remember that Barack Obama had struck a

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
deal through JCPOA called Joint Comprehensive

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,040
Plan of Action and later when Donald

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
Trump became President in his first term, he

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
withdrew from that deal.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,200
After which Iran keeps enriching uranium here continuously

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,920
and it

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
is very close to making an atomic bomb and this is the thing that Israel and

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
America do not like at all.

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,680
So now, since Donald Trump

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
became President, he has also written a letter

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
to Iran and asked them to sign the deal as soon as possible.

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
Otherwise it is a

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,600
waste of human life.  And he said

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.  He is

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
repeatedly saying that Iran

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,280
cannot have nuclear weapons.  I said it

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,080
over and over again.  And after that his

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,800
last sentence was, everyone should immediately

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440
evacuate Tehran.  And these were the

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,080
words that caused a stir in entire Tehran

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,239
and people started leaving the place.

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
And because of this, you can see here that

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
he had to leave the G7 summit going on in Canada

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,879
midway.   In

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,680
fact, it is also being said that

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,080
Donald

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
Trump does not want to participate in the joint communication of G7.  Well here

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
you can see the impact that has happened, basically

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
why did he say this?  First of all this

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,400
needs to be understood.  If you notice,

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,239
air strikes have been going on continuously for the last few days.  It's

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
not just Israel that's doing this against Iran.

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,040
Iran has also carried out a massive air

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
strike on Israel and Israel has

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,599
also suffered a lot of damage.  But especially the

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
way Israel is attacking Iran.

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
Its main objective is to

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
destroy the nuclear facilities.

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Apart from this, military command centres were established

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,080
in Tehran.  In fact, a big news came yesterday.  The

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,879
critical infrastructure here,

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,920
radar bases, oil depots were being attacked,

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,879
but yesterday during the live broadcast, the

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,440
TV station, that is, Iran's

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,200
public TV station, was attacked.

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
Here you can see Israel

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,680
bombs Iran state TV during live

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
broadcast.  You can see this, the

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
lady here was delivering the news, she was

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,319
saying something and what happens in the meantime?

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,920
Here, the bomb falls on the building,

93
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
and you can see here

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,080
she leaves it and starts running away.  And let me

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
show you the view outside.

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
What a sight this State TV building is after the strike.  So you are understanding that the

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,799
critical infrastructure in

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,640
Tehran, Iran is now being

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
continuously attacked.  And

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,360

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,440
you will see all this under Operation Rising Line by Israel.

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Basically what Israel wants is to

104
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,840

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
completely [ __ ] Iran's nuclear weapons capabilities.  Secondly,

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,599
what is here is that there is a direct threat of

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,319
regional war.  Meaning, the

108
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,200
statement given by Trump was not to leave Tehran

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,439
immediately and evacuate.  So this

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
shows that it is possible that very soon the

111
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,400
US may jump into this war even more

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,880
and support Israel more

113
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
rapidly, due to which there

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
may be more bombing inside Iran.  And

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
especially inside Tehran.  So Tehran

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
is most likely in immediate danger.  And

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
probably this is why Donald Trump has

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,960
given this statement.  And the US

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
may be preparing for

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,199
military intervention and escalation if

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
diplomacy fails here.

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,160
Diplomacy means what America is saying,

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Trump is saying that you cannot have an atom bomb.

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
So you can simply deal with us here.

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
So if that diplomacy fails

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
then the situation can become very serious.

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
Well, after this statement by Donald

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,520
Trump, do you see

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
what happened in Tehran?  Panic and

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,040
evacuations began inside Tehran.  Here massive

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
panic gripped Tehran and the citizens

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
started going to the fuel stations.

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
Long queues started forming at ATMs.  People

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,400
started withdrawing cash.  Highways

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
going north.  Wazandaran and Gilan.  Let me

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,199
show you.  Here is your map of Iran and

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,000
here is Tehran.  So the provinces above Tehran,

138
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,479
Mazdaaran, apart from this,

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Gilan also became a part of it.  So here people

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,240
started going through highways to

141
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
save themselves.  Apart from this, Iranian

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,440
emergency services were also reported.   It is being

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,199
told that 60 thousand people have been displaced within 48 hours.

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,759
Apart from this, you will see [ __ ] in many places like mobile, internet and network.  On the

146
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
other

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
hand, the Iranian Government said

148
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,479
that there is no need for such a true evacuation right now.

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,960
But yes, curfews have been imposed at many places at localized level,

150
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,880
air rate drills are being conducted

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
continuously in many districts, I mean

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
if you see in Tehran itself, there are

153
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,360
many districts here and you will be

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,199
continuously seeing many air rate sirens and many other

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
things there.  Well

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
now what is the global response here?

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,000
Because what is special is that the G7

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,479
summit is going on at this time.  What have the G7 and NATO said

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,880
?  Basically the G7 countries

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,520
want to issue a joint statement to

161
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,360
stop whatever is happening at the moment.  Meaning, he

162
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,680
wants to request that

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Israel should also restrain and on the other hand

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Iran should also restrain.  But the US

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,600
President has already left it midway

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
and somewhere he has made it clear

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,440
that I do not want to be a part of this.  On the

168
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,680
other hand, NATO has

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,000
also given a warning that if

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
any kind of war between Iran and US is

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
triggered, then this entire region

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
could collapse.

173
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,800
You will see things collapse in a very terrible way in the Middle East.  On the

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,919
other hand,

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman are all

176
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
working as back channel mediators here.   We are

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,479
trying to stop things here.

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,479
And ultimately, whenever

179
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,560
anything happens anywhere in the Middle East,

180
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,800
two countries are often affected, that is

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,840
Iraq and the other is Syria because the

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,759
reason for this is that every country, be it the UK,

183
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,840
America, Iran or Israel,

184
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,840
you will find some interest or the other of each of them in both these countries,

185
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
meaning in a way the

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,319
land is divided that this

187
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,880
area is ours, that is yours.  So here in

188
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
both these countries there is a

189
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
big danger of spillover.  Hezbollah and the

190
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,199
Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,360
Iraq have started mobilization here.

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
Meaning wider regional

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
conflict can trigger from here.

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,639
Well why did Donald Trump do this here

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,639
?  Basically a warning was given to Tehran

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,960
, the people of Tehran were warned to

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,880
immediately evacuate their city.  There

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
could be two or three reasons behind it.  The first thing is that an

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,120
attempt is being made to adopt pressure tactics.

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,360
Meaning that the Iranian regime is being isolated in a way that

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
now your

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
regime cannot protect you.

203
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,319
You will have to leave your city.

204
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
Or they are also signaling military readiness.  This

205
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,120
means that America is trying to dominate Middle East

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
diplomacy.

207
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
Then in addition

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
here Premly is

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
justifying if any type of

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,080
joint operation takes place.  Meaning,

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,160
suppose tomorrow Israel and US attack together, then

212
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
in that case they will be

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
able to justify that look, we had already given

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
you a warning for evacuation.

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,440
And see what happens

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
as soon as Donald Trump gives this warning to the

217
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,759
people of Tehran.  After that many

218
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
explosions were seen inside Tehran.

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,440
If you look at many videos etc., it was

220
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
continuously coming out that

221
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
smoke started coming out from there, from the building.

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,000
And the question here is, is it

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,919
possible?  Because let me tell you

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
what happened first, the

225
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,319
spokesperson of the Israeli Defense Forces

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,399
gave a warning to the people of Tehran.   The

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
third district in Tehran is

228
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,760
divided into many one-two-three districts.  So the third

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
districts were in a way

231
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,000
told to evacuate.  Due to which,

232
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,919
you see, more than 3 lakh people were affected

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
in that particular area.  But now

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,720
if Donald Trump says the entire Tehran, I

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,080
mean the population of Tehran, you can understand that it is

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,560
around 10 million.  10 million means

237
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
around 1 crore.  So it is possible that

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,480
people will be evacuated from there immediately.  It

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,000
is not possibile.  So somewhere the

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
question is being raised as to why such

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
warnings are being given.  Well whatever it is,

242
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,440
if

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
you see it from India's perspective, you will find many of our people there too.  In

244
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
fact, it is said

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,160
that around 10,000 Indians are

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,760
currently inside Iran.  So here the Indian

247
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Government has also started efforts.

248
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,800
What happened is that the air route is totally

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,040
closed and Iran has also said here that

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
you cannot take that air route.

251
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,279
So the land borders here are

252
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,519
open at this time.  And efforts are being made to

253
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,360
take it to the nearby countries.

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,760
And it is obvious if you

255
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,519
look at the neighboring country of Iran.  In fact,

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,839
if you go to the North Western side from here,

257
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,160
then on the top you will see Azar

258
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,480
Bhaijaan here and here is Armenia.  Now you know that

259
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,800
relations between India and Armenia are good.  They

260
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,120
are better.  Defence deals etc. have also been done.

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,120
So here now we are being taken to the border of Armenia.

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,040
Around 100

263
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Indians have already

264
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,200
reached the Armenia border so that they can be

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
brought back to India from there.  So

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
you will see this situation of evacuation.

267
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,640
Well in the middle of all this,

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
just

269
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,000
before I was recording the video, another important news came

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
from G7.  In Canada, French

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,560
President Macron has revealed this for the

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
first time that he said that he had a

273
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,480

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
conversation with the US President Donald Trump and

275
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,839
somewhere he has placed the Cspire deal proposal

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,320
here and said that Israel is

277
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,320
halting its strike if Iran freezes

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
further retaliation.  If Iran does

279
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
not retaliate from here then Israel

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
can stop the strike here.  If Iran does

281
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,240
not carry out uranium enrichment beyond 60% purity, then things will stop here

283
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
and at the same time we can do European mediation,

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
perhaps together with France and

285
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,640
Switzerland.  So, this was an

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,560
attempt to make some kind of deal

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,560
by Don Trump.  But on the other

288
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,440
hand, what has been the response from Iran?  Iran

289
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,519
says that look, we are open to a deal here

290
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
somewhere.  Now see, if you

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,360
observe, Iran is also becoming a little soft.

292
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,959
The kind of situation that is developing.   In

293
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
a way, Iran also wants a

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,519
ceasefire to happen somehow.  So here

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,079
he is saying, look, Israel has to

296
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
stop first.  If Israel attacks our critical

297
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,720
infrastructure, it means we

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
need an international guarantee that Israel will

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,040
not attack us again.  That's why we are going to

300
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,760
stay here.  So, in a way,

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,920
if you look at both the sides, here an

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,399
attempt is being made to show oneself as greater than before.

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
Well Donald Trump has already been here.

304
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,399
What could be the reason for that

305
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,240
from G7?  In a way, crisis management is

306
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
obvious; a big situation exists

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
in the Middle East.  So military

308
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
and diplomatic coordination becomes necessary,

309
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,720
so maybe he would have left first.   Apart from

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,920
this there is a symbolic message here that the

311
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,640
US is committed to Israeli defense and

312
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,240
apart from this there could also be a move to avoid the G7 consensus

313
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,839
because they do

314
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
not want a joint communication to

315
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
emerge.  Apart from this, there is also a domestic angle

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,640
here.  Trump's action

317
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
may be an attempt to woo his support base domestically in

318
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
a way.

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
Well, whatever it is,

320
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,959
if you look at the posture of the US military in the region at this time, it is

321
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,600
on high alert.  You can see that the

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,519
USS Gerald R. Ford Strike Group,

323
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
which is basically an aircraft carrier, has

324
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,560
arrived in the Persian Gulf.  has entered.

325
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,320
Apart from this, B52 bombers have been deployed in Qatar.

326
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,720
Patriot

327
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
missile defense systems have been reinforced here in Iraq and the UAE.

328
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,880
And at the same

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,040
time, intelligence sharing has been

330
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,600
intensified with Israel.

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,600
Meaning the military posture is on high alert.

332
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Any type of situation can arise at any time.

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Now let's see how things go from here.

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,680
But I hope that you have understood the current situation

335
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,519
in the midst of the Israel-Iran war

336
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
and

337
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,360
before leaving, I have an interesting question, can you
