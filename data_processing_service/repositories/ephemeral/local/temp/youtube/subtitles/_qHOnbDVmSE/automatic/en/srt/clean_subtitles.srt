Things got to the point that US President Donald Trump, who had gone to the G7 Summit, had to leave it midway.  You all know that recently PM Modi has also reached Canada for the G7 Summit.  So here Donald Trump gave such a warning and said such a thing which caused a stir in Iran's capital Tehran. He said everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.  You can see this news Trump cut shot G7 visit with a warning.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening right now. Why did Donald Trump give this warning?  What is its impact and what might happen next?  I will tell you all that in detail.  First of all, here you can see what Donald Trump said.  Donald Trump has given a statement here on Truth Social Media and you can see what he has to say.  Iran should have signed the deal.  I told them to sign. Basically, they are repeatedly redefining this thing that I have been trying to do for the last several days, to deal with Iran. Basically they should talk about the nuclear deal. You will remember that Barack Obama had struck a deal through JCPOA called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and later when Donald Trump became President in his first term, he withdrew from that deal. After which Iran keeps enriching uranium here continuously and it is very close to making an atomic bomb and this is the thing that Israel and America do not like at all. So now, since Donald Trump became President, he has also written a letter to Iran and asked them to sign the deal as soon as possible. Otherwise it is a waste of human life.  And he said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.  He is repeatedly saying that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons.  I said it over and over again.  And after that his last sentence was, everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran.  And these were the words that caused a stir in entire Tehran and people started leaving the place. And because of this, you can see here that he had to leave the G7 summit going on in Canada midway.   In fact, it is also being said that Donald Trump does not want to participate in the joint communication of G7.  Well here you can see the impact that has happened, basically why did he say this?  First of all this needs to be understood.  If you notice, air strikes have been going on continuously for the last few days.  It's not just Israel that's doing this against Iran. Iran has also carried out a massive air strike on Israel and Israel has also suffered a lot of damage.  But especially the way Israel is attacking Iran. Its main objective is to destroy the nuclear facilities. Apart from this, military command centres were established in Tehran.  In fact, a big news came yesterday.  The critical infrastructure here, radar bases, oil depots were being attacked, but yesterday during the live broadcast, the TV station, that is, Iran's public TV station, was attacked. Here you can see Israel bombs Iran state TV during live broadcast.  You can see this, the lady here was delivering the news, she was saying something and what happens in the meantime? Here, the bomb falls on the building, and you can see here she leaves it and starts running away.  And let me show you the view outside. What a sight this State TV building is after the strike.  So you are understanding that the critical infrastructure in Tehran, Iran is now being continuously attacked.  And you will see all this under Operation Rising Line by Israel. Basically what Israel wants is to completely [ __ ] Iran's nuclear weapons capabilities.  Secondly, what is here is that there is a direct threat of regional war.  Meaning, the statement given by Trump was not to leave Tehran immediately and evacuate.  So this shows that it is possible that very soon the US may jump into this war even more and support Israel more rapidly, due to which there may be more bombing inside Iran.  And especially inside Tehran.  So Tehran is most likely in immediate danger.  And probably this is why Donald Trump has given this statement.  And the US may be preparing for military intervention and escalation if diplomacy fails here. Diplomacy means what America is saying, Trump is saying that you cannot have an atom bomb. So you can simply deal with us here. So if that diplomacy fails then the situation can become very serious. Well, after this statement by Donald Trump, do you see what happened in Tehran?  Panic and evacuations began inside Tehran.  Here massive panic gripped Tehran and the citizens started going to the fuel stations. Long queues started forming at ATMs.  People started withdrawing cash.  Highways going north.  Wazandaran and Gilan.  Let me show you.  Here is your map of Iran and here is Tehran.  So the provinces above Tehran, Mazdaaran, apart from this, Gilan also became a part of it.  So here people started going through highways to save themselves.  Apart from this, Iranian emergency services were also reported.   It is being told that 60 thousand people have been displaced within 48 hours. Apart from this, you will see [ __ ] in many places like mobile, internet and network.  On the other hand, the Iranian Government said that there is no need for such a true evacuation right now. But yes, curfews have been imposed at many places at localized level, air rate drills are being conducted continuously in many districts, I mean if you see in Tehran itself, there are many districts here and you will be continuously seeing many air rate sirens and many other things there.  Well now what is the global response here? Because what is special is that the G7 summit is going on at this time.  What have the G7 and NATO said ?  Basically the G7 countries want to issue a joint statement to stop whatever is happening at the moment.  Meaning, he wants to request that Israel should also restrain and on the other hand Iran should also restrain.  But the US President has already left it midway and somewhere he has made it clear that I do not want to be a part of this.  On the other hand, NATO has also given a warning that if any kind of war between Iran and US is triggered, then this entire region could collapse. You will see things collapse in a very terrible way in the Middle East.  On the other hand, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman are all working as back channel mediators here.   We are trying to stop things here. And ultimately, whenever anything happens anywhere in the Middle East, two countries are often affected, that is Iraq and the other is Syria because the reason for this is that every country, be it the UK, America, Iran or Israel, you will find some interest or the other of each of them in both these countries, meaning in a way the land is divided that this area is ours, that is yours.  So here in both these countries there is a big danger of spillover.  Hezbollah and the Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Iraq have started mobilization here. Meaning wider regional conflict can trigger from here. Well why did Donald Trump do this here ?  Basically a warning was given to Tehran , the people of Tehran were warned to immediately evacuate their city.  There could be two or three reasons behind it.  The first thing is that an attempt is being made to adopt pressure tactics. Meaning that the Iranian regime is being isolated in a way that now your regime cannot protect you. You will have to leave your city. Or they are also signaling military readiness.  This means that America is trying to dominate Middle East diplomacy. Then in addition here Premly is justifying if any type of joint operation takes place.  Meaning, suppose tomorrow Israel and US attack together, then in that case they will be able to justify that look, we had already given you a warning for evacuation. And see what happens as soon as Donald Trump gives this warning to the people of Tehran.  After that many explosions were seen inside Tehran. If you look at many videos etc., it was continuously coming out that smoke started coming out from there, from the building. And the question here is, is it possible?  Because let me tell you what happened first, the spokesperson of the Israeli Defense Forces gave a warning to the people of Tehran.   The third district in Tehran is divided into many one-two-three districts.  So the third districts were in a way told to evacuate.  Due to which, you see, more than 3 lakh people were affected in that particular area.  But now if Donald Trump says the entire Tehran, I mean the population of Tehran, you can understand that it is around 10 million.  10 million means around 1 crore.  So it is possible that people will be evacuated from there immediately.  It is not possibile.  So somewhere the question is being raised as to why such warnings are being given.  Well whatever it is, if you see it from India's perspective, you will find many of our people there too.  In fact, it is said that around 10,000 Indians are currently inside Iran.  So here the Indian Government has also started efforts. What happened is that the air route is totally closed and Iran has also said here that you cannot take that air route. So the land borders here are open at this time.  And efforts are being made to take it to the nearby countries. And it is obvious if you look at the neighboring country of Iran.  In fact, if you go to the North Western side from here, then on the top you will see Azar Bhaijaan here and here is Armenia.  Now you know that relations between India and Armenia are good.  They are better.  Defence deals etc. have also been done. So here now we are being taken to the border of Armenia. Around 100 Indians have already reached the Armenia border so that they can be brought back to India from there.  So you will see this situation of evacuation. Well in the middle of all this, just before I was recording the video, another important news came from G7.  In Canada, French President Macron has revealed this for the first time that he said that he had a conversation with the US President Donald Trump and somewhere he has placed the Cspire deal proposal here and said that Israel is halting its strike if Iran freezes further retaliation.  If Iran does not retaliate from here then Israel can stop the strike here.  If Iran does not carry out uranium enrichment beyond 60% purity, then things will stop here and at the same time we can do European mediation, perhaps together with France and Switzerland.  So, this was an attempt to make some kind of deal by Don Trump.  But on the other hand, what has been the response from Iran?  Iran says that look, we are open to a deal here somewhere.  Now see, if you observe, Iran is also becoming a little soft. The kind of situation that is developing.   In a way, Iran also wants a ceasefire to happen somehow.  So here he is saying, look, Israel has to stop first.  If Israel attacks our critical infrastructure, it means we need an international guarantee that Israel will not attack us again.  That's why we are going to stay here.  So, in a way, if you look at both the sides, here an attempt is being made to show oneself as greater than before. Well Donald Trump has already been here. What could be the reason for that from G7?  In a way, crisis management is obvious; a big situation exists in the Middle East.  So military and diplomatic coordination becomes necessary, so maybe he would have left first.   Apart from this there is a symbolic message here that the US is committed to Israeli defense and apart from this there could also be a move to avoid the G7 consensus because they do not want a joint communication to emerge.  Apart from this, there is also a domestic angle here.  Trump's action may be an attempt to woo his support base domestically in a way. Well, whatever it is, if you look at the posture of the US military in the region at this time, it is on high alert.  You can see that the USS Gerald R. Ford Strike Group, which is basically an aircraft carrier, has arrived in the Persian Gulf.  has entered. Apart from this, B52 bombers have been deployed in Qatar. Patriot missile defense systems have been reinforced here in Iraq and the UAE. And at the same time, intelligence sharing has been intensified with Israel. Meaning the military posture is on high alert. Any type of situation can arise at any time. Now let's see how things go from here. But I hope that you have understood the current situation in the midst of the Israel-Iran war and before leaving, I have an interesting question, can you arrange the names of the countries here from North to South.  These are the names of four countries and you all know the right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You can get its correct answer from Telegram.
