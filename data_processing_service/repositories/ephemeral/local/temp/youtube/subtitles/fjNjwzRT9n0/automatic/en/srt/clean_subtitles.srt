The conversation will continue there and the exchange of information will continue between you and us.  Let's start today's episode.  So, it starts from 1939.  It was the day of 19th April, 1939, when Mashhad, which is said to be the most religious city of Iran, was founded.  Syed Ali Khamenei was born there.  The atmosphere at home was very religious as his father was a Maulvi in ​​the nearby mosque.  Ali Khame was the second among his eight siblings.   He was the second one who was born.  The atmosphere at home had a great impact on Khamei. From his childhood, when he tells, he was just four years old.  From that time onwards, when he was sent to an Islamic school, it was there that he learnt the method of learning to read the Quran. He learnt Arabic language and also received Islamic education there.  This was the period when Iran was ruled by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  It was his rule.  That was his rule.  Shah was actually considered a secular king.  He also promoted western ideas. During his time, it was seen that the culture of modeling, films, night clubs, parties, western clothing was at its peak in Iran. Women were also given their rights. Women also had complete freedom to live their lives according to their own rights.  All these things were during the time of Riza Pahlavi of Shara Pahlavi when he ruled. Well now the era of 1950 has come.  In this period of 1950, Ali Kameni was admitted in a new Islamic school in Mashad. Once during a program in this school, he recited verses from the Quran.  The listeners praised him very much and this was the point when Khameei decided that he too would become a cleric like his father. His first decision to become a Maulvi was taken from here.  At this time, Ali Khamenei's age is said to be around 11 to 12 years. He has to go to Kom, another religious city of Iran.  The community is actually called by the name Om which is its pronunciation. He used to come here in Om and when he was around 11-12 years of age, he became a Maulvi for the first time in this city.  At a very young age.  But when he came back to Mashhad from Om City.  After coming to Mashad, he started playing with his old friends in his Maulvi attire.  So the nearby children who were his old friends as well as the elders present there, all made fun of him.  He was considered a laughing stock in a way as if he was a child and was playing with us here in the attire of a Maulvi.  Because at this time Western culture was at its peak in Iran.  It is said that because of Western culture the entire atmosphere of Iran was different.  But there was one thing which kept the religious atmosphere intact.  That was the month of Muharram. It was said during the month of Muharram that in the first 10 days, all western entertainment resources, especially films, would be closed down and banned. This used to happen in Iran that these things were closed down in the first 10 days of Muharram. But in 1955, some change took place, the city governor of Mashhad made a new announcement and gave a new decision. Under this decision, he said that the entertainment sources that were banned till now in the first 10 days of Muharram, will not be banned now and this ban will be removed. This decision made all the people with religious sentiments very angry.  Ali Khamenei, who was about 16-17 years old at that time, was now. He also stood against this decision along with others. Started protesting.  Well, these people had to go to jail many times. The matter was settled.  Well, now it was the 1960s.  Ali Khamenei now started actively participating in the protests.  He constantly provoked people to come forward. Stand up against the rule of Shah Pahlavi.  During this period, under the rule of Shah Pahlavi, he was arrested several times by Iran's secret police, Sawaak.  It is said that he had to go to jail six times. During this period of 1960, Ali Khamenei became deeply influenced by a great leader of Iran, religious leader Ayya Rohalla Khomeini.  At that time Khomeini was actually running his own movement from Iraq and later from France to strengthen Iran.  Ali Khamenei became his disciple.  Whenever he came to know about Khomeini, he would listen about him. His preachings were such that he used to teach and he used to give speeches to people.   He used to spread them among the people.  Actually what was this overall scene?  Let me explain this to you. Ayatollah Khomeini was against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his White Revolution from the very beginning.  The White Revolution was actually a program that wanted to develop Iran like Western countries. Shah Bahlvi also wanted the same.  But Rahlat Khomeini considered it against Islam and Iranian culture.  He said that Islam and politics cannot be separated.  Basically, for this reason, he also introduced the concept of Wilayat Faqi.  This concept meant that Iran would be ruled by religious leaders.  It means that whichever religious leaders are there, they will come into the government, they will be in power and they will become the Prime Minister and President or the Supreme Leader of Iran and this was the ideology due to which Ali Khamenei, who was around 22 years old at that time, got influenced by him and started considering him as his guru, between the years 1962 and 63, when Rullah Khamenei openly started raising his voice against the Shah, started raising voice against the rule of Shah Pahlavi, at that time Ali Khamenei started spreading his messages to Mashad and other cities, as many as the other religious cities like Om. In 1963, Ali Khamenei called a meeting in a mosque in Mashhad. He himself gave a speech in a meeting.  It was said in the speech that Shah's rule is against Islam and the people. We have to save our religion and our country. And because of this speech Ali Khamenei got the appreciation of the people but he was also arrested. Well then comes the 1970s. By 1970, Ali Khamenei had become an accomplished young leader.  Had become young.  He was active in protest politics for a long time and also in religious politics in Iran. So now he had become a youth leader.  But this was the same time when during this period Rullah Khomeini was expelled from Iran by Shah Pahlavi.  At this time, Ali Khamenei once again worked to convey his messages to the people in different cities.  It is said that once upon a time Ali Khamenei had a secret tape of Rullah Khamenei in a gathering in which his voice was there and many things said by him were played. This secret tape was played in the gathering in which it was said by Khomeini that the rule of Shah is an un- Islamic dictatorship and it is the duty of every Muslim to overthrow it. After listening to this tape, people's anger increased even more and finally the same year happened again in 1979.  In 1979, Islamic revolution took place in Iran and the rule of Shah Pahlavi was completely abolished.  The entire Western culture that was coming to Iran was coming for the development of Iran. Women were coming for freedom. All these were abolished and Shah's rule ended completely.  This was a new beginning for Ali Khamenei and a new era of Iran was about to start from here.  So after the end of Shah's rule, it was around February 1979 when Ahmadullah Khomeini returned to Iran from Paris and he established his new government here. After forming the new government, he started appointing all his close people to high positions. He knew about Ali Khamini that he was also continuously supporting us. So he also included Ali Khame in the Revolutionary Council. Made him a member.  This council was actually the foundation of the new government of Rolla Coney.  The changes that are going to come in governance in Iran.  Now, this council used to work on what changes are needed to be made in the religious government that will come to power.  At that time, Khameei was also made the imam of Friday prayers in Tehran by Khamenei.  So all these things were going on.  At that time another big change came in Khamenei's life.  At that time, Hassan Rouhani, who later became the President of Iran.  He made a recommendation in front of Rullah Khamenei in the Parliament and after the recommendation, Ali Khamenei's life started changing.  He had said that we need a person who will take the Islamic revolution forward.  Rullah should carry forward the vision of Khamenei. Implement that vision in the Iranian military and Sayyed Ali Khamenei is the best person for this position. After this recommendation, Khamenei is made the Deputy Defense Minister of Iran.  After this, Ali Khamenei said that you all must be hearing about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC continuously in the news these days.  Iran basically started strengthening its army. Started working on strengthening it. But during this time, a big turning point was about to come once again in the life of Ali Khamenei. Actually, in 1980, a war broke out between Iran and Iraq.  Ali Khame had gone to inspect the battle. Came back from there.  After coming back, it was the day of 27th June 1981. As per his scheduled time, Ali Khamenei reaches Abujar Mosque in Tehran throughout the day. After going there, he used to answer people's questions all the time, which he used to do every other day, the way he used to answer people's questions.  He started giving these answers.  All the written questions were piled up on a table. But meanwhile a man arrives there and places a tape recorder on the table.  This tape recorder was suddenly placed in front of Khamini. After this, when he started answering these questions.  1 minute must have passed.  After this, suddenly a whistling sound came from the tape recorder and suddenly there was an explosion.  There was a loud explosion and the body was soaked in blood. Written inside the tape recorder was: Furqan Group's gift to the Islamic Republic.   The Furqan Group was an Iranian militant anti-establishment organization that followed Shia Islamic ideology and supported Saddam Hussein. Why is Saddam Hussein mentioned here?  Understand this. Saddam actually wanted to end the regime of Rullah Khomeini and in this motive of Saddam, the then chief of IRGC, Ali Khamenei, stood in the way. Khamenei's right hand was severely injured in this attack.  His voice was severely damaged.  He was admitted to Bahrel Hospital in Tehran for treatment.  But even after several months of treatment, he could not recover completely.  It is said that from then on, this was the point when his right hand became numb forever and the hearing power of one ear was lost.  Regarding this attack, Khame also once said that if my brain and tongue work then I do not need hands and my brain and tongue are enough for me for my work. So this was a whole sequence when an attack took place on him.  But the attacks were not stopped yet.  Just 2 months later, August 30, 1981 comes.  On August 30, 1981, a meeting of the National Security Council was going on in the Prime Minister's Office in Tehran. President of Iran Mohammad Ali Rajai and Prime Minister of that time Mohammad Javed Bunar were also present in this meeting.  Both the President and the Prime Minister were present in the meeting and suddenly, Masood Kashmiri, a secret agent of the ME organization, brought a suitcase and placed it in the Parliament House during the National Security Council meeting. Actually there was a bomb in this suitcase. After a while, suddenly a huge explosion takes place and all the people present in the National Security Council meeting, including the President and the Prime Minister, are killed.  This was an event that shook the Iranian regime.   The demand for a new President started rising across the country after this incident. By this time Naeem had become a big leader of the Islamic Republican Party (IRP). Rullah Khamenei was already heading the IRGC and along with him many big leaders of the IRP put forward the name of Ali Khamenei for the post of President. They said that there would be presidential elections on 2 October 1981. Presidential elections were held in Iran and finally when the results came, Ali Khamenei was made the candidate on 13 October 1981, when the results came, it was seen that not only were Rullah Khamenei praising Ali Khamenei, but he was also giving him further support. In fact, 95% of the voting was for Ali Khamenei.  With this voting he is made the third President of Iran. While taking the oath, he had said that I will give my life but will never step back from serving the people to save the Islamic Revolution.

Now let's move ahead with our episode.  So now Ali Khamenei had become the President of Iran.  It takes approximately 4 years.  After 4 years comes 1985.  85 This was the time when Ayatollah Khomeini had to announce his successor, and he did so. He declared Husain Ali Muntaziri as his successor.  But suddenly after a few days this decision is withdrawn.  This is changed. This decision was actually put on hold for quite some time.  But after this the next successor was not declared.  Nearly 4 years passed from here and it was the day of 3 June 1989 when Rohalla Khomeini passed away.  He passes away.  Now it was Iran's turn to choose the next supreme leader. Who would be the next supreme leader?  This suddenness also became a difficulty in the political issues of Iran.  The next morning a meeting of the Assembly of Experts is called to select the next India.  Khomeini's will was a 25-35 page long, sorry, sealed will, it is brought from the treasury and read.   The will was also read by the then President Ali Khamenei.  I read this will in about 2 hours.  After this, discussion started regarding the election to choose the next supreme leader. Some people also said that a proposal was put forward that a leadership council should be formed. She will lead Iran and a leadership council will be formed in future.  There will be many people in it or else it should be done that there will be one person who will have complete command and he will run the entire Iran. He will have a supreme leader.  So first there was to be voting on this thing.  Voting was done. Around 45 votes were received in the voting. A person must have command over this proposal.  So it was proved that there were 23 votes on the other side.  There were 45 on this side. So it is proved that brother a person will be selected who will have the command in his hands.  Now it was the turn to select the candidates.  So there were two people standing in front for the candidates.  The first was Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Riza Golpaygani and the second was Ali Khamei.  Both of them filed by putting their names forward.  Voting took place and Khamei got 60 votes. Whereas Golpegni got only 14 votes. Thus it was finally decided that Khame would become the next supreme leader.  The supreme leader will be elected. But there was another condition here, which we told you about at the beginning of the episode, how to choose based on the Constitution of Iran. What was clear was that he would become the supreme leader.  A condition was put forward that the person should be Ayatullah. Meaning he should be the religious leader of the Shia Muslims of Iran.  Those who were Khamini were not fulfilling this condition.  So due to this condition, amendment was made in the Constitution of Iran, revisions were made and finally once again this Assembly of Experts met on 6 August 1989 and after this Khamei was made the Supreme Leader of Iran by amending the Constitution.  When Khameh was elected Supreme Leader in 1989, Imam Kashani, who took part in the voting at that time, later gave an interview. In that interview he said that we had no other option.  It was necessary to take a quick decision because Saddam Hussein's army was on the borders of Iran and a supreme leader of Iran had to be elected soon. So Khamenei was elected this way.  Well, different people have different opinions about it. Now let us talk about how this entire role was after he became the supreme leader of Nahi. After becoming the supreme leader, his power and influence had doubled.  It had increased quite a lot.  But the media reports tell a different story.  She says that Khameh slowly started crushing the opposition in Iran, those who were against him.  Journalists were oppressed.  At that time whatever free speech there was in Iran was stopped. Extremism was encouraged.  The freedom that women had was taken away. Such a report came to light.  Despite this, he remained the most powerful leader of Iran. He built militant networks in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Which is called the Axis of Resistance.  About which you people read in the news these days, read in newspapers.  Let's talk about the conflict between Iran and Israel. Iran started denying the existence of Israel. This started during our tenure itself.  Ever since he became the Supreme Leader. Voyeurist support to the Palestine cause also happened during his tenure.  Khamei waged a proxy war against Israel through militant networks such as Hezbollah, Houthi and Hamas.  Along with this, Khameh continued Iran's nuclear program. You may have seen our episodes about how the nuclear program was not completely dismantled.  It was shown to the world that it had been destroyed but Iran was slowly operating it covertly underground. So this covertly operation also continued during Amin's tenure.  In order to maintain pressure on Western countries like America and Israel, it is constantly told that Iran continues to run its own nuclear program. So this was about the whole history of Iran, about Ali Khamenei and Rahullah Khomeini.  Now let's talk about the current situation regarding the Iran and Israel war.  Look, the war between Iran and Israel continues. Not just now, it has been going on for the past several decades.  Israel has two big motives.  Firstly, Iran's nuclear program, which poses the biggest threat to Israel, should be abolished. Second, IRGC, which is Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, should be abolished.  For this, Israel had raided Iran's nuclear plants, which are military bases, in 2018 and stole around 500 secret documents from there. Thereafter, going on the same basis, in the month of June 2025, an air strike was carried out on all the nuclear plants and military bases, especially the top commanders of IIGC were killed. Despite this, it was seen once again that Ali Khamini came forward and he appointed his new military officers. Israel basically believes at this time that if Khamini was killed, the nuclear program and IRDC could be stopped.  The situation in Iran will also improve because there will be a change in power. Here the power will go into someone else's hands. But electing a new leader after Khamenei is not going to be easy. Because many media reports claim that Khamenei has currently chosen his second son, whose name is Mustafa Khamenei, as his successor.   The assembly and the experts have also held a secret meeting and after that they have given their approval to it.  The agreement has been done. But if there is a change of power in Iran, then Reza Pahlavi, who was the son of the former Shah of Iran, started living in America after the Islamic Revolution because that was his father's throne, his old tradition which was going on, the purpose of westernizing Iran was that, it can be started again. So if he becomes the Supreme Leader of Iran here, after Trump wins the election in November 2024, Reza Pahlavi, who is his son, Shah, had also said in an interview that democracy should be brought back in Iran, there should be prosperity with western countries, proper contact with them, peaceful dialogue with Israel, when we keep relations with our neighbors, only then all this is possible, only then all this is possible, so what will happen next in Iran, it will be worth watching, you guys give your opinion on this, what can happen, in the coming few days, the comment section is yours and your comments are very important, tell us your comments on such videos, on Twitter, on Instagram, if you are there, come and connect, exchange them.
