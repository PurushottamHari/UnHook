00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,839
India.  Aiya Ali Khamei, the supreme

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,080
leader of Iran, calls America a great devil and

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,320
says about Israel that

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,119
it is a cancerous tumor which

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
needs to be cut out and thrown away.  The same bastards about whom

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,240
Israel believes that if they are killed

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,720

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,719
end.  But

one of the biggest religious leaders of Iran, Rullah Khomeini,

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,680
his guru and how a plan was hatched to

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,520
kill Ali Khamenei through a tape recorder blast.  Apart from this, we will

17

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
start today's

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,320
episode.  So, it starts from 1939.  It

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,119
was the day of 19th April, 1939, when

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,759
Mashhad, which is said to be the most religious city of Iran, was

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,080
founded.  Syed Ali Khamenei was

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
born there.  The atmosphere at home was very

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,360
religious as his father was a

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
Maulvi in ​​the nearby mosque.  Ali Khame was the

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
second among his eight siblings.   He was the

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,240
second one who was born.  The

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,640
atmosphere at home had a great impact on Khamei.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,799
From his childhood, when he tells, he was

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,640
just four years old.  From that time onwards,

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
when he was sent to an Islamic school, it was

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,479
there that he learnt the method of learning to read the Quran.

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,640

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,439
He learnt Arabic language and

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
also received Islamic education there.  This was the period when

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,479
Iran was ruled by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  It

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,799
was his rule.  That was his rule.  Shah was

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,799
actually considered a secular king.  He

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
also promoted western ideas.

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,239
During his time, it was seen that the culture of

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,200
modeling, films, night clubs, parties,

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,599
western clothing was at its peak in Iran.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,599
Women were also given their rights.

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,360
Women also had complete freedom to

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,560

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,200
live their lives according to their own rights.  All these things

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,400
were during the time of Riza Pahlavi of Shara Pahlavi when he ruled.

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Well now the era of 1950 has come.  In this period of 1950,

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Ali Kameni was

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
admitted in a new Islamic school in Mashad.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
Once during a program in this school,

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,599
he

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,599
recited verses from the Quran.  The listeners

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,080
praised him very much and

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,480
this was the point when Khameei decided

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
that he too would become a cleric like his father.

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
His first decision to become a Maulvi was

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,040
taken from here.  At this time, Ali Khamenei's

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,840
age is said to be around 11 to 12 years.

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,840
He has to go to Kom, another religious city of Iran.  The

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
community is actually called by the name Om

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
which is its pronunciation.

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
He used to come here in Om and when he was

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
around 11-12 years of age,

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,239
he became a Maulvi for the first time in this city.  At a very young

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,480
age.  But when he

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,879
came back to Mashhad from Om City.  After coming to Mashad,

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
he started playing with his old friends in his Maulvi

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
attire.  So the

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,800
nearby children who were his old

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
friends as well as the elders

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,000
present there, all made fun of him.  He was

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
considered a laughing stock in a way as if he was

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,159
a child and was

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
playing with us here in the attire of a Maulvi.  Because at this time

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,879
Western culture was

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,280
at its peak in Iran.  It is said that

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,840
because of Western culture the entire atmosphere of Iran was

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,640
different.  But there was one thing which

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,879

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,000
kept the religious atmosphere intact.  That was the month of Muharram.

92
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,080
It was said during the month of Muharram that in the

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,959
first 10 days, all

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
western entertainment resources,

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,840
especially films, would be

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760
closed down and banned.

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
This used to happen in Iran that

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,799
these things were closed down in the first 10 days of Muharram.

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,599
But in 1955, some change took place, the

100
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,400
city governor of Mashhad made a new announcement and

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,239
gave a new decision. Under this decision,

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
he said that the entertainment sources that were banned till now in the first

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920
10 days of Muharram, will

104
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,080

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
not be banned now

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,000
and this ban will be removed.

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
This decision made all the people with

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,199
religious sentiments

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
very angry.  Ali Khamenei, who was

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
about 16-17 years old at that time, was now.

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
He also

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
stood against this decision along with others.

114
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,560
Started protesting.  Well, these people had to go to jail many times.

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
The matter was settled.  Well, now

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
it was the 1960s.  Ali Khamenei

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
now started actively participating in the protests.  He

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
constantly

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
provoked people to come forward.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Stand up against the rule of Shah Pahlavi.  During this period, under the rule of Shah Pahlavi,

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
he was arrested several times by Iran's secret

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
police, Sawaak.  It is said that he had to

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,199
go to jail six times.

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,160
During this period of 1960, Ali Khamenei became deeply influenced by a great

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,880
leader of Iran, religious leader Ayya Rohalla Khomeini.  At

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
that time Khomeini was actually

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,120

129
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
running his own movement from Iraq and later from France to

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,919
strengthen Iran.  Ali Khamenei

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
became his disciple.  Whenever he came to

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,479
know about Khomeini, he would listen about him.

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,639
His preachings were such that he used to

134
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,759
teach and he used to give speeches to people.   He used to

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,360
spread them among the people.  Actually what was this overall

136
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
scene?  Let me explain this to you.

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,639
Ayatollah Khomeini was against

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his White

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,199
Revolution from the very beginning.  The White Revolution was

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
actually a program that

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,840
wanted to develop Iran like Western countries.

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Shah Bahlvi also wanted the same.  But

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,960
Rahlat Khomeini considered it against Islam and

144
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,080
Iranian culture.  He

145
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,199
said that Islam and politics

146
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,759
cannot be separated.  Basically, for this reason, he

147
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
also introduced the concept of Wilayat Faqi.  This

148
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,520
concept meant that Iran would be

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
ruled by religious leaders.  It means that whichever religious

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,639
leaders are there, they will come into the government, they will be

151
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,560
in power and they will become the Prime Minister and

152
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,039
President or the Supreme Leader of

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,440
Iran and this was the ideology due to which

154
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,720

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
Ali Khamenei, who was around 22 years old at that time, got influenced by him and

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,639
started considering him as his guru,

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,280
between the years 1962 and 63, when Rullah

158
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
Khamenei openly started raising his voice against the Shah,

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,000

160
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,160
started raising voice against the rule of Shah Pahlavi, at that time Ali Khamenei

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,479

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,880

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
started spreading his messages to Mashad and other cities, as many as the other religious cities like Om.

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,479
In 1963,

165
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,479
Ali Khamenei called a meeting in a mosque in Mashhad.

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,560
He himself gave a speech in a meeting.  It was said in the speech that

167
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,919
Shah's rule is against Islam and the people.

168
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,000
We have to save our religion and our country.

169
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,160
And because of this speech

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Ali Khamenei got the appreciation of the people

171
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
but he was also arrested.

172
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,440
Well then comes the 1970s.

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,560
By 1970, Ali Khamenei had become an accomplished young leader.  Had

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,639
become young.  He was active in protest politics for a long time and

175
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639

176
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
also in religious politics in Iran.

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
So now he had become a youth leader.  But

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,280
this was the same time when during this period Rullah

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
Khomeini was

180
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
expelled from Iran by Shah Pahlavi.  At this time,

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,199
Ali Khamenei once again

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,599
worked to convey his messages to the people in different cities.  It is

184
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,039
said that once upon a time Ali Khamenei had

185
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,440
a secret tape of Rullah Khamenei in a gathering

186
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,080
in which his voice was there and

187
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,319
many things said by him were played.

188
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
This secret tape was

189
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,599
played in the gathering in which it was said

190
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,080
by Khomeini that the rule of Shah is an un-

191
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,520
Islamic dictatorship and it is the duty of every Muslim to

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,199
overthrow it.

193
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,759
After listening to this tape, people's anger

194
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,599
increased even more and finally the same year happened again in

195
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,639
1979.  In 1979, Islamic revolution took place in Iran

196
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,639
and the rule of Shah Pahlavi was

197
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,960
completely abolished.  The

198
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
entire Western culture that was coming to Iran was

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,039
coming for the development of Iran.

200
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,160
Women were coming for freedom.

201
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,280
All these were abolished and Shah's

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,280
rule ended completely.  This was

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,039
a new beginning for Ali Khamenei and a new era of

204
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,199
Iran was about to start from here.  So

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,120
after the end of Shah's rule, it

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,120
was around February 1979 when Ahmadullah Khomeini

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,319
returned to Iran from Paris and he

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,080
established his new government here.

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,399
After forming the new government, he started appointing all his

210
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,479
close people to high positions.

211
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,880
He knew about Ali Khamini

212
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
that he was also continuously supporting us.

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,719
So he also included Ali Khame

214
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,440
in the Revolutionary Council.

215
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,760
Made him a member.  This council was actually the

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,320
foundation of the new government of Rolla Coney.  The

217
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080

218
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
changes that are going to come in governance in Iran.  Now, this council used to work on

219
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
what changes are needed to be made in the religious government that will come to power.  At

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,399

221
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,920
that time, Khameei was

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,160
also made the imam of Friday prayers in Tehran

223
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
by Khamenei.  So all these things were going on.  At that

224
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,120
time another big change came in Khamenei's life.  At

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,880
that time, Hassan Rouhani, who later

226
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
became the President of Iran.  He made

227
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,000

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,959
a recommendation in front of Rullah Khamenei in the Parliament and after the recommendation,

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,279
Ali Khamenei's life started changing.  He had

230
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,000
said that we need a person who will take the

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,480
Islamic revolution forward.  Rullah should

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
carry forward the vision of Khamenei.

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,080
Implement that vision in the Iranian military and

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Sayyed Ali Khamenei is the best person for this position.

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
After this recommendation, Khamenei is made the Deputy Defense

237
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Minister of Iran.  After this, Ali

238
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
Khamenei said that

239
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
you all must be hearing about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC

240
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,560
continuously in the news these days.  Iran basically

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
started strengthening its army.

242
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,440
Started working on strengthening it.

243
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,080
But during this time, a big turning point was about to

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,600
come once again in the life of Ali Khamenei.

245
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,000
Actually, in 1980, a

246
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,720
war broke out between Iran and Iraq.  Ali Khame had

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,240
gone to inspect the battle.

248
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,079
Came back from there.  After coming back, it

249
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
was the day of 27th June 1981.

250
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,320
As per his scheduled time,

251
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,560
Ali Khamenei reaches Abujar Mosque in Tehran throughout the day.

252
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
After going there, he

253
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,640
used to answer people's questions all the time, which he used to do every

254
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
other day, the way he used to

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,959
answer people's questions.  He

256
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
started giving these answers.  All the written questions were piled up on a table.

257
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,519
But

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
meanwhile a man arrives there and

259
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,800
places a tape recorder on the table.  This

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,160
tape recorder was suddenly placed in front of Khamini.

261
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
After this, when he

262
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
started answering these questions.  1 minute must have

263
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,680
passed.  After this, suddenly

264
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,560
a whistling sound came from the tape recorder and

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
suddenly there was an explosion.  There was a loud explosion and the

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,640
body was soaked in blood.

267
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,680
Written inside the tape recorder was:

268
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,079
Furqan Group's gift to the Islamic Republic.   The

269
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Furqan Group was an Iranian militant

270
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,240
anti-establishment organization that followed Shia Islamic

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,959
ideology and supported Saddam Hussein.

272
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,800

273
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,760
Why is Saddam Hussein mentioned here?  Understand this.

274
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Saddam actually wanted to end the regime of Rullah Khomeini

275
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,320
and in this motive of Saddam, the

276
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,720
then chief of IRGC, Ali Khamenei,

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,680
stood in the way.

278
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Khamenei's right hand was

279
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
severely injured in this attack.  His voice was

280
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,440
severely damaged.  He was

281
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,519
admitted to Bahrel Hospital in Tehran

282
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
for treatment.  But

283
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,079
even after several months of treatment, he could not recover completely.  It is

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,839
said that from then on, this

285
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
was the point when his right hand became numb forever

286
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,720
and the hearing power of one ear was

287
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,800
lost.  Regarding this attack,

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Khame also once said that

289
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,200
if my brain and tongue work then

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
I do not need hands and my

291
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,800
brain and tongue are enough for me for my work.

292
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,360
So this was a whole sequence when

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,399
an attack took place on him.  But the attacks were

294
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,920
not stopped yet.  Just 2 months later,

295
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,320
August 30, 1981 comes.  On August 30, 1981,

296
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,000

297
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,279
a meeting of the National Security Council was going on in the Prime Minister's Office in Tehran.

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,360
President

299
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,560
of Iran Mohammad Ali Rajai and Prime

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,079
Minister of that time Mohammad Javed Bunar were

301
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
also present in this meeting.  Both the President and the Prime

302
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,480
Minister were present in the meeting and suddenly,

303
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,079

304
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,000
Masood Kashmiri, a secret agent of the ME organization,

305
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,639
brought a suitcase and placed it in the Parliament House

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,959
during the National Security Council meeting.

307
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,519

308
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,920
Actually there was a bomb in this suitcase.

309
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
After a while, suddenly a huge explosion takes place

310
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
and all the people present in the National Security Council

311
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
meeting, including the

312
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,320
President and the Prime Minister, are

313
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,040
killed.  This was an event

314
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,519
that shook the Iranian regime.   The

315
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,720
demand for a new President started rising across the country

316
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,920
after this incident. By this time

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Naeem had

318
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,920
become a big leader of the Islamic Republican Party (IRP).

319
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,720
Rullah Khamenei was already heading the IRGC

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,519
and along with him many big

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,079
leaders of the IRP put forward the name of Ali Khamenei for the post of President.

322
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,959
They said that there would be

323
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,040
presidential elections on 2 October 1981.

324
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,120
Presidential elections were held in Iran

325
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
and finally when the results came,

326
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
Ali Khamenei was made the candidate on

327
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200
13 October 1981, when the

328
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,560
results came, it was seen that

329
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,480
not only were Rullah Khamenei

330
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,839
praising Ali Khamenei, but he was also giving him further support.

331
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,399
In fact, 95% of the voting was

332
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,639
for Ali Khamenei.  With this voting

333
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
he is made the third President of Iran.

334
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
While taking the oath, he had said

335
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
that I will give my life but will

336
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,920

337
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,680

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,240
years.  After 4 years

358
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,279
comes 1985.  85 This was the time when Ayatollah

359
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,120
Khomeini had to announce his successor,

360
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,040
and he did so.

361
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,279
He declared Husain Ali Muntaziri as his

362
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,760
successor.  But suddenly after a few

363
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,440
days this decision is

364
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,519
withdrawn.  This is changed.

365
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
This decision was actually put on hold

366
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,639
for quite some time.  But after this the next

367
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,760
successor was not declared.  Nearly 4 years

368
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,959
passed from here and it was the day of 3 June 1989

369
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,160
when Rohalla Khomeini passed away.  He

370
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,480
passes away.  Now it

371
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
was Iran's turn to choose the next supreme leader.

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Who would be the next supreme leader?  This suddenness also

373
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,560
became a difficulty in the political issues of Iran.  The

374
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,639

375
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,399
next morning a meeting of the Assembly of Experts is

376
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,199
called to select the next India.  Khomeini's

377
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,920
will was a 25-35 page long, sorry, sealed

378
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,079
will, it is brought from the treasury and read.   The

379
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,399
will was also read by the then President

380
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,320
Ali Khamenei.  I

381
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,959
read this will in about 2 hours.  After this, discussion started regarding the

382
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,760
election to choose the next supreme leader.

383
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,320
Some people also

384
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,720
said that a proposal was put forward that

385
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,519
a leadership council should be formed.

386
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,440
She will lead Iran and

387
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
a leadership council will be formed in future.  There will be many

388
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
people in it or else it should be done that there will be one

389
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
person who will have complete command

390
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,160
and he will run the entire Iran.

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,160
He will have a supreme leader.  So first there was to be

392
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,040
voting on this thing.  Voting was done.

393
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,920
Around 45 votes were received in the voting.

394
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,000
A person must have command over this

395
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,720
proposal.  So it was proved that there were

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,480
23 votes on the other side.  There were 45 on this side.

397
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
So it is proved that brother a person will be

398
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,480
selected who will have the command in his hands.  Now it

399
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,040
was the turn to select the candidates.  So there were

400
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,639
two people standing in front for the candidates.  The first

401
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,240
was Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Riza

402
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,040
Golpaygani and the second was Ali Khamei.  Both of them

403
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,519
filed by putting their names forward.  Voting

404
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,320
took place and Khamei got 60 votes.

405
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,040
Whereas Golpegni got only 14 votes.

406
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
Thus it was finally decided that Khame would

407
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
become the next supreme leader.  The supreme leader will be elected.

408
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,040
But there was another condition here,

409
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
which we told you about

410
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,040
at the beginning of the episode, how to choose based on the Constitution of Iran.

411
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,600
What was clear was that he would

412
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,079
become the supreme leader.  A condition was

413
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,839
put forward that the person should be Ayatullah.

414
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:00,079
Meaning he

415
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,560
should be the religious leader of the Shia Muslims of Iran.  Those who

416
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,439

417
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,280
were Khamini were not fulfilling this condition.  So due to this condition,

418
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,600

419
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,919
amendment was made in the Constitution of Iran, revisions were made

420
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,959
and finally once again this Assembly of

421
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,360
Experts met on 6 August 1989 and

422
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,199
after this Khamei was made the Supreme Leader of Iran by

423
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,240

424
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,400
amending the Constitution.  When Khameh was

425
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
elected Supreme Leader in 1989,

426
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
Imam Kashani, who took part in the voting at that time,

427
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
later gave an interview.

428
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,480
In that interview he said that we had no

429
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,799
other option.  It was necessary to take a quick decision

430
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,039
because Saddam Hussein's army

431
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
was on the borders of Iran and

432
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,440
a supreme leader of Iran had to be elected soon.

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,120
So Khamenei was elected this way.  Well,

434
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
different people have different opinions about it.

435
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760

436
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,760
Now let us talk about how this entire role was after he became the supreme leader of Nahi.

437
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,640

438
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,960
After becoming the supreme leader, his power and

439
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,559
influence had doubled.  It had

440
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,280
increased quite a lot.  But the media

441
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,160
reports

442
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,320
tell a different story.  She says that Khameh

443
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160

444
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160

445
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
slowly started crushing the opposition in Iran, those who were against him.  Journalists were

446
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,919
oppressed.  At that time whatever

447
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,840
free speech there was in Iran was stopped.

448
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
Extremism was encouraged.  The

449
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,840
freedom that women had was taken away.

450
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,480
Such a report came to light.  Despite this, he

451
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,600
remained the most powerful leader of Iran.

452
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,160
He built militant networks in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.

453
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Which is

454
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
called the Axis of Resistance.  About which

455
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,559
you people read in the news these days,

456
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,640
read in newspapers.  Let's talk about the conflict between Iran and Israel.

457
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,360

458
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
Iran started denying the existence of Israel.

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,120

460
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,080
This started during our tenure itself.  Ever since he

461
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,799
became the Supreme Leader.

462
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,880
Voyeurist support to the Palestine cause also

463
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,360
happened during his tenure.  Khamei

464
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,360

465
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,840

466
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,640
waged a proxy war against Israel through militant networks such as Hezbollah, Houthi and Hamas.  Along with this, Khameh

467
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,120
continued Iran's nuclear program.

468
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,960
You may have seen our episodes about

469
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
how the nuclear program was

470
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
not completely dismantled.  It was

471
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,799
shown to the world that it had been destroyed

472
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
but Iran was slowly operating it covertly underground.

473
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,480
So this covertly

474
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,440
operation also continued during Amin's tenure.  In order to

475
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,679

476
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
maintain pressure on Western countries like America and Israel,

477
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
it is constantly told that

478
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,679
Iran continues to run its own nuclear program.

479
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,120
So this was about the whole history of

480
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,200
Iran, about Ali Khamenei and Rahullah

481
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,799
Khomeini.  Now let's talk about the current

482
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,960
situation regarding the Iran and

483
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,840
Israel war.  Look, the war between Iran and Israel

484
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,120
continues.

485
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,000
Not just now, it has been going on for the past several decades.  Israel has

486
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,760
two big motives.  Firstly, Iran's

487
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,919
nuclear program, which poses the

488
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,720
biggest threat to Israel, should be abolished.

489
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,360
Second, IRGC, which is

490
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,880
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, should be

491
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,960
abolished.  For this, Israel had raided Iran's

492
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,679
nuclear plants, which are military

493
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,919
bases, in 2018 and

494
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
stole around 500 secret documents from there.

495
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,400

496
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,640

497
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
Thereafter, going on the same basis, in the month of June 2025, an

498
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,039
air strike was carried out on all the nuclear plants and

499
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,840
military bases, especially the

500
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,799
top commanders of IIGC were killed.

501
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,039
Despite this, it was

502
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,880
seen once again that Ali

503
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,559
Khamini came forward and he appointed his new

504
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
military officers.

505
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,840
Israel basically believes at this time

506
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,520
that if Khamini was killed, the

507
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,159
nuclear program and IRDC

508
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,760
could be stopped.  The situation in Iran will

509
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
also improve because there will be a change in power.

510
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,039
Here the power will go into someone else's hands.

511
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,720
But electing a new leader after Khamenei is

512
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,320
not going to be easy.

513
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Because many media reports claim

514
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,159
that Khamenei has currently chosen his second

515
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,799
son, whose name is Mustafa Khamenei, as

516
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,640
his successor.   The

517
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
assembly and the experts have also held

518
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,720
a secret meeting and after that they have given

519
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,240
their approval to it.  The agreement has been done.

520
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,960
But if there is a change of power in Iran, then

521
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,200
Reza Pahlavi, who was the

522
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,919
son of the former Shah of Iran,

523
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,960

524
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,520
started living in America after the Islamic Revolution because that was his father's

525
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,600
throne, his old tradition which was going on, the

526
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,159

527
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,159
purpose of westernizing Iran was that, it can be

528
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,120
started again. So if he becomes the

529
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,760
Supreme Leader of Iran here,

530
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,559
after Trump wins the election in November 2024, Reza Pahlavi, who is

531
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
his son, Shah, had

532
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,039
also said in an interview that

533
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,919
democracy should be brought back in Iran, there should be

534
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,520
prosperity with western countries,

535
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,000
