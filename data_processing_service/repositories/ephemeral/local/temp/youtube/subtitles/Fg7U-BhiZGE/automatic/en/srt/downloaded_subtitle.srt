1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
the amount of alcohol it takes to begin

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,880
to cause health rellated problems is

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,279
much lower than you think. Okay. So, if

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,960
I have this glass of wine every day,

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
you'd be in what we call moderate risk,

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
which is associated with pretty much

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,360
every form of cancer. So, say that I'm

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
drinking If you're drinking two of those

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
glasses, we're talking like a 40%

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,240
increase. But even drinking that amount,

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
your risk of breast cancer would

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
increase by about 5%. This amount. Mhm.

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,400
Which for many people is very normal.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
So, there's a lot of misinformation out

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,279
there about how much should you drink,

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,599
which I think people don't know, but I

17
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,279
can take you through everything. So, Dr.

18
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
Sarah Wakeakeman is a Harvard professor

19
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
and addiction expert leading the charge

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
against one of the biggest public health

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,399
crises of our time, addiction. Bringing

22
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,079
facts, empathy, and hard-earned truth.

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
One in three people may have a problem

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
with alcohol at some point in their

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
lives. And globally, 2.6 million people

26
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,280
every year die from alcohol-related

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
causes because pretty much every organ

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
in the body is impacted by it. You can

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
see here, this is a 43year-old person

30
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
where their brain looks the way a

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
90-year-old with dementia would look

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
because of that brain damage over time

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,600
from alcohol use. But what drives people

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
to use substances? It's probably the

35
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
most important question and if we look

36
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,360
at studies, one is about 40 to 60%

37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
genetics. And the other half of the

38
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
equation is trauma. And so we hear

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
someone talk about alcohol gives them

40
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,240
pain relief, whether that's emotional or

41
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
physical. That's a very real thing.

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
That's because your sort of natural

43
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,280
painkiller system is activated by

44
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
drinking. It's an anti-anxiety and a

45
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,479
pain medication sort of allin-one. So

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
when you think about how we treat

47
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,159
addiction, where are we going wrong? The

48
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,840
biggest problem is that people haven't

49
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
been given the evidence and tools to

50
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
understand addiction. But also many

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
rehabs don't offer the things that we

52
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
know are actually effective. And what is

53
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
it that people need? Great question. One

54
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
of the most effective tools we teach

55
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
people is something called and they

56
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
found that people drink much less after

57
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,799
it. Yeah. Wow.

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
This has always blown my mind a little

59
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,600
bit. 53% of you that listen to this show

60
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

61
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

62
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
before we start? If you like the show

63
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
and you like what we do here and you

64
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
want to support us, the free simple way

65
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,960
that you can do just that is by hitting

66
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
the subscribe button. And my commitment

67
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

68
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
everything in my power, me and my team,

69
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,759

70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,600
for you every single week. We'll listen

71
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,360
to your feedback. We'll find the guests

72
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
that you want me to speak to, and we'll

73
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,959
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

74
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,200
[Music]

75
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,280
much, Dr. Sarah Wakeakeman. With all the

76
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,640
work that you

77
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,400
do, what is the mission that you are on?

78
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
My mission is really to change the way

79
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
people think about and understand

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
alcohol and drug problems and also to

81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200
give people the evidence and the facts

82
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
both to understand addiction, which are

83
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
sort of problems related to alcohol and

84
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
drug use, but also to just understand

85
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
the science around, for example, how

86
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,599
much should you drink? Is drinking

87
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,120
healthy? Is it not healthy? There's a

88
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,239
lot of misinformation out there, and I

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
want to give people the tools to make

90
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
the right decision for them in their

91
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,959
lives. And who who are you and what what

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
is your sort of body of

93
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,319
experience education? So I'm a medicine

94
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
doctor by training. So I still do some

95
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
general medicine like in the hospital

96
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
take care of pneumonia and heart failure

97
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,319
and in the outpatient setting take care

98
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,160
of people's diabetes and um depression

99
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,440
but I train especially in addiction

100
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,879
medicine. So I'm board certified in

101
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,519
addiction medicine and that's been kind

102
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,280
of my life's work. I work in a big

103
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
academic medical center in Boston,

104
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,200
Massachusetts, where I would say my kind

105
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
of focus professionally has been

106
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
thinking about how do we bring addiction

107
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
care back into the medical system so

108
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,319
that it's not this separate and unequal

109
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
and often very poorly done sort of

110
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
siloed system, but actually just a part

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
of the health care that people get. And

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
then I train people so I'm um program

113
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
director of our fellowship program. So I

114
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
train doctors who want to be specialists

115
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,159
in addiction medicine. When you think

116
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
about how we treat addiction in the

117
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,040
modern world, what are some of your

118
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,760
gripes? Where are we going wrong? Oh,

119
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,760
how much time do we have?

120
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
Where do we begin? I mean, I think at

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
its core, the biggest problem is that

122
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
we've all been taught and sort of

123
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,560
infused in this idea that addiction is

124
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
an issue of behaving badly, that it's an

125
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
issue of morality, that people really

126
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,920
need to kind of knock it off and pull

127
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
themselves up by their bootstraps, and

128
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
that this is like a criminal legal

129
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
issue, that um it's an issue of

130
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
willpower. And so, if you believe those

131
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
things, then why would you think that

132
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
someone should get medical care or why

133
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,599
would you treat them with compassion and

134
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
kindness if you think that they're doing

135
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,000
something wrong? And so really reframing

136
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,159
how we think about addiction based on

137
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,680
all of the science we have and what

138
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,359
effective treatment looks like, which

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
often is very different than what people

140
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,239
may have experienced if they were trying

141
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,919
to access care for themselves or a loved

142
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,080
one. And what is an addiction? What what

143
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,000
falls into the the bucket of addiction?

144
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,600
You know, because I'm I use my iPad a

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,280
lot. I use my phone a lot. Um is that is

146
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
that an addiction? Yeah, it's a great

147
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,320
question because we use that term

148
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
colloially a lot. You know, I'm addicted

149
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,880
to Netflix or whatever. Um, so addiction

150
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
is really defined by use despite

151
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
consequences. So continuing to do

152
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
something in your life despite bad

153
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,840
things happening to you because of it.

154
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
So we talk of addiction, we talk of the

155
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,240
four C's is a way to remember it. So one

156
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,520
C is loss of control, meaning like

157
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
you've tried to change and you haven't

158
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
been able to. So you've tried to cut

159
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,800
back or you've tried to stop and you

160
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,479
couldn't. The other is compulsive use.

161
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,080
So your use is like spiraling out of

162
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
control that you're kind of using in a

163
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,759
way that isn't really attached to your

164
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,759
rational thinking. The next is

165
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
consequence. So continued use despite

166
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
negative consequences either in your

167
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,160
life, your job, your relationships, your

168
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
health. And then the last C is craving,

169
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
which is this sort of strong

170
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,880
psychological urge to want to use. Like

171
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
you can't get the idea of having a drink

172
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
out of your mind. And so it's really

173
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,479
those four C's that we think about. And

174
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
then we make the definition based on how

175
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,479
many criteria people meet out of this 11

176
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
list of different criteria. And then

177
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,720
based on that, people can have a mild,

178
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
use disorder, moderate, or severe. And

179
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
so moderate, severe is really what we

180
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
think of as addiction. But it's that use

181
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
despite bad things happening to you. And

182
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,639
what things are capable of being

183
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,720
addictive? Yeah, lots of things. I mean,

184
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,520
um, I focus mostly on alcohol and drugs.

185
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,280
So, alcohol obviously probably most

186
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,800
common. I think we'll talk about that a

187
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,199
lot today, which I'm excited about. And

188
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
certainly when we look worldwide, 400

189
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,560
million people have an alcohol use

190
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
disorder, meaning addiction alcohol.

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,120
It's a lot of people. The other are

192
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
drugs. So, that can be, you know,

193
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,360
opioids like heroin or pain pills or

194
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
fentanyl. can be cocaine or stimulants

195
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
like methamphetamine or prescription

196
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,639
stimulants, sedatives that people may

197
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
take for anxiety like bzzoazipines,

198
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,600
cannabis. And so there's a whole sort of

199
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,759
range of substances that can be

200
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
addictive and how addictive a substance

201
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
is um is really related to sort of how

202
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,960
much dopamine is released in the brain.

203
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960
I know you've had a wonderful episode

204
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
with Dr. Lumpkkey about dopamine, so

205
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
you've talked about that a bit. Um and

206
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
there are different sort of addictive

207
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
indices of different substances. So

208
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,080
cannabis is less addictive than

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
methamphetamine for example, but all of

210
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919
those substances can cause addiction in

211
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
people. Even beyond that, I wonder

212
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
sometimes in my life if I'm addicted to

213
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
other things like I mean I drink coffee

214
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,280
every day. Certainly get a craving to

215
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,720
drink it now. Yeah. Well, there's, you

216
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
know, a couple important pieces there.

217
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,960
Is your coffee drinking causing harm in

218
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
your life in any way? No. I think it's I

219
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,600
think it helps. It may be helping you,

220
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,880
right? Okay. So, it's not Yeah. So, it's

221
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,960
not addiction. So, there's a difference

222
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,319
between physiologic dependence, meaning

223
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
like if you don't drink your cup of

224
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
coffee, you're going to get a headache,

225
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,039
and addiction, meaning that you're

226
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,880
spending all your day and all your money

227
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
buying more and more coffee. We don't

228
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
really see this, but um buying more and

229
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
more coffee despite, you know, your

230
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
girlfriend nagging you about it and you

231
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
you're late to work cuz you're

232
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
purchasing coffee. We don't really see

233
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,319
that so much with coffee, but that would

234
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
be sort of addiction. And how big is the

235
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
problem? So, if you were to frame like

236
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
why should we care? Why should the

237
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
person listening to this care? Because I

238
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,080
imagine it's the case that many people

239
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,599
here don't have an addiction that fits

240
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
into the category of having severe

241
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
consequence for their life. I also

242
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
imagine some people are under the

243
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
impression that addiction is something

244
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,120
that happens to other people. Yeah. So c

245
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
can you frame the situation for me and

246
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,039
explain to me why we should all care

247
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,360
about this and the I guess the scale of

248
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,800
the impact it's having? Well, I

249
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
guarantee that many people listening

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,319
have been touched by addiction either

251
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
personally or in their lives. Because of

252
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,199
stigma, we tend not to talk about that.

253
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,720
But the scale is huge. So globally 2.6

254
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
million people every year die from

255
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,960
alcohol-related causes. So that's 7,000

256
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
people today will die from an

257
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
alcohol-related death. Another 600,000

258
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,080
people die from drugrelated deaths

259
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,639
annually. So that's like 1,600 deaths

260
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,400
today from drugrelated causes. And then

261
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
when we look at the criteria of sort of

262
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,639
meeting criteria for a substance use

263
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,560
disorder or addiction, it's about 400

264
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
million people worldwide for alcohol and

265
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
80 million people for drug use. So it's

266
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
incredibly common. If you think about

267
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
alcohol, some studies estimate that the

268
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
lifetime prevalence, meaning in over the

269
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
course of your life, how likely are you

270
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
to at some point develop alcohol

271
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,279
addiction? Somewhere between 15 and 30%

272
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,640
in some studies. So one in three people

273
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
may have a problem with alcohol at some

274
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
point in their life. So this touches all

275
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
of us. We just don't talk about it

276
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,200
because of stigma and because of these

277
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,399
mental images of kind of othering that

278
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
you know it's only those people who are

279
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,000
injecting heroin who have addiction or

280
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,279
that person who you know has the shakes

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
every morning and is drinking as soon as

282
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,640
they wake up who has a problem with

283
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,519
alcohol. In which direction are we going

284
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,120
in as a society? Are we getting better

285
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,360
or are we getting more addicted? Yeah,

286
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,240
great question. Um the pandemic was not

287
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,880
kind to addiction. So we saw rates of

288
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,640
alcohol and drug use and deaths related

289
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,040
to those increase significantly after

290
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
the onset of the COVID pandemic. Um that

291
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
has started to level out. So for drug

292
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,000
use related deaths, we're now back at

293
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,600
the prepandemic levels. But there was a

294
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,959
very significant increase during the

295
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
time of the pandemic. And that's really

296
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,080
not surprising when we think about what

297
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
are the things that drive people to use

298
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,399
alcohol or drugs in a problematic way. I

299
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,640
was looking at some of the some of the

300
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,800
life expectancy graphs and um this one

301
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
in particular I found quite shocking.

302
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
I'll throw it up on the screen but it

303
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,200
shows that obviously you know we would

304
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,760
expect that there was a drop in life

305
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,040
expectancy during the pandemic but even

306
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
when you compare it to other countries

307
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
it's not as significant. So I'm

308
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
wondering why in your view there was

309
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,440
such a significant decline in life

310
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,760
expectancy during the pandemic. Yeah. So

311
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
um obviously COVID was one driver. One

312
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,959
of the main other drivers was substance

313
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
related deaths. So actually immediately

314
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,839
following the onset of the pandemic, so

315
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,760
beginning March, April of 2020, we saw a

316
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,760
23% increase in alcohol-related

317
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
mortality and we saw the highest rates

318
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,440
ever we've seen of drugrelated overdose

319
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
deaths. And that actually impacted US

320
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
life expectancy up until this year. This

321
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
is the first year that we've seen that

322
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,160
change. at the essence of what's

323
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,800
actually going on there because you know

324
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,519
addiction is downstream from something

325
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
else. Yeah. What is actually going on?

326
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,720
Yeah. So that's a really great question

327
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,640
like what drives people to use

328
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
substances. It's actually probably the

329
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,560
most important question even in my work.

330
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
You know if you don't understand what

331
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
someone's substance use is about or

332
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
related to how are you ever going to

333
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,000
address it or help them address it? Um

334
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
so trauma is probably the single biggest

335
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
driver. So, you know, you often hear

336
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
things like cannabis is a gateway drug.

337
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
I would say trauma is the gateway drug.

338
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
If we look at many, many studies,

339
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,440
they're kind of two different things

340
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,839
that drive someone's risk of addiction.

341
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,000
One is genetics. It's about 40 to 60%

342
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
genetics, similar to diabetes in terms

343
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
of someone's risk. That's not a done

344
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,040
deal. Obviously, there are people with

345
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,560
strong genetic risks who never develop

346
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
addiction and people without that who

347
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,360
do. The other half of the equation is

348
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
based on kind of your exposures and your

349
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,160
experiences. And one of the number one

350
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
drivers is what we call adverse

351
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,640
childhood experiences. So there are this

352
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,920
famous study called the ACES study which

353
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
is stands for adverse childhood

354
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,440
experience and it's been replicated.

355
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,279
There's a recent one done actually in

356
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Europe as well that looks at the number

357
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,279
of adverse childhood experiences you

358
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,839
have and it's a linear track increase in

359
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
terms of your risk of substance use

360
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,880
disorder. So if you think about what's

361
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
happening in the brain with substances,

362
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,200
you know, when we use alcohol or drugs,

363
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
all sorts of feel-good hormones are

364
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
released, right? dopamine, your

365
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
indogenous opioid system, which is

366
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
literally your natural pain reliever.

367
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
And if you take someone who's

368
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
experienced trauma, there's great relief

369
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
that people can find in substance use.

370
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
And so we saw that in the pandemic, like

371
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
what was going on in the pandemic,

372
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
people were scared, they were bored,

373
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
they were lonely, they were stuck at

374
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
home, they didn't have their usual

375
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,000
routine, some people were losing people

376
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
that they loved. And so we saw all of

377
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,279
this escalating substance use. And it

378
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,959
was actually most pronounced in people

379
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
who are frontline workers. So that could

380
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000
be a healthcare provider. It could also

381
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
be someone working in a grocery store or

382
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
a convenience store who had to work

383
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
through the scariest times of the

384
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
pandemic. And also people who are

385
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,360
caregivers. So those are kind of the two

386
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,920
groups that had the biggest increase in

387
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,079
their substance use during the pandemic.

388
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
What is going on in the brain? You

389
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,360
referenced it a little bit there. You

390
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,240
referenced that dopamine makes you feel

391
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,519
good. Um so you know very naively I

392
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
would assume a case if you feel bad

393
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,800
dopamine makes you feel good. You want

394
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,320
more dopamine. But is it is it more

395
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
complic complicated and nuanced than

396
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
that? Yeah. Yeah. Well, alcohol is a

397
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,959
really complicated one because alcohol

398
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,200
has lots of different effects on the

399
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,480
brain. Um, so any drug that can or

400
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,760
substance that can cause addiction is

401
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
going to release dopamine. That's sort

402
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,600
of a primary driver of many things that

403
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,079
we find rewarding whether it's sex or

404
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
food or alcohol or drugs. But alcohol

405
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
also so it binds to the part of our

406
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,160
brain um a system called GABA which is

407
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,079
sort of our anti-anxiety system. So it's

408
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,000
the same system that anxiety medications

409
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,320
like people may have heard of Adavan or

410
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,079
larazzipam or Xanax. These medications

411
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
that are kind of sedatives and anxiety

412
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,240
meds, alcohol acts on that part of the

413
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
brain and it actually then causes a

414
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
release of your indogenous opioids in

415
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
your brain. So like your brain's natural

416
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,920
painkillers. So that's actually why one

417
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
of the medications that's effective in

418
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,600
helping people stop drink actually just

419
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
blocks the opioid response in the brain,

420
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,399
which doesn't make sense when you first

421
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
hear about it until you understand these

422
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,959
neural mechanisms that actually your

423
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
sort of natural painkiller system is

424
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
activated by drinking. So when you hear

425
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
someone talk about alcohol gives them

426
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
pain relief, whether that's emotional or

427
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
physical, that's a very real thing.

428
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,519
That's a powerful system in our brain um

429
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
that gets activated when you're

430
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
drinking. Ah okay. So, if I'm having a

431
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,360
stressful time at work and work is

432
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,600
making me anxious and um is crippling

433
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
me, then I'm more likely to want to have

434
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,519
a big blowout on the weekend because

435
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,720
that's

436
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,560
effectively a a pain medication.

437
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
Totally. It's an anti-anxiety and a pain

438
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,240
medication sort of allin-one, you know,

439
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,600
and I think often this is part of the

440
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
area where I think just getting more

441
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
awareness and and education about

442
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,800
alcohol is so important because we see

443
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,880
that as a way of like treating

444
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,120
ourselves, right? And and it's very easy

445
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,320
to have that get out of control. And I

446
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,160
think especially if in your head you

447
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
think as long as I'm not like drinking

448
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,079
in the morning or missing work because

449
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
of drinking or you know having problems

450
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,360
in my relationships I'm fine. But

451
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,800
actually there's so many health problems

452
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,320
and even life problems related to

453
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,760
alcohol that people may make different

454
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,959
decisions for themselves if they had

455
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,959
that awareness earlier on. You know I

456
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:30,560
was thinking about a friend of mine who

457
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:33,199
is fairly well known um passed away from

458
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,120
issues related to his addiction. Yeah.

459
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,040
He had a lot of pressure on him when he

460
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,600
was fairly young. He wasn't

461
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,199
necessarily a a young child when he had

462
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,560
a lot of pressure put on him, but he was

463
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,279
young. And I was wondering as you

464
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,279
said childhood

465
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,720
experiences, what age that is? Yeah. Is

466
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
there like a certain age where those

467
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,839
experiences become, you know, if you

468
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,199
experience a certain level of trauma at

469
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,639
a certain age, it's harder um to recover

470
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,639
from that and you're more likely to be

471
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,399
addicted. Yeah. So, it's a great

472
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
question. Trauma at any time can put you

473
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,639
at risk for addiction. The earlier that

474
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,839
happens, the more sort of long-lasting

475
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,199
the impact can be. Um, so when we think

476
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
about the brain, you know, your brain

477
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,000
doesn't really fully form until early to

478
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
mid20s. And so both in terms of trauma,

479
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,680
but also in terms of early substance

480
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,199
exposure, you're at much greater risk

481
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,040
when you're younger, but that doesn't

482
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
mean that trauma in later life doesn't

483
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
um put you at risk for developing

484
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
substance use as well. So I've seen

485
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
people who, you know, their first trauma

486
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,760
was in their 20s or 30s or 40s and they

487
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,760
can still develop a substance use

488
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,040
disorder. It's just the risk is even

489
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,040
greater when you experience those

490
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
adversities as a child. And the

491
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
interesting thing is, you know, trauma

492
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,199
is not so much about the experience.

493
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,800
It's about often being left alone to

494
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
grapple with that experience by

495
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,480
yourself. And so what's traumatizing to

496
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
one person may not be traumatizing to

497
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,240
someone else. And you know, take the

498
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
pandemic for example. I've talked to

499
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,800
people who like being stuck at home and

500
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
alone and bored was deeply traumatic.

501
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
Other people were fine. They like were

502
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
in their living room, you know, doing

503
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
whatever and found ways to connect and

504
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,880
to live their lives and did okay. It was

505
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,079
the same experience, but it was

506
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
experienced very differently by

507
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,079
different people. So, it's less about

508
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
the actual experience and more about the

509
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,199
impact on that human, how they're left

510
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,160
feeling. And often it's about feeling

511
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,839
disconnected. Um, we often talk about

512
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
the opposite of addiction is not

513
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,040
sobriety, it's actually connection. It's

514
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,279
how do you build that connection with

515
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,959
other people again? My friend um that I

516
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,959
was referencing is is Liam Payne who's

517
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,720
from One Direction, the the boy band who

518
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,560
passed away. and he was on my podcast

519
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,600
and uh a few years before he passed away

520
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,800
and on the show he said

521
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,160
that much of what made his early life so

522
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
difficult as a teenager was he was

523
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
obviously thrust onto this big show and

524
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,680
then the way it worked was you know got

525
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,839
all this public spotlight and then

526
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,920
they'd like put him up on a stage and

527
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,240
he'd be in front of 100,000 people in

528
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Dubai and then they after that

529
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,279
experience he was then like driven back

530
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,240
to a hotel room and like locked in the

531
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,440
hotel room because obviously you can't

532
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,720
go out because you're you're that famous

533
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
that if you walk out on the street the

534
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
crowds are going emerge. So he was then

535
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
locked in that hotel room and on the

536
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,160
show he said I was locked in there with

537
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,240
the mini bar which is full of alcohol.

538
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
Yeah. So I would drink and that cycle

539
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,799
would repeat itself and he'd be like

540
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,319
stage you know car hotel locked drink

541
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,520
stage car and that cycle repeat itself.

542
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,000
So when you were talking about isolation

543
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
and loneliness as well I never really

544
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
considered the fact that connection and

545
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,199
social

546
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,439
um relationships could play a role in

547
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,160
help in creating an addiction in someone

548
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,360
but it it tracks totally. I mean, it

549
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
makes me think of a patient I saw this

550
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
week who really wants to stop drinking

551
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
and is able to go for a few weeks, but

552
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
his life is pretty empty. Like, he's not

553
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,080
working right now. He doesn't have a lot

554
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
of relationships. So, when he's not

555
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
drinking, he's sitting at home like

556
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,440
watching TV by himself. And it doesn't

557
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,400
take very long for him to think that

558
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,080
like, you know, the thing that's going

559
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,919
to give me relief is having a drink. And

560
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,520
so, then the question becomes less about

561
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,200
the molecule of alcohol and more about

562
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
like how do we fill up people's lives?

563
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,039
How do we form connection and build

564
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
community and build a sense of identity

565
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,679
and purpose and engagement outside of

566
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,520
the relief of substance use? You're

567
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,799
you're clearly extremely smart and when

568
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
I meet people like you, I always think

569
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
to myself, you could have committed your

570
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
life to anything. You could have you

571
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
could have worked in pretty much any

572
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,280
field and you would have been a success

573
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,960
because you have what it takes to be

574
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,720
successful. So, why do you care so much

575
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,160
about this? Yeah. Um, I think like many

576
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
people, I had kind of a personal thread.

577
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
I um had a family member who was

578
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
impacted by addiction who actually died

579
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,400
when I was in medical school. And so

580
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,760
that was a sort of a pivotal moment I

581
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
think that coming at the same time that

582
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,559
I was learning all of this science, I

583
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,039
was realizing like, wow, I wish I'd

584
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,799
known this when I was younger and

585
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
dealing with family members and friends

586
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,400
who were affected by this and that we've

587
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
gotten it so wrong and most people don't

588
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
have the kind of tools and knowledge to

589
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,679
do things differently. And so, you know,

590
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,039
you sort of there's that saying when you

591
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,240
know better, you do better. And I think

592
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,919
I kind of wanted to put out into the

593
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
world what I wished was there for other

594
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,919
people. An immediate family member. Mhm.

595
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
And what age were you when you lost that

596
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,559
person?

597
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,559
Probably 24 or so from addiction. Yep.

598
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,120
When you're dealing with a family member

599
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,240
or someone close to you that has an

600
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,919
addiction. So many people listening will

601
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,320
be able to relate to that feeling. Yeah.

602
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
Can you can you describe that what they

603
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,280
feel to in I guess in attempt to make

604
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,559
them feel seen because sometimes

605
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
especially in hindsight if you end up

606
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,000
losing that person you can be filled

607
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,600
with lots of feelings of guilt or

608
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,160
misunderstanding and especially thinking

609
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
about how society's moved on. So how do

610
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,679
you put into words how it feels to be a

611
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,600
family member with someone dealing with

612
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,080
addiction? Yeah, I think you feel

613
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
powerless. You feel like you want to do

614
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,240
something and you either don't know what

615
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
to do or feel like everything you've

616
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
tried hasn't worked. Um, I think again

617
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,640
because people have been exposed to this

618
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
idea that it's an issue of willpower or

619
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,360
choice, which really implies that if

620
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
people wanted it bad enough, they could

621
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,679
just stop. And so if you're a family

622
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,200
member, then that's easy to feel like,

623
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,760
oh, they don't love me enough, you know,

624
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
that they're not choosing me over this

625
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,280
substance. And so I think often people

626
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,799
feel deeply hurt and they've, you know,

627
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
been through experiences that have

628
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,919
created trauma for themselves. There's a

629
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,679
lot of trauma within families who are

630
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,440
experiencing this. And then they're

631
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,960
sometimes given really bad advice, you

632
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,039
know, that you have to like kick someone

633
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
out or this whole concept of kind of

634
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,280
tough love and that people need to hit

635
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
bottom. And so sometimes people, you

636
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,160
know, either do that and then wrestle

637
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,640
with the guilt of was that the right

638
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,080
thing or not or they feel bad even like

639
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
being kind or loving to their family

640
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,000
member. So I think there's a whole mix

641
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,360
of feelings and of course if you lose

642
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
someone you always wonder what if like

643
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,120
could I have done something differently?

644
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
Could something else have changed? And I

645
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,080
think people can feel angry and sad and

646
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,600
guilty and be left with that. What did

647
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
those people in your life need that you

648
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,960
lost

649
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,440
that they didn't get? I think they

650
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,280
needed science-based treatment and

651
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,320
compassion and empathy and um and I

652
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,000
think they needed a world where

653
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,880
addiction was not seen as something to

654
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,120
be ashamed of or something that we judge

655
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
but rather something that is a problem.

656
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,559
You know, the shift from like you are

657
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
the problem to like you have a problem

658
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,679
and we can help you with this. And I

659
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,559
think too often we have approached it as

660
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,919
if like you the person are the problem.

661
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,240
Do you sometimes think back and think

662
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,280
you know if if

663
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,880
id done something differently whether it

664
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
was you or someone else around you or

665
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,960
the system around that individual they

666
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,159
would still be here today. Cuz I think

667
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
that was the first thing that sprung to

668
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,240
mind. I played back all the decisions

669
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,840
that I made and I thought okay maybe

670
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
that was bad advice that I was given.

671
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,720
Maybe I should have been you know maybe

672
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,919
I could have called more. Maybe I could

673
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,960
have intervened here. Maybe, you know,

674
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
maybe there's something else I could

675
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
have done. Absolutely. I mean, I think

676
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,640
about that all the time. And um, you

677
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
know, I think I think of a friend, I

678
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,480
lost overdose. I think of the family

679
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,440
member, I lost alcohol. And not only

680
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
things that I could have done

681
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
differently, but also, you know, those

682
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,200
people, they they saw their doctor, they

683
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
were in the hospital, they had all these

684
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
touch points, all of these like

685
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,240
reachable moments where someone could

686
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,039
have engaged with them and offered them

687
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,880
kindness and actual effective care

688
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,720
that's backed by science. And and they

689
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,919
weren't. And so there are all of these

690
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
like missed moments and missed

691
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,760
opportunities. But the other thing I

692
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,400
think about is like how much time I lost

693
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,480
with them because I think often in this

694
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
model of like tough love and kicking

695
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
people out or thinking like I'm not

696
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
going to see you until you stop using or

697
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
stop drinking because I think that's

698
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,919
going to help make them make that

699
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,360
change. You lose out on like all of

700
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
these moments of time with people that

701
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,000
you love and you you can't get those

702
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,000
back. And so there is this problem I

703
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
think in that binary model of like

704
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
you're either like sober in recovery or

705
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,280
you're actively using and this is good

706
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,640
and that is bad is that we lose the fact

707
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,120
that like people who are struggling with

708
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,720
addiction are amazing funny loving

709
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,480
people who have a problem that they're

710
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,400
dealing with. But if someone was dealing

711
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,760
with cancer, you wouldn't like not want

712
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
to spend time with them. You know, you

713
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
miss all of that time. And you know, the

714
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,520
both cases that I'm thinking about it,

715
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,960
like I'll never get that back. You know,

716
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
there's a phrase I had many years ago

717
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
which I'm now reconsidering, which is um

718
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,159
change happens when the pain of staying

719
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
the same becomes greater than the pain

720
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,039
of making a change. And that kind of

721
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,400
dovetales into this idea that someone

722
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,640
needs to hit their own rock bottom for

723
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
them to change. I think the part the

724
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,679
reason why that idea prevails is because

725
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,440
we hear so many stories. I hear them on

726
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
this podcast of someone's family

727
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,200
rejecting them, throwing them out on the

728
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,440
street and then them having that Eureka

729
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
moment that [ __ ] I need to change my

730
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,880
life. And people always reference that

731
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
like rock bottom moment where they took

732
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,159
action because you know they were at the

733
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,080
very bottom of the well. And um how does

734
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,840
that phrase sit with you? Change happens

735
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
when the pain of making a change becomes

736
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
greater than the pain of making a

737
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,280
change. I think that there are those

738
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
times for sure. It's not to discount

739
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,360
that and I hear those stories too. But I

740
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,280
think there are um from evidence what we

741
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,120
know there are probably more times where

742
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,840
people just endure the pain again and

743
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,840
again again until they never change. And

744
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,080
I think the part that we don't see are

745
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,000
are the folks who change happens when

746
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,080
they begin to get enough hope that

747
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
things could be better for them. That

748
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,200
you know someone loves them someone

749
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,559
cares enough that they're reaching out a

750
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,960
hand in the darkness that there actually

751
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,880
is a path forward. I think people stay

752
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,640
stuck when they feel hopeless, when they

753
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,919
feel like nothing could ever, that

754
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
they're never going to get this, they're

755
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,600
never going to be able to change, their

756
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,200
life would never get better. And so, you

757
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,440
know, take the example I'll often hear

758
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,360
from family members when their loved one

759
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,799
is in jail that they're like, "Thank

760
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,080
heavens." You know, they're they're in a

761
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,360
safe place at least like there's

762
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
actually this sense of relief. There's

763
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,919
even a term for it called a rescued that

764
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,200
people feel. I think it just goes to the

765
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,360
desperation that families are dealing

766
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
with, but this idea that like that's a

767
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,159
safe intervention. And you hear these

768
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
stories, right, of someone who they get

769
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,360
locked up and like that's their Eureka

770
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,360
moment. And yet, if imprisonment were an

771
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,039
effective intervention for addiction,

772
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
for example, we wouldn't see that

773
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,279
actually the time after getting released

774
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,080
from prison, there's 130 times increased

775
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,000
risk of dying from a drugrelated cause

776
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,400
after people leave prison. And that your

777
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
risk of dying ever from addiction is

778
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,360
much much higher if you've ever been

779
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,880
imprisoned. And so I think there are

780
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,720
those stories, but we tend to elevate

781
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,400
those like amazing narratives and we

782
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
miss the fact that so many other people

783
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,880
are going to die in pain and alone and

784
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
isolated because they have no hope. And

785
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,039
so it's not to discount those moments.

786
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,200
And some people are incredibly resilient

787
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,679
and against all odds even with the most

788
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
trauma they can, you know, make it

789
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,760
through and that's incredible. But that

790
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,279
doesn't mean that we should like create

791
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,520
a system that makes it as hard as

792
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,600
possible on people. So would you say

793
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,640
that if we are trying to help someone

794
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,240
change really it's about hope it's about

795
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,679
the strength of their why and it's about

796
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
love and empathy and connection

797
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,960
absolutely is there anything else

798
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,320
missing and it's about effective

799
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,840
treatment and treatment

800
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,120
okay which is subjective right which

801
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
could be depending on the situation

802
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,559
they're in it depends on the type of

803
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,559
addiction and their situation but in

804
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,279
most cases is some combination of

805
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,000
psychotherapy medication

806
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,480
so alcohol yes there's I I mean,

807
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
alcohol's been on a journey. Yes. It's

808
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,480
been on a journey in terms of society's

809
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
opinion about it. Mhm. Can you take me

810
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
on that journey and tell me where we are

811
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,720
now and and in ter when I'm saying that,

812
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,720
I'm talking about society's opinion on

813
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,640
its health benefits and what it is and

814
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
and then and then also what we're

815
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,400
getting wrong now about alcohol. Yeah.

816
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
Yeah. Um, so I mean the journey of

817
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
alcohol is fascinating. So, first I

818
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,880
think we think of this as a relatively

819
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,720
modern thing, but you know,

820
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,559
archaeologists have discovered like beer

821
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,760
making equipment in hunter gatherers

822
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,080
cave dwellings from 13,000 years ago.

823
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,320
That's wild. Like 13,000 years of people

824
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,559
figuring out how to make beer. You know,

825
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,080
you look at China 9,000 years ago, it

826
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
was really about like a spiritual

827
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,679
journey or a social thing. It was never

828
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,799
really about health. At some point, we

829
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
started talking about this as something

830
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,080
that is good for your health. Like drink

831
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,240
red wine. It's going to improve your

832
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,240
health. And that's where I think we got

833
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,559
wrong. And the reason why was actually

834
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,559
from how we were looking at the data. So

835
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
first if you look at only one health

836
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,039
condition, there are some health

837
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,880
conditions where a moderate amount of

838
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,000
alcohol actually improves your health.

839
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
But it was also how people were

840
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,720
conducting the studies. So in most of

841
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,039
those studies, what people do is they

842
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
take like a massive population, tens of

843
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,000
thousands of people, where we have some

844
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
data where they're reporting how much

845
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
alcohol they used. And then we look at

846
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,200
health risks over time. And scientists

847
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,360
would lump people into sort of

848
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
non-drinkers versus light drinkers,

849
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
moderate drinkers, or heavy drinkers.

850
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
And what they were finding is that

851
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,039
people who were drinking in the even up

852
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,480
to the moderate level were actually

853
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,640
doing better than the people who weren't

854
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,320
drinking at all. And so that was where

855
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,080
that um concept that drinking is good

856
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,919
for your health came from. And so people

857
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,320
talk about this like J-shaped curve,

858
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,559
meaning that moderate drinkers actually

859
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,600
have lower risks of health problems. And

860
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,279
then it's really only when you start

861
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,640
drinking very high levels that you start

862
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,799
having more risk of health problems than

863
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,799
people who don't drink at all. What they

864
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,320
realize is wrong with that is that in

865
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
the people who don't drink at all, many

866
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,799
of those people are not drinking because

867
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,559
they're actually really unhealthy for

868
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,000
another reason. Like they might have

869
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,799
heart failure and they like don't want

870
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,400
to drink because they don't want it to

871
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,919
mix with their medication or they might

872
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,799
have had a history of alcohol use

873
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
disorder and they're actually in

874
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,080
recovery. So they've already had some

875
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,159
damage from alcohol and they're not

876
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,760
drinking because of that. And so when

877
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
you change the reference group, you

878
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
actually make the the sort of group that

879
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
you compare people to to people who very

880
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
rarely drink. So, it's not that they're

881
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,360
not drinkers at all, but they drink, you

882
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,880
know, very very light levels. Then you

883
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,120
start to see that those like health

884
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,760
benefits of alcohol go away, especially

885
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,080
if you look across all conditions. Are

886
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,720
you telling me that there's no healthy

887
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,799
level of alcohol consumption? Yes. I

888
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,200
would never say drinking alcohol is good

889
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,600
for your health. That doesn't mean that

890
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
drinking at what we call low-risk levels

891
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,440
can't be a part of a healthy lifestyle.

892
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,039
So, it's a slight slight shift that like

893
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
don't fool yourself into thinking that

894
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,640
drinking that glass of wine is like

895
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
going to exercise for 30 minutes. Like,

896
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,679
it's not something that's going to

897
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,000
promote your health. I think of it more

898
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,200
like having dessert, eating bacon, going

899
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,720
out in the sun. There are risks

900
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,159
associated with all those activities. It

901
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
doesn't mean that I would say you can

902
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
never do any of that, but you need to

903
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,360
understand what the risks are and then

904
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,480
make choices for yourself. Say look at

905
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,520
this glass of wine here and this pint of

906
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,399
beer. Yep. If I drank one of these a

907
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
day, not a huge amount, um I think what

908
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
people tend to think is they think,

909
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,440
well, it's only one, so my body will

910
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,799
just flush it out and there'll be no

911
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,120
adverse health consequences.

912
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,640
Yep. I Is that true? Well, so part of

913
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,880
the challenge is what we think of as one

914
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
drink. So I think um much like, you

915
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
know, if you learn to re read the

916
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,760
serving size on a food, you realize that

917
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,159
like, oh, a serving of ice cream is like

918
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,240
a half a scoop. It's not like a giant

919
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,279
ice cream sundae. The same is true with

920
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,880
alcohol. So um in the UK the kind of

921
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,960
low-risisk drinking limits talk about

922
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,200
units of alcohol which is the equivalent

923
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,520
of 8 grams of alcohol. So how much of a

924
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,360
drink has eight grams of alcohol and to

925
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,840
be in that lowrisk category you have to

926
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,240
be below 14 units. The problem is that

927
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,640
glass of wine just eyeballing it has

928
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
several units of alcohol. So it is not a

929
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,480
even though we think of it as a single

930
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,559
drink it's probably I mean I have to

931
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,600
guess but it's probably like three units

932
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,760
of alcohol. So, if I have a glass of

933
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
wine every day, I'd be over that limit.

934
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,200
Then you'd be right at that limit. The

935
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,480
problem is most people don't drink just

936
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,159
one glass. If you um you know, you have

937
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
two glasses one day and then one glass

938
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,559
one day and then three glasses one day

939
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
cuz you're at a social function. All of

940
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
a sudden, you're actually quite a lot

941
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,080
over that limit. So, if you said that

942
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,080
this this is roughly three units roughly

943
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,080
and you get 14 a week. You get 14 a

944
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,600
week. Mhm. So, 3 * 7. Mhm. 21. Yep. So,

945
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,440
yes, you're over if you're drinking that

946
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,320
size. Yep. Okay. Okay. So, if I have

947
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,279
this glass of wine every day, then I'd

948
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,880
be over the UK limit of lower risk

949
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,320
drinking. Lower risk drinking. So, I'd

950
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,240
be medium risk drinking. You'd be in

951
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,760
what we call moderate risk, which is

952
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,080
associated with pretty much every form

953
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,159
of cancer, which I think people don't

954
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,120
know.

955
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,840
Okay. Cuz I was wondering why cancer has

956
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
been increasing. Yes. A variety of

957
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,320
different forms of cancer increasing.

958
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
You know, breast cancer is one of the

959
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
ones we always hear about that's

960
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
increasing.

961
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,320
So you're saying what is the data in

962
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,279
terms of low or moderate risk of

963
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,840
drinking and cancer? Yeah. So the data

964
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,760
is um growing and really worrisome. So

965
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,000
for breast cancer so there's really

966
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,240
there's a few cancers that even at low

967
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
risk limits you see the risk begin to

968
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
increase. So where we would say there's

969
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
kind of no healthy or there's no even

970
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
like low risk amount. So breast and

971
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
esophageal cancer are two examples of

972
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,600
that. So breast cancer if you were to

973
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,919
drink um below those low risk limits. So

974
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,399
in the US that would be fewer than seven

975
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,320
drinks but a drink in the US is 5 ounces

976
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,320
of wine which is smaller than that or in

977
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,919
the UK is below that 14 units. So it

978
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,080
would be you know fewer than seven of

979
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,279
that that size glass of wine. We still

980
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,919
see a slight increase in the risk of

981
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,760
breast cancer. It's about a 5% increase.

982
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,760
So that means your risk of breast cancer

983
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,919
would increase by about 5%. Now that's

984
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,200
not huge. So I think you know percent

985
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
increase is kind of hard to do the math

986
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,279
on but if you think in the US for

987
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,720
example the average woman has a 13%

988
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,240
likelihood of getting breast cancer in

989
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,320
their lifespan. 13% likelihood. Really?

990
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,919
Yeah. Wow. Really high. So 5% increase

991
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,880
would increase that to like 13.6 or so.

992
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,080
So that means that if there's nine women

993
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,039
in this room Yeah. one of them has is

994
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,320
going to get breast cancer

995
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,120
probabilistically in their life. Yep.

996
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,120
Damn. Yeah. Why is it is it and it's

997
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
increasing. Yeah. And so the reasons for

998
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,240
that are likely environmental because

999
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
your genes don't change over that time

1000
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,440
period. So the risk factors, you know,

1001
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,320
if you think about breast cancer, it's

1002
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,159
alcohol, it's obesity, um it's, you

1003
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,200
know, age when you have children or

1004
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,440
don't have children because it's a

1005
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,960
really hormonally driven cancer. Same

1006
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,240
thing if you think about colon cancer,

1007
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,880
that's a really scary one where we're

1008
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
seeing more and more cases in younger

1009
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,559
people. Some of the drivers of that

1010
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,559
eating meat. So processed meats increase

1011
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,799
your risk of colon cancer. So, you know,

1012
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,320
these very sort of normal behaviors.

1013
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,480
There's probably other environmental

1014
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
things honestly that we're not yet

1015
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,399
measuring or able to measure just given

1016
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,480
the rate of acceleration. When I talk to

1017
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,159
my colleagues who are oncologists, you

1018
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,919
know, things like plastics or other

1019
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,440
things that we don't yet know, there's

1020
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,880
um it's clearly something in the

1021
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,440
environment that is driving these

1022
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
increased cancer risks. So, even at even

1023
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,480
at this sort of level, if I'm drinking

1024
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,919
that might be one unit, right? Yes. So,

1025
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,760
that would be one unit. So, that would

1026
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,240
be fewer than 14 of that. So you could

1027
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,399
see like an, you know, if you had double

1028
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,840
that, it would be a decent pour of wine.

1029
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,760
You could not have more than seven of

1030
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,279
those in a week to be in low risk. But

1031
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,640
even drinking that amount, your risk of

1032
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,880
breast cancer would go up a little bit.

1033
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,360
Even this amount. Mhm. There's really

1034
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,760
sort of no safe amount of alcohol when

1035
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,039
when it comes to breast cancer. Is it

1036
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,880
just breast cancer? So that lowrisk

1037
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,360
category. So when we these big cancer

1038
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,360
studies categorize people as sort of low

1039
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,080
risk or light drinkers, moderate or

1040
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,360
heavy. And for pretty much every cancer,

1041
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,279
once you get to the moderate category,

1042
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
we start seeing increases. And there's

1043
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,159
what we call a dose response

1044
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,080
relationship. So the more you drink, the

1045
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,919
higher your risk of cancer. There's only

1046
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,360
a few cancers that the risk seems to

1047
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,880
increase even at that very low level.

1048
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
And breast cancer is one of those. And

1049
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,200
then esophageal cancer is one of those.

1050
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,799
So there are certain cancers where even

1051
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,760
a small amount of alcohol will increase

1052
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,039
your risk. Does it have an impact on

1053
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,320
thinking about cancers that are

1054
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,519
prominent in men? Yeah. Um, so colon

1055
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,880
cancer, we're seeing that in a lot of

1056
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,240
young men. Um, liver cancer, yeah,

1057
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,600
prostate cancer, which is obviously a

1058
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
male cancer, we don't think of as much

1059
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,000
as being sort of an alcohol sensitive

1060
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,840
cancer, but most cancers, because the

1061
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,840
way alcohol impacts your risk of cancer,

1062
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,919
is not really on a specific organ

1063
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
outside of the liver. It's really about

1064
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,359
how it changes our DNA. So, it's about

1065
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,919
inflammation and what are called

1066
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,000
reactive oxygen um species that sort of

1067
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,760
change our cells and increase the risk

1068
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,359
over time of the mutations that lead to

1069
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,599
cancer. So yeah, can you drill down on

1070
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,839
that? So if I if I'm a heavy drinker, so

1071
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,359
say that I'm drinking

1072
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,440
uh let's say I'm drinking two glasses of

1073
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,200
wine a day consistently, which I guess

1074
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,560
would cons like if I was drinking if you

1075
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,000
drink two of those glasses. Yeah, you'd

1076
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,359
be in the heavy category. So two of

1077
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,200
those a day puts me in the heavy drink

1078
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,000
category, which would surprise most

1079
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,040
people, right? Like that for many people

1080
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,879
is very normal. It is very normal. Yeah,

1081
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,159
I think it's some somewhat more

1082
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,839
difficult for younger people to

1083
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,440
understand because younger people drink

1084
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,440
less. But if I think about the

1085
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,240
generation above me, having two glasses

1086
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,679
of wine a day is quite normal after work

1087
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,680
on the weekends with with every meal

1088
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,240
that you have. So that would make me a

1089
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,720
heavy drinker. And then what are my what

1090
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,440
are the stats saying in terms of my

1091
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,200
cancer uh risk profile? Yeah. So it

1092
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,839
varies by cancer, but roughly we're

1093
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
talking like a 40% increase in cancer

1094
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,640
depending on the cancer type. And the

1095
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,720
more you drink, the more that's going to

1096
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,240
go up. So you know these are scientific

1097
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,760
studies where it's not precise to you as

1098
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
an individual. They're based on large

1099
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,839
populations, but definitely the more you

1100
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,160
drink, the greater the risk. And then if

1101
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,640
I have other sort of do they call them

1102
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,560
comorbidities? Yeah, exactly. So other

1103
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,680
illnesses, other diseases in my body, my

1104
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,760
probability is going to go up further

1105
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,359
from obese some if I'm overweight.

1106
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,599
Exactly. If you smoke. So one of the

1107
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,200
main drivers of alcohol too and cancer

1108
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,800
is that it actually makes you more

1109
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,800
susceptible to the cancer-causing

1110
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,400
effects of tobacco. So if you drink and

1111
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,960
smoke, your risk of cancer is going to

1112
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,880
be even higher.

1113
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,480
How does that work? The thought is like

1114
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,040
if you take esophageal cancer at like

1115
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
the cellular level, it makes you um more

1116
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,640
susceptible of the carcinogens which are

1117
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
kind of the cancer-causing compounds in

1118
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,000
tobacco. And so rather than just seeing

1119
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,680
like an additive risk, you actually

1120
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,400
almost get a multiplied risk in terms of

1121
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,560
the risk of cancer. So smoking and then

1122
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
obesity is the other big one. So a lot

1123
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,000
of um cancers your risk goes up if

1124
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
you're if you're you know have an

1125
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,160
increase in your body mass. What's going

1126
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,839
on in the body then? If I drink alcohol,

1127
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,119
how is that leading to cancer? You

1128
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,160
referenced it slightly there, but I'm

1129
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,839
trying to I want to make sure I'm super

1130
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,160
clear of my brain as to like what the

1131
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,720
the the knock-on effects are and how

1132
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,240
that ends up as cancer. Yeah. I mean,

1133
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,520
there's lots of different mechanisms.

1134
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,960
So, I mean, maybe starting just with

1135
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,520
like what does alcohol do in your body?

1136
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,040
So, you ingest alcohol. The like fancy

1137
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,440
name for that is ethanol. It's a

1138
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,359
molecule and it basically gets absorbed

1139
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
pretty quickly from your stomach. And

1140
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,320
so, you know, it hits your bloodstream

1141
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,560
usually within 10 minutes or so of

1142
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,920
having a drink. Um, how much it hits

1143
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,440
your bloodstream depends on how much

1144
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,599
water you have in your body. So alcohol

1145
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,359
doesn't penetrate into your fat. It just

1146
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
kind of diffuses into the water parts of

1147
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,280
your body. So that's actually why for

1148
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,960
many women, they will get more sort of

1149
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,480
drunk or more of an effect from alcohol

1150
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,480
at a lower level than men because women

1151
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
have more body fat than men. But that's

1152
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,800
going to depend on you as an individual.

1153
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,400
If you have more body fat, you're going

1154
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
to have a different impact. So alcohol

1155
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,320
gets in your bloodstream. Alcohol can

1156
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
instantly cross across what we call your

1157
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
bloodb brain barrier. So it impacts your

1158
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,760
brain instantly and that's where you

1159
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
feel the initially pleasurable effects

1160
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,680
for many people of feeling a little

1161
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,400
relaxed, feeling more social, feeling a

1162
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,920
little bit, you know, less anxiety. If

1163
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,839
you keep drinking and that level keeps

1164
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,160
going up, then you start having impaired

1165
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,760
judgment. You might have motor lack of

1166
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,359
motor coordination. So we've all seen

1167
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,520
this and many people have probably

1168
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,440
experienced it. You know, you may be

1169
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,480
stumbling, not able to drive safely.

1170
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,240
You're not going to make the same

1171
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,839
decisions you would make if you weren't

1172
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,280
drinking. And then if you keep drinking

1173
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,880
then you get you can actually lose

1174
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,960
consciousness so pass out and people

1175
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,240
have experienced that your body is going

1176
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
to try to break down alcohol as quickly

1177
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,079
as it's able to like anything we want to

1178
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,680
kind of excrete any abnormality and get

1179
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
back to our normal functioning and so

1180
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,640
that process happens mostly in your

1181
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
liver which is why the liver is so

1182
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,000
sensitive to alcohol because your body

1183
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,440
sees ethanol as poison. Yes. I mean you

1184
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,880
know I know you talked about this Dr.

1185
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,480
Lumpy but your body always wants to

1186
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,760
restore what's called homeostasis.

1187
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,119
You're always your body's always going

1188
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,359
to fight to get back to what it feels

1189
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,240
its normal is. And so ethanol is not

1190
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,599
something that belongs in your

1191
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,480
bloodstream. Your body's going to try to

1192
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,520
excrete it as fast as it can and then it

1193
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,960
converts it into something called

1194
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,200
acetate and then you can pee that out

1195
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,960
and breathe that out and get rid of it.

1196
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,079
So to eliminate the alcohol in your

1197
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,839
body, you have to go through this

1198
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,839
process and part of that process

1199
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,280
includes this toxic molecule that's

1200
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,280
going to be floating around and causing

1201
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,240
damage to your cells. So that's one way

1202
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,720
that alcohol can cause cancer. The other

1203
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,680
is um just general sort of inflammation.

1204
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
People have probably heard that

1205
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,359
inflammation is just not good for the

1206
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,079
body and increases the risk of cancer

1207
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,680
and o um alcohol generates a lot of that

1208
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,280
inflammation in the process of getting

1209
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
eliminated and so it can actually change

1210
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,200
your cells that over time that can lead

1211
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,800
to cancer. So I also found this graph

1212
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,880
which shows for anyone that can't see

1213
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,800
what we're describing at the moment. It

1214
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,960
shows the acceleration in liver disease

1215
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,200
uh death rates and general li liver

1216
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,960
disease compared to other parts of the

1217
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,960
body. Yeah. Other organs in the body. I

1218
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
believe it shows y what impact does

1219
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,079
alcohol have on the liver and we have

1220
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,640
our little mannequin here of the human

1221
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,400
body. Where is the liver? Yeah, great

1222
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,160
question. So here's um our little

1223
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,000
mannequin. So just to orient people to

1224
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
the body. So we're looking at the inside

1225
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,680
of the body. So like the ribs are gone,

1226
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,520
the outside of the skin is gone. These

1227
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
two pink things are the lungs. They kind

1228
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,400
of encase the heart. You can see the

1229
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
hearts behind the lungs pumping your

1230
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,800
blood. The liver is this brownish organ.

1231
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,800
It's on the right side of your body,

1232
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,960
right under your ribs. It's quite large

1233
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,960
and it's big. An amazing organ. It is

1234
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,680
quite big. It processes much of what any

1235
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,119
kind of toxins that we take in, things

1236
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,200
that we eat, your glucose, alcohol, 90%

1237
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,560
of it's metabolized by the liver. So the

1238
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,119
liver is sort of the clearing house,

1239
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,040
getting rid of byproducts in your body.

1240
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,480
The other are the kidneys, but the liver

1241
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,000
plays a huge role, especially in

1242
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,200
alcohol. So, it sits right here. It

1243
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,680
almost looks like it's as big as the

1244
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,079
lung as one lung. Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1245
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Yeah. Really? Yeah. It's a giant organ

1246
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,240
and it's an amazing organ. So, you could

1247
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,160
actually cut out 80% of the liver and it

1248
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,359
would regrow itself. So, kind of like

1249
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,359
you know those lizards that you cut off

1250
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,280
their tail and they regenerate a tail.

1251
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,760
The liver is fascinating. It's why we

1252
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,520
can do living liver um transplant. So, I

1253
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,520
could take half of your liver and give

1254
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,800
it to someone who needed a liver. you

1255
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,480
would still be able to live and they

1256
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,480
would get a second chance at life from

1257
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,640
that part of your liver. So, it's this

1258
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,400
really cool organ that can regenerate,

1259
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,240
but it can only regenerate up to a

1260
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,839
point. So, once you get to a level where

1261
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,400
you have a lot of scar tissue in your

1262
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,240
liver, we call that cerosis. Um, you

1263
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
sort of reach a point of no return where

1264
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,440
at that point the liver can't heal

1265
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,440
itself. So, I sort of think of it like

1266
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,160
to use a baking analogy. If you're

1267
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
making muffins or a cake, you're going

1268
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,440
along, you're mixing all your

1269
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,640
ingredients, and you realize before you

1270
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,920
put things in the oven like, "Oh, I

1271
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,200
forgot the eggs." You can still add the

1272
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,720
eggs in and like whisk it all together

1273
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,160
and it's going to be okay. If the

1274
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,520
muffins are baking in the oven and you

1275
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,359
forgot the eggs, you can't like pour the

1276
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,720
eggs on top and make the batter the

1277
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,960
same. And the liver is sort of like that

1278
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,040
that up to a certain degree, you can

1279
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,960
actually completely repair the effects

1280
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,560
of things like alcohol or obesity, other

1281
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,400
things. But once you pass that point

1282
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,319
into scar tissue, the liver can't

1283
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,760
regenerate anymore. And so when you

1284
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,160
think about that graph or just the

1285
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,400
rising rates of liver disease, um the

1286
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,599
the main drivers of liver disease are

1287
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,400
obesity and two is alcohol. And so those

1288
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,680
are the leading causes of of liver

1289
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,079
transplant. And the thing that is, you

1290
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,920
know, so sad is I mean I see this all

1291
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,040
the time working in the hospital is

1292
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,560
first of all, we're seeing younger and

1293
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,200
younger people coming in in liver

1294
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,119
failure. So people in their 20s coming

1295
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,160
in in fulminant liver failure from

1296
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,920
alcohol and then dying in the hospital.

1297
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,200
And the terrible thing is that they

1298
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,640
often didn't even know that this was

1299
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,839
causing a problem in their health. And

1300
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,079
by the time they get to the hospital,

1301
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,839
they're so sick it's too late. And yet

1302
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,839
all of that could have been prevented or

1303
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,680
even repaired if it was caught sooner.

1304
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,280
And so that's where I think this

1305
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,720
education of understanding like what

1306
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,880
really are the health harms of alcohol

1307
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,319
and that we have normalized binge

1308
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
drinking in many occasions, especially

1309
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,520
in young people, as being totally

1310
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,359
normal. and yet there are very serious

1311
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,119
health consequences.

1312
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,680
So, I've got a bunch of questions around

1313
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,040
around the liver. Um, does that mean

1314
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,040
that my liver can take a bit of a

1315
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,560
beating before there's any real

1316
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,720
problems? Should I, you know, some

1317
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,400
someone like me, I don't drink alcohol,

1318
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,480
I'm not engaging in anything too bad,

1319
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,640
but sometimes I do wonder if I could

1320
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,240
have like a blowout weekend and then my

1321
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,880
liver would just recover to normal again

1322
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,480
and I'd be fine. Yeah. I mean, so first,

1323
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,680
every person is different. One blowout

1324
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,040
weekend, you probably would be fine.

1325
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,040
Anyone would probably be fine. The

1326
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,720
challenge is one blowout weekend then

1327
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,960
leads to like multiple blowout weekends

1328
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,040
and then over time that can actually

1329
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,040
accelerate the damage to your liver. The

1330
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,319
up you said that my my liver regenerates

1331
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,319
though. So I'm thinking this thing will

1332
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,760
just pop back to normal again. As long

1333
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,920
as you haven't gotten to that scarring

1334
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,839
phase. So once you get too far down that

1335
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,839
path even if you were to stop drinking

1336
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,560
your liver won't recover. The hard thing

1337
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,400
is that that we don't totally understand

1338
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,000
who and why that happened so young to.

1339
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,040
So, this is an active area investigation

1340
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,240
because there are people who've been

1341
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,760
drinking for 60 years and their livers

1342
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,760
don't show signs of scarring. And then

1343
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,920
we're seeing these young people at 25

1344
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
who come in and die in the hospital. And

1345
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,119
so, there are individual factors that

1346
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,440
you don't have any way of knowing that

1347
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
are going to impact your risk of

1348
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,800
developing liver inflammation and scar

1349
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,480
tissue. And so, the safest way to

1350
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,760
prevent that is to not drink in these

1351
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,599
really high ways that we know are going

1352
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,079
to lead to harm. The other way is to get

1353
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,760
medical care because often we do detect

1354
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,839
these things through blood tests and we

1355
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,240
can do ultrasounds and when we see those

1356
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,920
early phases. So what happens first is

1357
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,400
you actually get fat deposition in your

1358
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,119
liver. That's the first step and then we

1359
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,880
see inflammation and fatty liver and if

1360
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,720
you don't stop the thing that's driving

1361
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
those changes over time we see the

1362
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,640
development of what's called fibrosis

1363
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,160
which is like scar tissue. And then that

1364
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,440
scar tissue gets more and more advanced

1365
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,880
to the point that your liver stops

1366
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,359
functioning and you either die or you

1367
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,680
need a liver transplant. What activities

1368
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,839
outside of alcohol cause great stress on

1369
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,760
our liver that we might not see as

1370
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,599
obvious? Yeah. Um so obesity. Um so food

1371
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,280
does. Yeah. Food. So your liver is very

1372
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,440
involved in glucose metabolism. Um so so

1373
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,440
our diet and our body weight impact our

1374
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,560
liver health. Um the other medications.

1375
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,079
So um acetaminophen or Tylenol, which is

1376
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,720
a very common over-the-counter pain

1377
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,119
reliever, um above a certain threshold

1378
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,400
can cause serious liver damage. So

1379
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,839
sometimes you'll see cases where someone

1380
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,079
didn't realize that like their cold

1381
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,520
medicine plus the Tylenol they were

1382
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,359
taking both had that ingredient and then

1383
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,880
they go out and drink heavily and that

1384
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,000
kind of combination effect can cause

1385
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,599
liver damage. How

1386
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,160
much do you think this might be a bit of

1387
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,079
a strange bit of an an unclear question

1388
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,960
but how much alcohol is going to cause

1389
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,960
liver damage? So again it varies person

1390
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,560
to person for liver damage it does tend

1391
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,160
to be the moderate to higher amounts

1392
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,920
that cause damage. Um, one thing is that

1393
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,079
you know that having these big surges,

1394
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,920
like these massive binge episodes, is

1395
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,920
probably more harmful than drinking like

1396
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,319
at a moderate level for a long period of

1397
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,960
time. Those like big surges cause a big

1398
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,280
buildup of that toxic byproduct that

1399
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,160
your body has to clear. And so, you

1400
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,440
know, if you have several years of binge

1401
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,119
drinking heavily, that actually probably

1402
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,640
is going to cause more damage than a

1403
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,119
longer period of time of just drinking

1404
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,040
above the risk limits. So really trying

1405
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,800
to minimize and avoid those very heavy

1406
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,720
drinking episodes is incredibly

1407
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,319
important and then keeping it to those

1408
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,000
low-risisk guidelines which we just

1409
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,920
learned are kind of eye opening and and

1410
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,599
how low risk they are is going to reduce

1411
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,480
the risk of liver damage. And does

1412
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,720
alcohol just impact the liver? No. I

1413
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,119
mean alcohol has effects across our

1414
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,880
body. So many parts of the body can be

1415
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,960
affected by alcohol. So kind of starting

1416
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,960
from the top your brain and we can look

1417
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,319
at this with pictures like an MRI. Oh,

1418
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,200
I've got one actually. Yeah. I think

1419
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,000
this is, by the way, shocking. Yes. To

1420
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,240
me. So, when we do an MRI of someone's

1421
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,760
brain, um, we basically, this is like a

1422
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,520
cross slice. So, it's almost like you're

1423
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,040
you're facing me and I'm cutting your

1424
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,520
face off and looking at your brain

1425
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,960
onwards. Um, healthy brain tissue is the

1426
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,119
gray and white matter. And you want it

1427
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
to be as plump and like taking up as

1428
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,640
much space as possible because that's

1429
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,400
where all of your brain activity is.

1430
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,880
When people get really old or have

1431
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,319
dementia, one thing we see is more and

1432
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
more the black space is essentially

1433
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,359
water. So we see the brain starts

1434
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
shrinking and shrinking and there's more

1435
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,599
water and less active healthy brain

1436
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,200
tissue. That process is accelerated with

1437
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,599
heavy alcohol use. And so you can see

1438
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,440
here, this is a 43-year-old person with

1439
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,880
severe alcohol use disorder where their

1440
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,560
brain looks the way, you know, a

1441
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,720
90-year-old with dementia would look

1442
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,400
because of that um brain damage over

1443
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,400
time from alcohol use. And so we can

1444
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,800
actually a form of dementia is related

1445
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,440
to alcohol use. And so your brain can be

1446
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,599
hugely impacted with alcohol. What is

1447
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,040
going on there? like what's causing the

1448
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,880
brain to deteriorate in such a way

1449
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,880
because of alcohol. Yeah. Well, um

1450
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,800
remember I said um ethanol which is the

1451
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,800
molecule crosses the bloodb brain

1452
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,319
barrier and so especially when you're

1453
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,560
having these high levels of blood

1454
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,040
alcohol that ethanol is sort of bathing

1455
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,880
your brain and if you think about what

1456
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,440
we talked about inflammation and changes

1457
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,280
to cells and to DNA and proteins that is

1458
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,960
happening at the brain level. The other

1459
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,319
thing that can cause accelerate the

1460
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,079
brain damage we see with alcohol is

1461
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,920
actually nutritional deficiencies. So

1462
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,359
people may be drinking a lot and they're

1463
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,680
actually not getting really crucial

1464
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,520
nutrients in their diet and that can

1465
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,240
accelerate the process of brain damage.

1466
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,040
We can even see a very like sudden onset

1467
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,400
amnesia from heavy alcohol use in the in

1468
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,800
the setting of not getting enough

1469
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,240
nutrients in your diet.

1470
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,240
Okay, so that's the brain. That's the

1471
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,240
brain. So the brain for sure. The next

1472
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,560
is the mouth and your esophagus. So

1473
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,839
obviously you're drinking alcohol. It's

1474
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,920
bathing your mouth. It's bathing your

1475
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,599
esophagus and your stomach. So we do see

1476
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,920
an increase in cancer like we talked

1477
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,000
about and that's accelerated by smoking.

1478
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,000
But we also see like benign but annoying

1479
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,640
and problematic health conditions most

1480
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,319
notably acid reflux. So heartburn. So if

1481
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,599
you notice like I'm like always having

1482
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,920
heartburn. I'm having to pop all these

1483
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,440
like ant acids and take this medicine.

1484
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,040
You might want to think like how much am

1485
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,480
I drinking? Is that contributing to my

1486
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,480
heartburn? So that's a very common

1487
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,720
thing. Um the heart is affected by

1488
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,800
alcohol. So you know the heart is an

1489
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,240
organ where at low risk levels there

1490
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,839
doesn't seem to be harm from alcohol.

1491
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,560
But once you get into the moderate and

1492
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,119
high, we see harms. And the harms can be

1493
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,960
a couple fold. One is um something

1494
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,480
called atrial fibrillation, which is

1495
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,040
basically where your heart starts

1496
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,720
beating really irregularly. Yeah. So um

1497
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,560
in your heart, there's four chambers.

1498
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,920
The two chambers at the top. So this is

1499
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,760
really showing the ventricles and the

1500
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,160
atrium. So there's two chambers that

1501
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,599
blood flows through. And in a normal

1502
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,119
heart, your electrical activity comes

1503
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,400
from the top of your heart, goes down to

1504
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,240
the bottom of your heart, and tells the

1505
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
heart to pump. Mhm. And so you get a

1506
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,119
single impulse that goes to the bottom

1507
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,559
of the heart, says pump. And that pumps

1508
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
blood out to your brain and your body

1509
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,160
and your organs and your liver. In

1510
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,440
atrial fibrillation, the top of the

1511
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,119
heart is just kind of quivering with

1512
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,680
this abnormal electrical activity. And

1513
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,920
so the heart can't pump in a normal way.

1514
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,520
We actually there's a a term in medicine

1515
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,040
called holiday heart because we see

1516
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,319
sometimes people drink a ton over the

1517
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,000
holidays and we'll end up in this

1518
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,319
abnormal rhythm just from that binge

1519
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,680
drinking pattern. And then over time, if

1520
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,599
you're drinking at high levels, your

1521
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,599
heart actually dilates and you can end

1522
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,359
up with congestive heart failure from a

1523
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,920
cardiammyopathy, which means the heart

1524
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,599
muscle gets kind of weak and thin and

1525
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,720
floppy and can't pump the way that it

1526
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,400
needs to. Oh, damn. Sometimes we think

1527
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,240
that if we're good at handling our beer

1528
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,720
or our alcohol, then it's having less

1529
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,960
harm on us. So, I'm for whatever reason,

1530
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,480
I've always been good at drinking quite

1531
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,160
a lot when I used to drink. drink

1532
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,000
anymore, but when I used to drink and

1533
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,240
being less affected than my friend who

1534
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,359
was a little bit bigger than me, had a

1535
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,480
little bit more body fat, which is

1536
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,680
really interesting because you pointed

1537
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,440
out an association there that I was

1538
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,559
never aware of. Just to pause on that

1539
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,240
for a second, you're saying that if

1540
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,920
someone has more body fat, they're more

1541
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,000
likely to get drunk. Yeah. Because they

1542
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,200
have less body water and alcohol doesn't

1543
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,880
go into your body fat. So, you're

1544
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,720
essentially it's like if you took, you

1545
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,720
know, a glass of water and you dropped

1546
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,960
red dye in it, you're going to diffuse

1547
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,559
into that water. So the more water you

1548
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,079
have, the more diffuse it'll be and the

1549
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,480
lower your blood alcohol content. So if

1550
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,400
you have very low body fat, you probably

1551
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,920
have more body water. And so, you know,

1552
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,760
two drinks for you is going to diffuse

1553
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,280
into a larger amount of water. Ah, that

1554
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,720
explains a lot cuz I always wondered, he

1555
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
was he was so much bigger than me at the

1556
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,119
time. He was um he had much more body

1557
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,559
fat. And he would get drunk very very

1558
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,000
quickly. And you always think, oh, a big

1559
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,280
guy, they can handle their beer or

1560
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,280
whatever, but he would get drunk very

1561
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,200
quickly. So I used to wonder I used to

1562
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,880
think well alcohol isn't harming me as

1563
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,440
much because I'm not having I'm not as

1564
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,040
drunk as he is. But but that's not true.

1565
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,400
No. I mean so first of all I think the

1566
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,800
interesting story there one is not just

1567
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,960
the body fat but also that people

1568
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,400
metabolize alcohol at different rates.

1569
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,680
You probably I don't know if you found

1570
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,200
this to be true. You probably had fewer

1571
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,119
hangovers than your friend because it

1572
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,880
hangover does seem to be related to the

1573
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,559
amount how high that your blood alcohol

1574
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,400
level gets. So people who don't

1575
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,079
metabolize alcohol as quickly tend to

1576
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,280
have worse hangovers. So that may have

1577
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
been something you experienced but it

1578
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,400
doesn't protect you from the other

1579
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,280
health harms of alcohol like liver

1580
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,359
damage like cancer like overtime you

1581
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,920
know heart problems or esophageal

1582
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,520
problems. What is a hangover? Yeah

1583
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,119
hangover is a fascinating thing that

1584
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,640
people are you know there's a lot of

1585
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,559
emerging evidence about it and trying to

1586
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,559
understand what happens. It seems to be

1587
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,720
most related to how high the ethanol

1588
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,920
concentration in your brain gets because

1589
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,680
they've actually done a ton of studies

1590
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,880
with mice and with people. It was

1591
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,200
initially thought to be due to the

1592
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,119
byproducts of alcohol like that acetal

1593
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,640
aldahhide molecule we talked about but

1594
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,640
it doesn't seem to be related to that.

1595
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,000
that seems to be related to ethanol, but

1596
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,599
essentially it's this syndrome where

1597
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,640
after you drink, once your blood alcohol

1598
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,559
content comes down to zero. You feel

1599
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,800
sort of apathetic, you're tired, you

1600
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,760
have a headache, you often feel

1601
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,079
nauseous. And so it's sort of that

1602
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,319
squelli of your brain essentially being

1603
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,559
bathed in this ethanol and then as it

1604
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,920
leaves you just feel totally crappy

1605
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,839
because people think of it sometimes as

1606
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,280
just being dehydrated.

1607
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,800
Yeah, it it is not just being

1608
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,400
dehydrated. There's actual sort of

1609
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,079
effects of ethanol on your brain that

1610
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,000
lead to the hangover. Okay. I think if

1611
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,760
you are drinking at an amount that

1612
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,680
you're getting a hangover, it is a good

1613
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,920
sign that you're drinking above a limit

1614
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,400
that would be considered okay for your

1615
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,480
body. Cuz sometimes I remember back in

1616
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,720
the day if I had a big glass of water

1617
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,359
before I went to bed, if I had been

1618
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,800
drinking, I felt better in the morning.

1619
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,079
There is some element of dehydration,

1620
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,359
don't get me wrong. And that's partly

1621
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,280
because, right, if you think again,

1622
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,440
alcohol is diffused in water. So if your

1623
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,920
total body water is contracted because

1624
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,000
you're dehydrated, your ethanol level is

1625
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
going to be higher. So drinking is going

1626
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,760
to help you sort of flush it out and

1627
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,839
feel better. I'm drinking water, but

1628
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,119
it's not only because of dehydration.

1629
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,240
There'll be people listening to this

1630
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,359
now. I doubt they would have got this

1631
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,480
far, but um because if they if they did,

1632
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,760
they probably wouldn't think this, but

1633
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,040
there'll be some people who would have

1634
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,839
gotten this far in the conversation and

1635
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,240
be thinking, "Yes, but Mhm.

1636
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,160
Alcohol helps me socialize and

1637
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,400
socializing is really important and I

1638
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,920
can't socialize very easily because of

1639
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,480
the design of the modern world without

1640
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,119
having a drink or I have great times

1641
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,760
when I drink so I don't want to quit my

1642
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,800
alcohol use and you know in some cases

1643
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,040
that they will be high and medium

1644
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,200
consumption alcohol drinkers. What do

1645
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,040
you say to those people? Well, first

1646
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,200
like there's no judgment here. So a

1647
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,800
molecule of ethanol is not more moral or

1648
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,559
immoral than a molecule of glucose. So

1649
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,960
you could say the same thing about diet.

1650
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,640
We have lots of awareness now about

1651
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,839
processed foods and white flour and

1652
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
white sugar. That doesn't mean that

1653
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,880
everyone's going to live this like

1654
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,960
aesthetic lifestyle where they never eat

1655
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,400
dessert. So I think it really is like an

1656
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,319
you need to go in with eyes wide open

1657
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,000
and understand what are the risks, what

1658
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,079
matters to you, and how do you make that

1659
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,680
calculus. So if you decide it's a choice

1660
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,200
you want to make, you want to set

1661
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,559
yourself up for success. So, if you

1662
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,599
decide like I want to cut back on how

1663
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,200
much I'm drinking, but I'm going to go

1664
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,640
to happy hour every night with my

1665
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,079
friends and just try to like not drink

1666
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,440
while I'm there, you're probably not

1667
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,720
going to be very successful because

1668
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,240
you're going to be in a situation that's

1669
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,680
constantly like reminding you of alcohol

1670
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,160
use and everyone around you is using

1671
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,319
alcohol. So, try to make some different

1672
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,680
sort of structural changes and how you

1673
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,440
set up your life and your week and your

1674
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,720
day. Um, and you may find that actually

1675
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,640
you don't miss it that much. That you

1676
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,400
could cut out three or four days of

1677
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,079
drinking and still get that social

1678
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,440
pleasure two days out of the week and

1679
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,240
your overall health risk is going to go

1680
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,200
down significantly. In terms of treating

1681
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,920
someone with alcohol uh abuse disorder,

1682
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,480
rehab is often the most widely known

1683
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,559
form of treatment. Um, one of my friends

1684
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,160
who struggled with addiction really,

1685
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,160
really badly with alcohol addiction, but

1686
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,119
also drug addiction said to me multiple

1687
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,319
times, he said, "I've been to rehab

1688
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,440
three or four times now, and it's just

1689
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,960
not working." Yeah. And I think when the

1690
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,240
most popular or the most well-known

1691
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,599
treatment doesn't work for you, you kind

1692
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,559
of develop an even greater sense of

1693
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,200
hopelessness. Are you a fan of rehab?

1694
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,359
Generally, no. Um, so you know, rehab is

1695
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,200
this idea that you go away somewhere for

1696
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,040
a week, a couple weeks, and then you're

1697
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,400
kind of cured, right? It's almost like

1698
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,680
people have thought of addiction as an

1699
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
infection where you need like two weeks

1700
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,960
of antibiotics and then you're done.

1701
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,640
Mhm. What we really understand is that

1702
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,319
for many people addiction is more like a

1703
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,520
chronic illness or even like cancer

1704
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,680
where you need a lot of treatment

1705
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,760
upfront for the first few years and then

1706
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,079
over time you get into stability and

1707
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,760
remission and you're almost like a a

1708
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,760
cancer survivor. You're in long-term

1709
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,440
recovery. And so this idea that you go

1710
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,880
somewhere for a couple weeks and then

1711
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,160
you come out and you're all better

1712
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
really doesn't match what we know of

1713
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,680
addiction. The other problem is that

1714
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,839
much of what happens in rehab is not all

1715
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,960
that therapeutic most of the time. So

1716
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,400
the things that we know are most

1717
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,079
effective for addiction, one are

1718
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,319
medications, which there's a lot of

1719
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,280
stigma, misunderstanding about, and then

1720
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,040
two are like evidence-based

1721
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,960
psychotherapy. So things like cognitive

1722
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,119
behavioral therapy, motivational

1723
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,280
enhancement therapy, you know, working

1724
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,359
on your underlying trauma. Often in

1725
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,800
rehabs, the model is really built around

1726
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,160
this idea of like you remove yourself

1727
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,680
from this environment. You do some

1728
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,359
groups while you're there. Sometimes

1729
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,200
often they're based on more of like a

1730
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,559
peer support model. Sometimes the

1731
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,160
therapies that are offered are frankly

1732
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,680
not very evidence-based. Like we

1733
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,599
actually did this study, it was a secret

1734
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,440
shopper study where we called rehab

1735
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,640
programs across the country to like ask

1736
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,720
about what they offered. And many of

1737
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,319
them offer things like, you know, horse

1738
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,800
therapy or like dolphin assisted

1739
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,960
therapy, which like I'm sure it's very

1740
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,240
nice to swim with dolphins and to work

1741
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,839
with horses, but it's not something

1742
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,440
that's been like studied and effective.

1743
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,960
And many places don't offer the things

1744
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,880
that we know are actually effective,

1745
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,720
which are, you know, trained clinicians

1746
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,800
doing evidence-based treatments or

1747
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,640
medication treatments. So, it's a

1748
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,359
combination of like this short-term fix

1749
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,800
for a long-term problem and not actually

1750
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,160
getting the treatment that you need. So,

1751
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,839
what does work like for alcohol use

1752
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,599
disorder, most people don't know we have

1753
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,920
very effective medications that can help

1754
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,319
you even if you just want to not drink

1755
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,599
as much. So, there's this medication I

1756
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,839
mentioned at the beginning that actually

1757
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,040
blocks your opioid receptors. Yeah.

1758
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,559
which seems kind of funny that it works

1759
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,799
on alcohol, but the reason it does is

1760
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,160
that that for people who part of the

1761
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,839
thing that drives them to drink is that

1762
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,000
they drink, they feel this like pain

1763
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,440
relief pleasure sensation from the

1764
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,200
release of opioids in their brain and

1765
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,960
that makes them want to drink more. That

1766
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,240
if you block that, people don't get sick

1767
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,640
if they drink, but they just don't find

1768
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,000
it as rewarding. And so, someone named

1769
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,520
Sinclair actually in Europe did some

1770
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,280
fascinating experiments of even just

1771
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,960
using it as needed. So rather than

1772
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,040
taking it as an everyday medication, if

1773
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,640
you know that when you go to like a

1774
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,160
holiday event, you're going to drink way

1775
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,920
more than you want to drink, you take it

1776
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,280
like 30 minutes before you go, and then

1777
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,720
what people find is they have like one

1778
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,920
drink and they're like, "Ah, I'm good. I

1779
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,119
don't have that same urge to want to

1780
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,040
drink more and more because I didn't get

1781
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,119
the same sort of tickle of feeling

1782
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,520
better and feeling relief." What do you

1783
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,280
think about psychedelics as a way to

1784
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,440
counteract addictive behaviors like the

1785
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,520
ones we've described? Yeah, one of the

1786
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,640
most like groundbreaking trials in the

1787
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,799
last couple years for alcohol use

1788
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,559
disorder was psilocybin. So there's a

1789
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,319
big study of psilocybin assisted

1790
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,480
psychotherapy for alcohol use disorder

1791
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,400
which showed really remarkable effects.

1792
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,000
So people took psilocybin they actually

1793
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,839
compared it. Folks came in and they

1794
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,440
either got a big dose of benadryil or

1795
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,040
psilocybin and then they sat with a

1796
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,640
therapist for like eight hours for this

1797
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,160
guided um psilocybin journey and they

1798
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,839
found that people drink much less after

1799
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,599
it. So it does seem to have some effect

1800
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,799
and the thought is that part of the way

1801
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,680
psychedelics work is they imp increase

1802
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:21,599
neuroplasticity meaning the ability for

1803
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,000
the brain to form new pathways and kind

1804
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,839
of retrain itself and so it does seem to

1805
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,760
be a potential therapeutic for alcohol

1806
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:29,280
use disorder. Psilocybin is the active

1807
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,200
compound in magic mushrooms. Yes,

1808
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,920
exactly. Have you heard of iberane? I

1809
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,280
have. Yeah. Which is often associated

1810
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,680
which is another psychedelic often

1811
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,200
associated with addiction. Yes. People

1812
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,599
have looked at ibagane for um opioid use

1813
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,760
disorder. um those studies have been

1814
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,280
less promising than psilocybin although

1815
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
it hasn't been tested in the same kind

1816
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,640
of rigorous ways recently partly for

1817
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,079
opioid use disorder we have really

1818
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,079
effective medications that have been

1819
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,520
shown to improve recovery and reduce

1820
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,680
death and so it's sort of hard to be

1821
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,440
better than that one really interesting

1822
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,599
like new whole class of medications for

1823
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,799
alcohol is um medications that are being

1824
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,280
used for weight loss that people have

1825
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,680
probably heard of so like WGOI ompic

1826
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,920
that whole class of GLP-1

1827
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,359
um medication seems to also reduce

1828
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,760
alcohol use which is kind of interesting

1829
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,200
Really? Yeah. Have they studied that?

1830
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,160
Yeah. So, they Well, first of all,

1831
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,920
there's I mean, there's whole like

1832
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,520
Reddit threads and online communities

1833
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,119
about this where people were prescribed

1834
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,720
it for diabetes or for weight loss and

1835
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,480
they all of a sudden were like, I don't

1836
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,400
really want to smoke or drink. Like that

1837
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,400
kind of urge has gone away entirely. And

1838
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,240
for some people, they really describe it

1839
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,680
as being like miraculous. They've been

1840
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,119
trying to stop drinking for, you know,

1841
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,480
years and years and for the first time,

1842
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,960
they don't feel that sense of like

1843
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,559
craving and urge. Um, and there recently

1844
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,480
have been some actual clinical trials

1845
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,160
where they've done, you know, placeboc

1846
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,559
controlled blinded studies and have

1847
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,160
shown that it does reduce drinking. And

1848
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,000
so it's a really interesting area where

1849
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,720
it seems like those medications kind of

1850
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,520
reset craving and appetite more globally

1851
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,520
and not just for

1852
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,640
food. What the hell is this? I'm going

1853
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,720
to tell you. All of you will probably

1854
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,079
know that I spend a huge amount of year

1855
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,359
about 50 weeks a year traveling around

1856
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,960
the world. And one of the great tips

1857
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:07,040
that I've always offered for traveling

1858
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,559
is to pack as light as you possibly can.

1859
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,720
Because if you do, I found that I can

1860
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,319
save hours by not having to check in my

1861
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,880
bags and then having to wait for them on

1862
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:17,760
the other side. So, I always travel with

1863
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,760
a small, tiny bag that can be stowed

1864
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,920
above me in the plane everywhere I go,

1865
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,000
even for trips that take weeks and

1866
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,040
weeks. It is a massive travel hack. And

1867
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,280
that's why I have to tell you about

1868
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,359
today's show sponsor, Extra. This bag

1869
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,440

the air out of your luggage so that you

1871

1878
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,319
One of the ways that many of us

1879
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,520
understand addiction if we haven't

1880
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:55,040
experienced it directly in our own lives

1881
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,040
is we look up at role models on TV and

1882
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,720
in sort of celebrity pop culture and we

1883
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,280
see these role models who you know we

1884
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,200
see on stages start to deteriorate and

1885
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,200
deteriorate in the public eye and

1886
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,880
ultimately it seems often like it's

1887
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,240
inevitable that someday the TMZ

1888
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,400
headlines going to ring out and say that

1889
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,920
this person has passed away and that

1890
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,640
happens all too often. We think about

1891
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,400
you know Whitney Houston or um I guess

1892
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,799
Michael Jackson's even been associated

1893
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,799
with dying from an addiction to I think

1894
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:23,200
it was painkillers or something. Prince

1895
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,760
Elvis Presley Mac Miller who a lot of

1896
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,520
people will know as well and a Nicole

1897
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,599
Smith and even now in the public eye

1898
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,960
there are certain individuals where

1899
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,720
we're starting to see this sort of

1900
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,559
erratic behavior. They're posting on

1901
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,480
their Instagrams. They're they're

1902
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,799
showing up in society in a slightly

1903
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,680
different way. When you see that in the

1904
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,440
line of work that you operate

1905
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,280
in, what is your natural reaction? How

1906
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,480
does it make you feel when you know

1907
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
because there's a couple of people I'm

1908
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,599
thinking about at the moment who the

1909
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,720
world are talking about that you know we

1910
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,720
think they have an addiction, we think

1911
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,200
they need help. What is your natural

1912
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,839
reaction to to that and what what is it

1913
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,280
that those people need? Yeah. Well, when

1914
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:02,400
I when I read the headlines of someone

1915
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,079
dying, I mean, to me, it's gutting and

1916
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,079
heartbreaking. One, because obviously

1917
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,000
it's a human life that was someone's

1918
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,680
mother and sister or brother and people

1919
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,760
cared about, a public figure that people

1920
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,359
looked up to and cared about, but mostly

1921
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,119
that it was a totally preventable death.

1922
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,799
Like really, no one should die from a

1923
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,799
substance related death. We have tools

1924
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,640
to treat addiction. We know how to

1925
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,720
prevent the harms of, you know, drug

1926
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,319
overdose, for example. And so the fact

1927
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,079
that someone can die, especially someone

1928
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,799
that everyone has watched for so long,

1929
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,280
is I think just like a tragic example of

1930
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,640
how what the mismatch is between what we

1931
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,359
do around addiction and what science

1932
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,240
does is actually helpful. Um I think you

1933
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,720
know when I see someone who actively is

1934
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,880
showing signs, like it's just sad to see

1935
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,359
that happen so publicly without people

1936
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,520
being able to support that person. And

1937
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:49,520
it's not a magic fix. not going to be

1938
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,960
like a you know you have an intervention

1939
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,559
the person goes to treatment gets better

1940
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,960
forever that I think is often in

1941
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,079
people's minds it is a process a journey

1942
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,000
like any change and so really it is

1943
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,599
around where we began that idea of how

1944
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,760
do you begin to understand with this

1945
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,040
person how is their substance use

1946
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,359
getting in the way of what they want for

1947
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,040
themselves and how might their life be

1948
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,640
better for them based on whatever they

1949
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,040
believe better is if they were to make

1950
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,240
changes to their substance use I am I

1951
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,520
remember I had this one particular

1952
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,880
friend who had an addiction and um I

1953
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,880
remember always the life of the party.

1954
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,400
And I remember this one day he came up

1955
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,280
to me at at an event and he'd sat down

1956
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:30,319
in front of me and said to me

1957
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:32,799
um he said he like whispered to me, "I'm

1958
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,119
in so much pain." Mhm. And he told me

1959
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:39,040
about rehab and how it had failed him,

1960
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,799
etc. But it it just it almost sounded

1961
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,119
unbelievable that someone with such a

1962
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,480
big smile on their face would whisper to

1963
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,079
me, especially a man because men don't

1964
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,559
really talk much about their emotions.

1965
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,319
I'm in so much pain. Mhm. And then

1966
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,839
funnily, I I then see how the world

1967
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,160
treats that individual, him having

1968
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:56,400
whispered that to me one day and the

1969
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,640
world how the world responds to his

1970
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,799
behavior and attacks him and criticizes

1971
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:03,040
him. But I was privy to the whisper.

1972
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:05,200
Yeah. Yeah. And that that one whisper

1973
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,960
helped me to kind of reframe how to how

1974
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,640
to treat that person, but also really

1975
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,079
what was at the heart of what was going

1976
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,520
on and probably gave you so much

1977
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,640
empathy, you know, a huge amount of

1978
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
empathy cuz I would have been like the

1979
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,880
rest of the world. I would have just

1980
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,839
thought what an idiot, what a [ __ ]

1981
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,760
Like what's he doing that? That's

1982
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:19,440
strange behavior. Y, you know, and you

1983
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,440
said something really important that was

1984
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,799
a slight shift in words. You didn't say

1985
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,720
he failed treatment. You said the

1986
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,640
treatment failed him. And that matters

1987
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,559
so much because I think too often we've

1988
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,079
made it seem as if people are failing.

1989
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,559
like if they go to rehab and they don't

1990
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,799
get well h it's their problem you know

1991
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,240
and actually the treatment wasn't right

1992
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,680
for them. If someone had cancer and

1993
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,200
their cancer came back or didn't get

1994
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,880
treated by chemotherapy we wouldn't say

1995
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,160
like they failed you know we would say

1996
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,920
well what's the next treatment how do we

1997
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,160
get them to the right doctor and so

1998
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,839
there is this like personal blaming and

1999
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,280
that gets it stigma which is one of the

2000
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,880
main reasons that people don't share

2001
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,880
that they're struggling with substances

2002
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,400
that they don't seek treatment and so we

2003
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,520
have tremendous stigma towards drug and

2004
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,359
alcohol addiction. It's one of the most

2005
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,200
stigmatized kind of social conditions

2006
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,480
globally. And so, of course, then if

2007
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,079
you're a person who starts to think

2008
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,599
like, "Oh, maybe I do have a problem."

2009
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,359
Like, maybe my alcohol use is getting in

2010
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,720
the way of things. It's really hard to

2011
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,680
then say anything because you worry that

2012
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,359
you're going to be judged. You're going

2013
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,440
to be labeled. You're going to be

2014
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,480
misunderstood. In some cases, terrible

2015
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,000
things could happen to you. You might

2016
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,359
get your children taken away by, you

2017
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,680
know, child welfare. You could lose your

2018
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,200
housing or lose your job. And so, that

2019
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,720
stigma has like played into this

2020
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,640
terrible cycle where people, you know,

2021
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,000
have to whisper it to someone. shows how

2022
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,240
much he trusted you to even be able to

2023
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,079
say honestly what he was going through

2024
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,839
because there's so much stigma about the

2025
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,480
condition itself. You must have had many

2026
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:37,520
cases that broke your heart. Yeah. Can

2027
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:42,480
you tell me about one that changed you?

2028
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:44,880
Oh goodness. So many um you know so one

2029
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,400
gentleman in particular he was um

2030
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,520
struggled with heroin addiction for a

2031
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,720
long time and had been like we talked

2032
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,839
about it had been kind of a chronic

2033
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,359
illness for him. He'd had periods where

2034
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,079
he'd done really well. He'd had periods

2035
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,680
where he had struggled and had always

2036
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,680
stayed safe through all of that. And he

2037
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,200
actually his like one really meaningful

2038
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,599
relationship in his life that kind of

2039
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,240
kept him together was a relationship

2040
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,079
with his mom and he lived with her. And

2041
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,440
um and they lived in public housing.

2042
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,760
They were, you know, dealing with

2043
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,200
economic insecurity like many people.

2044
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,559
And someone found out that he was

2045
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,640
staying with her and it would have put

2046
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,160
her at risk for her housing. And so he

2047
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,480
didn't want her to lose her housing. So

2048
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,480
he left. But he was newly homeless. and

2049
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,240
all of a sudden because of just social

2050
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,520
barriers was dealing with the stress of

2051
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:30,319
homelessness and being alone and um even

2052
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,799
with kind of all of the connection he'd

2053
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:34,640
had with his mom and with treatment he

2054
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,720
was found um dead between two parked

2055
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,280
cars had overdosed alone in the street

2056
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,160
and I always think like if and you knew

2057
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,520
him. Oh yeah, the cascading effects that

2058
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,640
you know that it didn't have to be that

2059
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,880
way. And I think there are so many

2060
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,480
deaths like that where I just think it

2061
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,119
doesn't have to be like this. You know,

2062
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,440
really no one should die like this. And

2063
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,039
um and there are so many things that,

2064
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,480
you know, in the moment feel so out of

2065
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,920
our control. And I think that's part of

2066
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,559
what generates my passion for this work

2067
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,079
is I can't always save the person in

2068
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,640
front of me or change issues around

2069
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,160
homelessness or housing policy, but I

2070
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,359
can try to work on a broader scale to

2071
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,480
make things different for the next

2072
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:14,240
person. And I think that kind of that

2073
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,000
for me counteracts some of the distress

2074
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,880
of of of losing people that I care

2075
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,480
about. If you were president of the

2076
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,640
United States, for example, let's just

2077
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,280
use this country as an example, and you

2078
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,440
had to make upstream changes to the way

2079
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,640
society was designed in order to

2080
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,359
mitigate the downstream symptom of

2081
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,880
addiction and addictive behaviors, etc.

2082
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,799
What are those things that you would

2083
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,720
change about the way that our society is

2084
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,280
designed? You could change anything.

2085
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,640
Yeah, I mean, starting upstream, the

2086
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,720
biggest thing would be building

2087
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,960
resilience and building connection early

2088
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,799
on. So you know I think these things

2089
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,480
that feel so not related to addiction

2090
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,599
per se are actually deeply related when

2091
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,520
we think about adverse childhood

2092
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,520
experiences. So we think about

2093
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,880
prevention for children you know often

2094
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,480
people have looked at like education

2095
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
like you know telling people telling

2096
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,440
kids that drugs are bad that doesn't

2097
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,520
work. What does work is actually

2098
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,359
building resilience in young people. So

2099
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,640
building resilience building connection.

2100
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,240
So what does that look like? That looks

2101
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,760
like affordable housing. That looks like

2102
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,079
parks where people can get outside and

2103
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,000
play sports and exercise and build

2104
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,280
relationships. That looks like, you

2105
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,880
know, supporting families so that

2106
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,039
families can stay together and so those

2107
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,200
early relationships and attachment can

2108
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,799
be wellformed. That's like the true

2109
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,240
prevention work is trying to break the

2110
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:27,680
cycles of intergenerational trauma,

2111
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,680
poverty, substance use, and actually

2112
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,000
supporting families, communities at the

2113
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,559
very start. It reminds me of Rat Park.

2114
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,799
Yes. Yeah. Rat Park is a great example

2115
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,720
of that. What is Rat Park for those that

2116
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:41,280
don't know? Yeah. So rat park was a

2117
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,039
series of experiments that were done um

2118
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,559
where essentially they took they're

2119
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,799
trying to understand kind of drivers of

2120
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,960
addiction using rat models. And so they

2121
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:50,960
took rats and they had one model where

2122
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,480
rats were isolated in their own cage

2123
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,559
with nothing to do and no human

2124
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,039
connection. And they had access to a

2125
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,880
substance like morphine or cocaine where

2126
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,039
they could push a lever and get more of

2127
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,880
it. And those animals when they were

2128
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,359
deprived of connection and isolation,

2129
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,520
anything to do more of the drug. It gave

2130
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,960
them relief. who gave them pleasure.

2131
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,200
They took those same animals and they

2132
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,520
put them in this amazing cage with, you

2133
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,920
know, areas to play and like wheels to

2134
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,440
climb on and lots of friends and other

2135
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,960
rats. And all of a sudden, they saw the

2136
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,719
same animals were no longer kind of

2137
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,279
pushing the lever and trying to get more

2138
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,199
of the drug. And so, you know, it's it's

2139
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,880
a somewhat simplified model that there's

2140
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:29,440
lots of it's probably oversimplified,

2141
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,799
but I it demonstrates that so much of

2142
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,480
addiction really is around this idea of

2143
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:36,319
connection restoring sort of the world

2144
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,560
around us, the community, the

2145
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,319
interrelatedness that we all have, the

2146
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,080
opportunities and purpose and and

2147
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,759
meaning and hope. So, I think that's the

2148
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,359
real prevention. And then there's how do

2149
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,520
we actually address folks who are having

2150
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,880
a problem? And I think you know what I

2151
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,040
would do there is first make addiction

2152
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,640
treatment widely available immediately

2153
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,719
when people need it. So the minute you

2154
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,120
walk into your general practitioner's

2155
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,040
office or an emergency room, you get

2156
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,319
treated with compassion, with science,

2157
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,560
with people asking you what can they do

2158
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,920
to help and offering you effective care

2159
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,159
the same way they would if you had a new

2160
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,000
cancer diagnosis or a new diagnosis of a

2161
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,920
heart problem. And that we really

2162
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,199
reframe treatment entirely to look like

2163
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,839
the way it looks for any other health

2164
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,159
condition. and that we stop punishing

2165
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,679
people who use substances where, you

2166
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,080
know, a lot of times people are still

2167
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,839
sent to jail for substance use, which,

2168
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,120
you know, is a confusing mixed message

2169
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,640
of we're saying this is a health problem

2170
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,040
on the one hand, but we're going to put

2171
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,319
you in prison or jail at the same time.

2172
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,359
Those two things don't necessarily

2173
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,120
align. Many of us are living in the

2174
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,719
first model of Rat Park. Yeah, we're

2175
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,960
living alone. We're living in these big

2176
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,920
cities. We're more sedentary than ever

2177
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,279
before.

2178
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,880
um maybe you know we've moved to a big

2179
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,600
city because we don't h which means we

2180
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,040
don't have our family around um we might

2181
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,799
be doing a job that's incredibly

2182
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,799
challenging. So, it's no wonder when we

2183
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,640
think about addiction and alcohol and

2184
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:55,280
some of these other behaviors, but more

2185
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,000
broadly beyond alcohol um as a

2186
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,679
substance, other addictive behaviors,

2187
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,880
whether it's social media or it's uh

2188
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,880
what we eat or pornography or in the

2189
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,960
sort of inverse the good habits, the

2190
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,600
healthy food, the working out, the

2191
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,640
exercise, the productive behaviors, why

2192
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,920
we're struggling so much. And um I've

2193
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,080
often wondered if we should all just

2194
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:22,000
like go to like communes and live, do

2195
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,320
you know what I mean? In like in in

2196
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,840
groups. I mean, I don't think human

2197
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,600
beings were meant to live this way. And

2198
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,679
it's a relatively new thing, right? We

2199
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,440
often lived in a village or a community.

2200
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,280
We lived in these multigenerational

2201
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,719
households. I mean I have little kids

2202
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,400
and I think having kids was such an eye

2203
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,239
openener of that of like well that makes

2204
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,600
sense why people live with their parents

2205
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:41,440
and their grandparents and have these

2206
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,679
big families to create you know

2207
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,840
community and and a sort of extended

2208
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,199
family around you and we have lost that

2209
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,760
in a lot of ways and I think the ways

2210
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,520
that we used to get that like religion

2211
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,199
maybe not maybe that still resonates for

2212
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,600
some people but for others it may not

2213
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,080
and so finding other ways of engagement

2214
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,280
of meaning of purpose that can be

2215
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,480
through lots of different things you

2216
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,280
know I think people are finding creative

2217
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,800
ways of doing that it can be through

2218
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,159
like, you know, finding a volunteer

2219
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,440
activity, finding some other type of

2220
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,120
social group. Some people do it through

2221
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,400
sports. You know, they they find

2222
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,000
connection and engagement with people

2223
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,400
they don't really know over the shared

2224
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,239
love around around an activity or a

2225
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,840
team. But really sort of seeing that as

2226
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,960
a priority the same way you'd prioritize

2227
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,719
other things in your life, in your

2228
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,040
health. And are you a fan of of therapy

2229
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,199
as an approach to aim at the early

2230
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,360
childhood trauma? Absolutely. Yeah. I

2231
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:29,840
mean, I think one of the problems is

2232
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:32,719
that too often therapy has been like

2233
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,080
forced on people. I think that um I'm

2234
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,920
much more of the approach of like we

2235
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,840
need to make treatment available and

2236
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,360
welcoming and high quality so that

2237
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,040
people get value out of it and therapy

2238
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,159
is a huge part of that. You know, it's

2239
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,600
about a lot of things. It's about

2240
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,440
connection. It's about figuring out

2241
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,120
those reasons why people are using in

2242
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,199
the first place addressing and healing

2243
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,600
those traumas. It also matters that we

2244
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,800
have um good well-trained empathetic

2245
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,880
therapists. So there's been a lot of

2246
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,800
interesting studies looking at actually

2247
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,159
how empathetic your therapist is is

2248
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,600
probably the strongest predictor of

2249
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:01,679
whether you stop make changes to your

2250
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,360
alcohol or drug use really which is so

2251
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,560
interesting because we often think like

2252
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,840
you you've probably heard someone say

2253
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,960
like I don't really like my therapist

2254
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,560
and I think sometimes reaction to that

2255
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,960
is like oh like you're you're not that

2256
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,719
into therapy but they've actually done a

2257
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,960
lot of studies showing that a therapist

2258
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,960
who is less empathetic their client is

2259
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,960
more likely to use more substances at

2260
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,719
the end of that course of treatment. So

2261
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,800
actually having a really well-trained,

2262
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,320
compassionate, evidence-based workforce

2263
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,239
is hugely important, too. And I guess

2264
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,080
the same applies for family and friends.

2265
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,600
Yeah. Yeah. I think empathy is really

2266
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,840
powerful. Those kind of things that we

2267
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,239
think of as soft skills actually matter

2268
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,120
tremendously. Is it possible to prop

2269
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:38,080
somebody

2270
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,239
up. You know, because I was talking to I

2271
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,120
think it was talking to Dr. Anna L about

2272
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:45,840
this about the idea that you can play a

2273
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,520
role in someone's addiction. Yeah. I.e.

2274
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,760
I want to help my friend who's addicted

2275
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,040
and so I I'm there for them. I'm

2276
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,560
comforting them, but I'm actually in

2277
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,880
some way reinforcing that addictive

2278
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,960
behavior

2279
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,080
because I'm I'm positively reinforcing

2280
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,600
it because I'm supporting them so much

2281
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,199
and I'm loving them so much and I'm

2282
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,199
showing them so much empathetic

2283
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:07,120
attention that actually I'm playing a

2284
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,239
role in continuing that addiction. Is

2285
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,800
that possible? Yeah. And this is this

2286
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,840
concept of like enabling which I think

2287
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,600
is nuanced. I would say at its core it's

2288
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,120
really deeply problematic that for the

2289
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,640
most part love and support are never

2290
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,719
going to be harmful. And when I talk to

2291
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,480
patients often the thing that caused

2292
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,480
them to ultimately engage in treatment

2293
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,400
was not some terrible consequence. It

2294
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,800
was the idea that someone cared enough

2295
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,320
about them in a moment where they didn't

2296
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,159
love themselves very much and felt

2297
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,520
hopeless that someone was willing to

2298
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,440
sort of lift them up and believe in

2299
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,800
them. And it's these small moments of

2300
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,480
kindness, like I'll tell you a story of

2301
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,000
a patient that we took care of in the

2302
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,440
hospital who was there for a really

2303
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,560
life-threatening infection related to

2304
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,560
their drug use. And a year to the date

2305
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,400
after um he was hospitalized, he wrote a

2306
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,760
letter to our team. And he said, you

2307
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,360
know, I'll never forget the moments you

2308
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,360
guys came in and just sat with me and

2309
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,800
talked to me. And he now sends an email

2310
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,400
every single year on the anniversary of

2311
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,480
when he got out of the hospital. And

2312
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,560
it's those those moments of humanity of

2313
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,880
connection again that connection idea

2314
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,320
that often are the catalyst for change

2315
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,480
the kind of hope and belief that your

2316
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,000
life could be better somehow as opposed

2317
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,000
to this idea of like increasing

2318
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,440
someone's pain and suffering. And that

2319
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,360
plays out in different ways. So in

2320
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,640
families one of the most effective tools

2321
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,800
we teach people is something called

2322
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,960
craft which is um stands for community

2323
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,640
reinforcement and family training. And

2324
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,239
it's very different than the like people

2325
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,520
may have seen like shows where you're

2326
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,760
supposed to like stage an intervention

2327
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,360
and you know tell someone all or nothing

2328
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,719
but craft is very different. It teaches

2329
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,640
people first how do you understand the

2330
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,920
science of addiction family members.

2331
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,520
Second, how do you get support for

2332
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,360
yourself? Because it's really tough to

2333
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,640
deal with addiction in a family. And

2334
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,560
then how do you start to learn about

2335
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,800
consequences in a different way that you

2336
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,320
know if you're a parent and your kid is

2337
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,000
missing school because they're using,

2338
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,880
you don't want to cover for them and and

2339
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,080
sort of reinforce their pattern, but you

2340
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,679
also don't need to kick them out of your

2341
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,840
house. That there's sort of gradations

2342
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,760
of consequence that can actually help

2343
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,040
people change. And one of the biggest

2344
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,480
sort of motivators for change is

2345
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,880
actually positive reinforcement of the

2346
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,800
behaviors you want to see. So that's

2347
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,880
been called contingency management in

2348
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,320
the kind of treatment world. And you

2349
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,360
know, health insurance companies, lots

2350
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,480
of companies have figured this out,

2351
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,560
right? So if you get money back because

2352
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,840
you join a gym or you get those, you

2353
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,280
know, you get reimbursements for doing

2354
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,040
something that people want to see,

2355
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,040
people do more of it. It's true in human

2356
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,400
behavior. It's very true with addiction.

2357
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,320
But we often do the opposite. We try to

2358
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,159
punish people into getting well instead

2359
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,640
of reinforcing kind of the healthy

2360
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,760
behavior, the what we want to see more

2361
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,360
of, if that makes sense. Yeah. I I I'm I

2362
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,880
guess I'm trying to represent the

2363
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,080
audience member that's listening to this

2364
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,920
right now that knows someone in their

2365
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:34,640
life that was addictive and they tried

2366
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,840
to be empathetic. They they tried to

2367
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,560
offer support. They tried to give the

2368
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,840
person help and still nothing changed.

2369
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,719
Yeah. In that situation, maybe the

2370
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,000
person that was struggling with the

2371
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,840
addiction didn't accept the support.

2372
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,159
Yeah. Didn't go to the meetings, didn't

2373
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,679
speak to the therapist. Yeah. in such a

2374
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,960
situation where you're offering help to

2375
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,960
someone and they're not taking it,

2376
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,760
they're not willing to investigate

2377
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,560
different medical um

2378
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,080
treatments, they're living at your

2379
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,679
house, they're in your business,

2380
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,239
whatever.

2381
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,960
Is there a point where you say enough is

2382
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:10,560
enough? Yeah. Well, first like it is

2383
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,400
just so hard to be there as a family

2384
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,320
member or friend. So for anyone

2385
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,960
listening, I've been there. It's

2386
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,719
incredibly impossible. So have grace

2387
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,000
with yourself. I think that's a

2388
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,159
different decision you're talking about

2389
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,679
is at some point do you have to make a

2390
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:26,159
decision to protect yourself. So let's

2391
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,320
say you have someone in your home who's

2392
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:30,560
dealing with addiction who you know gets

2393
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,480
aggressive or is stealing money or is

2394
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,840
you know causing trauma to the people

2395
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,440
living in the house. At some point you

2396
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,880
may need to decide that for my wellbeing

2397
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,960
for the rest of the family's wellbeing I

2398
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,080
can't have this in my life right now.

2399
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,440
That's very different than saying

2400
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,360
kicking them out is going to make them

2401
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,120
better. So the distinction there is that

2402
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,040
it's okay to protect ourselves.

2403
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,640
Sometimes we have to do that and

2404
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,480
sometimes there's only so much you can

2405
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,560
do. But to not sort of fool yourself

2406
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,719
into thinking that the action is to help

2407
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,800
the other person and that's okay. I

2408
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,159
think the other piece is, you know, at

2409
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,520
the end of the day, first of all, it's

2410
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,040
easier to be a treater. So I've been a

2411
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,880
family member, I've been a clinician. As

2412
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,560
a clinician, I can truly be

2413
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,760
unconditional. So I can I'm going to be

2414
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,440
someone's doctor whether they continue

2415
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
to use heroin or continue to drink or

2416
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,880
don't. And there's something really

2417
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,880
beautiful in that. Like my engagement

2418
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,800
with someone is is not premised on

2419
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,320
whether they make changes or not. as a

2420
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,320
family member, that's harder, especially

2421
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,560
if you're a kid dependent on someone or

2422
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,520
you're in a marriage or relationship.

2423
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,480
So, you may have to make different

2424
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,480
choices. But I think at the end of the

2425
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,920
day, people don't change because of why

2426
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,199
we think they should change. They change

2427
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,280
because they think their life is going

2428
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,880
to get better in some way. So, the key

2429
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,400
then becomes figuring out like why might

2430
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,760
this person's life get better if they

2431
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,000
were to make changes to their alcohol or

2432
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:40,000
drug use. So, it's a shift where you

2433
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,840
become sort of on their team instead of

2434
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
trying to drag them towards water, you

2435
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,520
know, drag the horse towards water. And

2436
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,199
there's this um fascinating kind of

2437
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,480
human instinct that none of us like

2438
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,239
being told what to do. So there's

2439
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,520
something called the writing reflex,

2440
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,800
which is it's really hard for

2441
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,560
caregivers, it's hard for parents

2442
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,080
because we love to tell people like our

2443
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,600
great advice and why what they're doing

2444
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,679
is wrong and they should take our like

2445
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,120
brilliant doctor advice. And this can be

2446
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,640
like telling someone like, "Don't you

2447
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,560
see what you're doing is causing harm?

2448
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,000
You should make changes." It can also be

2449
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,159
subtler. It can be like lecturing

2450
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,520
someone or trying to educate them. But

2451
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:11,679
when someone shoves something down your

2452
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,120
throat, your instinct is to to resist.

2453
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,400
It's just like natural human behavior.

2454
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,679
even if it's a great idea, if someone's

2455
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,520
like shoving an ice cream cone in your

2456
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,800
face and like eat it. Even if you like

2457
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,080
ice cream, you might be like, "Wait,

2458
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,000
wait, I don't know if I want this ice

2459
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,360
cream." And so the key then is not to

2460
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,800
sort of tell someone what to do. It's to

2461
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,960
understand why might they want to make

2462
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,040
changes. And so once you do that, then

2463
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,719
you all of a sudden realize like it just

2464
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,120
feels better. You're not trying to drag

2465
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,040
someone towards something. It doesn't

2466
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,480
you don't have like personal skin in the

2467
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,159
game about what choice they make, but

2468
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,000
you're really a partner with them and

2469
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,560
figuring out how is this thing causing

2470
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,920
problems to you and why might your life

2471
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,840
get better if you were to make changes

2472
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,120
to your alcohol use or your drinking or

2473
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,880
your substance use. What's the

2474
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,560
difference in delivery there in terms of

2475
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,719
delivering that message? Because they're

2476
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,120
both ultimately getting to the same

2477
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,120
outcome, but it sounds like the language

2478
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,080
might be slightly different. Yeah, very

2479
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,520
different. So um in kind of like medical

2480
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,400
speak and therapy speak we talk about

2481
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,640
something called motivational

2482
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,640
interviewing which is it becomes almost

2483
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,400
like a mind trick but it's um it is

2484
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,480
basically a way of trying to identify

2485
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,960
from the person their reasons for change

2486
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,320
and reflecting it back to them. And so

2487
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,080
it's not you telling them you think they

2488
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,040
should change but you are trying to

2489
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,159
elicit their motivation and amplify it.

2490
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,600
And then at the end of the day you're

2491
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,960
turning over the power back to them. So

2492
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,600
that might look like something someone

2493
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,640
says you know I'll I'll be your your uh

2494
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,239
patient. Okay. So yeah, I I I do drink a

2495
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,840
lot. I drink a couple of times a day,

2496
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,239
especially in the mornings, but it's

2497
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,520
fine, you know. Uh I'm still managing to

2498
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:37,920
get to work every day. Obviously, I have

2499
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,679
a couple of uh misconduct issues at

2500
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,280
work, but other than that, you know, and

2501
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,960
my partner's left me, but other than

2502
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,280
that, everything everything else is fine

2503
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,640
and I can manage this. It sounds like

2504
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,840
your alcohol use is causing some

2505
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,080
problems at work and in your

2506
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,960
relationships. It is. Yeah. Yeah. I lost

2507
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:55,440
my my partner's left me and um I keep

2508
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,520
getting these misconduct notifications

2509
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,640
at work in disciplinaries because I

2510
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,239
sometimes get there late and when I'm

2511
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,880
there sometimes I fall asleep etc. and

2512
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,400
I've obly I work with big machinery so

2513
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,159
there's a little bit of a risk there but

2514
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,159
otherwise it's okay. It sounds like

2515
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,760
you're worried about your safety at work

2516
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,960
and also how your drinking is starting

2517
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,120
to affect your job and your

2518
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,800
relationships. That's true. Yeah, I am.

2519
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:17,280
You know, I've been on the on the crane

2520
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,640
in particular, being um being

2521
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,880
intoxicated on the crane in particular

2522
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,640
has caused a few incidences. And you

2523
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,640
know, I sometimes do worry that one day

2524
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,480
it'll it'll go a little bit too far.

2525
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,320
Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like that's really

2526
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,000
scary that you're really worried your

2527
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,320
alcohol use could cause even like a

2528
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,320
serious or lifethreatening accident at

2529
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,440
work. Yeah. And then what am I going to

2530
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,360
do for work? You know, because if you

2531
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,560
get a something like that on your file,

2532
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,320
then you I'm never going to be able to

2533
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,440
be a machine operator ever again. So,

2534
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,800
yeah. Man, your job sounds really

2535
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,000
important to you and so important.

2536
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,640
Alcohol's starting to get in the way of

2537
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,159
that. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. And so what are

2538
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:50,400
your goals looking forward around your

2539
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:52,520
job or your relationship? Well, I I

2540
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,600
really should

2541
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,800
um I really should fix this alcohol

2542
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,960
issue that I have and uh I would love to

2543
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,000
find a partner. I'd really that's really

2544
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,040
important to me cuz I want to have a

2545
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,400
family. So obviously prerequisite of

2546
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,640
having a family is finding a partner

2547
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,239
really. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it sounds

2548
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,760
like you're really committed to thinking

2549
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,360
about making a change to your drinking

2550
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,960
and that you're looking forward to

2551
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,080
finding a partner and family and you're

2552
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,280
worried that alcohol might get in the

2553
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,199
way of that. So, you're what you're

2554
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,840
doing there is you're you're you're not

2555
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:23,440
leading me, you're kind of pushing me,

2556
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,880
if that makes sense. There's like a

2557
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,040
little bit of like a Jedi mind trick

2558
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,480
thing where you're so essentially it's

2559
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,760
actually really it's a little tricky

2560
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,280
when you're first learning how to do it

2561
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,800
because what I'm trying to do is I'm

2562
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,800
listening for what's called change talk.

2563
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,199
So, any little nugget you're giving me

2564
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,320
about making a change. So, you're saying

2565
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,239
like, "Oh, I'm starting to get this

2566
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,159
misconduct. I'm worried about this thing

2567
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,679
with safety at work. I want a partner."

2568
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:46,320
Those are like it's a gold mine of

2569
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,480
little kernels of change and I'm

2570
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,679
ignoring all of your sustained talk. So,

2571
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,199
anything where you're arguing for the

2572
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,639
status quo, it's not a big deal,

2573
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,239
drinking's not that big a deal, I can't

2574
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,920
make a change, I don't even acknowledge

2575
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,280
it or address it. And that's actually

2576
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,800
hard because I think most of us pay

2577
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,760
attention to the negative stuff. So if

2578
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,080
you think about like a performance

2579
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,920
review at work or someone telling you

2580
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,520
any kind of feedback, we tend to amplify

2581
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,800
and remember like the one bad thing that

2582
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,560
someone said to us and forget the

2583
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,840
millions of good things. So you have to

2584
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,920
change you have to like train yourself

2585
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,520
to do the opposite to hear those little

2586
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,880
kernels of change talk and then I'm

2587
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,400
basically being a mirror but I'm

2588
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,080
amplifying it. So I'm taking these

2589
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,760
little kernels of change talk. I'm

2590
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,960
reflecting back to your own words. So

2591
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,880
I'm not telling you that you should stop

2592
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,400
drinking because it's unsafe at work.

2593
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,600
I'm reflecting to you like you're

2594
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,800
starting to get worried that you might

2595
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,719
have an accident at work and that's

2596
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,280
really serious. And that's kind of

2597
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,040
guiding the conversation forward. The

2598
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,880
other key is that if you meet a point of

2599
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,639
resistance, you want to pivot because

2600
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,960
once you start arguing, whether it's

2601
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,400
about politics or anything, people dig

2602
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,000
in. So if you start arguing with

2603
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,840
someone, you got to find another way.

2604
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,760
You just got to pivot and roll to a

2605
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,760
different tactic because the more you

2606
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,280
argue, the more people dig in on their

2607
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,719
point of view. And it's more about like

2608
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,800
winning the argument than it is about

2609
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,120
moving forward. What if you want to

2610
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,679
change yourself? Are is there a process,

2611
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:00,480
a system, a methodology to help you

2612
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,400
discover what your ideal behaviors are,

2613
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,679
what your why is, and to implement

2614
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,840
change? That's why I say all the time,

2615
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,679
what's your why? I think that's so

2616
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,520
exciting. Like, we all want to live our

2617
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,920
best lives, whatever that means to us.

2618
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,280
And so, um, having a purpose, having a

2619
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,679
goal is probably the most important

2620
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,520
thing. Motivation is important. We talk

2621
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,600
a lot about motivation, but motivation

2622
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,840
is fleeting. It can slip and slide over

2623
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,199
the course of one day. So you may, you

2624
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,199
know, take kind of a mundane example.

2625
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,719
You want to get in shape and you're

2626
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:28,159
feeling super motivated one day and then

2627
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,600
the next morning your clock, your alarm

2628
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,520
clock goes off at like 5 in the morning

2629
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,440
and you're tired and it's cozy in your

2630
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,199
bed and maybe you stayed up a little too

2631
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,960
late. Your motivation is going to be

2632
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,120
flagging, right? So if you don't have a

2633
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,880
goal or a reason or a why or a purpose,

2634
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,800
it's going to be really hard to actually

2635
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,120
get up the energy to get up. And so

2636
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,719
figuring out what that purpose is and

2637
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,159
then trying to find ways to enjoy the

2638
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,840
process because if you're always working

2639
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:51,280
towards a future goal, some people are

2640
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,280
very goal-oriented and that works for

2641
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,800
them. But finding joy in the process

2642
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,800
will help you. So I'll take alcohol for

2643
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,920
example, like not an addiction issue,

2644
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,280
just like making changes to your

2645
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,120
drinking in your life. So if you're just

2646
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,440
like, I should stop drinking because

2647
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,920
drinking is bad for me. That's like a

2648
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,960
relatively vague goal, right? It's not

2649
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,040
really about anything that matters

2650
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,520
specifically to you and it's going to be

2651
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,360
hard to stick to that. If instead you

2652
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,360
think, okay, I, you know, started to

2653
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,040
realize that when I drink every single

2654
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,159
night, I don't get the work done that I

2655
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,520
want to get done because I'm too tired

2656
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,719
and I fall asleep. I don't feel

2657
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,480
refreshed in the morning, so I'm not

2658
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,840
sleeping very well. I'm not getting up

2659
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,840
early to exercise, and that's something

2660
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,840
that really matters to me. I'm not like

2661
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,679
as present with my family as I wanted to

2662
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,360
be. Then it's these all these little

2663
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,800
micro goals that make it much easier to

2664
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,639
make a change. So, you may decide, you

2665
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,840
know, I'm not going to drink. I'm only

2666
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,040
going to drink two days out of the week,

2667
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,960
and when I do drink, I'm going to keep

2668
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,880
it to this amount. But the reason why is

2669
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,800
not some vague recommendation from some

2670
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,239
doctor. It's because like you're working

2671
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,080
really hard at work and it feels good to

2672
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,520
be productive after dinner and you're

2673
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,440
training for a race and you want to get

2674
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,800
up in the morning and run. And so you

2675
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,239
actually notice those little steps like,

2676
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,239
"Wow, it feels great. I woke up this

2677
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,840
morning and I feel so refreshed." Like

2678
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,199
you're reinforcing your goal right

2679
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,400
there. You're not working towards some

2680
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,159
abstract thing that doesn't really

2681
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,960
matter to you. So you want to make these

2682
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:05,440
like really focused, personalized goals

2683
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,960
and really anchoring it on what is your

2684
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:09,840
why. And your why may be very different

2685
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,760
than my why or someone else's why. Um so

2686
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,080
it may be you know sleep really matters

2687
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,440
to you or you know you may have a

2688
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,920
different relationship with alcohol. So

2689
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,199
the other kind of example I'd give is

2690
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,560
people are different right? We respond

2691
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,320
differently to things. So some people

2692
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,480
can open a bag of like potato chips and

2693
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,520
eat two and walk away. Some people like

2694
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,199
they open the bag they're going to eat

2695
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,440
all of the chips. And so it's just

2696
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:30,880
easier not to open the bag. And alcohol

2697
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,320
is like that too. Some people may find

2698
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,920
if they open a bottle of wine or they

2699
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,239
have alcohol in the house they're going

2700
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,840
to drink all of it. And the idea of like

2701
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:39,520
trying to keep to these small amounts of

2702
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,280
alcohol is actually really hard. And

2703
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,040
it's simpler and easier to just avoid it

2704
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,800
completely or to only drink at a

2705
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,960
restaurant or something. So, you do have

2706
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,040
to understand like how your goals, your

2707
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,639
why, your purpose interacts with your

2708
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,760
response to whatever it is that you're

2709
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,280
working on. And that's going to be

2710
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,360
different for everyone. Are there any

2711
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,800
other things, any other habits that we

2712
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,760
should be thinking about when we're

2713
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,120
trying to overcome an addiction? So if

2714
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,040
we think about alcohol as being at like

2715
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,639
the bottom of the stream, are there is

2716
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,840
there anything else upstream that I

2717
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,960
should be thinking about? So we talked

2718
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,239
about social connections and

2719
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,760
relationships. So I need to be making

2720
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,520
sure that I'm surrounded by people. I'm

2721
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,840
socializing because that's going to be

2722
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,280
an insulator to like stress and

2723
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,639
loneliness which is going to cause me

2724
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,280
discomfort which is going to lead me to

2725
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:21,440
alcohol. But are there any other things

2726
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,280
that I should be thinking about when I'm

2727
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,040
setting off to make a change in my life?

2728
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,280
Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch. I think

2729
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:29,520
first any behavior change whether it's

2730
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:31,840
alcohol or other. If you're feeling like

2731
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,120
depleted and tired and not your best

2732
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,880
self, it's going to be harder to make a

2733
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,400
change. So, if you think about like any

2734
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,000
big decision you made to change your

2735
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,679
job, to start an exercise routine, to

2736
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,960
leave your partner, you probably didn't

2737
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,560
choose like the day that you were

2738
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,239
exhausted and feeling anxious and

2739
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,920
stressed and not your best self to make

2740
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,760
that change. Like, change is hard. So,

2741
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,520
you want to try to boost up other things

2742
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,760
in your life. Eat well, you know, get

2743
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,040
enough rest, try to exercise, things are

2744
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,719
that are going to help you feel healthy

2745
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,239
and your best best self when you're

2746
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,719
trying to make a change. Is that linked

2747
01:26:56,239 --> 01:27:00,159
to dopamine? Yeah, because I mean so our

2748
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,880
natural reward system, the thing that

2749
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,880
triggers it is exercise, food, sex,

2750
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,080
connection. So, you know, trying to have

2751
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,480
healthy other ways of um of positive

2752
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:12,880
dopamine release. And so, I think for

2753
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,239
many people, alcohol or substances can

2754
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,080
feel like a way of doing something nice

2755
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:18,080
for ourselves, like I'm going to this is

2756
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,800
going to help me reduce my stress after

2757
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,159
a bad day at work. So, the goal then is

2758
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,440
not that you just like white knuckle it

2759
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,719
all night and feel really stressed after

2760
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,760
work. It's that you figure out like what

2761
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,520
are some other things that help me

2762
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,760
reduce stress after work? Maybe it's

2763
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,440
going to a yoga class with a friend.

2764
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,000
Maybe it is, you know, spending time

2765
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,760
with my family. Maybe it's getting

2766
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,520
massage or meditating or watching a show

2767
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,719
I like. So, you want to, it's not just

2768
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,320
you're removing the thing that you're

2769
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,400
trying to change. You want to fill up

2770
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:45,600
the empty space with other things. So,

2771
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:49,600
what if I fill it up with like Hargan's

2772
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:52,000
ice cream and burgers because that will

2773
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,040
cause a dopamine hit. Mhm. So presumably

2774
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,199
if I just eat loads of sweets and candy

2775
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,360
then that's going to stop me from

2776
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:00,639
engaging in addictive behavior. But we

2777
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,199
see that all the time. So that's like

2778
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:04,719
replacing things. And um you know I was

2779
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,480
reading an article people have probably

2780
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,080
heard of dry January. This idea of like

2781
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,840
not drinking for the month of January to

2782
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,960
rethink your relationship with alcohol.

2783
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,639
I was reading an article that dry

2784
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,920
January has become high January because

2785
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,840
people are just smoking a ton of weed

2786
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,440
instead of drinking. And so it's very I

2787
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,360
think you want to be cautious that

2788
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,320
you're not just replacing the thing that

2789
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,440
you're trying to change with something

2790
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,360
that's also going to cause health

2791
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,880
problems. Now, if having dessert once in

2792
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,880
a while for this, you know, you're not

2793
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,280
getting calories from alcohol and having

2794
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,880
a nice ice cream cone once a week is a

2795
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,239
way of sort of treating yourself that's

2796
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,159
healthier and maybe more aligned with

2797
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,920
your goals. That's fine. I think

2798
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,280
thinking about these things, actually

2799
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,600
thinking about alcohol, the way we think

2800
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,120
about dessert, sunbathing, eating

2801
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,600
processed meats, all of these things

2802
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,040
have risk and benefit in our lives. I

2803
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,560
think where we've gone so wrong with

2804
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,960
alcohol is this idea that it's like a

2805
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,320
healthpromoting

2806
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,679
behavior that you shouldn't be drinking

2807
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,400
for your health. It's not going to make

2808
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:55,600
you healthier. Um, and also much like

2809
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,960
many things we do that are not

2810
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,719
healthpromoting activities, there are

2811
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,800
ways of reducing the health harms of

2812
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:04,080
that activity so that it's okay in small

2813
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,920
amounts in your life. I think B2B

2814
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,159
marketeteers keep making this mistake.

2815
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,400
They're chasing volume instead of

2816
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:12,239
quality. And when you try to be seen by

2817
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,920
more people instead of the right people,

2818
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,080
all you're doing is making noise. But

2819
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,480
that noise rarely shifts the needle and

2820
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,000
it's often quite expensive. And I know

2821
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,600
as there was the time in my career where

2822
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I kept making this mistake that many of

2823
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,080
you will be making it too. Eventually I

2824
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,679
started posting ads on our show sponsors

2825
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,520
platform LinkedIn. And that's when

2826
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,600
things started to change. I put that

2827
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,440
change down to a few critical things.

2828
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,440
One of them being that LinkedIn was then

2829
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,760
and still is today the platform where

2830
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,840
decision makers go to not only to think

2831
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,360
and learn but also to buy. And when you

2832
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,960
market your business there, you're

2833
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,280
putting it right in front of people who

2834
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,040
actually have the power to say yes. And

2835
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,280
you can target them by job title,

2836
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,960
industry, and company size. It's simply

2837
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,199
a sharper way to spend your marketing

2838
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,440
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how

2839
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:57,760
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try. and

2840
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:00,679
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit

2841
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,560
to get you started. If you visit

2842
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:05,679
linkedin.com/diary, you can claim that

2843
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,679
right now. That's

2844
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,120
linkedin.com/diary. Just thinking about

2845
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,440
something we said earlier about how

2846
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:14,800
early childhood trauma causes the brain

2847
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:16,719
to change and then results in addictive

2848
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,400
behaviors. If I went through an early

2849
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,480
childhood trauma and my brain has

2850
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,520
changed because of that and then I get

2851
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,840
into uh I become addicted to alcohol as

2852
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,400
a as a young man and then I manage to

2853
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,239
find my way off the alcohol. My brain is

2854
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,280
still addicted, right? My brain still

2855
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,080
has that addictive sort of

2856
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,520
predisposition. So isn't it the case

2857
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,120
that I'll just end up being addicted to

2858
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,159
something else that gives me a dopamine

2859
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:41,840
hit? So it turns out the brain is

2860
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:43,760
amazingly um plastic meaning it can

2861
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,520
change. We see that over time. So the

2862
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,440
first thing is even adverse childhood

2863
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,440
experiences are not a done deal. So we

2864
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:51,760
talk a lot about ACEs. We don't talk a

2865
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,000
lot about pieces or PCE positive

2866
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,679
childhood experiences but actually you

2867
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,520
can reduce the risk that someone

2868
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,480
develops addiction by increasing the

2869
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,760
number of positive childhood

2870
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,199
experiences. So take someone who's

2871
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,040
experienced some terrible adversity.

2872
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:05,120
Their parent has died or they have a

2873
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,280
parent who's in prison or they have

2874
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,280
addiction in their family. If that kid

2875
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,040
has one single adult figure that they

2876
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,040
believe cares about them, that reduces

2877
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,480
their risk of addiction. So there are a

2878
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,719
lot of positive ways that we can

2879
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,960
actually change the trajectory even in

2880
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,920
the midst of terrible trauma. When you

2881
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,440
think about someone who's had a

2882
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,920
substance use disorder, we actually have

2883
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,080
good data on this that after 5 years of

2884
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,600
recovery and often that is fits and

2885
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,199
starts. So most people think of like

2886
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,360
this is one fail swoop that you like

2887
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:33,440
decide to stop drinking and then success

2888
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,880
is that you never drink again. For most

2889
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,440
people what we find is that's actually

2890
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,440
like a series of steps. So I always like

2891
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,800
to think of progress not perfection and

2892
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,480
not have this kind of all or nothing

2893
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,480
mindset that for many people they may

2894
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,920
early on have a month where they go

2895
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,440
without alcohol and then maybe next time

2896
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,760
it's three months and then maybe it's a

2897
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,360
year and these recurrences happen but

2898
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,840
ultimately they get to this place where

2899
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:55,760
they go into long-term recovery. After 5

2900
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,760
years of recovery, a person's risk of

2901
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,360
subsequently developing addiction is no

2902
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,960
higher than the general public. So your

2903
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,880
brain actually does change and we see

2904
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,400
this on functional imaging. We see this

2905
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,880
in longitudinal studies that follow

2906
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:09,120
people over time. So you actually can

2907
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,560
overwhelm those things and get to a

2908
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,080
place where you don't have a higher risk

2909
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,080
than other people. Because some people

2910
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,600
say, "I've got an addictive personality

2911
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,360
that's they sort of self-label and

2912
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,800
selfidentify as having an addictive

2913
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,880
personality." Sometimes they even

2914
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,960
reference their brain as being easily

2915
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,239
addictive. Is there is there truth in

2916
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,840
that? Is it possible to have an

2917
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:27,600
addictive personality? It's not so much

2918
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,239
about personality, but we do respond

2919
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,120
differently to substances. So um you

2920
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:34,639
know, take alcohol or opioids, anything.

2921
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,239
People feel differently the first time

2922
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,000
they ever use it. So often if you talk

2923
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:39,440
to someone who then develops addiction,

2924
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,520
they tell you that first time they use

2925
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,280
the substance, it was like this amazing

2926
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,360
feeling. It felt like I've had people

2927
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:47,520
describe it as falling in love or, you

2928
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,440
know, a warm hug or or like a relaxing

2929
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,199
bath. These like incredible comforting

2930
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,040
experiences. Other people, they get

2931
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:55,120
prescribed like an opioid for a tooth

2932
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,639
extraction. They feel nauseous and kind

2933
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,400
of like not like themselves and they

2934
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,920
don't like the feeling. So how we

2935
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,080
respond to substances is definitely

2936
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,000
based on our neurobiology and is

2937
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,320
different for different people. Um so

2938
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,320
some people are both from a genetic

2939
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,320
reason and and their own brain are just

2940
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,520
more wired to be at risk of addiction.

2941
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,800
And that's important to know about

2942
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,800
yourself because then you can make

2943
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,080
different choices. You may decide, you

2944
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,400
know, never to keep alcohol in the house

2945
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:20,000
or not to drink because the risk is too

2946
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,760
great. But how much do you think about

2947
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,360
other things that are taking hold of

2948
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,159
society? some of the other things that

2949
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:28,239
are non substance related. So, social

2950
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:30,320
media addictions and pornography

2951
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,920
addictions and what else? What else are

2952
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,639
some of the big ones? Food addictions,

2953
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,400
food, sex, gambling. Um, I think there

2954
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:37,679
are a lot of similarities. It's not my

2955
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,280
particular area of focus, but I think

2956
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,560
there are a lot of overlaps. I mean, I

2957
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,719
think many of the things you just

2958
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,880
listed, you could talk about. One,

2959
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,040
dopamine obviously, but two, this idea

2960
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,719
of needing to fill yourself with

2961
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,080
something else. either, you know,

2962
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,760
thinking about trauma, thinking about

2963
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:54,159
untreated mental illness, thinking about

2964
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,639
just kind of the deficit of connection

2965
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:58,960
and of meaning and reward um and

2966
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,159
reaching to these external solutions.

2967
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,800
Can you tell me about a time where

2968
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:04,080
you've worked with a patient

2969
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,080
who through the process of working with

2970
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:08,719
them and understanding their trauma, you

2971
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,280
discovered something unexpected about

2972
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,480
the root cause of their addictive

2973
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,239
behavior? Yeah. Yeah. I can think of

2974
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,040
many patients, but one in particular

2975
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:20,400
who, you know, I I had this I knew that

2976
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,840
he'd experienced hard things in his

2977
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,239
life. He'd been in prison, for example,

2978
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,520
which is a traumatizing experience. He'd

2979
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,199
lost his parents and other thing. I

2980
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,120
never truly understood the depth of his

2981
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:31,120
trauma and had he had struggled his

2982
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,120
whole life um with substance use

2983
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:35,040
disorder and and using lots of things,

2984
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:38,719
mostly opioids, but also alcohol and

2985
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:41,679
cocaine and um and just had had a really

2986
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:43,440
really hard time. And after I mean years

2987
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,800
of knowing him, one day he broke down my

2988
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,960
office and shared that he'd actually

2989
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,719
been molested as a young kid. And so

2990
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,000
sometimes there is that like that thing

2991
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,080
that people have never felt like they

2992
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,920
could share with anyone that really is

2993
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,920
at the root of so much of what they've

2994
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,679
been dealing with. And like the person

2995
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,440
who whispered to you, I think the pain

2996
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,040
of keeping that inside. Not only the

2997
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,040
trauma of experiencing that as a child,

2998
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,280
but then holding that secret and feeling

2999
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:07,920
like you somehow are damaged or you know

3000
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:10,159
that this this thing inside you is there

3001
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,400
and not being able to heal it, talk

3002
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:14,639
about it, share it with people. I think

3003
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:16,320
um is just this like this well of pain

3004
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,320
that lives inside people. Did he

3005
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:22,960
recover? He actually passed away

3006
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:24,960
from substance abuse. From substance

3007
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,719
use. Yeah.

3008
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,199
You must carry a lot of this stuff with

3009
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,719
you because your line of work sounds

3010
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:34,320
like you're dealing with bad news quite

3011
01:35:31,719 --> 01:35:36,080
often, more so than the average person.

3012
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,120
And the news you're dealing with is is a

3013
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,840
different type of news. You're dealing

3014
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,840
with somebody sort of reaching the end

3015
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,320
of their life um through something that

3016
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,800
you also have said many times you

3017
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,280
believe is preventable in many cases.

3018
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:51,920
How do

3019
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:54,080
you how do you manage that? Yeah, I mean

3020
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,239
I think a couple things. one um there

3021
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:58,239
are so many stories of hope that I think

3022
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:00,159
um counterbalance that for me. So I

3023
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:02,080
think you know the other stories in my

3024
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,920
mind are you know I carry with me and

3025
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,120
still care for and are in touch with

3026
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,600
people who are living these amazing

3027
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,120
vibrant lives in recovery and in the US

3028
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,719
alone there's 24 million people living

3029
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,280
in recovery. So there are these stories

3030
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:15,600
of people who have overcome just trauma,

3031
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,199
tragedy, hardship and are doing awesome.

3032
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,400
They're parenting, they're working. You

3033
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:20,159
probably don't even know they're around

3034
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,600
you. you know, they don't tell people

3035
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:23,440
necessarily that they're in recovery.

3036
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,239
And getting to be sort of a part of that

3037
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,760
process with someone and watching, you

3038
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,920
know, there's nothing in medicine where

3039
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,679
I can actually see as dramatic of a

3040
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,280
change as with addiction, where someone

3041
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,560
can be, you know, at a moment where

3042
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,639
they're dealing with all of these health

3043
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,960
consequences and relationship challenges

3044
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,320
and then they get better and it's just

3045
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,600
like the most beautiful thing to be a

3046
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:44,159
part of. And so, I think the hope from

3047
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,159
that, the sort of positivity of it is

3048
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:47,600
what keeps me going every day. Obviously

3049
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:49,679
finding ways to care for myself through

3050
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,840
that and family and connection,

3051
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,360
exercise. I run, I write, you know, you

3052
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,360
gota you have to keep yourself whole

3053
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,920
through it all, too. But I think I get I

3054
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,199
get tremendous purpose and mostly like a

3055
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,880
lot of hope from working with people and

3056
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,920
seeing them recover. What is the most

3057
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,400
important thing we didn't talk about

3058
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,159
that we should have talked about?

3059
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,000
I think one thing is language. It's like

3060
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:09,440
this subtle thing. I sort of mentioned

3061
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,800
an example where you did it really well

3062
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,159
where instead of saying someone failed

3063
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,159
treatment, you said the treatment failed

3064
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:16,639
them. But a lot of the language that we

3065
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:18,880
use with addiction actually subtly and

3066
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,400
not so subtly worsen stigma. And

3067
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,679
sometimes this sounds like I'm being

3068
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,119
politically correct or it's like an

3069
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,800
issue of semantics, but there's actually

3070
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:26,000
really good data on this. So if you

3071
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,400
think about words we use for addiction,

3072
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,560
one is substance abuse, right? So the

3073
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,920
term abuse, what does abuse refer to? So

3074
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,560
it actually comes from an old English

3075
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,520
word that means like a willful act of

3076
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,520
misconduct. And it's a word that we use

3077
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,360
for child abuse, for sexual abuse, for

3078
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:42,239
domestic abuse. like it's only for these

3079
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:43,600
like terribly violent acts of commission

3080
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:45,199
that are very stigmatized because

3081
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,159
they're like terrible things. And yet we

3082
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,520
use it for this thing that we're saying

3083
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:49,159
as a health condition that you're like a

3084
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,040
substance abuser or you have substance

3085
01:37:49,159 --> 01:37:53,040
abuse. And so there have actually been

3086
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,719
these elegant studies that took like PhD

3087
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,239
level psychologists, really highly

3088
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,239
trained clinicians, and they described a

3089
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:59,679
person as either a substance abuser or

3090
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,679
as a person with a substance use

3091
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,199
disorder. And the clinician was actually

3092
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,800
more likely to recommend a punitive

3093
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:06,880
intervention for the person described as

3094
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,880
a substance abuser. What does that mean?

3095
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,400
So in this case, they were given like an

3096
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,320
option. You read this paragraph about a

3097
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,280
p about like a fictional patient and

3098
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,639
they don't really know what the

3099
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,159
researchers are testing and they're

3100
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,159
given a bunch of different options for

3101
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:20,080
intervention and one is this like send

3102
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:22,080
them to drug court or send them to jail.

3103
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:24,080
One is like offer them, you know,

3104
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,679
outpatient effective treatment. There's

3105
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:27,040
a bunch of different choices. When they

3106
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,560
hear someone described as a substance

3107
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,760
abuser, they're actually more likely to

3108
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,280
recommend the like jailbased

3109
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,920
intervention.

3110
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,440
So words actually like very in they

3111
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,880
influence how we think even how we make

3112
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,239
clinical decisions. They've also done

3113
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,400
this to the public. So if you describe

3114
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:41,840
someone as a drug addict the public has

3115
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,080
a more negative view of them than if you

3116
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,960
describe them as a person with

3117
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:46,400
addiction. So there are these subtle

3118
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,000
ways there's been this shift in

3119
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,080
addiction to really using what we call

3120
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,159
person first language which has been

3121
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,679
true across medicine. So like we used to

3122
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,280
use terrible words like we'd refer to

3123
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,280
someone as like the schizophrenic you

3124
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,960
know or really labeling them as their

3125
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,400
health condition. And thankfully there's

3126
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,840
been a change from that to realize that

3127
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,600
people are people first who have an

3128
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,440
illness or not defined by it. So I would

3129
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,520
never say like I'm going to go see the

3130
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,199
lung cancer in room 204. I'd say I'm

3131
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,800
going to see you know Mr. Smith who has

3132
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:12,320
lung cancer. And so with addiction too

3133
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,000
like people are more than that. So to

3134
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,920
say you know person with addiction

3135
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,960
person alcohol use disorder rather than

3136
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,960
saying they're an addict or an

3137
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,880
alcoholic. And then even terms like

3138
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,639
clean and dirty which are commonly used

3139
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,080
when we talk about addiction. So you

3140
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:25,119
know take the word clean. It sounds

3141
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,800
really positive. Like you're saying,

3142
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,320
"Oh, you're clean." But like what are

3143
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,920
you really saying? So you're saying

3144
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,679
like, "If you're clean now, when you

3145
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,239
were actively struggling, what were you?

3146
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,440
You were dirty." And so I always

3147
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:37,280
remember an example, a friend of mine

3148
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:39,360
who's in recovery was interviewing for

3149
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,800
jobs in the recovery space. And so

3150
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,239
people on the on the interview trail

3151
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,520
would say to him like, "How long have

3152
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,880
you been clean for?" And he would say,

3153
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,480
"Well, I've been bathing since I was a

3154
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,880
newborn. So I've been clean my whole

3155
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,719
life and I've been in recovery for five

3156
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,400
years or whatever." So, I think these

3157
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,800
little things actually matter that we

3158
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,920
should use terminology that we'd use for

3159
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,520
another health condition. If we're

3160
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,520
labeling, you know, people with active

3161
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,040
addiction as dirty or, you know, people

3162
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,199
with addiction is the same as child

3163
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,960
abusers with that sort of language, um,

3164
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,560
we're really sort of subtly increasing

3165
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,400
stigma. So, that's a small thing that we

3166
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,320
can all do is just try to use language

3167
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,840
that's a bit bit more humanizing. It's

3168
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,600
so interesting because I was aware of

3169
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,600
this, but I still found myself

3170
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,639
accidentally using the word abuse. Yeah.

3171
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:20,800
And I' I'd stumble into it. Go [ __ ]

3172
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:23,360
um I try to avoid the use of the word

3173
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,880
addict. Yeah, it's hard to change, but

3174
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,800
you know, like everything you just want

3175
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:28,159
to be humble, curious, and keep trying.

3176
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,520
I mean, there's lots of language that

3177
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:32,239
we've changed. Like, think about so many

3178
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,600
terms we use for, you know, for you

3179
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:35,520
know, people who are born with different

3180
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,920
abilities or for people of different

3181
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,520
races or other identities that were

3182
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,719
really stigmatizing and we've like

3183
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,239
learned to use different language even

3184
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,840
if it feels a little awkward when you're

3185
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,520
first learning it. I think understanding

3186
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,600
the science and the data behind the

3187
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,280
impact it has to use certain language I

3188
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,400
think is really useful. Yeah. Because

3189
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,360
that's helped me to understand just

3190
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,560
because now I understand the first

3191
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,040
principles of it. I need to make sure I

3192
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,600
describe people as a person first. So a

3193
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,040
person with addiction addiction is much

3194
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,040
better than calling someone an addict.

3195
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,560
Yep. Exactly. And one thing people ask

3196
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,239
me will say well what if someone refers

3197
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,880
to themselves that way because people

3198
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:08,159
may do that and that's I'm that's fine.

3199
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,400
People can use whatever language they

3200
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:11,920
want for themselves. But I think as a

3201
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,840
health care professional for sure or

3202
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,360
someone who's trying to help combat

3203
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,560
stigma, like we can choose to use

3204
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,239
different language. And I've actually

3205
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,920
had patients sort of ask me like, well,

3206
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,440
why do you use that terminology when

3207
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,040
they use a different language? And it

3208
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,800
actually can be sort of empowering to be

3209
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,880
like, oh yeah, I'm actually a person in

3210
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,400
recovery or I'm a person with addiction.

3211
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,080
I'm not going to label myself that way

3212
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,360
anymore.

3213
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,719
Something I've been really um curious

3214
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,800
about just in my life generally because

3215
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,840
in conversation, I'll often I said

3216
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,239
something yesterday when we were at

3217
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,679
dinner with with the team here. I said,

3218
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:42,639
I can't remember the exact phrase, but

3219
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,639
it was words to the effect

3220
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:48,360
of I'm not good at that or I'm not that

3221
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:52,239
type of person or I'm

3222
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:53,600
not organized. And I stopped myself and

3223
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,239
the team will remember and I go actually

3224
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:59,679
I shouldn't say that. I should say right

3225
01:41:56,239 --> 01:42:01,199
now uh was you're like defining yourself

3226
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,400
as incapable of doing something instead

3227
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:04,320
of being like I'm working on

3228
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,600
organization right now. I think it's so

3229
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:08,320
important and we don't think about it

3230
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,920
how casually we create an identity for

3231
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,159
oursel that is like fundamentally

3232
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,480
limiting or puts us in a box or frames

3233
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:15,920
us having a deficit or captures our

3234
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,320
whole identity and some kind of

3235
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,719
deficiency we have often in the case of

3236
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,080
the habits I'm referring to does this a

3237
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,159
similar thing take effect when we're

3238
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:25,520
talking about calling someone an addict

3239
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:27,280
yeah you're sort of labeling them as

3240
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,440
that is the only thing that they are and

3241
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,880
that they will be that forever and you

3242
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,800
know um a friend of mine who's a

3243
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,480
journalist who is in recovery and writes

3244
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,239
a lot about addiction. My Solivitz wrote

3245
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,840
this great New York Times piece that

3246
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:39,199
addiction doesn't always last a lifetime

3247
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,560
because I think there's this idea in our

3248
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,239
head that like you know people with

3249
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,199
addiction will always have addiction and

3250
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,639
it's this like incurable thing and that

3251
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:48,639
actually people have lots of different

3252
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:50,239
journeys and for some people you know

3253
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,920
that becomes something they deal with

3254
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:52,960
and then they move on their lives. For

3255
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,360
other people it's something that they

3256
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,040
actively manage. But this idea that you

3257
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,800
sort of boil things down to like the

3258
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,199
only thing I am in this world as a

3259
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,920
person with addiction, um, you really

3260
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:05,360
limit everything else about

3261
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,719
yourself. We have a closing tradition on

3262
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,000
this podcast where the last guest leaves

3263
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:09,679
a question for the next, not knowing who

3264
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,440
they're going to be leaving it for. And

3265
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:17,320
the question that's been left for you

3266
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:21,000
is, if you could redo or revise one

3267
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:23,040
thing that you have successfully

3268
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,199
accomplished, what would that be and

3269
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:28,880
why?

3270
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:31,040
I guess I would say, and I could think

3271
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,480
of lots of successful accomplishments

3272
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,719
I'd apply this to, but I'll take the

3273
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,800
example of medical training, which is a

3274
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:38,800
successful accomplishment. I think I

3275
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,639
would be more present that we are always

3276
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,880
like rushing to the accomplishment to

3277
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:46,000
the finish line to sort of getting to

3278
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,080
the next goal and I think back and wish

3279
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,960
I had realized what an amazing journey

3280
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:52,560
it was in that moment and I mean even

3281
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,840
things with medical training that I was

3282
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,440
I was never going to be a heart surgeon

3283
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,239
but to stand in an operating room and

3284
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,080
look inside someone's chest and watch a

3285
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:01,679
beating heart is an experience that I'll

3286
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:03,119
never get again and I think in this

3287
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,800
journey to always achieve and move

3288
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,719
forward and get to the next exam and the

3289
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,159
next thing we sometimes miss like the

3290
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,480
miracle that's right in front of us. And

3291
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:12,960
so I think I would have um been even

3292
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:15,520
more present.

3293
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:19,000
That applies to all of us. I felt like I

3294
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,000
was being called out.

3295
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:24,239
True for parenting, true for everything.

3296
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,360
Thank you so much. I'm so grateful for

3297
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,760
the work that you're doing because

3298
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:29,679
there's so much there's so much um

3299
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,280
conflicting information, especially as

3300
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:33,280
it relates to alcohol. There's been so

3301
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,600
much information over the last 5 10

3302
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,199
years about um the impact alcohol has on

3303
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,679
us. And I've sat here and and had

3304
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:42,000
conversations with people who are pretty

3305
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:44,239
convinced that even, you know, moderate

3306
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,159
levels of alcohol are good for us. And

3307
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,320
having read your work, I'm now clear on

3308
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:49,920
what the truth there is. Um thank you

3309
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,119
for doing what you do. It's incredibly

3310
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,639
important. And I actually think it's

3311
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:54,960
going to become increasingly important

3312
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,560
unfortunately because the way that the

3313
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,040
world is heading, the loneliness

3314
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:01,199
epidemic that we're experiencing and um

3315
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:04,239
the the access we now have to digital

3316
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:06,239
devices and to um lowcost consumption of

3317
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:08,239
addictive substances is is terrifying

3318
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:09,679
for me. I know you've got a book on the

3319
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:11,600
way which I'm extremely excited about

3320
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:14,000
which is due in autumn, next autumn.

3321
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,280
Spring of 27. So we have Okay. And

3322
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
what's that book about? Can you give me

3323
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,520
a give me a clue? I mean, I could gasp.

3324
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,080
It is going to be about changing the

3325
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,000
narrative around addiction and um about

3326
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:26,000
really reframing how people think about

3327
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
it to see it as a treatable good

3328
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,520
prognosis illness and using some of the

3329
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,840
stories of people I've had the privilege

3330
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,360
of knowing to hopefully help people see

3331
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,119
things in a different way. Where do

3332
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,600
people find you if they want to reach

3333
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:40,480
out or learn more? Yes. Um they can find

3334
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:43,440
me on LinkedIn, on Instagram, they can

3335
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,960
email me. Um yeah, happy to connect and

3336
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,800
would love to come back after the book

3337
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,719
is out too. I look forward to that. I'd

3338
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,480
love to. So, your Instagram, your

3339
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,600
LinkedIn, I'll put those details below.

3340
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,679
I'm sure you'll probably get a lot of

3341
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:56,880
messages. Great. Um because these issues

3342
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:58,880
in particular are incredibly um

3343
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,719
incredibly potent issues in people's

3344
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,239
lives and um very emotional issues as

3345
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,119
well. So, thank you for on behalf of all

3346
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,639
my audience, thank you for your

3347
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:06,159
generosity today, but also thank you for

3348
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,760
your wisdom. Really, really appreciated

3349
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:09,440
and I would love to speak to you again

3350
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:13,159
soon when the book is out. Thank you.

3351
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:13,159
Thank you for having me.

3352
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:17,440
This has always blown my mind a little

3353
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,600
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

3354
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,440
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

3355
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,560
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?

3356
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,000
If you like the show and you like what

3357
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,679
we do here and you want to support us,

3358
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,520
the free simple way that you can do just

3359
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,199
that is by hitting the subscribe button.

3360
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,719
And my commitment to you is if you do
