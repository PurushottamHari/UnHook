00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,260
[Music]

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,280
All right. So, today was Apple's big

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,440
software event for 2025, WWDC. And it

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
was a really, it was actually a really

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,320
interesting one. I was kind of wondering

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
how this would go cuz in this landscape

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,240
of AI, AI, AI, everyone's talking about

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,119
Gemini and GPT everywhere where it feels

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,880
like Apple is being left behind. They

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
could kind of go one of two ways. They

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,880
could either double down on Apple

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,480
intelligence and just lean right in like

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,680
everything's fine, everything's going to

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,440
plan, or they could shelf some of that

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,960
stuff, but show a whole bunch of other

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,640
stuff and hope that that's good enough.

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
So, now we've seen the keynote and I've

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
gotten to try a lot of these software

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
features and think about them a lot. And

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
they definitely did the second thing.

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
Don't get me wrong, there's much more

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
other stuff than AI versus what like

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,280
Google was doing earlier. But I do think

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,719
that that other stuff was actually kind

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
of a lot. And so maybe you can leave a

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
comment below if you agree with me after

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
you subscribe, of course. But this is

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,399
everything you need to know about WWDC

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,320
2025. So first of all, they always talk

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
about all of their OSS, all their

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,119
platforms this year, and they are now

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
all unified in their version number just

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,640
to keep it simple. So instead of having

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:20,240
iOS 19, iPad OS 19, tvOS 19, Mac OS 16,

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,560
Watch OS 12, and Vision OS 3, they're

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,840
now just doing version 26 for

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
everything. kind of the same thing

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
Samsung just did with their phones in

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,080
2020. How they match the year even

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,640
though it's a year ahead. Cool. Easy.

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,680
And everything is getting this fresh

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,600
glassy coat of paint over everything to

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
be unified as well. So, it's more

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
obvious in some places that I'll show

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,920
you and less noticeable in some others,

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
but in general, they're calling this

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
liquid glass. And they're treating

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,640
basically every window, every dialogue

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,840
box, every icon, every sidebar that they

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,240
possibly can as like a piece of physical

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,920
glass that's mostly transparent to the

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,159
things below it. Even the lock screen

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,240
clock and some text, some fonts are

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
clear and transparent. So, we might as

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,600
well start here with iOS 26 because this

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,599
is the biggest one. All of the icons are

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,920
slightly updated. The lock screen clock

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,160
is just this big glassy clear time that

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
adapts to the size of what's behind it.

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Once you unlock the iPhone, overall like

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
zoomed out, it doesn't look that

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,120
different. It's slightly different, but

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,879
they also kept showing this clear home

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,720
screen setup where all of the widgets

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,800
and icons are all clear. This is a new

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,440
option. And I don't know about this one.

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
I mean, it is new and you can do that if

68
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
you want to or never turn it on if you

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
don't want to. But I just think that's a

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
it's a little much and readability might

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
be kind of tough. But beyond the liquid

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
glass thing, there are also some new

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,280
features like they redesigned the camera

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
app really for the first time in a

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,879
decade plus. It's now going to be super

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
simplified to just photo and video

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,840
buttons and the shutter. And then

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,280
there's a whole bunch of hidden UI. So

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
you have to swipe to reveal the

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
additional modes. And those still work

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
the way they did before. But then also

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
the frames per second and resolution

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
settings are also super hidden. you have

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
to know to hit that little button up

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,040
there in the corner to change to 30 or

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
60 fps, which is a really interesting

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
choice there. I mean, especially on an

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
iPhone where you kind of have to assume

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
Apple knows which things people click

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
most of the time. This kind of implies

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,959
that nobody ever changes a lot of these

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,360
things. The swipe up to reveal a lot of

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
those settings. Most people will never

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
see that. But hey, you're watching this

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,879
video, so now you know that the live

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,599
photos setting toggle is there under

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,080
that swipe. So, good for you. There's

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,840
also uh a new FaceTime app with a new

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
landing page to quickly hit up your main

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,959
contacts. And then also the phone app is

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
updated to bring voicemail and miss

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
calls and contacts all into one unified

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
place. Kind of like that. And they've

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,519
also matched or copied. You could say it

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
however you want. Matched or copied. But

106
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
they've matched two of my favorite Pixel

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159
features from the dialer from the phone

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,519
app, which is call screening and hold

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
for me. Those are the Pixel feature

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
names. So now in iOS 26, there's a

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
feature that can automatically screen

112
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
unknown numbers and it'll answer the

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,560
call for you and then transcribe

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
whatever the person says before trying

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
to ring you and showing you who's

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
calling, which is interesting because

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,320
the Pixel would let me choose that for

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
every single call manually. But then

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,919
also the hold assist feature is a

120
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,280
no-brainer. Just waits on hold for you

121
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,800
while you do other things and when it's

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
time to come back, it rings you again.

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
Both super useful. And there's also a

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,880
couple iMessage features like you can do

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
native polls inside of iMessage. Now,

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
typing indicators and group chats will

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
show you which person is typing, which

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
is sweet. And you can add pictures as

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
backgrounds for each of your iMessage

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
chats. None of this is groundbreaking or

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,680
unheard of, but it is nice that they're

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
finally adding it. And then I would say

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,320
the most AI focused thing here is

134
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,160
translate. And I I feel like there's

135
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
like a storm of like a video idea

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
brewing where I might have to make an

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,759
entire essay about how this is the year

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
of live translation. It's just happening

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,919
all at once now. Uh but yeah, in short,

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,639
Apple added live translation to

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,880
FaceTime, to messages, and the phone

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,600
app. And it it works basically as you'd

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,600
expect with the ondevice AI models. If

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
you turn it on during a phone call, you

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
can hear a person speak in their own

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
language, and then it gets translated

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
and read in your language. And then if

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
you want to speak back, it gets

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
translated again and read back in

150
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,240
another voice to that person. It's a

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
little laggy, but it gets the job done.

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
There's also a little bit more stuff in

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,720
maps and in Apple Music and a new games

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,880
app. Uh I plan on breaking all of this

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
down in a dedicated best new features of

156
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
iOS video. Definitely get subscribed if

157
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
you want to see that right when it comes

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
out. I always do this when the public

159
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,080
beta rolls around. So that's coming

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
soon. But my main concern from seeing

161
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,479
Apple's demo videos and playing with it

162
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,880
a little bit myself is readability. this

163
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,320
glass aesthetic. It looks cool

164
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,479
sometimes, but it also is a little hard

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,199
to read sometimes. Like, I get that the

166
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,039
clear and glassy sheen is very modern

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
and it looks like Vision OS and it's

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,759
fresh, but also there's a reason that we

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
add backgrounds to things in the video

170
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
world a lot, even if it's subtle,

171
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,000
because it's to provide more contrast to

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
make things easier to see. Just basic

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,080
stuff. and there were so many bits of

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,360
text like notifications or menus or even

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
UI elements that just looked kind of

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
harder to read. Now, the OS is supposed

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
to adapt to it by giving light things

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
dark backgrounds and dark things light

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
backgrounds, but sometimes you'll have

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,720
like a half light half dark background

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
and that's where things get weird. So,

182
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm curious how this is going to play

183
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,319
out. Now, some of the other smaller

184
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
updates, Watch OS 26 also got a lot of

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,400
these glassy UI elements, and it's

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,960
noticeable. There's big touch areas and

187
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
reflections and glassy buttons galore.

188
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
And you can also definitely feel that

189
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
fresh coat of paint. But beyond that, I

190
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,000
really like the new wrist flick gesture,

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,160
which is just that. So, if you ever get

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
a notification and you don't want to do

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,039
anything with it, you know how it just

194
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,599
kind of sits on the watch for a while,

195
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
you can just flip it and it goes away.

196
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,800
So, if you're getting a notification,

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
you don't care, flip it. you're getting

198
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
a phone call, you don't want to accept

199
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,599
the phone call, dismiss it. If you got

200
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
an alarm that's starting to ring or

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
anything else like that you don't want

202
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,639
to be on your screen, just flip your

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,160
wrist and it goes away. I think I'll be

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,880
doing this all the time. And the other

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,840
big thing is this uh workout buddy,

206
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,360
which feels I'm going to describe it as

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,759
Spotify DJ but for Apple Watch workouts.

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,800
Like it's basically a new customizable

209
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,560
high energy voice that talks to you at

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
various times that it thinks you need

211
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,479
some energy or motivation during your

212
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
workout just by telling you stuff like

213
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,080
random stats like your heart rate or

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
your mile splits or hey this is your

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,120
third workout of the week. Great job.

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,599
Keep it up. Stuff like that. Uh still no

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,440
group fitness challenges though. I'm

218
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,960
going to just keep saying that every

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,319
year because every year I think they're

220
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
going to do it and every year they don't

221
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,800
do it. Still no group fitness

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
challenges. But then there was tvOS 26.

223
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,319
That also got new liquid glass. And I'll

224
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,000
be honest with this one. I barely notice

225
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,800
it here. But apparently the icons are

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,960
shimmering a little differently

227
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,039
allegedly. Uh but also just more content

228
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,520
obviously. Otherwise, not a huge upgrade

229
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,120
there. But then there's Mac OS 26, which

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,879
is also called Tahoe. And this one,

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah, this one you notice this one's got

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,160
way more very clear elements to it. And

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,879
some of it kind of can look cool. Others

234
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
I really don't like as much personally.

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
And I I thought this again about some

236
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,159
older versions of Mac OS, so I'm sure

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,839
we'll get used to it, but like the

238
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,839
control center with the super

239
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,760
glassified feels a little more cartoony

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
buttons. I'm just not a huge fan of

241
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,120
that. You can also do clear widgets,

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
clear dock, and the menu bar is

243
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
completely clear at the top, which is

244
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
also sweet. Makes your screen feel

245
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
bigger. And so, yeah, there's there's

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,760
some stuff to get used to here. I think

247
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
I like some of it. It's just not totally

248
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,120
like winning me over yet. One really

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,800
good feature now though is live

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
activities, which is already a nice

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
thing on the iPhone. If you have an

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
iPhone and a Mac, it'll show up in the

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
little menu bar in the Mac when

254
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,080
something is like happening, a delivery

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,440
or a flight information, whatever it is,

256
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
you can click on it and that'll view

257
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
that convenient information from the

258
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,839
live activity. And then if you want to

259
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,399
click on it again, you can bring up the

260
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
whole iPhone mirrored app to keep track

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,320
of that live activity. Makes a lot of

262
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
sense. Nice continuity feature. Anyway,

263
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
the Mac also gets the new phone app. So,

264
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
you know, your voicemail and everything

265
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,600
in one place and the hold for me, all

266
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,080
those features. But the number one

267
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,279
biggest update I'm interested in on the

268
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,240
Mac is actually the new Spotlight. Now,

269
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
some of you might not care about

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
Spotlight, but some of you are

271
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
productivity nerds like me because

272
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,760
you're subscribed to a tech YouTube

273
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
channel. And you might already know

274
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,600
about this, but my favorite productivity

275
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,680
app on the Mac, and it has been for

276
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,160
years. Every fresh new Mac, I install it

277
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,839
first, is called Raycast. And it's it's

278
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,320
basically Spotlight on steroids. It lets

279
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,880
you open apps, but also do shortcuts and

280
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,800
do window management and find files and

281
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
do even more useful things like viewing

282
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
my clipboard history. So now Apple comes

283
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,160
out and shows us the new spotlight in

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,279
Mac OS 26 and it does almost all of that

285
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,920
stuff. This is what we call in the

286
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,200
industry getting sherlocked. Basically,

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,880
Apple showed a whole bunch of really

288
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
cool stuff you can do now with the new

289
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,800
spotlight. It's got this sweet animation

290
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
which separates out things like file

291
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,320
searches or Siri shortcut searches. You

292
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
can do shortcuts from the keyboard to

293
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
open actions inside of certain apps and

294
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
perform them straight up entire strings

295
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
of commands without even opening an app

296
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,920
or touching your mouse. Real power user

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
stuff. Productivity nerd stuff right

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,440
here. It doesn't do fully every single

299
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,440
thing that I've done with Raycast. like

300
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,320
in Raycast I can tab over and and start

301
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
a new search or conversation with GPT or

302
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
Gemini or a bunch of other stuff. The

303
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,320
spotlight doesn't do that yet, but who's

304
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,800
to say if next year they might add that

305
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,720
feature or might slowly start doing all

306
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
the things that Raycast does. It's an

307
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,440
interesting step. It's definitely

308
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
better. But then, okay, Vision OS, this

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,399
is where all the glass came from. This

310
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,720
is technically only the third version of

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,000
Vision OS, but now it's Vision OS 26.

312
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,680
And there's some smaller updates to this

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,440
one, but I think the new widgets, even

314
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,079
though they're kind of silly and not

315
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
really that functional, I think they're

316
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,120
awesome. I think they're super cool.

317
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,680
Basically, you can pin these things to

318
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,399
persistent locations and customize the

319
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
size and depth and color of them exactly

320
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,160
how you want. So, they showed things

321
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,320
like clocks and weather widgets and

322
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,279
picture frames, but then they have these

323
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,519
like really convincing location pinning

324
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,480
plus all the reflectivity and depth that

325
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,640
they always have. And I just I don't

326
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
know. I thought it was super cool. I was

327
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
sold. But really, this is also pinned

328
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,800
with the fact that Vision OS or the

329
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Vision Pro will remember where you put

330
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
your Windows now all the time, like

331
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
through a reboot and everything, which

332
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
it didn't do before. It was one of my

333
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,560
biggest complaints I talked about in the

334
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,079
original Vision OS review. So, yes, it

335
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
will remember where you put your windows

336
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,880
and where you put your widgets. The

337
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,399
updated fidelity of the personas also,

338
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
uh, it was it's inevitable. Like, we

339
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
just knew they were going to continually

340
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,839
get more and more photorealistic, so

341
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
they showed another pretty big jump. Not

342
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
sure if you're going to have to do

343
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,240
another scan to get the updated Persona,

344
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,720
but either way, looks much better and

345
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
less cartoon ghosty. And there's also

346
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
they added PlayStation VR2 sense

347
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
controller support which no doubt will

348
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,200
be much better for some of the more

349
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
precise controls in certain games. Uh

350
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
there's also a new Jupiter environment.

351
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,600
So you're on one of Jupiter's moons with

352
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,320
Jupiter in the sky above you. Cool. They

353
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,440
also added native 360 video support

354
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,839
playback for cameras from GoPro, Insta

355
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,279
360, and Canon. It's pretty cool. We're

356
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,680
still hoping to see like more

357
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,839
highquality 360 content for these

358
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,440
headsets to view. There's some on

359
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,320
YouTube, but not a ton. But then the

360
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,560
biggest, most interesting update of the

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,959
day by far to me was iPad OS 26. This

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,000
was fascinating because, you know, every

363
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,519
iPad Pro video for the last 6 years or

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
however long it's been has always said

365
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
the same thing. It's great. It's amazing

366
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,920
hardware. It's very powerful, but it's

367
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
still an iPad. Meaning, it's still going

368
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
to have lots of limitations. And we

369
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,519
never really expect Apple to add those

370
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,519
really computer-like extra features

371
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,639
because they make computers, too. Why?

372
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,000
They're a business. They're not going to

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,600
cannibalize their own products. They're

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,040
not going to overlap that stuff. So,

375
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,800
there's iPads and then there's

376
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,399
computers. But with this update, I feel

377
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,000
like they they they use the word game

378
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,959
changer, which they use that word all

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
the time. But I actually feel like this

380
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:42,040
genuinely fit the bill because they

381
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,639
added things multitasking, file

382
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,720
management, things straight from the

383
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,800
Mac. So, yes, it still has the liquid

384
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,519
glass, of course. It has the new phone

385
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,320
app, the new lock screen, all the new

386
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
icons and widgets and all that, but then

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,279
this whole new multitasking and

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,959
multi-wind system where in any app, you

389
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,880
can just grab that handle in the bottom

390
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,320
right corner and shrink it in and make

391
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,320
the app whatever size you want

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
immediately to a floating window. And

393
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
then you can just start stacking

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
floating windows and and putting them

395
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
side by side and messing around with

396
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
window management very very freely. I'm

397
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
sure there's a limit to how many windows

398
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
you can have open. I got as many as four

399
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,279
open at the same time. But not only

400
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,519
that, they added this three dot window

401
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,040
control to the corner of each window,

402
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,519
the stop lightss that we have straight

403
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,000
from the Mac, so you can minimize or

404
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,440
change the shape of any app, just like

405
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,720
on a Mac. And on top of that, there's a

406
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,800
new literal Mac menu bar at the top of

407
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,360
the screen just giving you file, edit,

408
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
view, menu, help, just stuff that you

409
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,399
see in Mac apps. There's also a

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
redesigned cursor that seems a lot more

411
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,000
like a Mac cursor. It's less of a

412
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
floating blob that had like the aim

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,639
assist that we had before. Now it's just

414
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,000
a normal mouse. There's also a new files

415
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
app that lets you sort through things

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
with different ways, the same way you

417
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
would with the Finder app on a Mac.

418
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
There's now like you can have downloads

419
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,199
in your doc. There's all kinds of things

420
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,079
that I mean as someone who's used a Mac

421
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,600
for years.

422
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,920
Uh feels exactly like a Mac. There is

423
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,320
even an audio input selector built in

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
now for all media apps, which sounds

425
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
like such a small thing, but do you know

426
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,839
how hard it's been to change your

427
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,440
microphone input source on an iPad for

428
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,920
all these years? It's like they're

429
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,760
they're choosing now to add it. Great.

430
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,000
Also, background activities. So, if

431
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,720
you're exporting something from Final

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,440
Cut Pro for iPad, you can close the

433
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,959
Final Cut Pro app and do other things

434
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,160
and the export will continue in the

435
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,600
background just like a computer. So,

436
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,000
yeah, as a computer user, I'm

437
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
fascinated. This moves the iPad,

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
especially like the most powerful iPad

439
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,839
Pro, way further on the spectrum of

440
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,360
compelling laptop alternatives for

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
certain people. It certainly doesn't do

442
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800
everything. Obviously, it still doesn't

443
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
have multiple profile support. There are

444
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
some basics that we're still going to be

445
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
missing, but I never thought that they

446
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,800
would go this far. And it definitely

447
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
feels like in lie of some other AI

448
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,920
stuff, they took a lot of wishlist

449
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
things that people have been talking

450
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,040
about with the iPads and gave them to

451
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
us. But speaking of that, I mean, the

452
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,320
real question is, were all of those

453
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,480
features enough to, you know, tide us

454
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
over, to distract us from the lack of AI

455
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
stuff? I looked at the transcript and if

456
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,560
if the transcript that I have is

457
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,480
accurate, they said the word

458
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,399
Siri times in that entire 90minute

459
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,399
keynote. So that clearly wasn't a big

460
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,759
focus. And to me, it just feels like

461
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,959
Apple's AI strength, if they have one,

462
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,320
is really much more in how well

463
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,639
integrated their features are. It's not

464
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
going to be how good the AI is. It's

465
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
just how plugged in they are to their

466
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,320
ecosystem. Like a lot of features they

467
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,320
showed us do use AI, but they aren't

468
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,880
necessarily branded as AI or Apple

469
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
intelligence all the time. And then also

470
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,480
some of this Apple intelligence stuff is

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
slowly taking steps forward, including

472
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,320
them making their own foundational

473
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,279
models available for developers to have

474
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,520
access to those ondevice models and

475
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,959
build more AI features into their apps.

476
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Now, are those going to be the best

477
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,760
models in the world? No, probably not.

478
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,000
At least not right now. but they are on

479
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
device and local and can be used offline

480
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,559
and will probably be the fastest since

481
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,919
they don't have to go to the internet

482
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,160
and back. So, you can probably expect

483
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
many more apps to have little AI

484
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,839
features built into them, whether it's

485
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
just summarizations here and there or

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,480
shortening things that were longer,

487
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,440
things like that. Now, as for the big

488
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,440
LLM Siri upgrade that we kind of in the

489
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,039
background knew was taking too long,

490
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,160
they had a statement at the very

491
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,840
beginning of the keynote. If you

492
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,559
blinked, you might have missed it, but

493
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,520
the statement was, "This work required

494
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,960
more time to reach our high quality bar,

495
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,360
and we look forward to sharing more

496
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,559
about it in the coming year,

497
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,400
2026." We'll see. I just like that they

498
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
added the onscreen capabilities for

499
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
visual intelligence. So, it was just

500
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
from the camera feed before, but now,

501
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,120
you know how every Android phone has

502
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,799
circle to search? Well, yeah. Now, with

503
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,360
screenshots, the iPhone's going to get

504
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,120
that, too. This was a fascinating WWDC.

505
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,520
I am very excited to dig into these

506
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
betas and see what's actually good,

507
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,559
what's new about them. Stay tuned for

508
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,360
those videos. But let me know in the

509
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
comments what you think. Thanks for

510
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,039
watching. Catch you guys in the next

511
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,039
one. Peace.
