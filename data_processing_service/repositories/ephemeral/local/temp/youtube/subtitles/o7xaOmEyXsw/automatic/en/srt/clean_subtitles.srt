This is another very very important 2025 Career Specific Podcasts. So I need 10 different I need to make this type of apps. I in life Never done coding. what about a year or two Will I be able to make my own apps later? made then You can if you are a creative person. If You Make even 30% of the effort this remaining 70% Of the effort will be made by the AI ​​itself. You will learn from this episode that AI idents How can you skill yourself in your own business? You can. for my eye is only as useful as The output is right as far as I can use it For. I don't actually care about which using the tool i i i i i i i i i i As long as the task is done. Strategy Joe Yes, that will have to be changed. We have to figure this out At which stage of the company do I have to do it? How can I incorporate that? They How aligned it is with my goal. So right now a Recently a study was done where 59% off was given Corporates that existed in India. Give Said that you know we are very bullish on AI And we have to adopt it. and the coding that There used to be skills, but that too is changing a lot Is. I feel like coding is even better It is a hard skill but now 12-13 year old kids Are you able to translate your thoughts In tools. Do you think that reality is sitting at home Even a 10 year old kid can design a great game will be able to do it. Possible? How long it will take? to learn this Architectural skills? If from the very heart Yes, it's not that much at all. Wow! those who Are you in your 20s, what's your advice? My The most practical advice you could learn is skills Well, you will get promotion. i just hope this The podcast reaches many people. The term is AI agents. this will happen in the next 2 years You will continue to listen to my own work In place. And you will also hear that your Coworkers around AI have lost their jobs Because of the agents. Now there would be AI agents What is? How the corporate world In, how to learn entrepreneurship You will learn this today which will be applicable in the world Through the podcast. Last time Dr. Nandani Seth told us about the basic skills of AI. I told you a lot. it was one of the Most loved episodes of the year. Because India's top data scientists and AI The expert is Dr. Nandini Seth. He IM has done PhD from Bangalore. So much All AI Experts of Indian YouTube Through teaching you about AI. But Dr. Nandini has been very professional All young entrepreneurs should know about AI Guidance has been given. that's why she is the Ideal guest for this topic. Your cuttings For cutting edge research and unique teaching style She has become famous herself. Through which India's It is training future tech leaders. She is a founding faculty member at the Masters Union School of Engineering Where many students are interested in data science And teaches practical aspects of AI Are. If you are in 12th standard and Your interest is computer science or data If you are into science then this episode will keep you going till the end Seeing is very important. Dr. Nandini's Belief This is how real talent gets opportunity It must be available. This is why a deriving Dr. is giving 1% scholarship to the students. Nandini Masters Union under 4 years Graduate Data Science and AI Programs In. Links are in the description below Below. Friends, read this entire podcast in Notebook And look with the pen. this is another very Variant 2025 Career Specific Podcast. [music] Nandini said, welcome back to TRS. thank you at this point i am sure that people have known that What is available out there. Real on us now Also talking about the world scenario It is necessary. We are a part of AI geopolitics Many parts have already been made. explain this How? Ah, this is one question. The second question is Related to Indian Government. Hmm What does the Indian Government want? A With Respect to AI. hmm hmm you can give What ever examples you see fit for adding to this narrative okay so first of all what you said that AI is a lot of geopolitics Right is becoming an important part in this We have large three key players America China India when it comes to AI is now available in the US So much of AI started from what was Completely Privately Laid On To Them There were a lot of resources. That is very much Looking at it from the perspective of economics Were. We discussed regulatory norms In the first go if there is less then this we Can't set barriers. and there But there is still a lot of AI driven research It is high. Right? He is a leader. Some of it we I can't deny it. In Generation As many foundational models emerged from America That many have not come from anywhere else. then cut to that china came which believes that they Want to be leaders by 2030 right they want that they have lot of manpower He should be trained in such a way that he can use AI can do it. They can have AI capabilities. 2300 universities to provide AI education For this, in the last few years, China has Already happened. If you look at the top 25 From that there are top 25 institutes in the world which Provide education in AI. you largely American and Chinese institutes only Will meet. unfortunately still there There is no Indian institute. When you A.I. You are using the word education, the output of That is perfect engineers, AI Architects Architects, AI Experts, ML Engineers, Data Scientists are largely this category of people. Ok. Right? These are all the new jobs. donation All the New Jobs. some which are slightly Older. Data Scientists and ML Engineers Used to exist. But yes now that is very Work more. give what give Doing first. so unfortunately he still Ekist does not. China's own the standard problems remain that there But the data is very centrally controlled Therefore privacy issues remain. butt there if you'll see if you'll see that even in America what talent is there that The AI ​​is working. AI is doing the jobs. That's largely Chinese so far. Now come on On India. Ok? in india Too much brain drain in engineering We have seen that happen. a lot of people Here is the smarter group, the creams and going up to the west so that he can stay there more lucrative more respectful can get jobs. where they think that There is core engineering. India wants to That we build that capability. India wants us to enter AI education Do it. But India's perspective is a little It is a bit different. Like you know that India has not developed its foundational model I have taken it out. There are some reasons why India Why couldn't I get it out or why not I have taken it out. But I think largely of India AI is that whiz in which we can make our people want to create AI for. We our's Want to create AI for the welfare of people Are. in which we want A.I. she is not very complex but she Our Larger Population Related Problems is able to solve it. so i think kisan Can you give some examples like GPT? And also tell me what is Kisan GPT? We are farmers GPT is still being developed. We don't have a full fledged one yet. But It is a generalized tool like Chat GPT So that the farmer can do the conversation Is. Now what will the farmer do with the conversation? They It may ask whether my Soil or I will be I am in the state, I am in this location. This is my pin code. According to this I What kind of crops should be grown? Me At what time should that crop be grown? How will the weather conditions be? tractor to me Needed I don't have. around me Who has it? I want to know that it rains Will it happen or not? because from that my Loss and profit will be decided. So let me know that Is. He can tell. also did all this All capabilities now Kisan GPT then It is also still in a very nascent stage. But We already have many more AI capabilities have been brought in PM Kisan Scheme whose Inside we are also monitoring how much The output is getting generated. The minimum guarantee that We provide you with the pricing that we offer The government gives it more power to determine this It is possible that the output is in this state This much came out from it. The rest went to that state Some has been consumed locally, how much remains? right, is what is left bad? It is not happening, is it going to the right place or if I am not going then these things or else Many of our financial The dispersion which happens of our public funds when we distribute those which are ours to them Let's do it in Kisan scheme or In any other schemes, we would not see AI there. To check if you are using it too much To ensure there is no fraudulent transaction Is happening. What used to happen sometimes was that some people Those who were diseased or people with duplicate Aadhaar You would have got it made and taken your subsidy through it Were. They used to take their incentives through him And those who wanted it didn't get it I could find it. So there's a lot of AI in this right now. It has started being used to figure out Where is it not being used? Where But someone has done wrong. It could be the same one Aadhaar transactions are happening in two cities Is. How is that possible? There could be one Six people are taking the same subsidy at the address. How are they able to take it? All this tracking Now we are able to do this also through Aadhar. So India is building largely towards that. Right now we are more concerned about social welfare We are building towards this. But we We want to build in education as well. Starting any foundation in India Don’t want to spend money. $ million was spent When Chat GPT was created for the first time Was. Nobody in India has that much money I want to invest in this thing. Ok? Seconds We don't have this thing in Indian context The data is not in English and is centralized It doesn't happen. A lot of our data is local language and is non-digital data. So it is that much more difficult to train on it The model goes to learn something from it and moves on I can talk usefully. and the third thing is that we My GPU doesn't have that much space. It is very fragmented. Not many such hubs Is. if you look at america and china They have their own hubs in which they sell stores Can do it. Can do everything. India doesn't have it. to india foundational Trying very little not to make models And there is no investor funding in it either. But there are a lot of use cases. We are one Viewed from a human perspective, every Every person has a dream of his own. Hmm. And Every person has to earn money for his family wants. How will he make money now? They will earn money which depends on their own skill sets, level of ambition, level of effort, Life Story etc. We are the starting point. Yes. Is this starting point completely The reason for the change is the element of AI From? We have a question, this is it. The second question is that lets categorize indians into different Career Possibilities. hmm lots of Indians are very interested in entrepreneurship All Indians want corporate jobs. And Like Creative Jobs But Not Entrepreneurship and Non Corporate So Ok let's start with entrepreneurship Are. ok and divide it into two parts We do. The first part is Entrepreneurs Who are already established. Assume that It is in the agricultural sector. Assume that It is in the financial sector. Assume that Is in the media sector. Hum Hum and the Second Categories that are actually AI related Want to start a business. we end and Those who want to start a business and There's an AI element to it, right? to bring Have to think. Ok? so let's break it down This Entrepreneurship Game First. Ok? So what you said about first category people Which are the people whose businesses are established in which I am assuming that their A goal is set for the organization that Bhaiya I have to optimize this. to me Or you have to bring more money. Me More social welfare has to be done. to me You have to do better than your competition. Anything Their goals are goals on an organizational level It is set. This is his strategy. now over here what could be the strategy that Change will have to be made because AI has arrived Because your competitors also know AI You might be adopting it. Ok? So we have this We have to figure out that in our industry What things are already happening in AI right now? Are. Even if it is not in our country It is happening, it is happening somewhere else. but which one Things are happening and am I that one team I can build inbuilt capability that can't? If I am Fairly Advance So I can probably do it inbuilt. I A team of 4 or 10 for yourself that will work on this which Will work on AI and data. But if I Even if I am not that advanced, can I be anyone I can hire a consultant at this The stages that will guide me on AI adoption that on which stage of the company am I or In which vertical of the company should I work now? There is an immediate requirement for AI, I will How can I incorporate those into my goals? How does that align with That Is My First? category of people my second category of People are people who are starting out on Entrepreneurship to Them I Say Go Wild Think about the wildest application that you can you think about it i won't say anything yet Think About Foundational Model Building Because As a new entrepreneur you want to perhaps dip your feet into something in which Too much initial investment There is no need. Creating Foundational Models The initial investment is very high. But If I'm creating use cases, like You said that by depositing ₹ 00 per month can I do that Can I create a use case? so much so that I am funding I can pick it up. I have an important problem by identifying if there is a good one for that What if we create an AI based tool or agent? I display it as my They say that my minimum viable product What did I do by creating a usable product? Can I raise funds or not? or the one in my first category Was the company a problem? Was I his problem? I can solve it and go and pitch it to him Should I tell you brother to acquire me or Give me the funds. You basically say that You are saying that there should definitely be a tech element It's needed in everyone's business. Correct. Now! There are two additional questions. a first one very Controversial question is from a careerist Perspective because I don't create a lot of debate online. Hmm. Ok? a something People say that this is the total work of coders Reduction is happening because the coding of AI Capabilities are expanding. hmm lots of There are coders who get offended From this. As far as I know, some AI By watching the podcast, let me explain that you Coders can probably never be replaced you will find it. But coders might turn into highly Skilled workers who will be able to output A lot more codes. With the help of AI. Off Course. This very sentence is controversial Is. means it created controversy in Social media. I am saying bye to you talk. it is a controversial statement then I want to break it down a little bit. Ok? So the capabilities you are talking about Yes, these are called copilots. so as if Microsoft's 365 which we use Let's do presentation and Excel and Word Documents that we have been using since ages A copilot has also come with him. Similarly, Python and all these languages in which codes are written along with these The copilots have arrived. Now to be a copilot This does not mean that he is a pilot himself. Being a copilot means that you You tell him what to do and he can do it Used to be. Sometimes you can make it a little technical you are telling it in language and sometimes you tell it to her Tell me in English what to do and he is giving you options for Do it like this, do it like this, do it like this. Now I I myself have been different for the last 15 years I have been coding in languages. So Initially I also had a little inhibition that hey I mean this was my hard skill which I I had been learning it for many years. So now His replacement is not coming in a way Is. But this is an observation here. Ok? So I think coding is even two It's a hard skill. it is equally a science as It is an art. now what do i mean by That? which is the syntax for how to code You have to write it in a way that there is no error in the code So, there is science. But how to design the code? want to do it? How will the code be optimized? What do I mean by that? Minimum memory Minimal memory utilization inside The code does what I want it to do. Or that code could also be written in 600 lines Is. But I got the same task done for Rs.300. This is what happens, it is art. Yes. Which one Do you want to fetch data? which variables to take Are? Like I'm very data science I am speaking the language here. But which one? Which variable is most important? His What is context? Its for business What does Pisces do? This is a lot of art. this this There is no science. So, he doesn't seem to me That the copilot can do right now. For that Coders Are Still Very Variant. Right? They Maybe I should call myself a coder They are undervaluing it. they should now think of themselves s code architects and code Desires. When I was in college, we used to I had to remember the syntax of ' because Google couldn't do it. They no longer have That requirement. They have to think that and How to do better things? So according to me What you said is that their output is very high It will increase. I think their output is also will increase but efficiency will also increase and Efficient codes that consume less memory Do it. particularly in the AI ​​space, okay I I am entrepreneurial. we are on my mind There are lots of software ideas. me 10 I want to make different types of apps. we i I have never done any coding in my life. On us I know that my propt Engineering skills are amazing. I am very I am a good communicator. and what I am able to Visualize I am able to put into the process And there are many people like me all over the world Those who do not know coding but prt Will you learn engineering after one year? I will be able to make my own apps, I can make them now yes why are there so many no's in one year code and low code app creation tools that you If you do proper engineering then you can You can learn those tools right so for it ExampleBubble.io is one of the tools that we also teach our students at masters Union Rights and You can learn them in 20 hours If you have the tools then you can talk about it for 10 years or 2 years I am talking about 20 hours You spend 20 hours today, you will get the app from Bablu. I will learn to make it but I don't know any code You don't need to know anything about coding I'm a no code app builder ok but what I'm going to need a CTO then If I turn it into a business There are many aspects of sea business Are. Right? Now only if you create an app You are doing it in which the features of the app are very Limited in which only App Lets it is being used because someone came Received some more information and he left Went. Then in that case you need CTO There is no need. You may also need to tweak that. Sometimes you read the app but for that you need a full No time limit is required. It is possible You may sometimes need to optimize its design. You don’t need full time for that. But Now this business has become bigger than Lets. Correct Is? Now a lot of people come to me On time. So I want to optimize that Bhaiya, are you able to handle so many people? Is it available or the app is not able to do it. I have to do the same tracking the data of all users and Their data has to be utilized. before that I would like to understand which data is being tracked Should I do it? After that, I want to understand that this What can I do using the data? I can make predictions. Am I a user Am I able to understand the behavior of? Can I do this I can understand that if I change the color of the app If we change it a little then the user behavior Has there been any change or not? It is possible In that app I then see advertisements I want to bring it. Then I got the CTO job. Definitely needed. Can you make games? Very basic games can be made. But What goes into making games is that a lot of has more visual elements That's why we need techs Because right now the games are very It has been advanced. She is on many layers Visuals are created. it's almost Right now we are starting to combine virtual reality have started. Augmented Reality Starting to integrate. So that one You need someone to make the design one who understands that it is necessary How should the movements be? then you game You can make a simple game but make it engaging to make it such that people Stay addicted and keep playing. which is the The purpose of let's say a company that is Operating in the gaming space. For that You definitely need techies. as much as I have done gaming, I know I can Conceptualize a Game That Can Be Great And addictive. I put Indian History I will give it in the game. I added different levels I will give it to you, I will add different weapons etc. But these are all ideas. how far are we from a reality where my ideas as a Content creators are an advanced level in a game Change it into a game. We It will be any form of gaming. Right? Is a layered structure. Ok? so you what can you do for existing games There are layers, let's say you have Indian Something needs to be set in the context and no It is a game whose existing layer is you. by lifting the virtual reality layer and placing it on top of the You can do modifications through an engineer Right in which you actually have to put in that much effort you won't have to do this because your base The foundation is completely ready. You just add You are getting news. You are saying that level up How it will happen. You are adding all this that who Weapons will come extra from GTA Do you know? Yes GTA6 is releasing now But I don't want to play GTA6 in Miami. Have to play in Mumbai. yes you can do it He is just a context player it is very easy for him to do that, It is not difficult, it means we are incorporated Story lines are not difficult to do Gaming is difficult to incorporate Bringing Nuance Into Design That Expresses These things should be correct, the movement should be clean They are important. Ok? For us It is important how you are feeling The person who is playing the game has the right to the person who is playing the game should want to continue to play the game and for that I can give only Mumbai context I am not enough, I can also do more things with her You should read what is contextually correct All those nudges have to be added slowly For which you need proper web designers Graphic designers and game designers needed but as far as you know by now an A.I. about do you think that reality is 15 Years away in the year 2040, sitting at home will make a 10 Even a one year old child can design a great game will get possible yes i will not say that it is not possible i think it is possible i think we are we getting younger and younger age Entrepreneurs definitely means we now 12-13 year olds express their thoughts Are you able to translate in tools or in games or So definitely there is a possibility. Ok This is why I'm highlighting the games because as many as I have on an even take Techie bros, they all believe that coding for games is much more difficult yes it is than any other form of coding because you Human psychology has to be kept in mind. it is it is it is a combination of many Many things. It's only what we say There is human psychology, that's why we One has to keep in mind why he plays Someone will be there for my game. one for her There should come a stage where a person who is no that is enough It is fun to watch him play the game going. But if it's a very easy game Even if you go, you will not feel like playing Of. So to figure out how much that will cost you Have to maintain pressure. Meaning how much resistance What should be the difficulty level He should continue doing it. You Story Lines were made, complexes were built, that's a good thing Is. Engaging with the Butt Complex is a must. it should not happen that he is over There may be a complex that people feel It is taking so long to understand the context Is. I don't even get a chance to play remained. So those things are very important Here. So that psychology side is very It is important here. So to Summarize what are you saying. Basically the truth is that Yes, if you have an idea for an app in your mind have a tech product idea that we It is said that MVP is Minimum Viable Product At least you can generate that. Yes, In my opinion, at this stage he is no longer Can also generate . till and without you Do you want to use some technology which has some hardware that I don't I am able to create because I have There is no capability. I have to make something. let's say i want to make a tool like this which people wear variables and some that will track. Now what kind of data am I going to use? It will track and what can I do with that data Maybe I can do that by simulating it I can also show it in MBP. make this It might be difficult for me as a kid as a 10 15 year old kid. To the audience, I I would like to say that this is actually very big Tech used to be an entrepreneurial challenge in the world that investors' money How to make without? How to make? This is very It used to be a big challenge for many. And the tech entrepreneurship journey of many I would have stopped here because I don't have any money To make MBB. So at least now AI through you can make that MBB and You can go to investors. we and if It's a good investor, that's what you get as a CTO I will get it for you. That's where you get your own Will help you with networking. means my Thought is if you want to become an entrepreneur and Do you have time, doesn't it mean you are a kid? Even before your MBP you can earn a First Pay Do the check challenge with yourself. bring yourself One Pay Check Through the Skills That You Have Developed. Weather they are AI skills. Largely AI Skills But Also Entrepreneurial Skills. Your hustle is based on a paycheck Bring it. No matter how small your pay check is, then start to develop and try to bring That pay check from the space in which you Do you want to do entrepreneurship? got it ok do an internship basically but get somebody to pay you for that internship we are real World Experience Real World Experience in the same domain that you want To build in will do wonders to your journey okay this is one aspect of this question and there's an aspect called rappers w r a p p e r s rappers we It is very important what rappers are From an AI Entrepreneurship Perspective hmm because this is a very common Conversation Now Days in the Tech World. Hmm so do you understand what rappers are? in which context do you want me to Explain? whatever you feel someone said this I have never even heard the word in my life. Ok. So A rapper is essentially a rapper when you create one Graphic user interface and like a software Layer on top of your existing AI tools. So let's take Chat GPT. So Typing mind like a rapper. Right? Typing Mind is a personal assistant. We were able to talk about E ES. So those businesses How are they built? Those Businesses Essentially Earn money using these existing tools Create your own version using Versions which we can use as end users Can be done. And we pay for that tool Are. Like copy dot ai. Now the content For creation. You are inside him with your You can generate ideas, do it better You can. But he uses chat only in GPT Is. At the back end chat GPT is being used Is. But its GUI is very different for you. will be. So this is your AI entrepreneurship One type of entrepreneurship in this space It is emerging a lot. where at On Existing Foundational Model Making wrappers and selling them as a tool Are. Hmm. Just your own creativity here Need to develop more engineering skills Have to apply. Correct. Correct. Correct. Absolutely PREP Engineering And architecture skills because it can Isn't it true that we only borrow some specific data If you want to do it, then you will have to tell me this too on which data should it be based and not that we could tell if we could only If you are doing engineering then architecture What are skills basically? What does architecture skills consist of? to determine the data architecture tries to understand what type of data we need In which form should it be captured how should i capture it I can extract it but you can extract it from my account How do you say GPT? This is what we call GPT I don't say it. When we are up to him a when you are creating a layer of software we tell him to call this piece prioritizing or highlighting such content Prioritize. so a rapper based You need AI to start a business Architecture. You Need Basic AI Architecture skills and very good preparation Engineering skills. This is basic A.I. How about architecture skills? These basic A.I. To learn architecture skills you can A lot of documentation exists Is. Like GPT's own chat if the documentation exists If you want to make wrappers on it then you How to make it? A lot of chats are gpt Wonderful in this regard that he gives you everything Provides documentation of . so right now The organisations are also such that even within organizations because there are many No one has done many courses. They Also learn by relying on these documents hey how can i create a rapper I can do whatever I can for my organization Be specific. and i'm talking big Corporates also. Ok. practically Speaking how much time will it take to learn this Architectural Skills. If from the very heart Do it with all your heart and learn only this much If we can make an MBP then roughly one to two months. Right? If we do it this way we want to develop ourselves so that we doing it with your school or college So maybe three months. wow it's not That's much. It's not that much at all. it's not That's much. Ok. Some such examples are real who made rappers from world businesses sold for a lot of money. Copy AI For example I think is one in which Their profitability is so high Was not anticipated but was very high is living. Typically lots of rappers By creating educational wrappers he has helped colleges Have sold it to. A lot of colleges use it have made educational wrappers in which Integrate Learning Management Systems It is done. in which in a very interesting way like One of our students created a wrapper I had given that chat in GPT type I used to have conversations but one of our In a professor's tone. So if our The professor used to abuse, so that rapper also used to abuse I used to give. That kind of a thing. so there are Some Interesting Business Opportunities There For sure. I just hope the audience understands this Realizing how big the business is There is an opportunity. This is a very big business right now There is an opportunity because there are a lot of There are low hanging fruits. right now anything Has not happened. means if The ocean that is still left is just a bucket full That's the one that has come out. ok friend If someone had told me this 3 years ago I would not believe that this wood has been a Reality. We give money to so many young people Have to earn. Very few people know about these things Are. I just hope this podcast reaches us Many people. or and I think they are three Let's follow the philosophy of idiots, what does it mean Learn a skill and you will get progress. Meaning This is such a transferable skill, isn't it, AI? I did entrepreneurship from LETS and I failed at entrepreneurship. Couldn't make anything with lettuce. But if I You have acquired those skills, the same skills Will you help me find a job? and a va Probably a very good job also. Because There is same amount of demand there too There is a problem of supply. so i think this use it as one of those opportunities that are If brother fails then it doesn't matter. What did I learn out of it? what i take Out of it can help me find a job. So In the last podcast, we presented Engineering had broken down. End That's the basis of all other AI skills I see Feel. Yes. means over ai literacy when you If you go for skill building then you will get success Engineering is the one. Right now we have this A.I. A little about the skills of architecture I have talked about it. But to learn this you need to You will have to take help of GPT. yes gpt of the documentation or any other You want to use the foundational model You will remember in our last conversation Said as specific use of Grok The cases are great but the documentation is poor Not there. This is how they create problems He does that so that people don't make anything about him that you are getting something that is valuable because He doesn't have the documentation. Butt Chat I don't know how many thousands are already created on GPT. rappers are gone because there Very good documentation is available. So People are able to make it. Which chat box is this In the category? Four documentation available Is. Right now the documentation of deep sea is also It is decently done. Gemini's also decently It is done. The best chart is that of JPT. Ok. Moving on. We are that career Were breaking down the prospects. Right? So you did entrepreneurship We. You speak about older established Entrepreneurs and Entrepreneurs R Just starting. Correct. People who just Starting out having an AI element It is needed in their businesses. Correct. They What is Elementor? first pret engineering Find out from him only. Just ask AI that I am What should I do? then this documentation aspect Come in. That means if you like a lot of tech If you want to be specific then try to go low code, No Code and AI First at Least in Creation Off your MBP. If you don't know tech yet I also have to stay here. Even if you are not a tech product So actually the product you are making You want to make a first move advantage in that Low on having an AI strategy for Yourself. Ok. Any other aspects you might want to add As for the entrepreneur's playbook? there There is actually so much that you can add. Meaning Generally, entrepreneurship has its own stages There are. Your ideation stage is done, Your MVP stage is done, your GTM is done that the go to market stage is done, your Market fit is achieved, product market fit Done. And then you do a basic launch. Right? AI will help you at every stage Can. So not just the first stage. Suppose your will is to make me an entrepreneur I have to become one. But I don't know where to go. Ask Gemini or Chat GPT that What If I Want to Be an Entrepreneur These renewable energies? what kind of Problems can I solve. please give me a Game plan. And understand, I'm not a Hard working person. there for chowk out to Hours of my day every day and you coach me too Become a great entrepreneur in renewable Energy. as i said it is very good to Structure your thoughts. then use one of two tools that I speak about which are better et structuring. Like for such a thing May be prereplexity or gemini wood give you are a much better more specific response than Chat Jeepity Wood Give But Go Ahead and Dut Right. Ok. can we move on from Entrepreneurship? Yes. so let's do Corporate? Yes. Ok. so corporates at Present are very bullish on AI specially In India. So a recent study was done Where AI adoption is understood an attempt was made to take over these corporates in a Particular country. India was the highest There. so 59% of corporates that existed in india they said that you know we We are very bullish on AIA. Adopt us Is. this was actually more than american Companies, More Than Singapore, More Than Malaysia Extra. Right? let's break it down Corporate careers are also in two parts. Ok? People who are in their 20s and people who are in their 30s And are in the above. We first talk about 30s and above For this, the use of AI at the workplace. Tell me about it. I feel that this age Actually there is a little fear in the group. because this is a very new skill And so on. We are a part of What's Your Advice? Very Give practical advice. I think my The Most Practical Advice Would Be First try to focus on something that can save you Time and make you more productive. When you this You will see that I have to fulfill my task It was a day to do that which took me 8 hours It seemed so. Right now I feel like seven. that one The difference between the hours you will get is not of the day Which you can probably use at home. Perhaps You can use it to learn some other skill You can. Maybe you are passionate about something to do or just sit and chill You can use it. That one hour is yours will reduce my apprehension a little bit that Why You Should Use It vs. Why You Shouldn't Needed Mostly if you are in a corporate job Do you even be a little cognizant that you You are not sharing data anywhere. Own Not sharing organization data yes. But largely it is a minor task. Me Have to write an email. Ok? write me an email Is. Four things were highlighted in the email to me Have to do it. Someone please give it to me in a structure. Email me to get my first draft ready. They You can get it done. I need to make a presentation yes, I need to make a document, you do it You can. I need to check my grammar, you can do that You can get it done. from the same level if you Even if you start, you will be able to Build on because you will be saving time. Ok? I myself have never had a corporate job Did. A lot of my friends have Have seen progress in the corporate world. We And the harsh truth is this. he said that if we want promotions then we will always do more then you are asking me and second that is it We have to play the game of human politics Is. Hum we can't cover that aspect. He is yours It is based on people skills. But this is the first one The factor that is asked is that Of you? Or AI could be used here. You have an extra hour now, right? In that you can do both one and two. We Right? When we over deliver, The benchmark changes. so over There is a problem with delivery as well We have to constantly rewrite. Right? Now if I use AI to do something I can either do things quickly or do them better I can. so i should do it as long as There are no norms and rules against it In my organization. Right? because What does the strategy tell us that I Always be better than average. then i I will succeed. So, you will get better than average All people have the same AI to live in It is available. Right? you have to constantly understand what tools to use so that i Can do better than others. Previous Podcasts We did not talk about deep research. quickly please tell me what is deep research in this World Way? All this machine learning and data The science side, right? And in this our The concept of deep research also comes into play. which is just then looking at a lot of Data and Synthesizing Insights. Because One thing is that I have a lot of data and There is a tool. but there is another thing that my Whether he has business understanding or not Is. My organization, weather it's a health Care Organization, Wether It's a Finance organisation, wether it is a it is a retail organization, it's a it's a Manufacturing Organization. to everyone's own There are contextual things. Right? some of their There are business goals. some of their processes and There are SOPs that are set. with in that understanding that I can translate a Business problem into an analytical one Problem? solve this analytical problem Relying on AI. Right? and then throw back Business Insights That Can Help Me Do Better. When you go into this space Ho na then you are unstoppable. I Feel Incorporated. Ok. I would like to say two things. First of all, deep research in Chat GPT There is an option of. A in some cases if you have very Gave detailed prompts to GPT that I tell me about this, tell me about this, tell me about this, this Tell me, tell me from these angles, etc. tall Give a pull prompt to GPT. Put The Deep Research Option on Giving Output Maybe it will take time. 1 hour sometimes 3 It takes four hours. but if your request very detailed and good question to you The output will also be very strong. right now that You can make up your own mind by reading the output Apply and present it at your workplace For better results in your career. thats What did I do? This is a very practical scenario Is. Yes of course right. 3-4 years ago if Work of this level had to be done. this whole process Would you have taken a week to study research? Put Together Data. see i will give you an example right it's a very personal Example to me when you do your PhD Technically it takes you some six to eight months State your problem properly in structuring that exactly i What do I want to know and how do I I will contribute to the field of knowledge. Right? Now in the presence of AI, people are we finish it within a week because They do a deep search and it is very meaningful The output comes and no one is saying that You copy paste that output. Butt if I have got 10 options. it's almost like somebody very intelligent sing with me And throwing ideas at me. Right? i can Evaluate whether one of those ideas is a good one Idea or not. I can develop it deeper. I Can do more research as follow up. I can add My creativity to it. i can add my Intelligence to it. But I want that which Idea creation and initial search There are too many of those elements right now have been resolved. I mean you probably are Quickly read through the books you read at home You can't search for things as quickly as you want You can pay there. Ok. So Effectively for Corporates Corporates It's It If You Want To Like It For example you are ML Eng, now we have ML Sites with engineering and data scientists I haven't talked about it but if you are a machine Learning Person Right and You Know How to Work with algorithms and in that you copilot added what we were saying that the code if you write very well then your life is enough set is that means you you are able to then just Solve business problems one after the other right right and and it keeps you completely Employable. you will never be scared that Hey, where did my job go? Wright Key Factor We are very concerned about the economy right now The situations that we have and how much the waste Influences Corporates Even in Offshorers Like Hours and Centre of Excellence as Hours. It's very important to ensure that your skill level is always at a place where nobody younger and like sort of nobody who is Much less experience than you can replace you are right and so you have to continue to learn even evolve please add to what i am saying if you feel what i am saying is Incomplete hum if you want a corporate career We want growth in the coming 10 years Work on first and foremost AI literacy do it yourself this is a subject in itself It's a never ending subject because A.I. Constantly Evolving Correct. seconds you Work on people skills because that is Relevant for every single industry every Singles career A section on human politics element remains in corporate careers Too. We and the third are our communication skills But work on it. a because one it will help you In your work place. but to your prep Engineering skills will increase with improved Communication skills in the first place. yes i mean just to add on to that right now the way They Are Now Transforming Even Chat GPT extra is to say that even if somebody does not Know the right language even if English isn't their first language and they actually put Ah, a prompt that AI is working equally hard to understand where you are coming From. so if you make even 30% of the effort the Paining 70% of the effort will be made by ah The AI ​​Itself, Right? because it is genuinely It's my job to figure out what the user wants. There is responsibility. Right? and because of that That's what the whole algorithm is trying to do Brother I want to know what you want So, he will do all the hard work from his side. You have to just do the extra hard work. I think in just to add to your point. You Add three or four points, I think the The other last point is always be very aware Off your business. even if you think i'm just An analyst in a big organization what is meant by profit loss statement that's not true everything in corporate turns into dollar value so figure out her A problem can be small or big which you Dollars associated with solving this What is the value and where is it in the chain? You can create an impact because that is also another way you show that i am an Invaluable employees of your company where you know I know where the money is flowing. Basically, By doing all these things you are telling your boss look if you want to make money you can't Take me out of yours. the work that i am doing Because of that the company is earning money. We ok moving on to the final chapter we are here Think Creative Professionals You Should Know Highlighted it. Public thing also like government employees Extra. so i think in addition to all the Improving Productivity Bit and All In India, there are many schemes from the government There is more push now toward AI drove things right so now a good Understanding of what all AI is capable of of doing. India has now finally come to us place where we are very good with public Private Partnerships Now. Right? So India's AI ecosystem is like China's was centralized and America had a lot of It was privatised. Very public of India It is a private run. So, our government Sets policies and makes changes Gives perspectives and private Players can jump into what's out there Let us play our part. Such as At the time of Maha Kumbh, they did a lot of which Had AI involvement in it. so even if you are a government employee and i have some in my family they had to really have an Understanding how drones work, brother Are you? How is this data being captured? If 2300 has AI enabled cameras to Detect where the density of people has increased If so, what will I do with that data? How can I use it to manage it better In. if his job is only that I want to do crowd management. how can i Should I do crowd management? in bangalore now He has started the traffic Management Using AI Right Because We All Know HOW BAD THE BORDER TRAFFIC IS. so even if i Am a public sector employee more and more we are seeing that there is at least this The overlap that we're having where AI is touching some of the work that I do, some of the Decision making that I do. may be like For corporates, the data they say is that 40% of jobs are already AI touched. Maybe it's not that high a number right now for the Public Sector But It's Likely To Go Up because governments have now started to Work with a lot of private players in order to execute that bhaiya we will formulate do. We will give you ideas. We I will make a strategy. You execute it. Right? So, all of those places. and then creative field of course there is a lot that has been happening in that Space as well. So, if you are a creative The person who is not really looking to be very Entrepreneurial So that. so you just want To create a product. like let's say even For joy. Right? let's say i am somebody who Likes Writing Poetry for Joy. Right? You don't have to just convert it into a Business also. but of course there are business The elements are there. there are very very Specific Tools Such Just Copy AI For Content Creation But Also the Foundational Tools have a lot of space where they have Democratized in a way access right earlier Maybe because Ranveer has a very Ranveer was the only good editor in the team I was able to do good editing. but now maybe Nandini also came on the basis of an AI tool A very well edited YouTube video of yours Can make it. Because that tool also made noise I reduced it. That tool also provided the light I have optimised it. aa somewhere stop words Aa Aa I was doing it. He detected that too And I edited it out. so what is it now Used to be? very much because of that The field is being democratized. Creative Field Specialty Content Creation Writing Again going back to our first conversation that we know the ethics of who does what will keep in mind whose ownership it is and Keep in mind whose consent is there or not. K there is still a lot of tools that are able to help you out ok a lot of This is the question that has been asked in both episodes so far. I have not asked you what AI agents are What AI agents basically do is These are our existing AIs that still exist Let's place it in an environment, right? Let's do some specific things inside which we have remembered what you remember I have talked so many times that Bhaiya, where we are which is our general artificial Where we need to be on intelligence We have started his journey. AI Agents are the journey we started in which we are saying that you are something Can you take a decision? knowing that your Have access to Chat GPT. knowing that you Be placed in an environment. Do you? Can you take any one decision or not? As That they are launching a new version of Alexa as well which is saying that friend look at Alexa first There was Narrow AI. I was just talking to you. Meaning, he would only read and listen to your words. I used to translate. to figure out I used to try. What is intent? you spoke Play a song. He heard the play. She has her own Played the song from the repository. So first It was narrow AI. then a lot of sorts of versions later it becomes generative in a way that On its back end, run a GPT model like I used to do it and based on that also that output was able to generate verbal output that was generative but now we want to move further And whether he is able to take any decision is it there or am not able to take it means that again Things like is he able to make that booking is what I want him to do I am able to tell him Alexa call this person and say that i am running late by 15 minutes but but that guy didn't pick up the phone so Alexa What did Edge N output? So now he himself Is able to do some decision making. That That's where we're trying to go. this is Typically AI agents. when you place an AI in an Environment and After Reading the environment after understanding all that can this happen in the environment the ai agent Tries to take a decision. for example i I am a content creator. we would you say that An AI agent in my life Can work as a content strategy Based on data of content. yes, can Are. So effectively is an AI agent a bot The one whom you train that friend look at me This is what is needed in my industry. not just Give training because it is predictive Done. If I told everything. C Ye So if I told you about this picture Look and tell me whether this is a cat or not. In that I am telling you to find the tail Where from? Find where is the ear? find it Where is Whiskers? that's not what we are Talking about. We were there before, where This is very rule based. then we take seconds came here on the stage where we saw him Gave me lots of photographs. Thousand Gave me photographs of the cat and said that Brother, whoever looks like this is a cat Is. Then we progressed further to the stage when I asked him friend, what kind of cat can you make? It is visible. All that you know. Now we are more we're going to go a little bit further into that Still doing all these things. We him You can also give rules by hard coding them. We You can tell him other things also. but also He can also self learn. such as he That's your own YouTube video I can tell by looking at it that perhaps when I saw this I didn't take the old thumbnail but took another one no better People were clicking meaning. So now I do this I will do it. So he did it to himself Also did the testing in away. give an example You can use an AI agent. AI Agents Alexa AI is for example and an Example. Cloud AI is an example of this Are all examples of AI agent clout Clot is Clod can do a lot of things Firstly right Claude was started by People who are researchers in Open AI and Kind of Drifted Away by Wright and Claude The basic sort of structure is called this is designed in such a way that it Can solve complex problems. Now The Complex Problem Solving Website It can also be in the context of design, It can also be in the context of writing It is also in the context of audio-visual Might be possible. but the ability that they are trying to build in cloud is that one of those problem solving complex things And we can be a little more ethical. Meaning There the security is high, privacy is maintained There should be no concerns. It does not take any such data is doing something he doesn't have permission to do To take. a lot of these foundational AIs Are also getting in that direction. Clot just happens to be the one that was built on Dos Fundamental Principles. Is it a rapper? No No Claude Is Foundational In a way it is not really a rapper. it's not Built on top of something. Claude is what You build something on top of it. so would you say Especially for creative professionals But for professionals from any industry For. A lot of people can say that friend this Look, this is my job. this is my job There are requirements. I do this at my job I do this. These are all my tasks. Now with this app chat is gpt Whichever Gemini you are please list out Who are the best agents for me? Relay from industry. Correct. oh lord my Help me. It's basically that right. it's It's like not just agents. you ask him What skills should I develop? You ask him is there an AI for it? Right? You ask him if there are any rappers who Better do it. You ask him if any there is a specific foundational tool that maybe Works better for my use case. As We discussed that Bhaiya Grok It works much better. If you have social media I want to do analysis, sentiment analysis Have to do it, have to do SEO optimization. So If I have a specific industry and its If a foundational model does better for Which model is that? Right? If I am a If I go a step further back, then if I have Right now there are no jobs for us new people Let's talk. You can get your CV created by AI yes. Have you seen any job in any Do you think this job is for me on the portal? It is a good job. You give that feed to AI and say Can you tell me what skills I need I am not eligible for this job. which one is this There are skills that I have, on which I can I can focus in interviews. You Company You can prepare a specific interview for him Because of. There are so many things that we do You can because of AI now. Got it. These Perhaps the two most useful podcasts of 2025. But those who are hungry for career growth For them correct career growth I am hungry for this and a little bit towards the future Want to see Want to remain employable and i want to learn more that's that's my or After these two podcasts I feel like I wish you would have been my professor but the advantage of Being a Podcaster for Different Industries people would have become your professors so thank you Wishing you more luck, more success. I I genuinely feel that people like you are for India is a must. That's the kind of you. Thank you. just glad to be putting your Voice out there more. Thank you. thank you so Much. Hope to see you soon and thank you for all The Knowledge. Thank you. So friends, this was today Episode. Remember check out Dr. Nandanis Work ET Masters Union. We Link All The Details Down below. Like I said earlier, it is The people are the real heroes of India, the real heroes of India Celebrities. It is because of such people that the country Actually it is going to move forward. because if In our country, technology Thinking should become a common thing.
