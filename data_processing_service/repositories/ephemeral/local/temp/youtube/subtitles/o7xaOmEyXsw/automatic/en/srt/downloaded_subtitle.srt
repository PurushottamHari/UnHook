1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,799
This is another very very important 2025

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,040
Career Specific Podcasts. So I need 10 different

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,960
I need to make this type of apps. I in life

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
Never done coding. what about a year or two

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,839
Will I be able to make my own apps later? made then

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,039
You can if you are a creative person. If You

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,680
Make even 30% of the effort this remaining 70%

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,400
Of the effort will be made by the AI ​​itself.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,720
You will learn from this episode that AI idents

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,359
How can you skill yourself in your own business?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,359
You can. for my eye is only as useful as

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
The output is right as far as I can use it

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,320
For. I don't actually care about which

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
using the tool i i i i i i i i i i

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,520
As long as the task is done. Strategy Joe

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,079
Yes, that will have to be changed. We have to figure this out

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
At which stage of the company do I have to do it?

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
How can I incorporate that? They

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
How aligned it is with my goal. So right now a

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,399
Recently a study was done where 59% off was given

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
Corporates that existed in India. Give

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,039
Said that you know we are very bullish on AI

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,360
And we have to adopt it. and the coding that

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
There used to be skills, but that too is changing a lot

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,800
Is. I feel like coding is even better

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
It is a hard skill but now 12-13 year old kids

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,960
Are you able to translate your thoughts

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,119
In tools.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,520
Do you think that reality is sitting at home

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
Even a 10 year old kid can design a great game

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
will be able to do it.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,080
Possible? How long it will take? to learn this

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Architectural skills? If from the very heart

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,320
Yes, it's not that much at all. Wow! those who

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
Are you in your 20s, what's your advice? My

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,960
The most practical advice you could learn is skills

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,320
Well, you will get promotion. i just hope this

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,320
The podcast reaches many people.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,920
The term is AI agents. this will happen in the next 2 years

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,640
You will continue to listen to my own work

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,920
In place. And you will also hear that your

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Coworkers around AI have lost their jobs

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Because of the agents. Now there would be AI agents

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,720
What is? How the corporate world

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,600
In, how to learn entrepreneurship

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,240
You will learn this today which will be applicable in the world

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,960
Through the podcast. Last time Dr. Nandani

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,439
Seth told us about the basic skills of AI.

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,039
I told you a lot. it was one of the

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,840
Most loved episodes of the year. Because

51
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,480
India's top data scientists and AI

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,840
The expert is Dr. Nandini Seth. He

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,920
IM has done PhD from Bangalore. So much

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
All AI Experts of Indian YouTube

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Through teaching you about AI.

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,120
But Dr. Nandini has been very professional

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
All young entrepreneurs should know about AI

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
Guidance has been given. that's why she is the

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,040
Ideal guest for this topic. Your cuttings

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,120
For cutting edge research and unique teaching style

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,519
She has become famous herself. Through which India's

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
It is training future tech leaders.

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,000
She is a founding faculty member at the

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,959
Masters Union School of Engineering

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Where many students are interested in data science

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
And teaches practical aspects of AI

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,599
Are. If you are in 12th standard and

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,879
Your interest is computer science or data

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,840
If you are into science then this episode will keep you going till the end

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,879
Seeing is very important. Dr. Nandini's Belief

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,800
This is how real talent gets opportunity

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,080
It must be available. This is why a deriving

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Dr. is giving 1% scholarship to the students.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Nandini Masters Union under 4 years

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,920
Graduate Data Science and AI Programs

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
In. Links are in the description below

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,760
Below. Friends, read this entire podcast in Notebook

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,519
And look with the pen. this is another very

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,680
Variant

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,680
2025 Career Specific Podcast.

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:43,440
[music]

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,319
Nandini said, welcome back to TRS. thank you at this

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,439
point i am sure that people have known that

84
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,599
What is available out there. Real on us now

85
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,200
Also talking about the world scenario

86
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,080
It is necessary. We are a part of AI geopolitics

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,480
Many parts have already been made. explain this

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,959
How? Ah, this is one question. The second question is

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Related to Indian Government. Hmm

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,560
What does the Indian Government want? A With

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,519
Respect to AI. hmm hmm you can give

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,360
What ever examples you see fit for adding

93
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,160
to this narrative okay so first of all what you

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,080
said that AI is a lot of geopolitics

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,520
Right is becoming an important part in this

96
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,400
We have large three key players

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,360
America China India when it comes to

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,320
AI is now available in the US

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,280
So much of AI started from what was

100
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,520
Completely Privately Laid On To Them

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,000
There were a lot of resources. That is very much

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
Looking at it from the perspective of economics

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Were. We discussed regulatory norms

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,639
In the first go if there is less then this we

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,880
Can't set barriers. and there

106
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,720
But there is still a lot of AI driven research

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,280
It is high. Right? He is a leader. Some of it we

108
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
I can't deny it. In Generation

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,880
As many foundational models emerged from America

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,479
That many have not come from anywhere else. then cut

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,400
to that china came which believes that they

112
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,600
Want to be leaders by 2030 right they want

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,639
that they have lot of manpower

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,639
He should be trained in such a way that he can use AI

115
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:36,720
can do it. They can have AI capabilities.

116
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,360
2300 universities to provide AI education

117
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,960
For this, in the last few years, China has

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,199
Already happened. If you look at the top 25

119
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,240
From that there are top 25 institutes in the world which

120
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,160
Provide education in AI. you largely

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,840
American and Chinese institutes only

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
Will meet. unfortunately still there

123
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,759
There is no Indian institute. When you A.I.

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,840
You are using the word education, the output of

125
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,440
That is perfect engineers, AI

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,759
Architects Architects, AI

127
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,199
Experts, ML Engineers, Data

128
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,199
Scientists are largely this category of people.

129
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,000
Ok. Right? These are all the new jobs. donation

130
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,479
All the New Jobs. some which are slightly

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,039
Older. Data Scientists and ML Engineers

132
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,440
Used to exist. But yes now that is very

133
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,479
Work more. give what give

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,080
Doing first. so unfortunately he still

135
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,319
Ekist does not. China's own

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,319
the standard problems remain that there

137
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
But the data is very centrally controlled

138
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
Therefore privacy issues remain. butt there

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,840
if you'll see if you'll see

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,960
that even in America what talent is there that

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,039
The AI ​​is working. AI is doing the jobs.

142
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,720
That's largely Chinese so far. Now come on

143
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
On India. Ok? in india

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Too much brain drain in engineering

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,039
We have seen that happen. a lot of people

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,680
Here is the smarter group, the creams

147
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,759
and going up to the west so that he can stay there

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,240
more lucrative more respectful

149
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,840
can get jobs. where they think that

150
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,160
There is core engineering. India wants to

151
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,120
That we build that capability. India

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,599
wants us to enter AI education

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,759
Do it. But India's perspective is a little

154
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
It is a bit different. Like you know that

155
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,840
India has not developed its foundational model

156
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
I have taken it out. There are some reasons why India

157
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,360
Why couldn't I get it out or why not

158
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,039
I have taken it out. But I think largely of India

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
AI is that whiz in which we can make our people

160
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,199
want to create AI for. We our's

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Want to create AI for the welfare of people

162
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
Are. in which we want A.I.

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,960
she is not very complex but she

164
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,880
Our Larger Population Related Problems

165
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,880
is able to solve it. so i think kisan

166
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,520
Can you give some examples like GPT?

167
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,160
And also tell me what is Kisan GPT?

168
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,879
We are farmers GPT is still being developed.

169
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,440
We don't have a full fledged one yet. But

170
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,680
It is a generalized tool like Chat GPT

171
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,240
So that the farmer can do the conversation

172
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Is. Now what will the farmer do with the conversation? They

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
It may ask whether my Soil or I will be

174
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
I am in the state, I am in this location.

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,319
This is my pin code. According to this I

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
What kind of crops should be grown? Me

177
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,759
At what time should that crop be grown?

178
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
How will the weather conditions be? tractor to me

179
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,199
Needed I don't have. around me

180
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,879
Who has it? I want to know that it rains

181
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,520
Will it happen or not? because from that my

182
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,360
Loss and profit will be decided. So let me know that

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,919
Is. He can tell. also did all this

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
All capabilities now Kisan GPT then

185
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,719
It is also still in a very nascent stage. But

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
We already have many more AI capabilities

187
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,600
have been brought in PM Kisan Scheme whose

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,720
Inside we are also monitoring how much

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
The output is getting generated. The minimum guarantee that

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
We provide you with the pricing that we offer

191
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
The government gives it more power to determine this

192
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,120
It is possible that the output is in this state

193
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,320
This much came out from it. The rest went to that state

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,320
Some has been consumed locally, how much remains?

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
right, is what is left bad?

196
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
It is not happening, is it going to the right place or

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
if I am not going then these things or else

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,519
Many of our financial

199
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
The dispersion which happens of our public funds

200
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,760
when we distribute those which are ours to them

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's do it in Kisan scheme or

202
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,720
In any other schemes, we would not see AI there.

203
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
To check if you are using it too much

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
To ensure there is no fraudulent transaction

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,920
Is happening. What used to happen sometimes was that some people

206
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,959
Those who were diseased or people with duplicate Aadhaar

207
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,880
You would have got it made and taken your subsidy through it

208
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
Were. They used to take their incentives through him

209
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
And those who wanted it didn't get it

210
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
I could find it. So there's a lot of AI in this right now.

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,760
It has started being used to figure out

212
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,320
Where is it not being used? Where

213
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,080
But someone has done wrong. It could be the same one

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Aadhaar transactions are happening in two cities

215
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,279
Is. How is that possible? There could be one

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Six people are taking the same subsidy at the address.

217
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,440
How are they able to take it? All this tracking

218
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Now we are able to do this also through Aadhar. So

219
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,600
India is building largely towards that.

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Right now we are more concerned about social welfare

221
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
We are building towards this. But we

222
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,880
We want to build in education as well.

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,839
Starting any foundation in India

224
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,839
Don’t want to spend money. $ million was spent

225
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,880
When Chat GPT was created for the first time

226
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
Was. Nobody in India has that much money

227
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,519
I want to invest in this thing. Ok? Seconds

228
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,839
We don't have this thing in Indian context

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,320
The data is not in English and is centralized

230
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
It doesn't happen. A lot of our data is local language

231
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
and is non-digital data.

232
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,800
So it is that much more difficult to train on it

233
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,079
The model goes to learn something from it and moves on

234
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,320
I can talk usefully. and the third thing is that we

235
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,959
My GPU doesn't have that much space.

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,959
It is very fragmented. Not many such hubs

237
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,600
Is. if you look at america and china

238
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,279
They have their own hubs in which they sell stores

239
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
Can do it. Can do everything. India

240
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,079
doesn't have it. to india foundational

241
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,680
Trying very little not to make models

242
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,560
And there is no investor funding in it either.

243
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,720
But there are a lot of use cases. We are one

244
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,920
Viewed from a human perspective, every

245
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,000
Every person has a dream of his own. Hmm. And

246
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
Every person has to earn money for his family

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,200
wants. How will he make money now?

248
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,000
They will earn money which depends on their own skill

249
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,720
sets, level of ambition, level of effort,

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Life Story etc. We are the starting point.

251
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,320
Yes. Is this starting point completely

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,320
The reason for the change is the element of AI

253
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,079
From? We have a question, this is it. The second question is

254
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,160
that lets categorize indians into different

255
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,079
Career Possibilities. hmm lots of

256
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Indians are very interested in entrepreneurship

257
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,519
All Indians want corporate jobs.

258
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,079
And Like Creative Jobs But Not

259
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,720
Entrepreneurship and Non Corporate So

260
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,839
Ok let's start with entrepreneurship

261
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Are. ok and divide it into two parts

262
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,000
We do. The first part is Entrepreneurs

263
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,320
Who are already established. Assume that

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
It is in the agricultural sector. Assume that

265
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,680
It is in the financial sector. Assume that

266
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Is in the media sector. Hum Hum and the Second

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Categories that are actually AI related

268
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,480
Want to start a business. we end and

269
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,120
Those who want to start a business and

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,600
There's an AI element to it, right? to bring

271
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,519
Have to think. Ok? so let's break it down

272
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,240
This Entrepreneurship Game First. Ok?

273
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,079
So what you said about first category people

274
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Which are the people whose businesses are established

275
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,880
in which I am assuming that their

276
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,680
A goal is set for the organization that

277
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,240
Bhaiya I have to optimize this. to me

278
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,079
Or you have to bring more money. Me

279
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
More social welfare has to be done. to me

280
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,800
You have to do better than your competition. Anything

281
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,920
Their goals are goals on an organizational level

282
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,959
It is set. This is his strategy. now over here

283
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,120
what could be the strategy that

284
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,880
Change will have to be made because AI has arrived

285
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Because your competitors also know AI

286
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
You might be adopting it. Ok? So we have this

287
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,279
We have to figure out that in our industry

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,120
What things are already happening in AI right now?

289
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,120
Are. Even if it is not in our country

290
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,880
It is happening, it is happening somewhere else. but which one

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,000
Things are happening and am I that one team

292
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,760
I can build inbuilt capability that

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,920
can't? If I am Fairly Advance

294
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
So I can probably do it inbuilt. I

295
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,880
A team of 4 or 10 for yourself

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,839
that will work on this which

297
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Will work on AI and data. But if I

298
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,320
Even if I am not that advanced, can I be anyone

299
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,200
I can hire a consultant at this

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,000
The stages that will guide me on AI adoption

301
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
that on which stage of the company am I or

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
In which vertical of the company should I work now?

303
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,360
There is an immediate requirement for AI, I will

304
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,040
How can I incorporate those into my goals?

305
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,519
How does that align with That Is My First?

306
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,040
category of people my second category of

307
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,760
People are people who are starting out on

308
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,000
Entrepreneurship to Them I Say Go Wild

309
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,920
Think about the wildest application that you

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,959
can you think about it i won't say anything yet

311
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,279
Think About Foundational Model Building Because

312
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,480
As a new entrepreneur you want to

313
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,240
perhaps dip your feet into something in which

314
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Too much initial investment

315
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
There is no need. Creating Foundational Models

316
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
The initial investment is very high. But

317
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
If I'm creating use cases, like

318
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,720
You said that by depositing ₹ 00 per month can I do that

319
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,360
Can I create a use case? so much so that I am funding

320
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,160
I can pick it up. I have an important problem

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,519
by identifying if there is a good one for that

322
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,800
What if we create an AI based tool or agent?

323
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,800
I display it as my

324
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,959
They say that my minimum viable product

325
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
What did I do by creating a usable product?

326
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,279
Can I raise funds or not?

327
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,800
or the one in my first category

328
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,639
Was the company a problem? Was I his problem?

329
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,399
I can solve it and go and pitch it to him

330
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,720
Should I tell you brother to acquire me or

331
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,279
Give me the funds. You basically say that

332
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,160
You are saying that there should definitely be a tech element

333
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,600
It's needed in everyone's business. Correct. Now!

334
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,000
There are two additional questions. a first one very

335
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
Controversial question is from a careerist

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,639
Perspective because I don't create a lot

337
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,279
of debate online. Hmm. Ok? a something

338
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:04,079
People say that this is the total work of coders

339
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,240
Reduction is happening because the coding of AI

340
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,240
Capabilities are expanding. hmm lots of

341
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,120
There are coders who get offended

342
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,320
From this. As far as I know, some AI

343
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,399
By watching the podcast, let me explain that you

344
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,920
Coders can probably never be replaced

345
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,320
you will find it. But coders might turn into highly

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Skilled workers who will be able to output

347
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,519
A lot more codes. With the help of AI. Off

348
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,279
Course. This very sentence is controversial

349
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,120
Is. means it created controversy in

350
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,040
Social media. I am saying bye to you

351
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,880
talk. it is a controversial statement then

352
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,680
I want to break it down a little bit.

353
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,560
Ok? So the capabilities you are talking about

354
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes, these are called copilots. so as if

355
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,440
Microsoft's 365 which we use

356
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,600
Let's do presentation and Excel and Word

357
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
Documents that we have been using since ages

358
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,120
A copilot has also come with him.

359
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,959
Similarly, Python and all these languages

360
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,279
in which codes are written along with these

361
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,519
The copilots have arrived. Now to be a copilot

362
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,720
This does not mean that he is a pilot himself.

363
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,720
Being a copilot means that you

364
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
You tell him what to do and he can do it

365
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
Used to be. Sometimes you can make it a little technical

366
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,440
you are telling it in language and sometimes you tell it to her

367
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,600
Tell me in English what to do

368
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
and he is giving you options for

369
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,920
Do it like this, do it like this, do it like this. Now I

370
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,480
I myself have been different for the last 15 years

371
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,360
I have been coding in languages. So

372
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,240
Initially I also had a little inhibition that hey

373
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,519
I mean this was my hard skill which I

374
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,240
I had been learning it for many years. So now

375
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,160
His replacement is not coming in a way

376
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,360
Is. But this is an observation here. Ok?

377
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,959
So I think coding is even two

378
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,680
It's a hard skill. it is equally a science as

379
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,000
It is an art. now what do i mean by

380
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,959
That? which is the syntax for how to code

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,560
You have to write it in a way that there is no error in the code

382
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,360
So, there is science. But how to design the code?

383
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,240
want to do it? How will the code be optimized?

384
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,360
What do I mean by that? Minimum memory

385
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,319
Minimal memory utilization inside

386
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,640
The code does what I want it to do.

387
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,439
Or that code could also be written in 600 lines

388
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,799
Is. But I got the same task done for Rs.300.

389
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,039
This is what happens, it is art. Yes. Which one

390
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,640
Do you want to fetch data? which variables to take

391
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,720
Are? Like I'm very data science

392
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,600
I am speaking the language here. But which one?

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,679
Which variable is most important? His

394
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,880
What is context? Its for business

395
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,200
What does Pisces do? This is a lot of art. this this

396
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,160
There is no science. So, he doesn't seem to me

397
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,679
That the copilot can do right now. For that

398
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Coders Are Still Very Variant. Right? They

399
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,919
Maybe I should call myself a coder

400
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,000
They are undervaluing it. they should now think

401
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,080
of themselves s code architects and code

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
Desires. When I was in college, we used to

403
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,320
I had to remember the syntax of ' because

404
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
Google couldn't do it. They no longer have

405
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,000
That requirement. They have to think that and

406
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,720
How to do better things? So according to me

407
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,039
What you said is that their output is very high

408
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
It will increase. I think their output is also

409
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,000
will increase but efficiency will also increase and

410
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,039
Efficient codes that consume less memory

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Do it. particularly in the AI ​​space, okay I

412
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,799
I am entrepreneurial. we are on my mind

413
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,039
There are lots of software ideas. me 10

414
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,760
I want to make different types of apps. we i

415
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,600
I have never done any coding in my life. On us

416
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
I know that my propt

417
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,360
Engineering skills are amazing. I am very

418
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
I am a good communicator. and what I am able to

419
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,480
Visualize I am able to put into the process

420
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,160
And there are many people like me all over the world

421
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,559
Those who do not know coding but prt

422
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,960
Will you learn engineering after one year?

423
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,960
I will be able to make my own apps, I can make them now

424
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,640
yes why are there so many no's in one year

425
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,039
code and low code app creation tools that you

426
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,840
If you do proper engineering then you can

427
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,440
You can learn those tools right so for it

428
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,080
ExampleBubble.io is one of the tools that

429
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,160
we also teach our students at masters

430
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,200
Union Rights and You can learn them in 20 hours

431
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,799
If you have the tools then you can talk about it for 10 years or 2 years

432
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,760
I am talking about 20 hours

433
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
You spend 20 hours today, you will get the app from Bablu.

434
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,240
I will learn to make it but I don't know any code

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,720
You don't need to know anything about coding

436
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,080
I'm a no code app builder ok but what

437
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm going to need a CTO then

438
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,320
If I turn it into a business

439
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,480
There are many aspects of sea business

440
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,840
Are. Right? Now only if you create an app

441
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,320
You are doing it in which the features of the app are very

442
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,360
Limited in which only App Lets

443
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,400
it is being used because someone came

444
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,960
Received some more information and he left

445
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Went. Then in that case you need CTO

446
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,120
There is no need. You may also need to tweak that.

447
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,360
Sometimes you read the app but for that you need a full

448
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,440
No time limit is required. It is possible

449
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,280
You may sometimes need to optimize its design.

450
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
You don’t need full time for that. But

451
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,760
Now this business has become bigger than Lets. Correct

452
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,440
Is? Now a lot of people come to me

453
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,280
On time. So I want to optimize that

454
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,679
Bhaiya, are you able to handle so many people?

455
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,080
Is it available or the app is not able to do it. I have to do the same

456
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,400
tracking the data of all users and

457
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,640
Their data has to be utilized. before that

458
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,880
I would like to understand which data is being tracked

459
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,400
Should I do it? After that, I want to understand that this

460
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
What can I do using the data?

461
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
I can make predictions. Am I a user

462
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,679
Am I able to understand the behavior of? Can I do this

463
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
I can understand that if I change the color of the app

464
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,919
If we change it a little then the user behavior

465
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,760
Has there been any change or not? It is possible

466
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,520
In that app I then see advertisements

467
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,840
I want to bring it. Then I got the CTO job.

468
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,960
Definitely needed. Can you make games?

469
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,799
Very basic games can be made. But

470
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,600
What goes into making games is that a lot of

471
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,480
has more visual elements

472
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,320
That's why we need techs

473
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,240
Because right now the games are very

474
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,360
It has been advanced. She is on many layers

475
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,679
Visuals are created. it's almost

476
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Right now we are starting to combine virtual reality

477
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
have started. Augmented Reality

478
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,159
Starting to integrate. So that one

479
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,400
You need someone to make the design

480
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,440
one who understands that it is necessary

481
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,760
How should the movements be? then you game

482
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,840
You can make a simple game but make it engaging

483
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,840
to make it such that people

484
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,640
Stay addicted and keep playing. which is the

485
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,880
The purpose of let's say a company that is

486
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,120
Operating in the gaming space. For that

487
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,440
You definitely need techies. as much as

488
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,360
I have done gaming, I know I can

489
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
Conceptualize a Game That Can Be Great

490
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,799
And addictive. I put Indian History

491
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,200
I will give it in the game. I added different levels

492
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,480
I will give it to you, I will add different weapons etc.

493
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,679
But these are all ideas. how far are we

494
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,480
from a reality where my ideas as a

495
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,960
Content creators are an advanced level in a game

496
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Change it into a game. We

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,720
It will be any form of gaming. Right?

498
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,039
Is a layered structure. Ok? so you

499
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,559
what can you do for existing games

500
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,240
There are layers, let's say you have Indian

501
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,120
Something needs to be set in the context and no

502
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,080
It is a game whose existing layer is you.

503
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,880
by lifting the virtual reality layer and placing it on top of the

504
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,600
You can do modifications through an engineer

505
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,960
Right in which you actually have to put in that much effort

506
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,679
you won't have to do this because your base

507
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,679
The foundation is completely ready. You just add

508
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,600
You are getting news. You are saying that level up

509
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,000
How it will happen. You are adding all this that who

510
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,720
Weapons will come extra from GTA

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,120
Do you know? Yes GTA6 is releasing now

512
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,120
But I don't want to play GTA6 in Miami.

513
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,799
Have to play in Mumbai. yes you can do it

514
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,960
He is just a context player

515
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,760
it is very easy for him to do that,

516
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
It is not difficult, it means we are incorporated

517
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,240
Story lines are not difficult to do

518
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,640
Gaming is difficult to incorporate

519
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,440
Bringing Nuance Into Design That Expresses

520
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,159
These things should be correct, the movement should be clean

521
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,640
They are important. Ok? For us

522
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,679
It is important how you are feeling

523
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,840
The person who is playing the game has the right to

524
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,480
the person who is playing the game should want to

525
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,280
continue to play the game and for that

526
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,679
I can give only Mumbai context

527
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,000
I am not enough, I can also do more things with her

528
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,640
You should read what is contextually correct

529
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,559
All those nudges have to be added slowly

530
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,720
For which you need proper web designers

531
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,280
Graphic designers and game designers needed

532
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,159
but as far as you know by now an A.I.

533
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,679
about do you think that reality is 15

534
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,000
Years away in the year 2040, sitting at home will make a 10

535
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,520
Even a one year old child can design a great game

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,480
will get

537
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,280
possible yes i will not say that it is not

538
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,280
possible i think it is possible i think we

539
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,480
are we getting younger and younger age

540
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,039
Entrepreneurs definitely means we now

541
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,799
12-13 year olds express their thoughts

542
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
Are you able to translate in tools or

543
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,000
in games or

544
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,760
So definitely there is a possibility. Ok

545
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
This is why I'm highlighting the games

546
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,720
because as many as I have on an even take

547
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,440
Techie bros, they all believe that coding

548
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,600
for games is much more difficult yes it is

549
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,679
than any other form of coding because you

550
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,039
Human psychology has to be kept in mind.

551
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,280
it is it is it is a combination of many

552
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,280
Many things. It's only what we say

553
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,120
There is human psychology, that's why we

554
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,360
One has to keep in mind why he plays

555
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,320
Someone will be there for my game. one for her

556
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,880
There should come a stage where a person who is

557
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,720
no that is enough

558
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,799
It is fun to watch him play the game

559
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
going. But if it's a very easy game

560
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,679
Even if you go, you will not feel like playing

561
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,679
Of. So to figure out how much that will cost you

562
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,840
Have to maintain pressure. Meaning how much resistance

563
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,720
What should be the difficulty level

564
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
He should continue doing it. You Story

565
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,039
Lines were made, complexes were built, that's a good thing

566
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,640
Is. Engaging with the Butt Complex

567
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,120
is a must. it should not happen that he is over

568
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
There may be a complex that people feel

569
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,799
It is taking so long to understand the context

570
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,600
Is. I don't even get a chance to play

571
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,360
remained. So those things are very important

572
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
Here. So that psychology side is very

573
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,440
It is important here. So to Summarize

574
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,840
what are you saying. Basically the truth is that

575
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,840
Yes, if you have an idea for an app in your mind

576
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,960
have a tech product idea that we

577
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,480
It is said that MVP is Minimum Viable Product

578
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,039
At least you can generate that. Yes,

579
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,200
In my opinion, at this stage he is no longer

580
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,960
Can also generate . till and without you

581
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,720
Do you want to use some technology

582
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
which has some hardware that I don't

583
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,960
I am able to create because I have

584
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,360
There is no capability. I have to make something.

585
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:27,120
let's say i want to make a tool like this

586
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,000
which people wear variables and some that

587
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,679
will track. Now what kind of data am I going to use?

588
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,679
It will track and what can I do with that data

589
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,919
Maybe I can do that by simulating it

590
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,000
I can also show it in MBP. make this

591
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,960
It might be difficult for me as a kid as a

592
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,559
10 15 year old kid. To the audience, I

593
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
I would like to say that this is actually very big

594
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,080
Tech used to be an entrepreneurial challenge

595
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,880
in the world that investors' money

596
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,120
How to make without? How to make? This is very

597
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,919
It used to be a big challenge for many.

598
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,360
And the tech entrepreneurship journey of many

599
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
I would have stopped here because I don't have any money

600
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,200
To make MBB. So at least now AI

601
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,440
through you can make that MBB and

602
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,520
You can go to investors. we and if

603
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
It's a good investor, that's what you get as a CTO

604
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,200
I will get it for you. That's where you get your own

605
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,039
Will help you with networking. means my

606
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Thought is if you want to become an entrepreneur and

607
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,880
Do you have time, doesn't it mean you are a kid?

608
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,000
Even before your MBP you can earn a First Pay

609
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Do the check challenge with yourself. bring yourself

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,279
One Pay Check Through the Skills That You Have

611
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Developed. Weather they are AI skills. Largely

612
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,919
AI Skills But Also Entrepreneurial

613
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,159
Skills. Your hustle is based on a paycheck

614
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,240
Bring it. No matter how small your pay check is,

615
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
then start to develop and try to bring

616
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,880
That pay check from the space in which you

617
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,600
Do you want to do entrepreneurship? got it

618
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,679
ok do an internship basically but get somebody

619
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,200
to pay you for that internship we are real

620
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,279
World Experience Real World

621
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,400
Experience in the same domain that you want

622
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,159
To build in will do wonders to your journey

623
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:58,480
okay this is one aspect of this question

624
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:02,559
and there's an aspect called rappers

625
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,039
w r a p p e r s rappers we

626
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,039
It is very important what rappers are

627
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,039
From an AI Entrepreneurship Perspective

628
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,760
hmm because this is a very common

629
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,480
Conversation Now Days in the Tech World.

630
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,320
Hmm so do you understand what rappers are?

631
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
in which context do you want me to

632
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,400
Explain? whatever you feel someone said this

633
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:26,880
I have never even heard the word in my life. Ok. So

634
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,440
A rapper is essentially a rapper when you create one

635
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,480
Graphic user interface and like a software

636
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,120
Layer on top of your existing AI tools.

637
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,279
So let's take Chat GPT. So

638
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,600
Typing mind like a rapper.

639
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:43,279
Right? Typing Mind is a personal assistant.

640
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,120
We were able to talk about E ES. So those businesses

641
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,640
How are they built? Those Businesses

642
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,279
Essentially

643
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,559
Earn money using these existing tools

644
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,720
Create your own version using Versions

645
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,320
which we can use as end users

646
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,279
Can be done. And we pay for that tool

647
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
Are. Like copy dot ai. Now the content

648
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,679
For creation. You are inside him with your

649
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,480
You can generate ideas, do it better

650
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,720
You can. But he uses chat only in GPT

651
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,200
Is. At the back end chat GPT is being used

652
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,919
Is. But its GUI is very different for you.

653
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,159
will be. So this is your AI entrepreneurship

654
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,320
One type of entrepreneurship in this space

655
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,880
It is emerging a lot. where at

656
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,360
On Existing Foundational Model

657
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
Making wrappers and selling them as a tool

658
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,200
Are. Hmm. Just your own creativity here

659
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Need to develop more engineering skills

660
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
Have to apply. Correct. Correct. Correct.

661
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
Absolutely PREP Engineering And

662
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,520
architecture skills because it can

663
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,000
Isn't it true that we only borrow some specific data

664
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,399
If you want to do it, then you will have to tell me this too

665
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,080
on which data should it be based and not that

666
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,679
we could tell if we could only

667
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
If you are doing engineering then architecture

668
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
What are skills basically?

669
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,240
What does architecture skills consist of?

670
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,640
to determine the data architecture

671
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
tries to understand what type of data we need

672
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,720
In which form should it be captured

673
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,720
how should i capture it

674
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,520
I can extract it but you can extract it from my account

675
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
How do you say GPT? This is what we call GPT

676
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,200
I don't say it. When we are up to him a

677
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,799
when you are creating a layer of software

678
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
we tell him to call this piece

679
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,000
prioritizing or highlighting such content

680
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
Prioritize. so a rapper based

681
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,559
You need AI to start a business

682
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,559
Architecture. You Need Basic AI

683
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,440
Architecture skills and very good preparation

684
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,919
Engineering skills. This is basic A.I.

685
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,640
How about architecture skills? These basic A.I.

686
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,039
To learn architecture skills you can

687
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
A lot of documentation exists

688
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,640
Is. Like GPT's own chat

689
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,399
if the documentation exists

690
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,240
If you want to make wrappers on it then you

691
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,640
How to make it? A lot of chats are gpt

692
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,880
Wonderful in this regard that he gives you everything

693
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
Provides documentation of . so right now

694
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
The organisations are also such that

695
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,880
even within organizations because there are many

696
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,600
No one has done many courses. They

697
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,200
Also learn by relying on these documents

698
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,640
hey how can i create a rapper

699
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,919
I can do whatever I can for my organization

700
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,000
Be specific. and i'm talking big

701
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,679
Corporates also. Ok. practically

702
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,159
Speaking how much time will it take to learn this

703
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,880
Architectural Skills. If from the very heart

704
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,240
Do it with all your heart and learn only this much

705
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,840
If we can make an MBP then roughly one

706
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,520
to two months. Right? If we do it this way

707
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
we want to develop ourselves so that we

708
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,799
doing it with your school or college

709
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,440
So maybe three months. wow it's not

710
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,039
That's much. It's not that much at all. it's not

711
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,640
That's much. Ok. Some such examples are real

712
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,520
who made rappers from world businesses

713
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,159
sold for a lot of money. Copy AI

714
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,840
For example I think is one in which

715
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,080
Their profitability is so high

716
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,120
Was not anticipated but was very high

717
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,520
is living. Typically lots of rappers

718
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,600
By creating educational wrappers he has helped colleges

719
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,919
Have sold it to. A lot of colleges use it

720
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,080
have made educational wrappers in which

721
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,720
Integrate Learning Management Systems

722
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,000
It is done. in which

723
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,480
in a very interesting way like

724
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,039
One of our students created a wrapper

725
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,960
I had given that chat in GPT type

726
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,399
I used to have conversations but one of our

727
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,720
In a professor's tone. So if our

728
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,919
The professor used to abuse, so that rapper also used to abuse

729
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,480
I used to give. That kind of a thing. so there are

730
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,480
Some Interesting Business Opportunities There

731
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,320
For sure. I just hope the audience understands this

732
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,679
Realizing how big the business is

733
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,039
There is an opportunity. This is a very big business right now

734
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,799
There is an opportunity because there are a lot of

735
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,279
There are low hanging fruits. right now anything

736
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,760
Has not happened. means if

737
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:34,720
The ocean that is still left is just a bucket full

738
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:37,120
That's the one that has come out. ok friend

739
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,480
If someone had told me this 3 years ago

740
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,399
I would not believe that this wood has been a

741
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Reality. We give money to so many young people

742
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,640
Have to earn.

743
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,120
Very few people know about these things

744
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,039
Are. I just hope this podcast reaches us

745
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,360
Many people. or and I think they are three

746
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,320
Let's follow the philosophy of idiots, what does it mean

747
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,880
Learn a skill and you will get progress. Meaning

748
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,559
This is such a transferable skill, isn't it, AI?

749
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,159
I did entrepreneurship from LETS and

750
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
I failed at entrepreneurship.

751
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
Couldn't make anything with lettuce. But if I

752
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,240
You have acquired those skills, the same skills

753
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,320
Will you help me find a job? and a va

754
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,360
Probably a very good job also. Because

755
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,399
There is same amount of demand there too

756
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,880
There is a problem of supply. so i think this

757
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,279
use it as one of those opportunities that are

758
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
If brother fails then it doesn't matter.

759
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,720
What did I learn out of it? what i take

760
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,000
Out of it can help me find a job. So

761
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,840
In the last podcast, we presented

762
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
Engineering had broken down. End

763
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,000
That's the basis of all other AI skills I see

764
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,679
Feel. Yes. means over ai literacy when you

765
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,320
If you go for skill building then you will get success

766
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,360
Engineering is the one. Right now we have this A.I.

767
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,039
A little about the skills of architecture

768
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,240
I have talked about it. But to learn this you need to

769
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,200
You will have to take help of GPT. yes gpt

770
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,200
of the documentation or any other

771
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,200
You want to use the foundational model

772
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,679
You will remember in our last conversation

773
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
Said as specific use of Grok

774
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,000
The cases are great but the documentation is poor

775
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,840
Not there. This is how they create problems

776
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,840
He does that so that people don't make anything about him

777
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,919
that you are getting something that is valuable because

778
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,720
He doesn't have the documentation. Butt Chat

779
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,360
I don't know how many thousands are already created on GPT.

780
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,360
rappers are gone because there

781
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,039
Very good documentation is available. So

782
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,120
People are able to make it. Which chat box is this

783
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,000
In the category? Four documentation available

784
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Is. Right now the documentation of deep sea is also

785
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,120
It is decently done. Gemini's also decently

786
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,559
It is done. The best chart is that of JPT.

787
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,240
Ok. Moving on. We are that career

788
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,200
Were breaking down the prospects.

789
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,440
Right? So you did entrepreneurship

790
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,279
We. You speak about older established

791
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,799
Entrepreneurs and Entrepreneurs R

792
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,720
Just starting. Correct. People who just

793
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,200
Starting out having an AI element

794
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,039
It is needed in their businesses. Correct. They

795
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,360
What is Elementor? first pret engineering

796
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,600
Find out from him only. Just ask AI that I am

797
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,519
What should I do? then this documentation aspect

798
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,000
Come in. That means if you like a lot of tech

799
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,799
If you want to be specific then try to go low code,

800
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,320
No Code and AI First at Least in Creation

801
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,159
Off your MBP. If you don't know tech yet

802
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,919
I also have to stay here. Even if you are not a tech product

803
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,399
So actually the product you are making

804
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,879
You want to make a first move advantage in that

805
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,200
Low on having an AI strategy for

806
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,560
Yourself. Ok.

807
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,760
Any other aspects you might want to add

808
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,879
As for the entrepreneur's playbook? there

809
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,960
There is actually so much that you can add. Meaning

810
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,639
Generally, entrepreneurship has its own stages

811
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
There are. Your ideation stage is done,

812
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,119
Your MVP stage is done, your GTM is done

813
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,599
that the go to market stage is done, your

814
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,240
Market fit is achieved, product market fit

815
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,919
Done. And then you do a basic launch.

816
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,679
Right? AI will help you at every stage

817
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,440
Can. So not just the first stage.

818
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,280
Suppose your will is to make me an entrepreneur

819
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,599
I have to become one. But I don't know where to go.

820
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,359
Ask Gemini or Chat GPT that

821
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,320
What If I Want to Be an Entrepreneur

822
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,720
These renewable energies? what kind of

823
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,359
Problems can I solve. please give me a

824
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,240
Game plan. And understand, I'm not a

825
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,079
Hard working person. there for chowk out to

826
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,160
Hours of my day every day and you coach me too

827
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,480
Become a great entrepreneur in renewable

828
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,800
Energy. as i said it is very good to

829
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,560
Structure your thoughts. then use one of two

830
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
tools that I speak about which are better

831
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,960
et structuring. Like for such a thing

832
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,160
May be prereplexity or gemini wood give

833
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,720
you are a much better more specific response than

834
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,720
Chat Jeepity Wood Give But Go Ahead and Dut

835
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Right. Ok. can we move on from

836
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,839
Entrepreneurship? Yes. so let's do

837
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,480
Corporate? Yes. Ok. so corporates at

838
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,400
Present are very bullish on AI specially

839
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,040
In India. So a recent study was done

840
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,119
Where AI adoption is understood

841
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,839
an attempt was made to take over these corporates in a

842
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,880
Particular country. India was the highest

843
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,040
There. so 59% of corporates that

844
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,200
existed in india they said that you know we

845
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,480
We are very bullish on AIA. Adopt us

846
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Is. this was actually more than american

847
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,960
Companies, More Than Singapore, More Than

848
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Malaysia Extra. Right? let's break it down

849
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,040
Corporate careers are also in two parts.

850
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Ok? People who are in their 20s and people who are in their 30s

851
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,960
And are in the above. We first talk about 30s and above

852
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,240
For this, the use of AI at the workplace.

853
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,320
Tell me about it. I feel that this age

854
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,560
Actually there is a little fear in the group.

855
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,320
because this is a very new skill

856
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,480
And so on. We are a part of What's Your Advice? Very

857
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
Give practical advice. I think my

858
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,720
The Most Practical Advice Would Be First

859
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,599
try to focus on something that can save you

860
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Time and make you more productive. When you this

861
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,640
You will see that I have to fulfill my task

862
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,200
It was a day to do that which took me 8 hours

863
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,520
It seemed so. Right now I feel like seven. that one

864
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,240
The difference between the hours you will get is not of the day

865
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,400
Which you can probably use at home. Perhaps

866
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,400
You can use it to learn some other skill

867
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,920
You can. Maybe you are passionate about something

868
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,760
to do or just sit and chill

869
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,920
You can use it. That one hour is yours

870
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,160
will reduce my apprehension a little bit that

871
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,320
Why You Should Use It vs. Why You Shouldn't

872
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,240
Needed Mostly if you are in a corporate job

873
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,680
Do you even be a little cognizant that you

874
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,280
You are not sharing data anywhere. Own

875
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,599
Not sharing organization data

876
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
yes. But largely it is a minor task. Me

877
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,599
Have to write an email. Ok? write me an email

878
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,440
Is. Four things were highlighted in the email to me

879
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,520
Have to do it. Someone please give it to me in a structure.

880
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
Email me to get my first draft ready. They

881
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,440
You can get it done. I need to make a presentation

882
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,200
yes, I need to make a document, you do it

883
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,520
You can. I need to check my grammar, you can do that

884
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,440
You can get it done. from the same level if you

885
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,079
Even if you start, you will be able to

886
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,079
Build on because you will be saving time.

887
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,079
Ok? I myself have never had a corporate job

888
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,359
Did. A lot of my friends have

889
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,359
Have seen progress in the corporate world. We

890
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,400
And the harsh truth is this. he said

891
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,760
that if we want promotions then we will always do more

892
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,839
then you are asking me and second that is it

893
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,520
We have to play the game of human politics

894
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,160
Is. Hum we can't cover that aspect. He is yours

895
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,800
It is based on people skills. But this is the first one

896
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,160
The factor that is asked is that

897
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,040
Of you? Or AI could be used here.

898
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,000
You have an extra hour now, right?

899
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,760
In that you can do both one and two. We

900
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Right? When we over deliver,

901
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,440
The benchmark changes. so over

902
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,680
There is a problem with delivery as well

903
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,119
We have to constantly rewrite.

904
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,359
Right? Now if I use AI to do something

905
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,839
I can either do things quickly or do them better

906
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,680
I can. so i should do it as long as

907
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,119
There are no norms and rules against it

908
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,800
In my organization. Right? because

909
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,720
What does the strategy tell us that I

910
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Always be better than average. then i

911
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,800
I will succeed. So, you will get better than average

912
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,599
All people have the same AI to live in

913
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,040
It is available. Right? you have to constantly

914
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,079
understand what tools to use so that i

915
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Can do better than others. Previous Podcasts

916
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,200
We did not talk about deep research. quickly

917
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
please tell me what is deep research in this

918
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,480
World Way? All this machine learning and data

919
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
The science side, right? And in this our

920
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,480
The concept of deep research also comes into play.

921
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,119
which is just then looking at a lot of

922
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,280
Data and Synthesizing Insights. Because

923
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,680
One thing is that I have a lot of data and

924
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,520
There is a tool. but there is another thing that my

925
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,000
Whether he has business understanding or not

926
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,760
Is. My organization, weather it's a health

927
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,640
Care Organization, Wether It's a Finance

928
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,320
organisation, wether it is a it is a retail

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,200
organization, it's a it's a

930
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,000
Manufacturing Organization. to everyone's own

931
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,800
There are contextual things. Right? some of their

932
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,240
There are business goals. some of their processes and

933
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,359
There are SOPs that are set. with in that

934
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,920
understanding that I can translate a

935
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,640
Business problem into an analytical one

936
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,160
Problem? solve this analytical problem

937
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,160
Relying on AI. Right? and then throw back

938
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,920
Business Insights That Can Help Me Do

939
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,000
Better. When you go into this space

940
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,880
Ho na then you are unstoppable. I Feel

941
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,200
Incorporated. Ok. I would like to say two things.

942
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,280
First of all, deep research in Chat GPT

943
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,240
There is an option of. A in some cases if you have very

944
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,079
Gave detailed prompts to GPT that I

945
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,560
tell me about this, tell me about this, tell me about this, this

946
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,359
Tell me, tell me from these angles, etc. tall

947
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,640
Give a pull prompt to GPT. Put

948
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,520
The Deep Research Option on Giving Output

949
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,320
Maybe it will take time. 1 hour sometimes 3

950
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,359
It takes four hours. but if your request

951
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,000
very detailed and good question to you

952
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,280
The output will also be very strong. right now that

953
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,800
You can make up your own mind by reading the output

954
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,720
Apply and present it at your workplace

955
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,320
For better results in your career. thats

956
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,320
What did I do? This is a very practical scenario

957
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,359
Is. Yes of course right. 3-4 years ago if

958
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Work of this level had to be done. this whole process

959
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,160
Would you have taken a week to study research?

960
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,720
Put Together Data. see i will give you an

961
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,520
example right it's a very personal

962
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,520
Example to me when you do your PhD

963
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,359
Technically it takes you some six to eight months

964
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,000
State your problem properly

965
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,079
in structuring that exactly i

966
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,800
What do I want to know and how do I

967
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,880
I will contribute to the field of knowledge.

968
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Right? Now in the presence of AI, people are

969
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,000
we finish it within a week because

970
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,839
They do a deep search and it is very meaningful

971
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,280
The output comes and no one is saying that

972
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,720
You copy paste that output. Butt if

973
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,960
I have got 10 options. it's almost

974
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,319
like somebody very intelligent sing with me

975
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,800
And throwing ideas at me. Right? i can

976
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,280
Evaluate whether one of those ideas is a good one

977
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
Idea or not. I can develop it deeper. I

978
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Can do more research as follow up. I can add

979
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
My creativity to it. i can add my

980
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,440
Intelligence to it. But I want that which

981
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,599
Idea creation and initial search

982
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,240
There are too many of those elements right now

983
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,560
have been resolved. I mean you probably are

984
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Quickly read through the books you read at home

985
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,560
You can't search for things as quickly as you want

986
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,960
You can pay there. Ok.

987
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,680
So Effectively for Corporates

988
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,040
Corporates It's It If You Want To Like It

989
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,119
For example you are ML Eng, now we have ML

990
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,520
Sites with engineering and data scientists

991
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,400
I haven't talked about it but if you are a machine

992
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,359
Learning Person Right and You Know How to Work

993
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,200
with algorithms and in that you copilot

994
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,000
added what we were saying that the code

995
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,200
if you write very well then your life is enough

996
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,520
set is that means you you are able to then just

997
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,359
Solve business problems one after the other

998
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,839
right right and and it keeps you completely

999
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,560
Employable. you will never be scared that

1000
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,599
Hey, where did my job go? Wright Key Factor

1001
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,240
We are very concerned about the economy right now

1002
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,520
The situations that we have and how much the waste

1003
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,400
Influences Corporates Even in Offshorers

1004
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,599
Like Hours and Centre of Excellence as

1005
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,319
Hours. It's very important to ensure that your

1006
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,680
skill level is always at a place where

1007
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,760
nobody younger and like sort of nobody who is

1008
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,599
Much less experience than you can replace

1009
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
you are right and so you have to continue to

1010
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,359
learn even evolve please add to what i am

1011
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,960

Work on first and foremost AI literacy

1015
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,960
do it yourself this is a subject in itself

1016
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,280
It's a never ending subject because A.I.

1017
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,640
Constantly Evolving Correct. seconds you

yes i mean just to add on to that right now the way

1028
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,440
They Are Now Transforming Even Chat GPT

1029
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,680
extra is to say that even if somebody does not

1030
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,760
Know the right language even if English isn't

1031
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,440
their first language and they actually put

1032
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,119
Ah, a prompt that AI is working equally

1033
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,800
hard to understand where you are coming

1034
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,839
From. so if you make even 30% of the effort the

1035
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,240
Paining 70% of the effort will be made by ah

1036
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:17,280
The AI ​​Itself, Right? because it is genuinely

1037
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,079
It's my job to figure out what the user wants.

1038
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,079
There is responsibility. Right? and because of that

1039
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,480
That's what the whole algorithm is trying to do

1040
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,640
Brother I want to know what you want

1041
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,440
So, he will do all the hard work from his side.

1042
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,880
You have to just do the extra hard work.

1043
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,200
I think in just to add to your point. You

1044
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,839
Add three or four points, I think the

1045
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,560
The other last point is always be very aware

1046
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,960
Off your business. even if you think i'm just

that's not true everything in corporate

1050
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,560
turns into dollar value so figure out her

1051
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,560
A problem can be small or big which you

1052
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,119
Dollars associated with solving this

1053
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,359
What is the value and where is it in the chain?

1054
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,400
You can create an impact because that is

1055
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,839
also another way you show that i am an

1056
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,640
Invaluable employees of your company where you know

1057
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,200
I know where the money is flowing. Basically,

1058
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,000
By doing all these things you are telling your boss

1059
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,920
look if you want to make money you can't

1060
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,720
Take me out of yours. the work that i am doing

1061
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,400
Because of that the company is earning money. We

1062
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,839
ok moving on to the final chapter we are here

1063
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,240
Think Creative Professionals You Should Know

1064
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,079
Highlighted it. Public

1065
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,440
thing also like government employees

1066
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:36,000
Extra. so i think in addition to all the

1067
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,680
Improving Productivity Bit and All

1068
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,319
In India, there are many schemes from the government

1069
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,000
There is more push now toward AI

1070
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,720
drove things right so now a good

1071
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,880
Understanding of what all AI is capable of

1072
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,280
of doing. India has now finally come to us

1073
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,200
place where we are very good with public

1074
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,839
Private Partnerships Now. Right? So

1075
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,240
India's AI ecosystem is like China's

1076
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,640
was centralized and America had a lot of

1077
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,400
It was privatised. Very public of India

1078
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,400
It is a private run. So, our government

1079
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
Sets policies and makes changes

1080
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,240
Gives perspectives and private

1081
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Players can jump into what's out there

1082
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,720
Let us play our part. Such as

1083
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,200
At the time of Maha Kumbh, they did a lot of which

1084
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,280
Had AI involvement in it. so even if you

1085
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,000
are a government employee and i have some in

1086
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,240
my family they had to really have an

1087
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,640
Understanding how drones work, brother

1088
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,720
Are you? How is this data being captured?

1089
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,040
If 2300 has AI enabled cameras to

1090
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,119
Detect where the density of people has increased

1091
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,359
If so, what will I do with that data?

1092
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,280
How can I use it to manage it better

1093
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,079
In. if his job is only that

1094
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,640
I want to do crowd management. how can i

1095
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,839
Should I do crowd management? in bangalore now

1096
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,880
He has started the traffic

1097
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,599
Management Using AI Right Because We All Know

1098
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:53,920
HOW BAD THE BORDER TRAFFIC IS. so even if i

1099
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,400
Am a public sector employee more and more

1100
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,359
we are seeing that there is at least this

1101
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,920
The overlap that we're having where AI is

1102
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,319
touching some of the work that I do, some of the

1103
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,119
Decision making that I do. may be like

1104
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,240
For corporates, the data they say is that

1105
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,920
40% of jobs are already AI touched. Maybe

1106
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,040
it's not that high a number right now for the

1107
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,880
Public Sector But It's Likely To Go Up

1108
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,640
because governments have now started to

1109
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,520
Work with a lot of private players in

1110
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,960
order to execute that bhaiya we will formulate

1111
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,200
do. We will give you ideas. We

1112
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,839
I will make a strategy. You execute it.

1113
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,160
Right? So, all of those places. and then

1114
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,319
creative field of course there is

1115
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,000
a lot that has been happening in that

1116
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:40,000
Space as well. So, if you are a creative

1117
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,240
The person who is not really looking to be very

1118
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,160
Entrepreneurial So that. so you just want

1119
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,880
To create a product. like let's say even

1120
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,200
For joy. Right? let's say i am somebody who

1121
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,960
Likes Writing Poetry for Joy. Right? You

1122
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,200
don't have to just convert it into a

1123
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,520
Business also. but of course there are business

1124
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:01,359
The elements are there. there are very very

1125
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,599
Specific Tools Such Just Copy AI For

1126
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,319
Content Creation But Also the Foundational

1127
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:10,560
Tools have a lot of space where they have

1128
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:12,880
Democratized in a way access right earlier

1129
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,960
Maybe because Ranveer has a very

1130
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,280
Ranveer was the only good editor in the team

1131
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,640
I was able to do good editing. but now maybe

1132
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,200
Nandini also came on the basis of an AI tool

1133
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,359
A very well edited YouTube video of yours

1134
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Can make it. Because that tool also made noise

1135
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,400
I reduced it. That tool also provided the light

1136
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,119
I have optimised it. aa somewhere stop words

1137
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Aa Aa I was doing it. He detected that too

1138
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,240
And I edited it out. so what is it now

1139
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,319
Used to be? very much because of that

1140
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,079
The field is being democratized. Creative

1141
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:46,559
Field Specialty Content Creation Writing

1142
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,040
Again going back to our first conversation

1143
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,319
that we know the ethics of who does what

1144
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,880
will keep in mind whose ownership it is and

1145
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:57,760
Keep in mind whose consent is there or not.

1146
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,880
K there is still a lot of tools that are

1147
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,480
able to help you out ok a lot of

1148
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,280
This is the question that has been asked in both episodes so far.

1149
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,400
I have not asked you what AI agents are

1150
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,599
What AI agents basically do is

1151
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,760
These are our existing AIs that still exist

1152
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,319
Let's place it in an environment, right?

1153
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,400
Let's do some specific things

1154
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,960
inside which we have remembered what you remember

1155
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,359
I have talked so many times that Bhaiya, where we are

1156
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:28,240
which is our general artificial

1157
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,559
Where we need to be on intelligence

1158
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,880
We have started his journey. AI

1159
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,119
Agents are the journey we started

1160
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,480
in which we are saying that you are something

1161
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,280
Can you take a decision? knowing that your

1162
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,920
Have access to Chat GPT. knowing that you

1163
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,160
Be placed in an environment. Do you?

1164
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,960
Can you take any one decision or not? As

1165
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,200
That they are launching a new version of Alexa as well

1166
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,520
which is saying that friend look at Alexa first

1167
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,240
There was Narrow AI. I was just talking to you.

1168
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,559
Meaning, he would only read and listen to your words.

1169
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,640
I used to translate. to figure out

1170
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,119
I used to try. What is intent? you spoke

1171
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,040
Play a song. He heard the play. She has her own

1172
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,640
Played the song from the repository. So first

1173
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,440
It was narrow AI. then a lot of sorts of

1174
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,760
versions later it becomes generative in a way that

1175
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,920
On its back end, run a GPT model like

1176
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,720
I used to do it and based on that also that output

1177
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,440
was able to generate verbal output that

1178
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,599
was generative but now we want to move further

1179
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,359
And whether he is able to take any decision

1180
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,359
is it there or am not able to take it means that again

1181
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,880
Things like is he able to make that booking

1182
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,960
is what I want him to do

1183
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,680
I am able to tell him Alexa call this person

1184
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,680
and say that i am running late by 15 minutes

1185
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,839
but but that guy didn't pick up the phone so Alexa

1186
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,440
What did Edge N output? So now he himself

1187
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:45,680
Is able to do some decision making. That

1188
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,839
That's where we're trying to go. this is

1189
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,520
Typically AI agents. when you place an

1190
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:53,520
AI in an Environment and After Reading the

1191
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,160
environment after understanding all that

1192
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,280
can this happen in the environment the ai agent

1193
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,839
Tries to take a decision. for example i

1194
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:06,640
I am a content creator. we would you say that

1195
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:08,800
An AI agent in my life

1196
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,760
Can work as a content strategy

1197
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,520
Based on data of content. yes, can

1198
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Are. So effectively is an AI agent a bot

1199
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,880
The one whom you train that friend look at me

1200
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,559
This is what is needed in my industry. not just

1201
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,200
Give training because it is predictive

1202
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,400
Done. If I told everything. C Ye

1203
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,319
So if I told you about this picture

1204
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
Look and tell me whether this is a cat or not.

1205
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,839
In that I am telling you to find the tail

1206
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,640
Where from? Find where is the ear? find it

1207
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:40,240
Where is Whiskers? that's not what we are

1208
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Talking about. We were there before, where

1209
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,319
This is very rule based. then we take seconds

1210
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,920
came here on the stage where we saw him

1211
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,680
Gave me lots of photographs. Thousand

1212
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
Gave me photographs of the cat and said that

1213
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,319
Brother, whoever looks like this is a cat

1214
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,559
Is. Then we progressed further to the stage when

1215
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:57,520
I asked him friend, what kind of cat can you make?

1216
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,240
It is visible. All that you know. Now we are more

1217
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,800
we're going to go a little bit further into that

1218
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,200
Still doing all these things. We him

1219
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,760
You can also give rules by hard coding them. We

1220
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,760
You can tell him other things also. but also

1221
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,720
He can also self learn. such as he

1222
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,960
That's your own YouTube video

1223
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,760
I can tell by looking at it that perhaps when I saw this

1224
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,599
I didn't take the old thumbnail but took another one

1225
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,520
no better

1226
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,880
People were clicking meaning. So now I do this

1227
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,800
I will do it. So he did it to himself

1228
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,680
Also did the testing in away. give an example

1229
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,920
You can use an AI agent. AI Agents

1230
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,240
Alexa AI is for example and an

1231
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,880
Example. Cloud AI is an example of this

1232
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,839
Are all examples of AI agent clout

1233
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,400
Clot is Clod can do a lot of things

1234
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:43,440
Firstly right Claude was started by

1235
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,720
People who are researchers in Open AI and

1236
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,520
Kind of Drifted Away by Wright and Claude

1237
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,880
The basic sort of structure is called this

1238
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,960
is designed in such a way that it

1239
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,960
Can solve complex problems. Now

1240
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,200
The Complex Problem Solving Website

1241
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,880
It can also be in the context of design,

1242
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,640
It can also be in the context of writing

1243
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,960
It is also in the context of audio-visual

1244
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,280
Might be possible. but the ability that they are

1245
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,200
trying to build in cloud is that one of those

1246
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,880
problem solving complex things

1247
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,520
And we can be a little more ethical. Meaning

1248
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,480
There the security is high, privacy is maintained

1249
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,400
There should be no concerns. It does not take any such data

1250
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,040
is doing something he doesn't have permission to do

1251
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,680
To take. a lot of these foundational AIs

1252
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,319
Are also getting in that direction. Clot

1253
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,119
just happens to be the one that was built on

1254
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:32,319
Dos Fundamental Principles.

1255
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,720
Is it a rapper? No No Claude Is Foundational

1256
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,599
In a way it is not really a rapper. it's not

1257
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,240
Built on top of something. Claude is what

1258
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,000
You build something on top of it. so would you say

1259
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,680
Especially for creative professionals

1260
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,319
But for professionals from any industry

1261
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,119
For.

1262
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,960
A lot of people can say that friend this

1263
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,920
Look, this is my job. this is my job

1264
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,640
There are requirements. I do this at my job

1265
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:59,280
I do this. These are all my tasks.

1266
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,440
Now with this app chat is gpt

1267
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,920
Whichever Gemini you are please list out

1268
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,920
Who are the best agents for me?

1269
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,000
Relay from industry. Correct. oh lord my

1270
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:15,599
Help me. It's basically that right. it's

1271
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,079
It's like not just agents. you ask him

1272
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,559
What skills should I develop?

1273
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,880
You ask him is there an AI for it?

1274
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,960
Right? You ask him if there are any rappers who

1275
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,359
Better do it. You ask him if any

1276
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,119
there is a specific foundational tool that maybe

1277
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:31,760
Works better for my use case. As

1278
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,599
We discussed that Bhaiya Grok

1279
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,599
It works much better. If you have social media

1280
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,000
I want to do analysis, sentiment analysis

1281
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,400
Have to do it, have to do SEO optimization. So

1282
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,400
If I have a specific industry and its

1283
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,280
If a foundational model does better for

1284
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,119
Which model is that? Right? If I am a

1285
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,440
If I go a step further back, then if I have

1286
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,720
Right now there are no jobs for us new people

1287
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,119
Let's talk. You can get your CV created by AI

1288
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,960
yes. Have you seen any job in any

1289
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,319
Do you think this job is for me on the portal?

1290
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,920
It is a good job. You give that feed to AI and say

1291
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,079
Can you tell me what skills I need

1292
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,680
I am not eligible for this job. which one is this

1293
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,240
There are skills that I have, on which I can

1294
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,640
I can focus in interviews. You Company

1295
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,880
You can prepare a specific interview for him

1296
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,920
Because of. There are so many things that we do

1297
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:20,079
You can because of AI now. Got it. These

1298
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,960
Perhaps the two most useful podcasts of 2025.

1299
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,520
But those who are hungry for career growth

1300
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,480
For them correct career growth

1301
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,200

my or

1305
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,720
After these two podcasts I feel like I wish

1306
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,720

1307
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,640
Being a Podcaster for Different Industries

In our country, technology
