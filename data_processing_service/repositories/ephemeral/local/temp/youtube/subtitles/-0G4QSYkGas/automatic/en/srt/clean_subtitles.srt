Hello Friends.  Friends, from time to time there are wars in different parts of the world like Africa, Middle East and Ukraine and in view of this the Indian Government has to launch operations so that Indians can be brought back from there safely.  And keeping this in mind, especially from your exam perspective, keep in mind that the operation launched to evacuate Indians from Iran is named Operation Sindhu.  But there was a problem in this.  The problem that arose was that at present there is a full-scale war going on between Israel and Iran. Missiles are being fired continuously. Even hypersonic missiles have been launched. So it is obvious that whenever Iran sees such a situation, it closes its entire airspace. And obviously, if we bring it through land through different countries, it will take a very long time.  A lot of time will pass and the danger will also increase.  So keeping this in mind, finally let me tell you that Iran has made an exception for India, yes Iran has made its airspace open so that Indian students could be brought back from there.  So let us understand this in a little detail as to why exactly this matters so much and especially let me tell you that there is important news here for Armenia as well.   The small country that you see here, Armenia, has also played a very important role and our relationship with Armenia is still very young. So let's know about it.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC, you must avail our Pratigya batch.  There are many features in it. If you have any doubt, my team is sitting here, just call on this number which is given and all your doubts will be solved and tell them to use this code Ankit Live so that you can avail the maximum discount. Let's get started.  The first question is why Operation Sindhu had to be launched ?  It's a simple thing.  There was a war between Israel and Iran and you must be seeing everything right now including missile strikes, drone attacks, and because of this, many foreign students, professionals in Iran are stuck here. If I talk about India, it is being said that more than 4000 Indian citizens were in Iran at this time and you will see them in different cities, especially in Iran, their capital is Tehran.  Here, if you look at the eastern side, you will see Mashhad there and just below Tehran, there is this city, Com, and look, this becomes very dangerous because just next to Com, as you might have heard, there is a nuclear facility, which attempts are being made to hit. So these are some important cities, where so many attacks are being witnessed and many Indian students are stranded there, in fact if you see among the more than 4000 citizens, maximum of them are students and even among the students, if you look, you will mostly find students from Jammu and Kashmir.  So keeping this in mind, we had to save them and take them out from there.  The Indian government launched Operation Sindhu.  Sindhu, you all know, is a river, the Indus river, it is named after it in a way that reflects continuity and civilization.  Well, what are the main objectives of Operation Sindhu?  It is a simple thing that all Indians should be evacuated from the high risk areas of Iran and using the safe passage, diplomatic channels, whatever we have to use, we have to bring them back home safely and somewhere or the other, psychological, medical, logistical support which the people need at this time, the Indians who are stranded there, everything should be provided, so whether it is air, land or multinational corridors, whatever things are required, this is being done by using them. Now the question here is what exception did Iran make and why?  Look, as I was telling you, whenever a war like situation arises, even small things happen, Iran closes its entire airspace and right now a full scale war is going on.  So in the meantime, creating an exception here becomes a big deal in itself.  So because of this, the Iranian authorities here have approved a temporary corridor so that Indian evacuation flights can fly directly from Iran and bring them to India.  should be brought to Delhi.  And at least let me tell you that there are three charter flights to your city Masad, in fact it was being said that many of the students were first brought here from Tehran to Masad and the flights took off from there and they reached India. I am saying it has reached because since last night the news had come that the three flights that took off are bringing students from there.   There are at least around a thousand students who are being brought back now and one had already reached last night.  So the flights are continuously arriving here. Now as far as the experience of the students is concerned, the students said that they were facing a lot of problems in Iran. Meaning he has witnessed the bombings.  The internet went black out. Now this becomes a big problem.  You need to pass on some information.  If you want to watch something and the internet is blacked out, how will you do it?  There was a power cut.  There was a great fear of drone attacks.  Then, shortages started occurring.  In many areas of food, water, medical supplies.  And in a way the students have had to suffer psychological trauma.  In fact, some controversy also occurred.  I would n't want to go into that.  But you must have heard that some of the students here had also complained that everything was fine till the buses and flights reached Delhi. But from there, when they were being taken to Jammu and Kashmir by bus, its condition was very bad.  But immediately Chief Minister Omar Abdullah intervened and better quality buses were provided here. Anyway, you can see here that the students say that it was like living in a war movie.  We Could See Missiles Overhead.  This is what the medical student says.  In fact, he praised the Indian Embassy a lot and said that it was like our second home during those days.  In fact, let me tell you that I was watching the interviews of the students. He said that he was picked up exactly from his doorstep where he was living and brought here.  So whatever help could be provided was done.  In fact, you can see that 247 control rooms have been opened in Tehran and New Delhi.  Numbers etc. were launched here. Coordinated closely with the Iranian Foreign Ministry and local authorities, Indigo flights were mobilized here.  And the Indian embassies here in the neighbouring countries like Armenia, Turkmenistan, Oman have also been prepared for backup transit. Now the question here is, why does the airspace opened by Iran for India matter so much?  This is unprecedented.  As I told you, Iran usually completely closes its entire airspace during war time. So doing it at that time and especially now, it becomes a big thing in itself. This, somewhere, shows the diplomatic trust that exists.  Now see, it becomes interesting because Iran knows this.  Everyone knows how close India is with Israel.  So despite that, doing this thing is a big thing in itself.  And Iran must also be trying to show humanitarian optics somewhere, Iran too must be trying to say that despite all these situations, we had opened the airspace for India on humanitarian grounds and the corridor was carefully timed so that the Israeli missiles do not reach Iran at that time, at least it is okay now it is possible that India may have spoken to Israel also that our flights are flying, please do not fire missiles for now, anything can happen, there is no confirmation yet, like for example, at the time of Russia-Ukraine war, it was decided that we had spoken to both Ukraine and Russia that at that time at least no firing of any kind should be done in this entire corridor. So whatever it is, it belongs to Iran.  But secondly, what is being discussed a lot here is about Armenia.  Now look here I want to explain something to you.  If you look at the map, there are many countries around Iran, which are its neighbouring countries.  In fact, you will be able to see total seven neighbouring countries. Now what is the problem for India? See, after Operation Sindoor, if you see, our relations had deteriorated with both Azar Bhaijaan who is from Turkey.   What I mean to say is that when Operation Sindhu was launched here, we could not take a direct flight from Iran. So the only option we had was to take him to another country through the land border and from there take a flight to bring him to India.  So the problem was that after Operation Sindoor, our relations with Azhar Bhaijaan and Turkey had deteriorated so we couldn't do it.  As far as Pakistan is concerned, you all know that Balochistan is here and Pakistan is obvious that we could not come from there again.  So three countries went away just like that.  Then as far as the question of Afghanistan is concerned, look, we do not have any official relations with Afghanistan yet. Ok?  Which is currently being ruled by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Some conversation or the other keeps happening through the back channel. But we have still not established official relations.  So the question arises that now here only Turkmenistan is left, one is your Iraq and here comes Armenia.  So as far as Turkmenistan is concerned, it was being said that there is a very sparsely located area here.  Meaning very few people live here.  So there could have been many logistical issues.  If we tried to go to Turkmenistan here. As far as Iraq is concerned, now see it lies between Israel and Iran. So here also many air bases were closed.  So it was becoming difficult from there also.  And that is why in the end the only such country left was your Armenia.  This small country from where we finally got help and we were bound to get help because at this time relations between India and Armenia are very good and here you can see that due to the closed Iranian airspace, we used the overland routes and in Armenia, if you look from Megri to Yerawan, I will show you, this what you are seeing is your Iran and land border, basically the land border of Iran and Armenia, here what you are seeing is inside Armenia, this place Megri, so the students were first brought here to Megri and then from there, bypassing, they were brought to Armenia, sorry, Yeran is the capital of Armenia, they were brought there and then after flying from there, finally the flight reached Delhi, there were around 110 students in it who were brought, but yes obviously when Iran opened its airspace and made an exception for India, then we did not need that because then we could have brought them directly by flight. Well, if you look at the defence partnership here, then as of today, India has become the biggest defence partner for Armenia.  Especially since 2020, its tension with Azerbaijan has been very high.  So there are many reasons because of which and here if you see the Indian defense system, we have supplied a lot of it to Armenia.  Swathi became Weapon Lock Locating Radar.  Pinaka became a missile.  ATAGS are now Hoizers. Akash One became the air defence system which we had also used here recently in Operation Sindoor. So because of all these things, our partnership is very important and it also has a geo-strategic impact because if you look at Armenia, it has become like a showcase for Indian weapons in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  This helps to challenge the influence of Turkey and Pakistan within that entire region.  And in the future if we need a logistics base etc. then Armenia can help us. So this is very important regarding relations with Armenia and again with Iran and as far as the question is concerned, if you talk about earlier evacuations then you can look at the entire history.  We had evacuated them from Yemen in 2015 under Operation Rahat. In 2021, he was evacuated from Afghanistan by launching Operation Devshakti.  Ah, there was a conflict in Sudan in 2023, we launched Operation Kaveri there.  And in 2022 you can see that Operation Ganga-Ganga was launched to bring back your Indians from the Ukraine War.  So, this was the whole video friends.  I hope you have got as much detailed information about evacuation as you could.  And before I go, a very interesting question.  Can you tell?
