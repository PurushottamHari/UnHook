00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello Friends.  Friends, from time to time there are wars in different parts of the world like Africa,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,040
Middle East and Ukraine

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,519

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,000
and in view of this the Indian Government has to

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,799
launch operations so that

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,480
Indians can be brought back from there safely.  And keeping this in mind,

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
especially

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,439
from your exam perspective, keep in mind that the

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
operation launched to evacuate Indians from Iran

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,160
is named Operation Sindhu.  But there was a

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,400
problem in this.  The problem that arose was that at

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
present there is a full-scale war going on between Israel and Iran.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
Missiles are being fired continuously.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
Even hypersonic missiles have been launched.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
So it is obvious that whenever Iran

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,680
sees such a situation,

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
it closes its entire airspace.

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,559
And obviously, if we

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
bring it through land through different countries, it will take a

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
very long time.  A lot of time will pass

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,600
and the danger will also increase.  So keeping

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
this in mind, finally let me tell you that

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,280
Iran has made

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,399
an exception for India, yes Iran has made its

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,559
airspace open so that Indian

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,080
students could be brought back from there.  So let us

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
understand this in a little detail as to

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,400
why exactly this matters so much

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
and especially let me tell you that there is

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
important news here for Armenia as well.   The

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
small country that you see here,

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
Armenia, has also played a very important

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,960
role and our relationship

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,400
with Armenia is still very young.

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,159
So let's know about it.  But

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
preparing for UPSC, you

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,759

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,600
must avail our Pratigya batch.  There are many features in it.

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,600
If you have any doubt, my

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
team is sitting here,

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
just call on this number which is given

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,600
and all your doubts will be solved

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
and tell them to use this code Ankit Live

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
so that you can avail the maximum discount.

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
Let's get started.  The first

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,799
question is why Operation Sindhu had to be launched

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,000
?  It's a simple thing.  There was a

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,399
war between Israel and Iran and

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,720
you must be seeing everything right now including missile strikes, drone attacks,

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,720
and because of this,

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,320
many foreign students,

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,360
professionals in Iran are stuck here.

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,479
If I talk about India, it is being said

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,360
that more than 4000 Indian citizens were

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,120
in Iran at this time and

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
you will see them in different cities, especially in Iran,

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
their capital is Tehran.  Here, if you look

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,080
at the eastern side,

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,440
you will see Mashhad

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,680
there and just below Tehran, there is this city,

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Com, and look, this becomes very dangerous

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,560
because just next to Com, as

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,680
you might have heard, there is a nuclear facility,

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,959
which attempts are being made to hit.

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,280
So these are some important cities,

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,440
where so many attacks are being witnessed

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,920
and many Indian students are stranded there, in

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,760
fact if you see among the more than 4000 citizens,

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,080
maximum of them are

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
students and even among the students,

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
if you look, you will mostly find

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
students from Jammu and Kashmir.  So keeping this in

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,120
mind, we had to save them and

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,599
take them out from there.  The Indian government launched

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
Operation Sindhu.  Sindhu, you all know, is a

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,239
river, the Indus river, it is named after it in a

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,200
way that reflects continuity and

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
civilization.  Well,

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,599
what are the main objectives of Operation Sindhu?  It is a simple

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,159
thing that all Indians should be

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,080
evacuated from the high risk areas of Iran and using the

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,959
safe passage, diplomatic channels,

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
whatever we have to use, we have to

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,840
bring them back home safely and somewhere or the other,

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
psychological, medical, logistical support which the

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
people need at this time, the Indians who are

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
stranded there, everything should be provided, so

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,799
whether it is air, land or

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,959
multinational corridors, whatever

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
things are required, this is being done by using them.

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,599
Now the question here is

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,840
what exception did Iran make

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
and why?  Look, as I was

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
telling you, whenever a war like

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,599
situation arises, even small things happen,

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,519
Iran closes its entire

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,400
airspace and right now a

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
full scale war is going on.  So in the meantime,

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,200
creating an exception here becomes a

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,120
big deal in itself.  So because of this, the

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,480
Iranian authorities here have

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,959
approved a temporary corridor

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,439
so that Indian evacuation flights can

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,599
fly directly from Iran and

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,920
bring them to India.  should be brought to Delhi.  And

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,879
at least let me tell you that there are three charter

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,199
flights to your city Masad, in

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,759
fact it was being said that many of the

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
students were first brought here from Tehran to

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,560
Masad and the flights took off from there

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
and they reached India.

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
I am saying it has reached because since last night

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
the news had come that the three flights that took off are

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
bringing students from there.   There are at

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
least around a thousand students

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,400
who are being brought back now and one had

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
already reached last night.  So the

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
flights are continuously arriving here.

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
Now as far as the experience of the students is

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
concerned, the

123
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,919
students said that

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,840
they were facing a lot of problems in Iran.

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
Meaning he has

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
witnessed the bombings.  The internet went black out.

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,520
Now this becomes a big problem.  You need to

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
pass on some information.  If you want to

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
watch something and the internet is blacked out,

130
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
how will you do it?  There was a power cut.  There was a

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,759
great fear of drone attacks.  Then,

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,919
shortages started occurring.  In many areas of food, water,

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,840
medical supplies.  And in a

134
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
way the students have had to

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,240
suffer psychological trauma.  In fact, some

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,320
controversy also occurred.  I would

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
n't want to go into that.  But you must have heard that

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
some of the students here had

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,039
also complained that everything was

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
fine till the buses and flights reached Delhi.

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,280
But from there, when they were being taken to Jammu and Kashmir

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
by bus, its condition was

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,840
very bad.  But immediately Chief

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,800
Minister Omar Abdullah intervened

145
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
and better quality buses were

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,479
provided here. Anyway,

147
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,479
you can see here that the students

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,120
say that it was like living in a war

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
movie.  We Could See Missiles Overhead.  This is what the

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
medical student says.  In fact,

151
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,840
he praised the Indian Embassy a lot

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,680
and said that it was like our second home

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,919
during those days.  In fact, let me tell you

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
that I was watching the interviews of the students.

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,039
He said that he was picked up

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,000
exactly from his doorstep where he was living

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,240
and

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
brought here.  So whatever help

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
could be provided was done.  In fact, you

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
can see that 247 control rooms have been

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
opened in Tehran and New Delhi.  Numbers

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,800
etc. were launched here.

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,960
Coordinated closely with the Iranian

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Foreign Ministry and local authorities,

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,720
Indigo flights were

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,800
mobilized here.  And the

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,199
Indian embassies here in the neighbouring countries like

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,199
Armenia, Turkmenistan, Oman have

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
also been prepared for backup transit.

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
Now the question here is,

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,919

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,080
why does the airspace opened by Iran for India matter so much?  This

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,880
is unprecedented.  As I told you,

174
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,520
Iran usually completely closes its entire airspace during war time.

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,520

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
So doing it at that time and especially

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,080
now, it becomes a big thing in itself.

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
This, somewhere,

179
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,120
shows the diplomatic trust that exists.  Now see, it becomes

180
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
interesting because

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Iran knows this.  Everyone knows

182
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
how close India is with Israel.  So

183
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
despite that, doing this thing is a

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
big thing in itself.  And

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
Iran must also be trying to show humanitarian optics somewhere,

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
Iran too must be trying to say that

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
despite all these situations, we had

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,319

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,560
opened the airspace for India on humanitarian grounds and the

190
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,440
corridor was carefully timed

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,840
so that the Israeli missiles do

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
not reach Iran at that time, at least it is okay

193
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,240
now it is possible that India may have

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
spoken to Israel also that our flights are

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
flying, please do not

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
fire missiles for now, anything can happen, there is

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,080
no confirmation yet, like for example, at the

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
time of Russia-Ukraine war, it was decided

199
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,560
that we had spoken to both Ukraine and Russia

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,960
that at that time at least no firing of

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
any kind should be done in this entire corridor.

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,599
So whatever it is, it belongs to

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
Iran.  But secondly, what is being

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
discussed a lot here is

205
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
about Armenia.  Now look here I

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,479
want to explain something to you.  If you

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,160
look at the map, there are many countries around Iran, which are its

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,080
neighbouring countries.  In fact,

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
you will be able to see total seven neighbouring countries.

210
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Now what is the problem for India?

211
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,160
See, after Operation Sindoor, if you see,

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,560
our relations had

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,120
deteriorated with both Azar Bhaijaan who is from Turkey.   What I

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,319
mean to say is that when

215
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,319
Operation Sindhu was launched here,

216
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
we could not take a direct flight from Iran.

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
So the only option we had was to

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,960
take him to another country through the land border

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
and from there take a flight to

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,800
bring him to India.  So the problem was

221
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,879
that after Operation Sindoor, our relations with Azhar Bhaijaan and

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
Turkey had deteriorated so

223
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,960
we couldn't do it.  As far as Pakistan is

224
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,039
concerned, you all know that Balochistan is

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,039
here and Pakistan is obvious that

226
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,279
we could not come from there again.  So three

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,039
countries went away just like that.  Then as far as the question

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,000
of Afghanistan is concerned, look,

229
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,200
we do not have any official relations with Afghanistan yet.

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,279
Ok?  Which is currently being ruled by the Taliban in

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
Afghanistan.

232
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,800
Some conversation or the other keeps happening through the back channel.

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,200
But

234
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,279
we have still not established official relations.  So the question

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,000
arises that now here only

236
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,160
Turkmenistan is left, one is your Iraq and

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
here comes Armenia.  So as far as

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,040
Turkmenistan is concerned, it was being said

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,200
that there is a very sparsely

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
located area here.  Meaning very few people

241
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,880
live here.  So there could have been many logistical

242
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,519
issues.  If we

243
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,279
tried to go to Turkmenistan here.

244
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,760
As far as Iraq is concerned, now see

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
it lies between Israel and Iran.

246
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,920
So here also many air

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,839
bases were closed.  So it was

248
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,720
becoming difficult from there also.  And that is why

249
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,279
in the end the only such country left was

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,600
your Armenia.  This small country from where

251
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,920
we finally got help and we were bound to get help

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
because at this time relations between India and Armenia are

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,279
very good and here you

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,920
can see that due to the closed Iranian

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,760
airspace, we used the overland routes

256
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,560
and in Armenia, if you

257
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,200
look from Megri to Yerawan, I will show you, this what

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,200
you are seeing is your Iran

259
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,959
and land border, basically the land border of Iran and Armenia,

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
here what you are seeing

261
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,279
is inside Armenia, this

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,320
place Megri, so the students were first brought here to

263
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,560
Megri and then from there, bypassing,

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,519
they were brought to Armenia, sorry, Yeran is the

265
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,160
capital of Armenia, they were brought there

266
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,279
and then after flying from there,

267
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,560
finally the flight reached Delhi, there were

268
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,320
around 110 students in it

269
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,040
who were brought, but yes obviously

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
when Iran opened its airspace and made an

271
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
exception

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
for India, then we did not need that

273
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,440
because then we could have brought them directly by flight.

274
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Well,

275
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
if you look at the defence partnership here, then as of today,

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,120
India has become the biggest defence

277
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
partner for Armenia.  Especially since 2020,

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,680
its tension with Azerbaijan has been

279
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
very high.  So there are many reasons

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
because of which and here if you see the

281
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Indian defense system, we have

282
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,880
supplied a lot of it to Armenia.  Swathi

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,519
became Weapon Lock Locating Radar.  Pinaka

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,560
became a missile.  ATAGS are now Hoizers.

285
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,200
Akash One became the air defence system which

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,680
we had also used here recently in Operation Sindoor.

287
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
So because of all these things,

288
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
our partnership is very important and it

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
also has a geo-strategic impact

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
because if you look at Armenia, it has become

291
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
like a showcase for

292
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,640
Indian weapons in Eastern Europe and Central

293
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,560
Asia.  This helps to

294
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,480
challenge the influence of Turkey and Pakistan

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,720
within that entire region.  And

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,040
in the future if we need a logistics base etc. then

297
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,360
Armenia can help us.

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,440
So this is very important regarding

299
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,839

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,240
relations with Armenia and again with Iran and as far as the question is concerned, if

301
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
you talk about earlier evacuations then

302
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,440
you can look at the entire history.  We had evacuated them from Yemen in 2015

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,839
under Operation Rahat.

304
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
In 2021, he was evacuated from Afghanistan by

305
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
launching Operation Devshakti.  Ah, there was a

306
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
conflict in Sudan in 2023,

307
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,640
we launched Operation Kaveri there.  And

308
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,200
in 2022 you can see that Operation Ganga-Ganga was launched

309
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,760
to

310
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,440
bring back your Indians from the Ukraine War.  So, this

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
was the whole video friends.  I hope you have got

312
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,600

313
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
as much detailed information about evacuation as you could.  And

314
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
before I go, a very interesting

315
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,200
question.  Can you tell?  What was the key

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,399
objective of India's involvement

317
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
in Iran Jawahar Port?  What is the main objective of

318
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,120
India's involvement in the Jawahar Port in Iran

319
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,959

320
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
?  You tell me this.  You all know its right answer.  You will
