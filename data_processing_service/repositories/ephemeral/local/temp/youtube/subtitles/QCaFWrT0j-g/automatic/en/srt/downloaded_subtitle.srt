1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
So, I messaged my closest friends. Can

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,799
you tell me what question you have that

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,200
you wouldn't ever say out loud? Give me

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,000
a few. How can I be satisfied with just

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,400
one sexual partner? I have my partner.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
Should I tell them? I no longer find my

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,400
partner attractive, but I don't know how

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
to tell her. We have a lot to talk

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
about. You going to record me today?

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,279
Okay. All right. Here's what I would

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
suggest. Esther PL is regarded as one of

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,560
the most sought after relationship

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
therapists in the world. For the past 40

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,599
years, she's been helping millions of

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
people with her brutally honest and

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
wildly relatable insights. People are

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,160
having less sex. Why is the sex getting

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
less interesting? No, their life with

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,399
each other is less interesting. And what

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
concerns me at this moment, it's the

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
loss of social skills, but they are

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,840
vital to us. And we have less and less

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
opportunities to practice because we are

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,920
pursuing connection beyond the human

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
world. People don't have partner sex,

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
they have sex on porn. We also are

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
surrounded by algorithmic perfections

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,520
and that's creating warped expectations

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,280
that we bring to our relationships and

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
then there's the misery of the dating

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
app. Have you heard this story of the

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,439
guy who swiped 2 million times to get

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,600
one date? Oh god. It appears that you

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
have many options but you'll swipe swipe

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,720
swipe and you're going to get frustrated

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
because you don't get matched with

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
anybody. But don't make the app become

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
the replacement where you can actually

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,920
go outside, meet people, and also deal

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
with rejection because it's a major

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
feature to develop relationships. But

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
we've never been more free, but we've

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
never been more alone and more filled

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
with self-doubt. So, tell me how to fix

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
it in order to have a great

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,759
relationship. There's a ton of really

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,759
important things. The first thing this

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,119
This has always blown my mind a little

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,119
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,600
before we start? If you like the show

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
and you like what we do here and you

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,799
want to support us, the free simple way

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
that you can do just that is by hitting

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
the subscribe button. And my commitment

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
everything in my power, me and my team,

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
to make sure that this show is better

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
for you every single week. We'll listen

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,039
to your feedback. We'll find the guests

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
that you want me to speak to and we'll

63
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,720
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
much.

65
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,959
[Music]

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
Esther, with all that you know and with

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
all that you study and with all that you

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,520
research and write about and think

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,360
about,

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,959
what is it that concerns you most? What

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,319
is front of mind for you when you think

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
about mating and dating and human

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
connection?

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,599
What concerns me most

75
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,720
I think is the fact that uh there is a

76
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,920
unique moment in history at this moment

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,360
where we are redesigning our

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,480
communication our way ways of connecting

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
our ways of answering the big questions

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,239
but specifically in the realm of

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,519
relationships it's social atrophy I

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,200
think we are losing social skills and

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
the word atrophy for anyone that doesn't

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,640
know is atrophy is when you don't use

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,560
muscles they go numb. Social atrophy is

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,360
when you no longer know how to speak to

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,879
people. And what is the cost of that? If

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
we do lose that social ability to to

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
connect and to have happen stance, what

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
price do we pay? Why does life get

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,319
harder? And how does it get harder?

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Because we are social creatures. We are

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,120
wired for connection.

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,959
If we we live longer because we are

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,680
connected. We don't live longer because

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,680
we are master biohackers.

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,599
We need those connections. They are just

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,840
literally vital to us. So, um it's not

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,480
that we have replaced this, you know,

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,400
and and our skills are still honed in.

101
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,360
We don't we have less and less

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
opportunities to practice.

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,560
If you do sports and you don't practice

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
your sport, you wouldn't be asking me

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
what is the price. You would know that

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
if you don't play and it's been years of

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
not playing, then that thing is out of

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
your life. Done. But you can do other

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,560
things, whereas you can't live without

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,200
connection. So many people are really

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,200
dissatisfied with the choices they have

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
for connection. Now, I'm sure we're all

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
to blame, but when I when I scroll

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
through my my feed on social media, one

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
of the things I've seen lately, I saw it

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
just before you arrived and also a

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,880
couple of days ago, was people so angry

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,919
at dating apps. Mhm. And I've got

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
friends close to me who are furious that

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,520
their only apparent option to meet

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,880
someone these days. Go outside, go walk

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,320
your dog, go run, go with a bike group,

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,759
go to a go do life and you will meet

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
people. I mean, you create situations.

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
It's not, you know, where are the

126
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
available situations? Where are the the

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
options for meeting people? You create

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,000
options. You know, you're at a you're at

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
a coffee shop, you're ordering a coffee,

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,639
ask the person next to you if you can

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,280
offer them one. Can do something that

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
actually invites relatedness.

133
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,600
And I know the anger at the app. I get

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,840
that, you know. I I'm actually quite

135
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,199
connected to to to this whole world of

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,039
dating apps. But I think that it's a

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,080
tool. Use it but don't make it become

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,759
the replacement for the multitudes of

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,160
situations.

140
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
Yesterday I sat on a plane. I spoke for

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,479
3 hours with two people just because

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,680
there was no Wi-Fi.

143
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,320
It was just an amazing conversation and

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,520
and all of us at the moment we landed

145
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
said to each other, "Wow, if we had had

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
Wi-Fi, we wouldn't have talked to each

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
other one bit or five minutes and then

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
be done with this." It's all these

149
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
situations that we don't take advantage

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,240
of. We used where we used to always talk

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,759
to people. And I think if you just rely

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,240
on the app, you will go through a loop.

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
You'll go on it. You'll swipe, swipe,

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
swipe. You'll respond with the least

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,120
amount of effort possible because you've

156
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,720
so burned out already from doing this

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,319
that you don't really want to give much

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
of yourself. If you don't give much of

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,199
yourself, you're not going to get the

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
kind of responses that you want. Then

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
you're going to get frustrated because

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
you don't get matched with anybody. But

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,240
you don't look at your own laziness that

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
is not particularly invited for someone

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
to actually want to match with you. And

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
then you say now I'm tired of this. So

167
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
now you get off the app for 6 months.

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
You take a break. You say I'm done with

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
the apps. And then six months later you

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
say I don't want to meet someone. And

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,440
what do you do? You go back on the app

172
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,080
instead of thinking of the multitudes of

173
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,639
situations where you can actually meet

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,880
people. And it's become so weird to talk

175
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,520
to somebody. you know, you can sit next

176
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,520
to someone and at the at the counter and

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,919
it's like you're a weirdo if you start

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,240
talking to me instead of, you know, why

179
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,080
not? Cuz even in the situation of your

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,199
plane ride, if there had been Wi-Fi,

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
those people wouldn't have wanted to

182
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
talk to you. So really, regardless of

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,000
your attempt, you would have been met

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,400
with, you know, rejection to some

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
degree, social rejection.

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,680
Maybe, maybe. But you know, the original

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,160
app, if you really want to understand

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,960
the gamification of that, it was really

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
done as a way to not have to put

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
yourself out and have to deal with

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,520
rejection. But do you rejection is a

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,960
major feature of relationships. Learning

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,840
to live with people who say no to us

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,160
is essential. Have you heard this story

195
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,039
of the guy who tracked his Tinder

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,800
swipes? And the story is that he swiped

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,280
two million times to get one date. And

198
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
you can kind of see this is him here.

199
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,479
This is the image of the of the swipe.

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,400
So it says this guy swiped 2 million

201
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:54,639
58,000 times. He got 2,000 matches from

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,520
that. Mhm. Which turned into 1,200 chats

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
which turned into one date.

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,560
Such a system is failing a huge

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,120
percentage of people. This is the chap

206
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,479
on WhatsApp on Tinder, I believe it was.

207
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,400
This is Here he is. I'll put him on the

208
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,639
screen so everyone can see. Mhm. And you

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,280
can kind of see the the photos that he

210
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,479
he led with on his dating profile. He

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
probably shouldn't be holding a massive

212
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,160
fish. I'm not sure many women are into

213
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,479
that, but Oh, he's got the fish picture.

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
Yes. Yes. For people like him, what's

215
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,000
the honest advice that someone like him

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,520
needs? Because you know clearly dating

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
apps aren't going to work for him which

218
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,800
is a lot of us from what I read. But how

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
many hours he should also have put on

220
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
the amount of hours that he Oh it does

221
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,399
have that. So has the hours too. So has

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
the amount of time he's been a member of

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,399
the apps just over five years almost six

224
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,159
years. Yes. I mean the first thing if if

225
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
you sat in my office and you told me

226
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,080
this I would not spend my time

227
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,519
discussing what you're doing on the app.

228
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
I would discuss what you're doing off

229
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
the app. And if you ever are even off

230
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,800
the app,

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,920
I mean, have you the amount of hours of

232
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,920
swiping that you've done, obviously this

233
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,839
is not yielding anything. Why are you

234
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,240
continuing? 5 years is an enormous

235
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,600
amount of time in your life. I feel sad

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,320
for you. You know, have you tried any

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,399
other ways? Have you have you been with

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
with your friends? Do you have friends?

239
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,560
Have your friends introduced you to

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,399
people? Have you gone to places where

241
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
you are more likely to meet people? I

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,200
don't know what you're interested in,

243
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,279
but if your fishing is one of those

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,519
things, you know, maybe even at the fish

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
market you could meet, but I mean more

246
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
of it isn't going to give you more of

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,920
it. It's just going to make you more

248
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,560
frustrated. So, if you were sat there,

249
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,360
there's a rigidity to this. It's like,

250
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,920
what are you trying to prove? You know,

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
go try something else. If you're trying

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,000
to park in a space that you can't get

253
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
in, at some point, don't you go look for

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
another space? Is there an element of

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
this where, you know, from what I heard

256
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
from dating apps, there's only a small

257
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,640
percentage of men that could basically

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,160
get all the opportunity if I I'll put

259
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
the numbers on the screen, but yeah, I

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,839
know the holes. Yes. And a large

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
proportion of women get lots of

262
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
opportunity because lots of men swipe

263
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
for But opportunity for what to be

264
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
swiped does that mean? There's and then

265
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,320
what the main thing is can we have a

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,839
conversation about emotional capitalism

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,440
you know I go I try I I I try to get the

268
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:21,760
best I try to shop you know I try to to

269
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,399
maximize my chances but fundamentally

270
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
the app originally was broadening your

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
circle. It gave you the opportunity to

272
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,240
meet people that you would otherwise not

273
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,959
meet. There was something very beautiful

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
about that. From that it became a

275
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,640
commodification. People treat each other

276
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,360
like [ __ ] People ghost each other left

277
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,240
and right. People tell each other things

278
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
and then disappear. People don't have to

279
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,920
say, "I'm not interested in seeing you

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,839
again." They just close the shop. And

281
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
the misery is not because they haven't

282
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,519
met someone. The misery is the treatment

283
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,519
that this kind of semi anonymity enables

284
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
you. You don't have to be polite

285
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
anymore. You don't have to treat people

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,920
with minimum decency.

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,560
And that's what hurts people. That that

288
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,360
makes people bitter, angry, doubting

289
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,200
themselves. A lot of things like that.

290
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,000
It's part of the challenge that I have

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
so many apparent options. Now, as

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,720
someone on these dating apps, it's kind

293
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
of like going to a when you go to like

294
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
Asia or Thailand and you get the menu

295
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,959
and the menu is so big, they'll like

296
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
make anything you want. So, you find it

297
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,240
hard to choose. And also any choice you

298
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
make, you realize that it's come at the

299
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
cost of so many other things you could

300
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
have had. So it's less special, it's

301
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,279
less scarce. And in a world of Instagram

302
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,680
and dating apps, it appears that I have

303
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,079
100,000 options. Yes, it appears that

304
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
you have many options. And it appears

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,120
that you have a paradox of choice. And

306
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
it appears that you constantly are

307
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
dealing with the FOMO of what else is

308
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,360
around the corner. But the interesting

309
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
thing is when I work with people, I

310
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
spend a lot of time reading reading what

311
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
they actually post. Even a peacock is

312
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,640
more creative than us, you know, in how

313
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,600
they attract people, in what you say, in

314
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,839
what, hey, what's up?

315
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
want to hang.

316
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
Is that giving you any energy in your

317
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,560
body? Okay. I mean, this is half the the

318
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,440
messages.

319
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,079
I'm watching. I'm chilling. Okay. Well,

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
keep chilling. It's like where is the

321
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,519
energy? Where, you know, there's

322
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,240
something about called flirting,

323
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,240
attracting someone, showing an interest,

324
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,000
etc., etc., etc. What's a better thing

325
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,079
for us to say? Oh, man. You know, show

326
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,320
interest. I saw something in your

327
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
picture. Uh, I'm wondering, you know, if

328
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,959
we went to listen to music, what's the

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
first band we would go to listen to?

330
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
Something that says you are a person

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,959
with life, with interest, with

332
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
curiosity. Show curiosity. It's probably

333
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,040
the first thing that you do when you are

334
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,120
drawn to somebody. I guess if I've been

335
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
rejected so much, as you said, I've been

336
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
kind of demoralized. The energy has been

337
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
taken out of me. So now it's just become

338
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
this sort of cycle of just well then

339
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,040
don't do it then go then do something

340
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,040
else for a while. Don't stay in that

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,120
pattern. It's it's it's really

342
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,160
depleting. But the thing about the

343
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,959
choice is that we also are living

344
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,120
surrounded by algorithmic perfections

345
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,680
and predictive technologies that are

346
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,399
trying to deliver us always, you know,

347
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,320
on demand delivery of our everyday life

348
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,200
always on without any friction and that

349
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,600
is creating warped expectations that we

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,079
bring to our relationships. That very

351
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
same expectation for perfection and

352
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,839
forcopantic

353
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,639
responses, you know. So the more we are

354
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,399
interacting with AIS and the more we are

355
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,639
re receiving a different kind of

356
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
response, the more challenging it will

357
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,440
be for us to actually deal with real

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,920
people and and to face what you call

359
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
rejection. Not every refusal is a

360
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,200
rejection. I mean this guy didn't write

361
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
how many times he wasn't interested. He

362
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,519
only tells you what's happening to him.

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,160
He gives you the victim story. It's a

364
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,959
statement of this thing doesn't work for

365
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,040
me and men don't get answered on the app

366
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,079
and you get this whole plight but

367
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,680
there's no context. I can't give you a

368
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,199
and I don't think anybody should

369
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,519
actually respond to this without knowing

370
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
all these other details. Is there an

371
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
issue when you mentioned men there is

372
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,959
there an issue that gender roles have

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,120
shifted and when we think about the

374
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,240
plight of men they are you know this I

375
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
think the single biggest killer of men

376
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
over the age of 45 is themselves and the

377
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,959
gender roles um have shifted so much

378
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,639
that often men have less purpose

379
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,639
feelings of purpose and worth now than

380
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,399
they used to have. Women and men have

381
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,720
got gotten closer to a point of

382
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,000
financial equality. they've gotten

383
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,360
closer um than the past which now kind

384
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
of also means that the role of a man if

385
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
we think historically is less clear than

386
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,720
the role of a man maybe 50 100 years

387
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
ago. To understand masculinity you have

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,920
to understand the broader spectrum of

389
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,800
relationships.

390
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,560
So relationships used to be about duty

391
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,399
and obligation, loyalty and community.

392
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,480
And happiness came not from what you do

393
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,079
for yourself, but happiness came from

394
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
having fulfilled your role and your

395
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
mission and your obligation to the

396
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,480
people that you owe to your family

397
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
primarily. That model is still the

398
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
prevailing model in most parts of the

399
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,079
world. We shifted that model from duty

400
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,639
and obligation to option and choice. And

401
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,240
so now we have zero clarity and a lot of

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
freedom. And we've never been more free,

403
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
but we've never been more alone and more

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
confused and more filled with

405
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,880
self-doubt. How how long have you been

406
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,240
working with

407
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,600
men and women in a relationship love

408
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,959
connection? 40 years. So what have you

409
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,480
seen change in the conversation around

410
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,759
men and masculinity? Like what are the

411
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,440
different problems that men are talking

412
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,480
about in when they speak to you that

413
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
they weren't speaking about when you

414
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,519
started your career? I mean you can

415
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,000
start with the subject of loneliness.

416
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,240
Loneliness, which is a a a general

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,880
societal issue at this point, is

418
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,560
definitely a major affliction, even more

419
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,920
so for boys and men. Okay? Loneliness

420
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,279
was not a the story of men in the 19th

421
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,279
century. Men hunted together, men hiked

422
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,880
together, men gathered together, men

423
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,600
went to the bar together. Men had

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,519
conversations with other men. Men meant

425
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:29,120
met, you know. So the there is nothing

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,399
inherent about men that sets them up for

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,279
more loneliness and isolation.

428
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,639
That is really important to understand.

429
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,320
Men, boys till the age of four and then

430
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,720
till the age of seven are highly

431
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,000
emotional. They can articulate. They can

432
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,040
so these are cultural phenomenons. These

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,680
are social developments. This is not

434
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,399
biological. This is not intrinsic to

435
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,680
men. One shift that's taken place which

436
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm keen to get your perspective on is

437
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,720
relates to sex. One in three men under

438
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,079
30 in the US reported no sex in the past

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
year. That's triple the rate from 2008.

440
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,839
Millennials and Gen Z's are having less

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,839
sex than any generation since records

442
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,679
began despite more access to the dating

443
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,240
apps we talked about. Yeah. In Japan

444
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,760
over 40% of young adults are virgins and

445
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
they say many say that they have no

446
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
interest in sex. Mhm. And lastly,

447
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
married couples in the UK and the United

448
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,959
States report a steady decline in sexual

449
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,799
frequency since the early 2000s. Yeah, I

450
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
wrote about that in Mating in Captivity

451
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,000
that came out in 2006. That's 20 years

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,080
ago. Yes. Because in order to have sex

453
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
with a female partner, if that's the man

454
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
you're talking about, you need to be

455
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,720
able to approach her. And so social

456
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,080
atrophy is directly connected to what is

457
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,520
often called the sexual recession.

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,280
I mean I in in mating 20 years ago I

459
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
have an entire chapter where someone

460
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,360
basically says to me I'd rather have the

461
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,960
security of an MBA than of a

462
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,039
relationship.

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,200
Okay. And at that point already you

464
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,280
began to see that adolescence in the

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
United States it's not everywhere in the

466
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,679
world but certainly in the US and where

467
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,840
more and more going in groups and having

468
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,000
less and less pair bonding and less and

469
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,919
less romantic relationships that

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
accompany you through your adolescence

471
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,280
that develop with you and you basically

472
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,559
develop sex as part of a plot and not as

473
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,080
something that at some point your

474
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,240
hormones force you to do. But a story, a

475
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
story, a relationship is a story. And

476
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
then at suddenly you arrive at a certain

477
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,840
age and now you're looking at this other

478
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
person with whom you want to have sex

479
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,799
and it's like this unknown continent

480
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,799
that you have to conquer. But but you've

481
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
never spoken with those people. You have

482
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,120
very little female friends who are just

483
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,280
friends who help you understand what

484
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,840
happens with your girlfriend. You know,

485
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,360
there's an entire social map that has

486
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,160
dissipated. So the sex is the last thing

487
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,840
on the list of all these disconnects

488
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
that then of course lead you to have

489
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,320
this kind of statistic and that means

490
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
with partners they have plenty of sex

491
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
maybe with themselves and others other

492
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,880
other

493
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,799
but it's partnered sex here that is that

494
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,799
is involved right they have sex on porn

495
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,000
they have sex

496
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,039
they don't have partner sex you know do

497
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,880
you understand when I say to you this is

498
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,000
a you can add that to your statistics

499
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,840
too that the majority of men who come to

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,360
sex therapy today for erectile

501
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,080
dysfunctions are young men in their 20s,

502
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,840
not old men after prostate issues.

503
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,280
Really? Yes. Why? Because they spend an

504
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,679
enormous amount of time with themselves

505
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,000
watching porn and masturbating. Yes.

506
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,000
Because in order to be able to maintain

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
erections with a partner, it's an it's

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,120
an it's an attunement, right? It's a

509
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,120
resonance. It's grooving together. But

510
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,840
if you've always just been by yourself,

511
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,320
then you only know how to kind of be

512
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,480
connected to your own physiological

513
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,480
responses. I've worried about this

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,320
before. I've worried that if I watch

515
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,559
pornography that I will like desensitize

516
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,320
myself to the real thing. Depends how

517
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,880
much, depends if what else is there in

518
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,919
your life. I mean, it's not an all or

519
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,919
nothing thing. But what I'm saying is

520
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,640
social atrophy. The the the gradual

521
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,919
disconnect of the multiple touch points

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,640
between people leads to then the

523
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,600
challenges that are also sexual leads to

524
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,080
the kind of social isolation leads to

525
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
people confusing friends and friendship.

526
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,320
So they can have a thousand virtual

527
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,280
friends but no one to feed their cat.

528
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,120
You know it's it's it's all para no one

529
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
to feed their cat. Yeah. Who would pick

530
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,919
up a prescription at the pharmacy? who

531
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,400
may pick me up at the airport,

532
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,480
who will go check on on someone I care

533
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
about if I happen to not be there. Yes.

534
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
Who shows up for me? Because it's

535
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,520
foundational to trust. Who can I lean

536
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,799
on? Do you have my back? Can I rely on

537
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,320
you?

538
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,080
So do you think the partnered sex is in

539
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,520
decline because because they're still

540
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,080
having sex but they're doing it on their

541
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,960
own now with in part sex is in decline

542
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,440
because social connection is in decline

543
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,600
because people have less friends because

544
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,400
people the statistics on who you call to

545
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,120
when you are in trouble are really

546
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,520
terrible. People have no one to confide

547
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
in. So what how does that impact my sex

548
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,280
with my partner? Well, you you won't

549
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,880
have a partner usually. What this

550
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,919
statistic says is that there is no

551
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,480
partner. Young men the age of 30 don't

552
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,919
have sex with partners. This one here

553
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
from the British Medical Journal says

554
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
that married couples in the UK and US

555
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,200
report a steady decline in sexual

556
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,640
frequency. Yes. Since basically the

557
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
internet. Yeah. So here's how this

558
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,280
works. How much time do you spend in

559
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,840
front of a screen during the day? Nine

560
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,360
hours. All right. And then you sometimes

561
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,679
think now I'm going to go home and I'm

562
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,520
finally can close the screens. Yeah. But

563
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,559
then you're so tired that all you can do

564
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,320
is watch TV. Yeah. And then while you

565
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,240
watch TV, you're also scrolling on your

566
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
phone. Yeah. And then while you're

567
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,120
watching TV and scrolling on your phone,

568
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
there may be somebody sitting next to

569
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,679
you that does the exact same thing.

570
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah. All right. And then somebody may

571
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,440
even say something to the other person

572
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,840
who goes, "Uh-huh."

573
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Doesn't look at them. Uh-huh.

574
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,360
Very interesting. And you really wonder

575
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,360
why people are having less sex.

576
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,840
It is. It's hard. It's hard. I'm going

577
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,960
to say it is hard. Right. So, people are

578
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,960
experiencing at that moment what I've

579
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,840
come to call ambiguous loss.

580
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,440
Ambiguous loss is when I'm actually with

581
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,440
somebody, but I don't feel the

582
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,600
closeness, the intimacy, the connection

583
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,080
from actually being with that person. I

584
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,120
don't know if you're here or not here.

585
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,799
Ambiguous loss is actually a term that

586
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
was developed by Pauline Bos, a

587
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,960
psychologist who talked about it when

588
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,120
you have a person who has Alzheimer or

589
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
dementia and they are actually

590
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,080
physically in front of you but they are

591
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,840
emotionally or psychologically gone or

592
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,640
people who are deployed or have

593
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,559
disappeared or miscarriage where people

594
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
are no longer physically there but they

595
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,880
are emotionally very very present inside

596
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,840
of you. In both cases you don't know are

597
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,120
they here or are they not. Do I say

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,840
goodbye or do I hold on? When I am doing

599
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,200
this looking at your phone and I have

600
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,960
like the a still face and I'm barely

601
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,440
responding to you who said something

602
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,919
that may be quite important. You don't

603
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,600
know are you here but you're not

604
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,760
present.

605
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,919
I'm with you, but I'm not experiencing

606
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
any of the things that one experiences

607
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
from the closeness of being with you,

608
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,240
like Alzheimer, dementia, physically

609
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,600
there, but psychologically elsewhere.

610
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
Because it's not just that you're not

611
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,080
here, it's that you're in another world.

612
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,480
You're gone somewhere. You may be

613
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,159
talking to who knows.

614
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
And I guess this is the from reading

615
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,039
your work, this is the crux of many an

616
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,880
argument. The argument might sound like,

617
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,520
oh, you didn't put the toilet seat down,

618
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,120
but it's actually linked to

619
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,240
something else, something deeper under

620
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,159
the surface.

621
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,000
I I just see it, you know, specifically

622
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,520
when me and my partner have been away

623
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
from each other for a long time and then

624
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,880
we come back together. I always know

625
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,159
we're going to argue for the first like

626
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,200
one or two days. It's not even going to

627
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,960
be an argument. It's going to be

628
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,559
there's going to be a problem. And the

629
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,640
problem is usually around expectations,

630
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,159
which is I come in and my head is still

631
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,360
d like I'm still a million miles away,

632
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
maybe on a different frequency, thinking

633
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,039
about lots of things. And I think she

634
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,799
comes into that space expecting

635
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,000
connection and I let her down. And we've

636
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
tried to like call it out and say,

637
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,120
"Listen, when we come back together,

638
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,360
let's just, you know, both make an

639
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,880
effort in that direction." But, um,

640
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,640
going back to your point of ambiguous

641
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
loss, it's like it's almost like she's

642
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,000
trying to test if I'm

643
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,240
connected to her. And I sometimes don't

644
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,640
do a good job of that because of how I

645
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,000
come into that space. Like for example,

646
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
right now I'm filming Dragon STEM, which

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,159
is a TV show in Manchester. And so I

648
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,039
film three or four days a week, morning

649
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
till night. The minute I get off from

650
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,440
it, I'm back with her. So you can

651
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,200
imagine everything hits me at once.

652
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
Do you what I'm saying? Yes. Like all of

653
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
my team, all the to-do list, everything.

654
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,279
Steve, we need you to sign this off all

655
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,919
at once, but then I'm back in front of

656
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,240
her. Mhm. So she's experiencing that

657
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,440
ambiguous loss. And the expectation was

658
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,360
that we haven't seen each other for a

659
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:35,919
while. So this is, you know, so the

660
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,919
question is, can you carve out a half an

661
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,480
hour that's clean? An hour that's clean

662
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,600
that connects. Yeah. But don't do that

663
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,000
just for her. You have to imagine that

664
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,919
when you do what you do and it all is

665
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,120
bleeding into each other and all your

666
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,760
roles collapse into the same space that

667
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,360
it actually is doing something for you.

668
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:03,200
to you, not for you, to you. And that to

669
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,000
to actually close the phone,

670
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,799
tell people to call you in an hour, you

671
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,320
won't miss a thing. And to actually drop

672
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,679
in

673
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,679
is going to give you a level of energy,

674
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,919
of oxytocin, of well-being that is way

675
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,960
more important or as important as every

676
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,400
supplement you may be swallowing.

677
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,159
Yeah. Cuz you're It's true. I think it's

678
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,520
not just for her. Yeah, I am excited to

679
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,440
see her and I am excited to connect in

680
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,960
here. I just You said it wrong. You said

681
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
it correctly. Like I just multi I try

682
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,679
and multitask and I I let everything

683
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,679
down. Yes. The boss, the podcaster, the

684
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,400
this, the that and the boyfriend is all

685
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,159
in the same thing. Um it's an

686
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,880
indigestion. So you're a fan of

687
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,679
scheduling clean time to do things. Oh

688
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,679
yeah. Oh yeah. It's you can call it

689
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,840
scheduling, you can call it demarcation,

690
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
you can call it delineation. We are

691
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,799
social creatures who really orient

692
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,480
ourselves in time and in space. When

693
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,120
everything happens to us at the same

694
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,279
time, we get headaches. They not always

695
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,760
experienced as headaches, but in fact,

696
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,799
we get a confusion inside. We're not

697
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,279
here, we're not here, we're not here,

698
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,120
we're not here, it's just okay. So, you

699
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,279
can call that scheduling or you can call

700
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,200
it that, you know, when you go to place

701
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,279
when you go to the gym, you basically

702
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,360
put on certain clothes, you prepare

703
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,200
yourself for that. It's an activity that

704
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,279
comes with a role that comes with a set

705
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,120
of things that comes with a delineation

706
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,960
of time that makes you go to a certain

707
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,480
space

708
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,559
where you're going to go do that thing

709
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,320
and we this happens when you go out at

710
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,120
night this when you go out for dinner

711
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,279
when you the same thing is for home.

712
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,760
It's a if you are going to spend the

713
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,080
moment with her, however short it is, if

714
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:48,080
it's clean and present, not just kind of

715
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,120
semi there, ambiguously present, it will

716
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,360
change a lot of things for you, for her,

717
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,120
and for the two of you. Before we sat

718
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,799
down today, I messaged a group of 10 of

719
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,320
my closest friends. I put them all in a

720
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
group chat, and I told them I was going

721
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,559
to be speaking to you today. So I said

722
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,799
to them, "Can you tell me what question

723
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,120
you have for Esther Pel?" These are all

724
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,360
my 10 of my best friends that you

725
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,080
wouldn't ever say out loud. How can I be

726
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,080
satisfied with just one sexual partner?

727
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,279
I have been unfaithful with my partner

728
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,120
in the past

729
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,840
and I feel guilty about it. Should I

730
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,399
tell them?

731
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,039
I no longer find my partner attractive,

732
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,200
but I don't know how to tell her. I love

733
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,320
her but I don't find her attractive.

734
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
Those are probably the most interesting

735
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,919
ones.

736
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,320
I think the one that I would probably uh

737
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,640
address is also uh about the infidelity

738
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,640
and about your guilt. That's that and

739
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,440
also to this person read state of

740
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,440
affairs because I spent many years

741
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,159
writing this book about infidelity and

742
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,640
trying to offer a very nuanced

743
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,559
perspective on this very subject. But

744
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,039
here's the thing

745
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,960
to tell somebody something just because

746
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,960
you don't have a clean conscience and

747
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
you feel guilty isn't always the kind

748
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,760
thing to do.

749
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,679
Ask yourself what will happen to your

750
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,000
partner or to your relationship for that

751
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,399
matter if you speak about this now

752
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,559
and who you doing it for. I think

753
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,080
honesty sometimes is extremely caring

754
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,880
and at other times can be very cruel.

755
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,880
It cleanses you and it destroys another

756
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
person.

757
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,000
deal with your responsibility and deal

758
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,399
with your guilt and face the

759
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,520
consequences of your behavior and treat

760
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,559
your partner with all the good things

761
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,120
that actually say I now am willing to

762
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,159
really invest in here and and make up

763
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,559
for what I did without having to destroy

764
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,480
the narrative of the relationship

765
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,880
because everybody has a story about

766
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,640
their relationship. Everybody has a set

767
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,480
of shared assumptions about their

768
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,039
relationship. And you are going to come

769
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,760
in and just say, "Last year or two years

770
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,399
ago or five years ago, I did X, Y, and

771
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,480
Z." And from that moment on, you rob the

772
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,720
other person of their narrative.

773
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,919
You may think you did something that was

774
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,600
honest, and sometimes that is the case.

775
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,679
But many times you actually create an

776
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,399
enormous amount of hurt. If you feel

777
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,159
guilty, it's not bad. Deal with your

778
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,919
guilt. Face it. Take your responsibility

779
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
and make your relationship the best

780
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,480
relationship you can. And honor your

781
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,320
partner in that way. Don't honor them by

782
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,000
putting your dirt onto them. That is a

783
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,559
different way of saying and that is not

784
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,960
for everyone. But I think that it is an

785
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,799
important perspective to include here

786
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,760
because we live in this era where

787
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,840
transparency supposedly is the the best

788
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,720
model for everything. And people dish

789
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,320
stuff out on other people that destroys

790
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,279
them

791
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,520
in the name of and when you're no longer

792
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,679
attracted to your person, you know, ask

793
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,039
yourself what is that about? You know,

794
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,919
is it are you paying attention? are you?

795
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,840
Um I think people often just think that

796
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,279
attraction is something like I look at

797
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,200
you and I should just instantly have a

798
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,600
response,

799
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,440
you know. Um and sometimes it's also

800
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,159
because I haven't really taken a good

801
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,240
look and sometimes it's because what I'm

802
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,279
looking at isn't necessarily anymore

803
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,600
what draws me in. And sometime it's it's

804
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,679
not, you know, attraction is a very fle

805
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,960
fluid thing. It comes and go. When I'm

806
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,559
angry at you, I'm not nearly as

807
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,480
attracted to you as when I'm looking at

808
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,720
you being so kind to someone and I say,

809
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,880
"What a great person you are and I just

810
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,960
want to come and and I run over and I

811
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,640
want to hug you and I want to hold you."

812
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,080
That's attraction, too, right? We're not

813
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,279
just talking about the attraction to

814
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,519
have sex with somebody. Attraction is is

815
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,919
in a in a is part of a story. It's part

816
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,760
of a context. You know, if you think

817
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,440
that you're just going to watch Netflix

818
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,960
for three hours, scroll on your phone

819
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,120
for another two, and then turn around

820
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,039
and say, "Oh, you're so attractive and

821
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,360
I'm so turned on by you." We you're

822
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,440
you're off. You're off. This is not the

823
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,360
way that it works. And then it's easy to

824
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,840
replace the person and to just think

825
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,039
you're, you know, new shiny object. We

826
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,240
will be very attracted again. But

827
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,919
attraction is a part of an interaction

828
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,880
that these two words have the have the

829
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,720
same ethmological root if there is zero

830
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,519
interaction. Now if you have a partner

831
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,360
who neglects themselves, a partner who

832
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,159
you know there's lots of things that

833
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,000
people also do that diminishes them.

834
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,679
There was a woman in a in in a

835
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,600
an event I just did and you know there

836
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
had been some hurt in the relationship

837
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,360
and so she said I'm no longer attracted

838
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,279
which is not the same as I have no

839
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,960
desire. Basically she had no desire

840
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,559
and she said but I've worked we've

841
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,240
talked everything out. We've discussed

842
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,559
it. I said yeah you may have discussed

843
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,480
it but your body shut down. Your body

844
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,640
carries the anger. Your body carries the

845
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,799
hurt. Your body carries the feelings.

846
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,519
and your body doesn't want to open. So

847
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,000
obviously it's not over,

848
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,360
you know. So that's too is attraction.

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,679
It is one of the most popular things

850
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,240
that men whisper to me in silence, which

851
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
is they can't seem to get their and

852
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
listen, I'm saying men because my the

853
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,120
majority of my good friends that would

854
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
whisper to me are men. So it might be

855
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,080
the case for women too. I just can't

856
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,120
speak to that. is that they are unsure

857
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,080
how they could possibly be faithful for

858
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,640
a prolonged period of time

859
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,919
um and have one partner for a prolonged

860
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,080
period of time. I think that you would

861
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,320
be an interesting thing to tell your men

862
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,559
friends.

863
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Women get bored with monogamy much

864
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,080
sooner than men.

865
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,760
Really? Yes. That's not what men think.

866
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,679
No. men think she's not interested in

867
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,840
sex

868
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,440
and what they should probably replace it

869
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,560
with is that she's not interested in the

870
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,639
sex she's can she's going to have

871
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,879
in order to want sex it needs to be sex

872
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,599
that is worth wanting

873
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,320
for women to remain interested it needs

874
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,879
to be interesting

875
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,960
and so the fact that women don't

876
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,359
necessarily experience the same

877
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,359
liberties at least historically and

878
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,399
culturally all over the world that men

879
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,399
do. So they remain in their homes and

880
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,240
they are not as unfaithful because

881
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,639
there's been a double standard around

882
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,119
infidelity forever everywhere in the

883
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
world. For this particular friend of

884
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,520
mine, where is that message? What what

885
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,919
should I say to him when he says, "How

886
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,280
can you be satisfied with one sexual

887
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,839
partner?" That's literally just so you

888
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,040
know that I'm not just I believe you.

889
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,399
But some people at home might think that

890
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,800
it's like me as a proxy of um but but

891
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,200
maybe you're not. Maybe you're not.

892
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,720
Maybe you want to have more partners.

893
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,480
Maybe you want your partner to have

894
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,720
other partners, too. That's not always

895
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,400
so the case, right? He doesn't want to

896
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,400
lose her. That's right. They've been

897
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,880
together I think 25 years. So, you know,

898
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,040
it won't you may have sometimes

899
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,680
frustrations if you there's a few

900
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,200
options, right? You either say we have a

901
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,119
relationship that can welcome other

902
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,040
people. We're not exclusive. But she's

903
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,680
going to leave then

904
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,000
because she doesn't want that. Okay. So

905
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,160
then the next thing is as best as you

906
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,599
can make it as interesting and as fun

907
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,520
and as pleasurable as it can be. And my

908
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,359
first question to you is have you been

909
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,160
doing the same old for god knows how

910
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,359
many years? And with that in mind I

911
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,040
wouldn't be surprised that you're not

912
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,200
that attracted or that she's not that

913
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,640
interested for that matter.

914
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,240
So if you want to be satisfied or more

915
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,880
satisfied,

916
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,839
I mean you have a dialogue you know and

917
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,160
the more satisfied means

918
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,960
bring more of yourself and and and make

919
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,359
this experience more erotic, more

920
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,040
pleasurable, more playful, more

921
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,280
fulfilling.

922
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,119
You may remain frustrated and you may

923
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,119
say I would love to have other people

924
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,119
and for that matter maybe your partner

925
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,800
wants would would want it too but that's

926
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,480
not the kind of relationship that she

927
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,320
wants. That doesn't mean she hasn't

928
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,440
thought about other people and it

929
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,280
certainly wouldn't mean that if she

930
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,079
fantasizes she fantasizes about you. So

931
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,320
everybody is keeping their secrets here

932
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,880
you know. Um, and then the next thing

933
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,200
is, are you putting more emphasis on the

934
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,440
fact that you're not as satisfied having

935
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,200
one sexual partner, or are you putting

936
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,440
more focus on the fact that you're going

937
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,000
to make this sexual experience with your

938
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,920
partner as pleasurable and rich as can

939
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,839
be? If you find yourself more on the

940
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,440
complaining side, then you're going to

941
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,400
be constantly more unsatis dissatisfied.

942
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,160
I think much of it is actually he and

943
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,839
many others want the best of all worlds.

944
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
And in life, we're not willing to accept

945
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,920
trade-offs. Yeah. So, and you're saying

946
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,079
you're saying make a decision. If you

947
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,280
want that life, then be honest about

948
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,800
that life. If you don't want that life,

949
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,960
then

950
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
invest in that thing to make it better.

951
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah. That's the other alternative. Be

952
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,800
bored with the food you eat. Go buy

953
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
other food and and and and cook at home

954
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,760
and make it more rich and more

955
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,200
interesting. If you don't want to have

956
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
the same dinner every night in the

957
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,760
house, the question is what are people

958
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,560
doing to make their relationships more

959
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,280
vibrant, more erotic, more alive? I mean

960
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,119
this is really you by the way it's not

961
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,920
about having more sex. You can have more

962
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,079
sex and and not feel much. It's about

963
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,079
making it more alive and vibrant. That

964
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,839
is what much of my work is about is

965
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,160
cultivating the eroticism and the

966
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,560
aliveness in relationships

967
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
on the on the personal front. And you

968
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,160
ask people what do you do to make it

969
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,760
rich and interesting and and you find

970
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,560
the laziness, the complacency, the

971
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,640
constant same old same old and then the

972
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,200
complaint about it and then you say that

973
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,760
is that is really self-defeating. Are

974
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,720
you frustrated with people as No, I

975
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,320
smile at it. I I I I just I I smile at

976
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,839
the the way that we can lie to

977
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,160
ourselves.

978
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,119
I smile at the way we can complain about

979
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,359
others and as if that we have no

980
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,440
implication. I smile at the way we don't

981
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,760
want to take responsibility for actually

982
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
getting the things that we really want.

983
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,839
You must see the same patterns over and

984
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,480
over again. those ones I do not all but

985
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,920
this kind of pattern which is actually

986
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,119
why I've expanded to from only working

987
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,880
in the romantic sphere to working also

988
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,040
in the workplace because relationships

989
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,400
are richer than just this and I think

990
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,760
that this friend I would have a five

991
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,040
minute conversation with him and I would

992
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,760
ask him these very questions

993
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,280
I would ask the partner also those very

994
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
questions

995
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,280
and I would have a few ideas. It's not

996
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,440
uber complicated. You going to record me

997
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,800
to him? No, I'm just Okay.

998
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,880
What would you say to him? What's his

999
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,640
name? I I should call it name. Let's

1000
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:18,240
call him John. John.

1001
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,440
So, yes, John. It's we are we are not

1002
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,599
necessarily uh curious only about one

1003
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,240
partner. Many people would like to have

1004
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,480
other partners. in the context of your

1005
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,599
relationship that is not an option for

1006
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,000
you as I understand. So if that is the

1007
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,320
situation and you really deeply care

1008
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,160
about your partner and your relationship

1009
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,560
with her, then the next question is

1010
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,440
what do you do to energize your

1011
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,160
relationship to bring playfulness,

1012
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
curiosity, imagination,

1013
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,440
eroticism as in life force, as in

1014
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,560
aliveness, not as in sex to your

1015
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,800
relationship? Are you bringing the

1016
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,119
leftovers home and the best of yourself

1017
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,760
goes to work or are you also bringing

1018
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,880
your creativity, your energy, your

1019
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,280
curiosity to your relationship? My sense

1020
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,280
is that if you do that, there is a good

1021
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,920
chance that you will actually have a

1022
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,359
more satisfying erotic connection with

1023
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,960
your partner. That doesn't mean you

1024
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,920
won't have interest, curiosity,

1025
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,480
fantasies about others, but it will free

1026
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,760
you from this position in which you just

1027
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,079
kind of say, "I'm bored. I'm not

1028
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,880
satisfied. I would like a little more

1029
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,440
diversity." And all of that. And just

1030
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,359
for you, do not imagine that you're the

1031
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,560
only one in your relationship who thinks

1032
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,480
this way and wants this. It's just that

1033
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
you may have a partner who doesn't want

1034
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,200
the consequences of it. That doesn't

1035
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,920
mean she wouldn't fantasize about the

1036
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,560
plurality herself.

1037
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,560
I'm going to send that. Um, please

1038
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,560
listen

1039
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,800
to the ad hoc intervention.

1040
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:04,280
Yeah. Just need a honest response. Have

1041
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,280
you ever done that

1042
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:13,040
on your podcast? And Pel said, "Women

1043
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,680
are often more quickly bored with

1044
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,000
monogamy than men." And that is the

1045
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,599
secret that people do not understand.

1046
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,160
That means that in order for her to

1047
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,800
remain engaged, it has to remain more

1048
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,119
engaging and interesting and fun and

1049
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,359
pleasurable. And if it's just to get it

1050
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,760
done and just to do it for the sake of

1051
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,560
doing it, then she really can often

1052
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,040
spare it. And while men are much more

1053
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,359
able to remain actually contrary to what

1054
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,119
he describes to remain interested that

1055
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,119
doesn't mean they don't want others as

1056
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,240
well but they can remain more interested

1057
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,640
in their partner without having to

1058
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,640
change it like that. And it is

1059
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,160
interpreted as women are less interested

1060
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,720
in sex rather than women need more in

1061
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,480
order to remain interested. They need

1062
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,880
more of the emotional stuff. Not

1063
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,880
necessarily. Not only they need more

1064
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,880
imagination, more risque, more

1065
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,440
connection, more attention, more of a

1066
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,480
lot of whatever is hurt thing. Right.

1067
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,240
Okay. It's it's one of the the most

1068
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,280
important things I learned actually that

1069
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,880
that kind of turned it around for me

1070
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,920
because once you begin to look at it

1071
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,000
like that, it it plays with this classic

1072
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,960
gender division. Men want, women

1073
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,720
doesn't. It's boring. It's it's like it

1074
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,119
becomes true just because we say it all

1075
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,880
the time, but that doesn't mean it is.

1076
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,319
This is true for a lot of these gendered

1077
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,280
things. Um, so my friend replied and the

1078
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,119
essence of what they said, yes, he said,

1079
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,119
"She's right. Full stop. The intimacy in

1080
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,880
our relationship has died and it died so

1081
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,040
long ago that I think part of me doesn't

1082
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,119
feel like I can revive it anymore. We're

1083
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,040
so used to the relationship being off."

1084
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,319
Okay, put the put the mic on. Okay.

1085
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,400
Yep. All right, John, here's what I

1086
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,960
would suggest. Um, I think that you can

1087
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,280
just simply say I, you know, Steve

1088
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,680
approached me and asked me if I had a

1089
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,680
question for Estelle and I just threw

1090
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,000
out this thing. At first I was just kind

1091
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,240
of flippant about it. I just thought

1092
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,920
what do you do when you you know but in

1093
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,680
fact when she answered I realized you

1094
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,680
know that this is a bigger thing between

1095
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,079
us and this is an emptiness and a gap

1096
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,400
that we allowed to create and that I

1097
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,880
have contributed to and I don't just

1098
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,800
want to leave it at that. So I thought

1099
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,760
I'm going to sit down and actually write

1100
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,079
to you. I want to just write some of my

1101
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,119
thoughts because uh I think when we sit

1102
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,000
we avoid the subject, we circle around

1103
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,319
it or I avoid it or I'm defensive about

1104
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,839
it or anyway whatever it is that I've

1105
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,319
done. I don't know you enough, John, to

1106
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,079
know the details of that. And then you

1107
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,319
just really say, you know, something

1108
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,480
died a long time ago and I feel awkward

1109
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,720
about it, but I miss it and I miss you

1110
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,079
and I miss us. And I would like to know

1111
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,520
if you are willing to re-engage with me

1112
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,520
and for us to rekindle. It's desire goes

1113
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,520
through intermittent eclipses. It's like

1114
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,560
the moon. It disappears, but it can

1115
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,359
reappear. And I would love to invite you

1116
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,359
to re-engage with me to bring back the

1117
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,200
light, the spark inside of us because we

1118
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,079
can do it. We are more than just this.

1119
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,760
And because just living side by side, I

1120
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,960
don't think is going to be enough for

1121
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,119
either of us. And I'm prepared to do my

1122
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,200
part. Would you be willing to do yours?

1123
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,119
That was beautiful.

1124
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,200
That was beautiful. And then let's see

1125
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,200
if it still answers us before we end.

1126
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,280
I made the biggest investment I've ever

1127
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,520
made in a company because of my

1128
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,599
girlfriend. I came home one night and my

1129
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,839
lovely girlfriend was up at 1:00 a.m. in

1130
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,560
the morning pulling her hair out as she

1131
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,960
tried to piece together her own online

1132
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,880
store for her business. And in that

1133
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,119
moment, I remembered an email I'd had

1134
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,520
from a guy called John, the founder of

1135
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,280
Standstore, our new sponsor and a

1136
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,440
company I've invested incredibly heavily

1137
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,119
in. And Standtore helps creators to sell

1138
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,119
digital products, courses, coaching, and

1139
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,920
memberships all through a simple

1140
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,839
customizable link in bio system. And it

1141
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,760
handles everything, payments, bookings,

1142
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,000
emails, community engagement, and even

1143
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,520
links with Shopify. And I believe in it

1144
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,200
so much that I'm going to launch a Stan

1145
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,040
challenge. And as part of this

1146
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,520
challenge, I'm going to give away

1147
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,880
$100,000 to one of you. If you want to

1148
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,720
take part in this challenge, if you want

1149
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,800
to monetize the knowledge that you have,

1150
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,280
visit stephenbartlet.stan

1151
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,599
stan.store to sign up and you'll also

1152
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,839
get an extended 30-day free trial of

1153
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,839
Stan Store if you use that link. Your

1154
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,599
next move could quite frankly change

1155
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,000
everything. Are you hearing a lot of

1156
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,319
couples in your practice increasingly

1157
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,480
say either member of the couple that

1158
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,560
they don't like having sex?

1159
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,319
Not more than before. I wrote a book 20

1160
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,400
years ago that was all about the dilemas

1161
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,000
of desire. You've always heard it. I

1162
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,599
always heard it. No, I don't think that

1163
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,280
there are fundamental changes around

1164
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,240
that. I think the changes are the fact

1165
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,599
that people are spending less for time

1166
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,319
together where they are actually

1167
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,119
attentive to each other. They're half

1168
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,400
there. Their attention is fragmented.

1169
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,280
They're multitasking all the time. The

1170
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,680
that's what is changing. And if you have

1171
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,560
less connection, less attention, less

1172
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,920
intimacy, less in why do you think that

1173
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
people are suddenly going to be turned

1174
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,599
on? But is the sex getting less

1175
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,119
interesting? No. Their life with each

1176
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,119
other is less interesting.

1177
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,800
And this the last time when I spoke to

1178
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,359
you like this, you told me why you

1179
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,359
shouting at me.

1180
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,240
Their life is less interesting. The sex

1181
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,880
is the is the consequence of of seven

1182
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,240
other things before. God, they haven't

1183
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,440
said anything interesting to each other.

1184
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,720
They haven't laughed. They haven't

1185
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,000
kissed each other. They haven't looked

1186
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,440
at each other. They haven't barely

1187
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,599
touched each other. And suddenly the

1188
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,240
text the sex needs to be you know all

1189
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,319
hot and and and and passionate on what

1190
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,960
freaking basis.

1191
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,119
Their life is not interesting.

1192
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,280
Their communication, their interaction,

1193
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,359
their conversations, their attention to

1194
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,040
each other, the fact that they matter,

1195
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,200
the fact that their presence means

1196
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,760
something in each other's lives, that's

1197
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,359
what is all connected to long-term sex.

1198
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
Long-term sex doesn't come just for

1199
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,599
because you I look at you and I'm and

1200
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,520
I'm all hot.

1201
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,400
it it it's a different mechanism.

1202
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,280
So you're asking a question that happens

1203
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:37,200
here and I am telling you if all of this

1204
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:39,440
is rather boring and uh unengaged.

1205
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,880
It's like at work you know I'm doing a

1206
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,319
lot of this stuff around work now. It's

1207
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,760
like if the engagement is low on what

1208
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,520
basis do we think people are going to

1209
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,680
perform?

1210
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,119
The performance is here, but the

1211
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,720
performance is a response to the

1212
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,160
engagement, which is a response to the

1213
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,079
culture, which is a response to the

1214
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,760
quality of the relationships between the

1215
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,119
people who work together. It's the same

1216
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,160
in the personal realm.

1217
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,880
What element of responsibility do I have

1218
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,480
in making sure that my relationship with

1219
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,480
myself is great in order to have a great

1220
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,760
relationship with someone else? Cuz a

1221
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,000
lot of people like to blame. I think the

1222
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,440
premise is inaccurate. Okay, fix my

1223
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,920
premise. The premise is that it it's

1224
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,200
time for us to begin to question the

1225
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,520
intense level of individualism

1226
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,599
and self

1227
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,599
thinking, self-love, self-care,

1228
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,280
self-fululfillment, self-awareness. It's

1229
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
all about the self in front. And the

1230
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
presumption is that if all those levels

1231
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,040
of the self have been attended to, we

1232
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
will be better able to attend to other

1233
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,880
people. So, what do you think about this

1234
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,200
culture of self-care and self-love? And

1235
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,079
I think it's gone overboard.

1236
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,599
I think it's it's a distortion.

1237
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,200
I think it feeds consumerism. I think

1238
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,359
that there's a lot of elements of it

1239
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,559
that are highly important. But we have

1240
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,680
completely lost the fact that what

1241
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:05,200
actually is at the root of well-being,

1242
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,119
happiness, longevity, meaning is in our

1243
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,319
relationships and our connections with

1244
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,040
others as well as with ourselves. When

1245
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,720
you give to others, you will depressed.

1246
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,800
When you are when you feel like you make

1247
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,119
a difference in other people's life, it

1248
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,800
makes you feel better chemically too. If

1249
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,559
you go on the street and you make some

1250
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,160
you give compliments to people and you

1251
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,160
tell them that they look really great or

1252
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,000
this this beautiful what they're wearing

1253
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,440
and you've made a smile on someone's

1254
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,760
face, your oxytocin levels go up too.

1255
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,319
Doing for others makes us feel better

1256
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,559
about ourselves as well. Not all the

1257
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,200
time and not every circumstance but that

1258
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,359
voluntary connecting and and and being

1259
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,280
engaged with other people whereas being

1260
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,119
engaged with oneself. Have you seen at

1261
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,920
the gym how people are super engaged

1262
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,280
with themselves lifting and but nobody's

1263
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,800
interacting with anybody.

1264
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,319
And many of these people go home and

1265
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,920
there's nobody there. Huh? It's not like

1266
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,480
they're doing this for someone that

1267
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,960
that's waiting for them. Relating to

1268
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,680
yourself is not a goal in and of itself.

1269
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,319
It is a step to something, but it's not

1270
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,200
in and of itself an achievement. The

1271
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:14,640
goal is relating to others.

1272
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,480
The goal is is yes, is having meaningful

1273
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,640
relationships, meaningful connections

1274
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,040
with other people and other causes that

1275
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,319
are beyond yourself. Part of why we are

1276
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,480
so miserable and so unhappy and so is

1277
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,240
because we are so constantly focused on

1278
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,240
ourselves.

1279
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,000
There's a world, there's nature, there's

1280
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,480
politics, there's climate, there's

1281
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,240
people, there's poverty, there is a ton

1282
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,319
of things to be interested in. There's

1283
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,200
art, there's creativity, there's a lot

1284
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,760
of things that are beyond us that is

1285
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,480
beyond maximizing and optimizing and

1286
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,559
hacking and focusing on myself and naval

1287
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,319
gazing.

1288
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,040
And I am a therapist and I work with

1289
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,200
individuals who I am helping to have a

1290
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,839
better relationship with themselves and

1291
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,400
deal with what stands in the way to

1292
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:04,079
relate to others not what stands in the

1293
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,160
way to feel good about me period. With

1294
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,559
gender roles reversing, have you seen

1295
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,359
men get increasingly emasculated by the

1296
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,480
success of women in your practice? And

1297
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:17,119
have you seen also the woman get sort of

1298
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,960
frustrated with the man because he's now

1299
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
not the bread winner? There was this

1300
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,520
stat I saw that said again rough numbers

1301
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,160
70% of women expect the man to be the

1302
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,760
bread bread winner. But then there's

1303
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,839
this bigger social narrative that

1304
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,839
actually no 50/50 or you know equality

1305
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,319
is the case. Um and I was sat here with

1306
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,319
a guy who runs runs the men and boys

1307
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,559
clinic. I think it's called the men and

1308
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,520
boys institute or something. Richard

1309
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,359
Reeves. Mhm. and Richard Reeves was a

1310
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,800
stay-at-home dad and then his partner,

1311
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,040
you know, and doing all of this work

1312
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,359
about men in equality that, you know, a

1313
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,559
self-proclaimed feminist, I believe, and

1314
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,599
then his wife turned around to him one

1315
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,839
day and was like,

1316
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,760
you know, and I've heard this quite a

1317
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,240
lot. I've heard from my successful

1318
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,839
female friends that part of the reason

1319
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,520
they think they can't find a man is that

1320
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,200
men feel emasculated by their success.

1321
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,640
And on the counterpoint, I'm wondering

1322
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,400
if it goes the other way. Can I take

1323
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,599
this a little differently? Sure, please.

1324
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Whatever. Emasculation is a word that

1325
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:22,480
doesn't exist in the feminine.

1326
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,400
It's always been a masculine concern.

1327
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,800
Which is part of why I said to you that

1328
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,359
masculinity is an identity that

1329
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,319
constantly has to prove itself. Mhm. If

1330
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:35,599
it was so solid, it wouldn't have to

1331
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:38,160
constantly have to show you that it

1332
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,160
really is serious and it's it's the real

1333
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,240
thing. There is, you know, those things

1334
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,079
do not translate on the feminine side.

1335
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,160
The word loser doesn't exist in the

1336
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:49,119
feminine either.

1337
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,119
And this is historical. This is not new.

1338
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,920
That men have had the challenge with

1339
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:57,119
powerful women is not new. that women

1340
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:01,040
have wanted men to be both powerful and

1341
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,760
nurturing is not new. That fathers have

1342
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,119
often been as tender toward their I

1343
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,359
think that there's a the for me the the

1344
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,240
the engagement with some of your

1345
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,599
question is that it plays into a whole

1346
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,920
discourse about men and women that at

1347
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,520
this point somehow puts them completely

1348
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,000
apart.

1349
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,839
each one kind of more and more angry at

1350
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,839
the other side. And I don't really want

1351
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,599
to participate in that. The women are

1352
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,920
talking about the useless this and the

1353
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,599
men are talking about the [ __ ] that

1354
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,920
and I don't find that helpful. People I

1355
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,000
don't think it's true.

1356
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,000
I think there are fathers and men all

1357
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,559
over the world doing everything they can

1358
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,400
to save their family, their wives, their

1359
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,960
you know it has nothing to do just with

1360
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,720
how much they earn. The world is filled

1361
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,319
with people who want to give a better

1362
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,440
life to their family and to their

1363
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:56,000
children. Men who work day and night in

1364
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:00,160
order to provide. And I think that to

1365
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,440
turn this conversation into that section

1366
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,680
that in that we are referring to is

1367
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,559
true. It exists but it is not a fair

1368
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:12,480
rendering of men, of masculinity, of

1369
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,880
fathers, of brothers, of husbands

1370
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,800
and of wives.

1371
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,960
um that there is a group of women who

1372
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,960
are out earning the men. Yes, women have

1373
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,960
out earned men for a long time in all

1374
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,480
kinds of industries, not just at the

1375
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:30,559
higher levels. Um that men have stay

1376
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,559
have not been home as primary parents. I

1377
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,640
think gay couples have shown us a whole

1378
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,480
new range. It's like it's time to kind

1379
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,960
of move on a little bit. Do you know

1380
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,400
when you say that we need to know how to

1381
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,640
relate to each other? And I think you

1382
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,400
said that it starts with being aware of

1383
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,480
ourselves.

1384
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,440
Is that roughly what you said that it

1385
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,960
starts with having a sort of a

1386
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,359
self-awareness of yourself? I think that

1387
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,280
the it's a constant combination because

1388
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:58,160
what I'm saying is that in order to have

1389
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,240
self-awareness, you need to understand

1390
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,119
your connection with others. Your

1391
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,920
self-awareness is not developed here

1392
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,559
alone by myself. You get to know

1393
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,640
yourself through your relationships with

1394
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,359
people. It is in the presence of another

1395
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,880
that we discover ourselves. And this is

1396
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,880
in part why I'm asking these questions

1397
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,720
because I think for a lot of men, we've

1398
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,640
understood who we are by how we relate

1399
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,839
and the role we play for others

1400
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,000
historically. So like I kind of

1401
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,160
understand much of who I am when you see

1402
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,160
me with my partner. Yeah. Because I will

1403
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,559
grab the door. I will grab the bags. I

1404
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,880
will help solve problems in a more

1405
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,119
logical like I'm a very like tell me how

1406
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,400
to fix it. And you understand the I

1407
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:42,319
understand myself by being how I relate

1408
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:45,920
to her. taking care of her is part of my

1409
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:47,200
identity to me. So in in such a world, I

1410
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,760
think the question becomes like what is

1411
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,880
it to be what is it to be a man? And if

1412
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,640
I don't know what that is, I find it

1413
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,880
harder to relate to others. One of the

1414
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,720
things I love to do, but that's not on a

1415
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,720
societal level. That's me in my work.

1416
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:04,319
when I do retreats, relationship

1417
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,200
retreats like we have one that I'm going

1418
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,640
to do in in October in Greece and and I

1419
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,640
have I do fishbowls and I put all the

1420
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,359
men in a fishbowl or all those who

1421
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,520
identify as men for that matter and I

1422
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,200
have the women just listen the people

1423
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,920
around

1424
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,240
and for an hour they or more or two they

1425
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,480
talk about everything you just brought

1426
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,240
up their challenges, their frustrations,

1427
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,079
their hopes, their aspirations, their

1428
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,720
loss. loses their self-doubt, their

1429
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,680
shame, their shadows,

1430
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,839
and people listen without judgment,

1431
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:41,920
without opinions, just receive the the

1432
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:44,000
gift of having somebody be willing to

1433
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,880
expose themselves like that. It's

1434
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,480
extremely moving. It's very beautiful

1435
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,960
and you learn a ton. And you learn how

1436
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,799
much of your projections are, you know,

1437
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,960
standing in the way. how much you you

1438
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:00,960
you make assumptions without really

1439
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,319
knowing how hard it is to truly listen.

1440
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,640
That's when it becomes to me beautiful,

1441
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,599
worthwhile and and things change. Things

1442
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,839
become softer and people start to weep

1443
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:16,240
in front of total strangers and you

1444
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:18,079
realize humanity is bigger than gender.

1445
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,240
Gender is important, super important,

1446
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,359
but there is another layer that is just

1447
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,040
our humanity. And at this moment in our

1448
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,760
society where there's tons of

1449
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,880
uncertainties that connecting on the

1450
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,760
human level to me supersedes some of

1451
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,599
these gender wars. There's lots of it. I

1452
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,160
don't and and I leave it to others to

1453
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,280
comment on that. But my work is to

1454
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,440
create alternative conversations, better

1455
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,440
conversations. Are you hopeful?

1456
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,680
Honestly, in those moments I'm very

1457
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,839
hopeful. But are you hopeful when they

1458
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,280
leave the retreat and they go back onto

1459
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,040
the algorithms? I hope that some of them

1460
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,720
will do that and some of them will

1461
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:01,119
actually experience a profound change

1462
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,359
you know but in the moment I feel like I

1463
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,000
can do something I'm hopeful when I can

1464
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,839
do something when I can contribute when

1465
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,880
I can create something that's really

1466
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:14,640
special that's you know I'm not hopeful

1467
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,480
when I'm helpless when I'm passive so in

1468
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,720
those moments I am hopeful because

1469
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,880
something really beautiful is happening

1470
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,760
you know when people connect at a deeper

1471
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,119
level it is very very meaningful be it

1472
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,799
at work or be it at home I mean it it's

1473
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,440
anywhere at this point where I can

1474
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:35,440
create these connections people I mean

1475
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,520
it's sentence that I take with me all

1476
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,680
over the all the time it's the quality

1477
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,960
of your relationships will determine the

1478
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,480
quality of your lives and my work is

1479
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,200
about helping you have better

1480
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,480
relationships be more confident be more

1481
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,240
connected I I I can analyze a lot of

1482
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,240
these statistics but I don't know what

1483
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,240
to do with it. Be more confident. Yes.

1484
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,640
What is confidence in that regard?

1485
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,040
Confidence is when you are able to see

1486
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:07,160
yourself as a flawed person and still

1487
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,160
hold yourself in high regard.

1488
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,040
That's from my friend Terry Real. But it

1489
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,040
is a great definition of confidence.

1490
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,640
It's not when I when I know when I'm

1491
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,000
sure. It's none of that. It's actually

1492
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,280
when I see myself as flawed

1493
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,079
but I still hold myself in high regard

1494
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,160
that means I'm confident. And is there

1495
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,960
is there work one can do to get to such

1496
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,520
a place? Yes, of course. Work and life

1497
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,000
experience and maturity. But for a lot

1498
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,520
of people their work and life experience

1499
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,599
knocks them down to make them think

1500
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,760
they're just a thought they're just a

1501
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,119
flawed person.

1502
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,960
That's what I thought when I was in my

1503
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,799
20s and 30s too. And if I made a

1504
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,640
mistake, I could obsess about it for 3

1505
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:52,480
weeks. Now it's 3 hours, sometimes 3

1506
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,599
days if it's really bad. But you know,

1507
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,760
you do you you learn to accept you make

1508
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,599
mistakes and life goes on and you try

1509
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,760
again. So there's no shortcut to No, no,

1510
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,920
no, no. Is there anything that builds on

1511
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,799
itself? The nice thing about it is that

1512
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,680
it builds on itself.

1513
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:13,200
It adds layer by layer, step by step. Is

1514
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,839
there anything one can do to accelerate

1515
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,599
that process? Why?

1516
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:21,040
So that we can become more confident

1517
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:24,079
quicker. No, that's called arrogance.

1518
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,839
When a when a when a 22 year old, you

1519
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,359
know, sometimes it's arrogant. I mean

1520
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,240
there listen, there are things you can

1521
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,839
feel confident about very early on and

1522
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,000
and you've tried them. And then there's

1523
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,920
other things. It's also not I am

1524
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,240
confident. I'm confident about certain

1525
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,000
things. You can trust me on some things.

1526
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,480
You should not trust me to get you to a

1527
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,520
certain place. neither on time, neither

1528
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,079
without getting lost. So I have zero

1529
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,760
confidence in that area, but I'm quite

1530
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,680
confident in some of the things that I

1531
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,319
do. And confidence doesn't mean that I

1532
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,880
know or that I'm right.

1533
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:00,559
It's that I'm prepared to do things and

1534
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,240
be mistaken and not know and try again.

1535
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,240
Two different people can go through the

1536
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,559
same experience and one of their

1537
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,799
confidence can build and the other one

1538
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:13,520
can lose confidence. Yes, that is the

1539
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:16,640
biggest mystery question. Why two people

1540
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:19,119
with the same story? For one, it becomes

1541
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:23,520
what brings their resilience and what

1542
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:26,559
gives them the drive and what makes them

1543
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,240
be people that are engaged with life and

1544
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,720
the world. And for the other person,

1545
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,319
it's what broke them. It's what crushed

1546
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,480
them. It's what that makes it so

1547
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:37,119
impossible for them to actually put one

1548
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,440
foot in front of the other. And if you

1549
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,720
can ever tell me why this and versus

1550
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,799
that, you know, why this person to it is

1551
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,720
one of the great mystery questions for

1552
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,760
any therapist for that matter in

1553
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,000
general. Why the same circumstances

1554
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,079
build the strength of one and become the

1555
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,480
weakness of the other. There's clearly

1556
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,640
some kind of a pair of sunglasses in

1557
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,000
between what happened and how I

1558
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,079
perceived it or something. There must be

1559
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,040
some I you know there's a lots of things

1560
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:08,079
but what we do know is that for many

1561
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:11,359
people who have major adverse

1562
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,599
circumstances but manage to turn use

1563
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,839
them and turn them and and really make a

1564
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,880
beautiful life for themselves. It

1565
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:21,200
usually there was one defining factor

1566
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,359
that differentiates them from everybody

1567
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,960
else who had similar circumstances is

1568
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,640
that they had somebody who believed in

1569
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,359
them.

1570
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,880
a coach, a teacher, a neighbor, not

1571
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,799
necessarily a family member actually

1572
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,160
because the adversity is often in the

1573
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,000
family. So, somebody who believed in you

1574
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,520
when you didn't believe in yourself and

1575
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,720
didn't give up even when you were

1576
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,480
[ __ ] up. I had um a lady called Dr.

1577
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,319
Lisa Feldman on the podcast recently

1578
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,240
who's a neuroscientist and one of the

1579
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,760
things she said to me has really stayed

1580
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,079
with me and I think about it a lot and I

1581
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,160
talk about it a lot which is um she said

1582
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,880
to me she told me the story of a young

1583
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,040
lady who grew up and had some uh an

1584
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,640
aggressive uncle who would like beat her

1585
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,240
and this young lady she was good in

1586
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,160
school she slept well everything was

1587
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,000
fine and then many years later this

1588
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,040
young lady was watching Oprah Winfreyy's

1589
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,720
show and it was about domestic abuse and

1590
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,400
there was women on there crying and

1591
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,599
talking about their trauma and all those

1592
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,200
things and essentially this young lady

1593
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,839
suddenly started to experience the

1594
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,319
symptoms of trauma. Mhm. Unproductive in

1595
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,799
education, couldn't sleep as well and

1596
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,960
visibly traumatized. The trauma hadn't

1597
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,520
appeared hadn't there was wasn't

1598
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,079
symptomatic up until she watched this

1599
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,079
show with Oprah. And it made me think

1600
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,240
that is there a possibility that some of

1601
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,079
our trauma not all of it but some of it

1602
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,640
is

1603
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,880
like contagious i.e. We give meaning to

1604
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,480
it when someone tells us the meaning of

1605
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,920
what happened to us

1606
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,119
like are we giving meaning to the things

1607
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,240
that happened to us and it goes to what

1608
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,559
we were saying here about you can go

1609
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,880
through the same two thing but interpret

1610
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,599
it differently do we inherit the meaning

1611
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,119
externally from somewhere you know it's

1612
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,000
interesting because I think about this a

1613
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,680
lot with things like anxiety I'm like it

1614
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,119
feels like you know I know the world has

1615
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,520
changed and we're less connected but it

1616
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,799
does feel like

1617
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,960
had I not known that anxiety existed, I

1618
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,599
probably I'm unsure whether I I would

1619
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,359
have personally experienced it. I think

1620
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,200
that the anxiety culture actually kind

1621
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,359
of made me anxious. It made me label the

1622
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,960
feeling. And I'm just wondering if you

1623
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,480
have a perspective on this idea that we

1624
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:31,680
like give meaning to

1625
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:35,520
our experience and then that yes of

1626
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:38,160
course all the time we give meaning to

1627
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,720
everything. We are meaning making

1628
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,960
machines and if you don't do an

1629
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,079
individual meaning attribution you get a

1630
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,480
collective cultural social attribution.

1631
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,480
In our society we may call it anxiety.

1632
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:54,000
In another society we may call it the

1633
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,240
ancestors are unhappy.

1634
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,799
Somebody is a spirit is knocking at your

1635
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:03,599
door. Somebody has not been properly

1636
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:06,799
mourned. Somebody is being um degraded.

1637
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,960
So, so there's every every ill ease,

1638
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,680
every disease

1639
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,200
has a story, has a meaning, has an

1640
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,400
attribution.

1641
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,400
The words change.

1642
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,640
That's on a cultural level. I think it's

1643
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,880
very important to not just individualize

1644
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,960
these things and think I give meaning.

1645
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,039
You we give the meaning that our culture

1646
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,280
has taught us to give. You've learn you.

1647
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,440
So, you've kind of become you're part of

1648
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,039
the anxiety generation. So you put you

1649
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,440
give words of anxiety, stress, burnout.

1650
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,839
There's a whole lingo that is that

1651
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,079
didn't exist 40 years ago by the way. I

1652
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,760
mean those words existed but they were

1653
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,960
not nearly in the vernacular of the

1654
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,359
moment. They were not part of the

1655
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,319
therapy speak of dour you know they were

1656
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:53,119
not on Tik Tok. So there were other

1657
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:56,400
words that were people used and you know

1658
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,079
every century has certain names.

1659
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,000
Hysteria we don't hear much about

1660
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,480
hysteria these days. That was a 19th

1661
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,079
century thing. It's mental health now,

1662
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,720
you know. So, we changed the words, but

1663
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,400
we still are trying to give meaning to

1664
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,200
our

1665
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,960
ill ease. I guess this is a question of

1666
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,839
identity as well, which is who do I

1667
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:21,359
think I am? And who I think I am will

1668
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:24,319
probably become who I am, at least as it

1669
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,720
relates to relating to people. No, no.

1670
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,160
Who do you think you are is part of who

1671
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,559
you are and how other people see you is

1672
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,640
also a part of who you are. We are

1673
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,440
constantly looking at ourselves from the

1674
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:40,160
inside and from the outside.

1675
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,680
We do not exist without the inter in

1676
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:46,799
integration of also the gaze from the

1677
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,720
outside in. And it's a two-way street

1678
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,799
all the time. So if I think I'm a late

1679
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:55,039
person, you said, you know, get there on

1680
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:57,200
time. Um, then I'm likely to be late

1681
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,119
off more because I can I've identified

1682
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,359
with that becomes part of my character.

1683
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,599
It starts to become how I predict my

1684
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,799
future. And Lisa Filmore was saying to

1685
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,760
me that the brain is this prediction

1686
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,520
machine. So it's like predicting um what

1687
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,599
to what it will do next based on the

1688
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,280
past. So my identity is like a

1689
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,799
prediction of what I'll become. And you

1690
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,440
know, same I think of this maybe the

1691
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:19,359
same in relationships. Your behavior may

1692
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,440
be a prediction but that doesn't mean

1693
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:23,599
your identity.

1694
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,079
Don't confuse identity with behavior.

1695
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,839
It's it's it's they are connected but

1696
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,839
your identity is a lot more than your

1697
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,839
behavior.

1698
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,960
You know at GFK there are three lines at

1699
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,440
the airport. Yeah. One is for the

1700
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,200
tourist, one is for the American

1701
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,119
passport holder and one is for the

1702
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,000
resident alien.

1703
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:49,119
The tourist may have been living in the

1704
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,319
states for years, but they don't have

1705
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:55,440
the papers. So the internal definition

1706
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:57,039
is not recognized by the external. The

1707
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,880
American, you may have been living your

1708
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,640
whole life abroad, but you were born in

1709
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,039
the US. So you have the papers, you have

1710
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,280
the external recognition, but the

1711
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,200
internal one doesn't match. And then the

1712
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,480
resident alien is the one who has been

1713
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:14,559
there a long time but doesn't have the

1714
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,640
is a guest of some sort right um and I

1715
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,600
find that a fascinating moment to

1716
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,480
understand identity when you stand there

1717
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,560
what is internal what is external what

1718
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,120
is seen from other how others recognize

1719
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,679
you and think and how others define who

1720
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,480
you are and how you define who you are

1721
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:34,000
and these these are conversations

1722
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,319
that the question that you're asking

1723
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,159
about trauma is a whole it's a different

1724
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:43,199
question because

1725
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:45,600
the trauma is not the event itself.

1726
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:48,239
The trauma is often in the experience of

1727
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,239
the event without an empathic witness

1728
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:53,120
without in it. Yes. Without what makes

1729
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,880
an event traumatic is often the fact

1730
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,080
that you experience something without an

1731
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,480
emphatic witness.

1732
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Well, it's not the fact that the the the

1733
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,560
you it's not the event itself. And so

1734
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,239
what happens is she sees this Oprah show

1735
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,279
and it's not just that she sees the

1736
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:16,000
women tell their stories but she sees

1737
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:19,440
Oprah with her unique kind of empathy

1738
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,880
respond to the women and give value to

1739
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,880
their experience and acknowledge it and

1740
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,040
express the sadness that comes with it

1741
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,000
and the devastation that they may have

1742
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:34,319
experienced. And she she is the

1743
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,719
consumate empathic witness who gives not

1744
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,319
just meaning to your story but because

1745
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:41,520
before you can give meaning you even

1746
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,600
have to acknowledge it. Mhm. You have to

1747
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,759
recognize that it even happened. And in

1748
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,359
many of those situations it's the lack

1749
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,560
of acknowledgement that is the most

1750
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:52,400
traumatic. Not the thing itself

1751
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,640
or not only the thing itself the fact

1752
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,239
that nobody even admits that this took

1753
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,280
place. So as she's watching this

1754
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:03,120
empathic resonance in front of her,

1755
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,600
something opens inside of her that

1756
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,960
allows her to finally

1757
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,719
recogn cry, you know, her do her own

1758
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,280
acknowledgement and realize what was

1759
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,120
done to her.

1760
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,280
That's a different way of interpret and

1761
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,360
I have no idea if that is true. But just

1762
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,840
to give you another reading of what may

1763
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,760
have happened to this woman. Mhm. And

1764
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,800
for a while she will not sleep. And for

1765
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,800
a while she because suddenly

1766
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,520
in order to finally come to admit

1767
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,920
something you need to feel safe to let

1768
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,640
it happen. And when you watch the opera

1769
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,520
show with those women this is I just did

1770
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,480
the opera. So I I had the people and I

1771
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,840
see how she it's it's an amazing moment

1772
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:48,239
of being held and experiencing a

1773
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,400
container that allows you to experience

1774
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:55,400
the pain that you've been holding in.

1775
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,400
interesting.

1776
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,400
I I was it's a very interesting um

1777
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,159
alternative perspective especially this

1778
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,560
idea of this the empathic witness and

1779
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:08,400
the minute you see empathy shown to your

1780
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,159
experience um in such a way yeah maybe

1781
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,159
you have permission to feel in a way

1782
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:13,520
that you didn't get to feel but also in

1783
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,520
that environment I imagine there was a

1784
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,800
studio audience and they were providing

1785
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,560
empathy and there was Oprah and they

1786
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,640
were providing empathy and then you had

1787
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,040
someone she could relate to who in that

1788
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:26,000
scenario was

1789
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,600
being held and had a label like an

1790
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,360
implicit label attached to their

1791
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,679
experience. But she does it without

1792
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,600
audience now. And um it's it's I think

1793
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,480
it was a long time ago. So when she used

1794
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,960
to have her show many decades ago, I was

1795
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,480
my first time on the opera show in ' 87.

1796
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:47,360
87 with a studio audience. Yeah. How was

1797
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,600
it? It wasn't

1798
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,920
a very powerful experience for a woman,

1799
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,880
a young woman as I was back then. It was

1800
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,719
just like what? Yeah. This is quite

1801
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,320
embarrassing for me to admit. But if you

1802
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,080
know me well, there's something that you

1803
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,000
know about me which is a function of my

1804
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,679
personality and that is that I lose

1805
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,440
everything. I've lost my wallet. I've

1806
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,360
lost multiple passports. I now actually

1807
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,880
have two passports because there's a

1808
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,400
high probability of me losing one. And

1809
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,000
when you lose your wallet overseas, as I

1810
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,520
have many times, it's a particular

1811
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,880
inconvenience because you also lose your

1812
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,320
driving license and your credit cards

1813
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,159
and those kinds of things. And that's

1814
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,080
why I'm so happy that our show sponsor

1815
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,840
Extra have invented this thing I have in

1816
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,239
my hand. They have partnered with

1817
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,880
Apple's Find My Technology. So, all I

1818
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:28,640
have to do is open their app and play a

1819
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,040
noise and it will tell me where my

1820
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,880
wallet is. Extra wallets are slim.

1821
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,120
They're made of recycled aluminium and

1822
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,280
they block various types of digital

1823
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,080
theft. And with one click, your cards

1824
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,360
can pop up and are ready to go. So, if

1825
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,080
this sounds like the kind of thing you

1826
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,320

1831
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,840
marketeers keep making this mistake.

1832
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,000
They're chasing volume instead of

1833
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,840
quality. And when you try to be seen by

1834
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,520
more people instead of the right people,

1835
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,679
all you're doing is making noise. But

1836
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,080
that noise rarely shifts the needle and

1837
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,760
it's often quite expensive. And I know

1838
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,199
as there was a time in my career where I

1839
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,600
kept making this mistake that many of

1840
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:15,679
you will be making it too. Eventually, I

1841
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,280
started posting ads on our show sponsors

1842
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,199
platform, LinkedIn. And that's when

1843
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,280
things started to change. I put that

1844
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,040
change down to a few critical things.

1845
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,120
One of them being that LinkedIn was then

1846
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,360
and still is today the platform where

1847
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,440
decision makers go to not only to think

1848
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,960
and learn but also to buy. And when you

1849
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,640
market your business there, you're

1850
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,880
putting it right in front of people who

1851
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,719
actually have the power to say yes. And

1852
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,880
you can target them by job title,

1853
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,640
industry, and company size. It's simply

1854
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,880
a sharper way to spend your marketing

1855
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,120
budget. And if you haven't tried it, how

1856
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,360
about this? Give LinkedIn ads a try. and

1857
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,040
I'm going to give you a $100 ad credit

1858
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,280
to get you started. If you visit

1859
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,280
linkedin.com/diary,

1860
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,520
you can claim that right now. That's

1861
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,199
linkedin.com/diary.

1862
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,120
So, if I made you president of the

1863
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,679
entire world and your job was to prevent

1864
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,520
the the social atrophy, this decay of

1865
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,760
social connections and relationships and

1866
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,960
you had to take three steps on a global

1867
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,000
basis to they can be drastic steps. You

1868
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,440
can delete mobile phones. Oh god. They

1869
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,520
can be any drastic step you want to

1870
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,679
take. I think that things are lived in

1871
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,600
the details, not in the big things.

1872
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:23,760
Okay? You know, where was I recently? I

1873
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,000
went to a place and I remember making

1874
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:32,000
the comment. Everybody says hello.

1875
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,400
People said hello. People were friendly

1876
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,920
when you when you went into a place,

1877
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,480
when you were on the street, when you

1878
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,040
went it was like I said, "Oh my god, I

1879
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,440
have I I have not been in a place." It

1880
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,880
felt small enough but it wasn't small

1881
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:49,360
where people kept saying hello have a

1882
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:53,440
nice day this looks very good you know

1883
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:56,000
so it's that basic you make it a law you

1884
01:14:53,440 --> 01:15:00,640
have to say no I don't legislate these

1885
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,440
things at all I think it's more of a of

1886
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,800
a it's a cultural shift it's a it's a

1887
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,560
return to to to practices that still are

1888
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,880
prevalent in many other parts of the

1889
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,239
world talking to strangers Yes. Talking

1890
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,679
to strangers. Okay. So, you're going to

1891
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,880
make it illegal. It's an incredible

1892
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,800
thing to talk to strangers. Um, so

1893
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,800
Esteel makes it illegal not to talk to

1894
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,280
strangers during illegal. No. No. I said

1895
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,480
don't bring the law into it. It's much

1896
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,719
more art than law. Anybody who these

1897
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:32,719
days can make people laugh or sing

1898
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:36,000
together is doing holy work.

1899
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,239
So go sing with people or go because

1900
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,360
when you sing together you create you

1901
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:44,719
create a collective resonance. You you

1902
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,440
actually are bringing that resonance

1903
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,000
that it is very empathic. It's very

1904
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:53,280
kind. It's compassionate. It's caring.

1905
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,800
It's playful. It brings out a whole set

1906
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,320
of other things in people.

1907
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,719
And the third thing would be teach

1908
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,040
people how to have conflict. You asked

1909
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:06,480
me before when when when when you argue

1910
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,800
with your with your partner. I think I

1911
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,600
think that the the majority of our

1912
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,679
arguments are about three basic things.

1913
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,400
And this is based on on Howard Markman's

1914
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,800
work, but you know, it's not the issue

1915
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,640
you're fighting about.

1916
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,440
Actually, what you can often ask is what

1917
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,520
is it that you're fighting for? And what

1918
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,760
people fight for when they argue

1919
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:31,920
whatever thing they're having a spat

1920
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,880
about. They fight for power and control.

1921
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:38,080
Who makes the decision? And whose

1922
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,880
priorities matter most? They fight for

1923
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,880
trust, for care and closeness. Can I

1924
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,040
trust you? Do you have my back? Can I

1925
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,760
lean on you? Can I rely on you? Will you

1926
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,920
show up for me? And they fight for

1927
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,640
respect and recognition. Do you value

1928
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,239
me? Do I matter? And does this all

1929
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,840
translate to work? You've you've now

1930
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,760
started doing a lot more work with

1931
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,199
businesses and companies around sort of

1932
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,520
their working culture and connection and

1933
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:03,360
relationships in the workplace. All of

1934
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,280
those things you just listed there, are

1935
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,400
they also the reasons why our

1936
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,760
relationships are successful or

1937
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,360
unsuccessful in a work environment?

1938
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:13,280
Absolutely. So I actually have been

1939
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,520
working with corporations and in the

1940
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:18,000
business world for quite a while um and

1941
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,360
have been talking in and speaking in for

1942
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,840
with corporations and companies. What is

1943
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,920
new is that I I became an advisor to a

1944
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,040
number of companies in particular in

1945
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,040
this case with culture amp and and the

1946
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,960
reason that became such a wonderful

1947
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,520
collaboration is because I brought my

1948
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,120
clinical expertise and they're bringing

1949
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:41,760
massive amounts of data science people

1950
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:44,159
science 1.5 billion experience survey

1951
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,960
points. I mean it's just like so it's

1952
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:49,840
not no longer just my intuitive sense.

1953
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:53,040
It's backed. It's

1954
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,159
And we created this card game because my

1955
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:58,880
original card game, people wanted the

1956
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:00,320
corporate was demanding for it, but

1957
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,080
every time they had to take out the

1958
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,880
cards with the pink triangles, which

1959
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,199
were the sex questions in order to make

1960
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,159
it work safe,

1961
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,800
safe for work. So I said, "Okay, let's

1962
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:14,400
create a game just for the workplace

1963
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,040
that will create meaningful

1964
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,120
relationships at work." And what's

1965
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,840
fascinating is that what the research

1966
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:26,000
showed is that there are four major

1967
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:28,719
relational pillars that actually sustain

1968
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,480
this quality of relationships in the

1969
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,120
workplace and they are directly

1970
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:37,440
connected to these three things that I

1971
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:39,840
said we fight for. So one was trust, one

1972
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,159
was belonging. Okay. So on trust, how do

1973
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,320
I know what what is trust in specific

1974
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:46,719
terms? What does that mean? Trust is a

1975
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:50,159
leap of faith.

1976
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,920
Trust is a sense that that is really

1977
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:55,360
it's an active engagement with the

1978
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:58,719
unknown says Rachel Butsman. It's like

1979
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:02,480
trust is not I know for sure. Trust is I

1980
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:05,040
don't know for sure and I'm willing to

1981
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:07,120
believe it. And that's the definition of

1982
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,760
the word trust. And in a work context,

1983
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:12,719
what does that mean? It means that I can

1984
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,640
rely on you. Yeah. On my team. Yeah. On

1985
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,159
my manager.

1986
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,159
um that you uh you have my back. Yeah.

1987
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:22,080
That you're not going to betray me.

1988
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:25,760
You're not going to put your interests

1989
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:28,880
ahead of mine. You are not going to take

1990
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,760
credit where the when it's not yours. Um

1991
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,239
that you care about me and that we are

1992
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,800
part of something together. So trust

1993
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:40,080
then connects directly to a sense of

1994
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:43,840
belonging that we are part of a group of

1995
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,320
a company and in and I get a certain

1996
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,560
sense of who I am by virtue of my sense

1997
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,320
of connection to this group and the

1998
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,199
group defines me and gets my

1999
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:56,080
contribution. So it's a mutual

2000
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:58,960
experience. Mutuality is essential to

2001
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:02,560
living organisms be it in nature or in

2002
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,880
social ecological systems. And there is

2003
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,280
recognition means that there is respect

2004
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,040
that I feel valued that I feel that my

2005
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,760
that I contribute and that it is

2006
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,520
recognized. This is essential because I

2007
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,280
could achieve and perform and meet the

2008
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,520
productivity goals and all of that but

2009
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,239
if nobody pays attention to it, it

2010
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,440
doesn't really meet the need. But the

2011
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,600
biggest one is the collective

2012
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:28,120
resilience. To me, that's the one that

2013
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,120
really stands out because

2014
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:33,120
resilience isn't an individual matter

2015
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,840
only. It's not just a set of traits that

2016
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:39,280
exists inside of you and that you need

2017
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:42,159
to tap into in order to face adversity

2018
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,280
and all of that. Resilience is how we at

2019
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:47,600
this point in particular are able to

2020
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,760
respond creatively and adaptively and

2021
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,080
flexibly to all the changes that are

2022
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,440
happening. The workplace is in massive

2023
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:58,480
flux, massive flux. And from a

2024
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:01,440
relational point of view, it's huge. And

2025
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:03,520
it is basically at this point becoming

2026
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,360
no longer just a soft skills. It's

2027
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:09,440
becoming the new bottom line. Basically,

2028
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,120
Esther, thank you so much. Thank you so

2029
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,480
much for the work that you do. I I when

2030
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,640
I've met you the first time, I was

2031
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,040
convinced that you're in fact an alien

2032
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,920
from another planet because you have an

2033
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,920
ability to understand situations.

2034
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,520
um at a deeper, more intuitive level

2035
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,800
than anyone I've ever met. Specifically

2036
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,080
as it relates to just like the human

2037
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,920
condition and the way that we are, the

2038
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,080
excuses to make the patterns of a human

2039
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,159
and it really like shocked me. You were

2040
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,360
able to see through me in a way that I

2041
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,920
did not like,

2042
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,199
but I appreciate it. Um and it's really

2043
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,520
remarkable. There's very few people I've

2044
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:43,600
ever met that are like that that have

2045
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,159
that ability. It's a really really

2046
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:49,840
special thing. Um, and it's been the

2047
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:52,080
cause of so much healed and cured and

2048
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,440
fixed problems for so many of us. We

2049
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,560
have a tradition on this podcast where

2050
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,679
the last guest leaves a question for the

2051
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,560
next guest, not knowing who they leave

2052
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:01,280
it for. The question left for you is,

2053
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:05,080
how are you going to adapt to a world of

2054
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,080
AI and robots?

2055
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:18,080
I am going to uh

2056
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:20,800
use AI as a tool as I just did an hour

2057
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:25,040
before I came here. I was in a meeting

2058
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:30,080
and we were generating ideas and uh and

2059
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:32,880
one of us asked the AI uh exactly this

2060
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:35,360
uh what would you see is the next step

2061
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,600
in the collaboration between what would

2062
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,400
be bold collaborations between Estelle

2063
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,960
Purel and Culture AMP the very company

2064
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:46,000
that with whom I created the cards and

2065
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,400
the AI gave us incredible ideas but it

2066
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,600
was both we had AI and we had the

2067
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,760
people. The people could use the AI, the

2068
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,960
AI became way more relevant because it

2069
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,920
had the people. So, as long as I can use

2070
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:03,679
it as a tool

2071
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:06,560
um to foster the communication and to

2072
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:10,960
generate ideas and between me and

2073
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:14,000
others, I think that um

2074
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,520
I am still shaping it and it is helping

2075
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,840
me. I would hope that it doesn't just

2076
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:24,080
begin to shape me or us all and make us

2077
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,080
into a species that none of us can yet

2078
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,840
imagine.

2079
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,920
Some people are very much looking

2080
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,800
forward to that new species. I kind of

2081
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,960
like the ones we've been.

2082
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,480
We imperfect creatures. We're

2083
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,639
unpredictable.

2084
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,280
But there is something fascinating about

2085
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,679
human beings that has been the core of

2086
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,679
my work. Thank you. Again, I'll link the

2087
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,280
cards below for everyone to go and get a

2088
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,600
pair. I think I'm I think I'm going to

2089
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:52,719
use them in at the very start of the

2090
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:55,120
week with my teams. So, just to kind of

2091
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,719
create a bit of a space where we can

2092
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,719
connect with each other before we get

2093
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,840
into more difficult work, but also

2094
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,040
there's other sort of work environments

2095
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,199
when I have new investments and stuff

2096
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,199
like that. It's really, you can do it

2097
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:07,280
one-on-one, you can do it on boarding,

2098
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:09,600
you can do it offsite, but there is

2099
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,840
something about the weekly meeting, all

2100
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,760
hands on deck kind of meeting where we

2101
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:17,040
do a card, one person each and I can

2102
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,440
tell you and especially when it's

2103
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:23,120
remote, which you are not. Yeah. But

2104
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:25,360
there everybody knows the the the

2105
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,000
lackluster attention that you can get in

2106
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,520
a Zoom meeting with everybody doing five

2107
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,520
other things at the same time. You just

2108
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,520
need to track the eyes.

2109
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,639
But once people start to tell stories

2110
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,639
like this, people get the others are

2111
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:41,679
interested and are listening. It changes

2112
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:44,000
the whole dynamic. So, uh it's a

2113
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:46,239
beautiful ritual to have your weekly

2114
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,639
start with a few cards. Um Esther, thank

2115
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:49,760
you so much for all that you do. So, so

2116
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,800
wonderful to see you. I feel like you

2117
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,639
you help correct me and uh in an

2118
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,120
important way and you do it with such

2119
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,880
what was one of them today when you were

2120
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,239
talking about the dementia and the

2121
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:05,600
Alzheimer's and that ambiguous loss I

2122
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:07,120
felt I felt that because I think

2123
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,760
sometimes

2124
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:11,360
sometimes I um I create that impression

2125
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,520
and my one of my ex-girlfriends said

2126
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,480
that to me she said even if you're

2127
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,320
sitting next to me I feel like you're a

2128
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,679
million miles away and I remember

2129
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,880
thinking it's such a horrible way to

2130
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,000
make someone feel you know and my

2131
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,520
girlfriend. It's what a wonderful thing

2132
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,600
it is for someone to want your attention

2133
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,679
and to want you to hug them and to want

2134
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,920
you to care about them and to look at

2135
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,159
them. What a wonderful privilege that is

2136
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,520
and to like insult that privilege by

2137
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,920
being a million miles away. I just

2138
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,639
thought this horrible thing it is that

2139
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:39,520
you know how often during the day do you

2140
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,120
send just a little sweet nothing? I know

2141
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:45,040
I need to do that more. I don't know. Do

2142
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:46,560
you know how much it changes a person's

2143
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,760
Yeah. just to say that you're thinking

2144
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,159
about them as well because I do think

2145
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:53,280
about them but I just don't I don't you

2146
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:54,639
know so you're saying it to me. Yeah.

2147
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,520
Yeah. Exactly. I need to say it to her.

2148
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,560
I'm going to say I'm going to tell her

2149
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:01,920
now Esther. Okay.

2150
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,800
Life is lived in the details. It's all

2151
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,800
these small things.

2152
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,960
It's not it's like when you ask about

2153
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,760
the changing of the world. I I don't

2154
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:15,360
think in these big things. And this, you

2155
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:20,120
know, when it's done authentically,

2156
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:20,120
it's not big and it

2157
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,719
Yeah. Okay. Okay. That puts energy into

2158
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,480
a relationship. She said, "Oh, with a

2159
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,320
little heart face." She said,

2160
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,239
"Sweetheart."

2161
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:37,320
And she's typing.

2162
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:37,320
Okay, you got it. No, I don't.

2163
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,800
The hardest conversations are often the

2164
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,040
ones we avoid. But what if you had the

2165
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,639
right question to start them with? Every

2166
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:49,760
single guest on the diary of a co has

2167
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:51,040
left behind a question in this diary.

2168
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,040
And it's a question designed to

2169
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,800
challenge, to connect, and to go deeper

2170
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,880
with the next guest. And these are all

2171
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,040
the questions that I have here in my

2172
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,360
hand. On one side, you've got the

2173
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,800
question that was asked, the name of the

2174
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,679
person who wrote it, and on the other

2175
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,080
side, if you scan that, you can watch

2176
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:10,239
the person who came after who answered

2177
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:12,080
it. 51 questions split across three

2178
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:14,560
different levels. The warm-up level, the

2179
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,239
open up level, and the deep level. So,

2180
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,159
you decide how deep the conversation

2181
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:20,159
goes. And people play these conversation

2182
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:22,960
cards in boardrooms at work, in

2183
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:25,199
bedrooms, alone at night, and on first

2184
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,639
dates, and everywhere in between. I'll

2185
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,080
put a link to the conversation cards in

2186
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,320
the description below and you can get

2187
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,840
yours at the diary.com.

2188
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,480
This has always blown my mind a little

2189
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,639
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

2190
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,480
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

2191
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,600
show. So, could I ask you for a favor?

2192
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,040

2193
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,719

01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,239
that is by hitting the subscribe button.

2196
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,760

that, then I'll do everything in my

2198
