00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,639
Prashant Dhawan. During Nawaz's time, the entire global

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,679
media, be it American media, European

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,320
media, everyone is discussing

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,560
that what had not happened till date has finally happened, has

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,199
Iran shot down the F35 fighter jet, not

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,199
once, has this

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,160
happened twice, you will be able to see it here because the Iranian

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,640
government has officially claimed that

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
they have shot down two Israeli fighter jets.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,760
Now this is the claim from Iran

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,879
that not only have they shot down two Israeli fighter

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
jets, they have also shot down F35 fighter jets.

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
Some Iranian officials are also saying

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
that they have also captured an Israeli pilot.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
And look, ever since Iran

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,120
started claiming this, you will

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,039
see that many articles have

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
started getting published across the world.  Iran

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,360
shoots down two Israeli fighter jets.  Iran

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
's media itself is obviously propelling this.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,719
And the funniest thing I

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,119
saw here is this Chinese media, to which I will frankly

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,040
say that in terms of credibility, I would

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
give absolutely zero marks out of 10

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
because these people print anything.  That means it

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
is a global network only in name.  But

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,600
they have no credibility.  CGTA you might know that

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,119
these people published the news that the

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,720
G35 fighter jet has crashed.  Now

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,000
this image is fake.  This is an AI image.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,080
This was spread on social media by some Iranian or maybe some Iran

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,320
supporter.  this

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,479
is not real.  Global Time also started reporting that

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Iranian media has claimed that

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,320
they have shot down two fighter jets.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Now obviously western media has

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
started.  The Chinese media started.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,560
Iranian media is talking about it anyway.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,799
How could Indian media stay behind?

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,040
Our news outlets also started reporting that

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,320
Iran was claiming it had

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,759
shot down two Israeli F35 Hulk jets.

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,640
Now see, here Iran has

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,960
adopted Pakistan's strategy of just

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
saying anything initially.  There is no proof.  There

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
is no evidence.  No images, no videos have

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,879
surfaced yet.  Nor do we know

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,599
what happened to the captured Israeli pilot.  But Iran spread all this by

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,120
saying all this in the international media.

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,680
Now, the responsibility lies on Israel to prove

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,760
whether your fighter jets have fallen here or

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
not and look, the world is

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,680
absolutely interested in the fact that it is said that S400 will fall short to surround the F35 which is

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,599
said to be the best fighter jet in the world.  The

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,160

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,640
Americans have said it many times

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,879
that the S400 is suitable only for the fourth generation, 4.5

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
generation fire jets.  The

61
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,480

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,239
stealth mode of the F35 FJet is so good that the S400

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,879
missile defense system will not even

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,239
know when the F35 has arrived.  The

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,879
Americans used to claim these things.  But if what

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,840
Iran is claiming here turns out to be true,

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,480
that they shot down two F35s each.  That too

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,560
not from S400 but from S300. Do you know how

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,760
old S300 is?  It is an air defence system from the USSR era.

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,480

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,800
Its first variant came out around 1970-1980.

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,200
Later some of its advanced variants came and

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
today no one even buys it.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
Russia is a very poor country which does

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
not have the money to

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,519
defend itself.  Russia hands him this air

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,959
defence system.  Rest, everyone is

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,959
buying either S400, be it Turkey,

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
India or China, and everyone is

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,959
actually waiting for when S500 will arrive?

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,560
So in the meanwhile tell them that Iran has shot

82
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,360
down an F35 fighter jet using the S300.  This

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,159

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,799
puts a big stain on the value and brand value of the F35 fighter jet.

85
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,120
Now it is obvious that all this news

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,080
reached Israel.  Then these people said that

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,760
look all this stuff is fake, baseless.   They are

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,879
saying that Iran did not shoot down any of their F35

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,920
fighter jets and

90
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,920
Iran did not capture any woman pilot.  So these are two versions.

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,400
I told you both.  Iran's

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,519
version is resonating more on social media and in international media

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,000
because now

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,320
see, this also happens here,

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
many journalists who otherwise

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,400
write against Israel also stand up in support of Iran.

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,479
So because of this, the

98
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,440
news spread about Iran has spread far and wide.

99
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,280
Whereas, on the clarification that Israel is giving,

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
if you assume that articles are being published,

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,720
around 36 or 40 articles are being published on Iran news, and these

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,919
supporters of Iran have even gone to Wikipedia,

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,040
there is a page where it is shown

105
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,600

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,560
how many accidents have happened with Lockheed Martin's F35 Lightning 2.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,960
In this, they have

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,400
put an entry in the year 2025 that on 13 June 2025, 2

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,960
F35s were shot down by Iran during

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,680
the June 2025 Israeli strikes

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,720
on Iran. These reports are

112
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,639
unconfirmed for now, but they have got

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
this thing recorded here in Wikipedia. Now

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,039
anyone can edit Wikipedia, but

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,759
I want to show you at

116
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,880
what level information warfare is being fought today

117
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,400
between Iran and Israel. Now if you

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,720
ask me, tell me that according to you who is

119
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
telling the truth, Israel is saying that

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
look, Iran is lying.  Iran is saying

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
that no, we have shot down two F35

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,320
fighter jets, Iran has done a feat which no country has been able to do till date.

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,880
Now again

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,680
see, Israel had carried out a very big attack

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,880
on Iran, it had used 200 fighter jets.

126
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,000
Now when you use 200 fighter jets,

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
then there is a probability by

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
basic statistics, if I talk about that an

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,960
air defence system like S300

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,400
starts firing blindly, then you know there is a

131
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,960
chance that it can hit a fighter jet, even if

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,199
it is F35,

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
and if you

134
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,840
look at many defence forums, then many Americans are

135
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
already claiming that Russia and

136
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,919
China have given intelligence inputs

137
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
to Iran so that they can identify the F35 jet and

138
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,639
shoot it down.

139
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
Now again these are all claims.

140
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
Did this happen in reality or not?  It is

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759
very difficult to say this without proof.  And let me

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,120
tell you

143
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,520
one thing that is very famous about Israel.  They

144
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
focus a lot on public morality.  I will have to say this to some extent.  There is

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,240
same type of approach in Pakistan also.  They will even tell lies to

147
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,800
maintain public moral.

148
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,919
For example, in the Kargil war we

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,000
saw that their soldiers were disowned

150
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,560
so that the public morale does not go down.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,039
Our CDS sir went to Bloomberg and

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,160
openly said that yes, these were our losses.

153
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,520
Whereas if we look from Pakistan's side, has

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,199
any of their generals, any of their Air Force

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,960
personnel, given any statement regarding the failure of the HQ9 air defense system

156
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,039
?

157
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,880
Nothing.  Everyone is silent.  Have

158
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,199
they

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,039
given any statement regarding the destruction of their air bases?  Nothing just quiet,

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
no general went before the international media and

161
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,960
said that yes, India came and caused

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,360
so much destruction to us.  It is the same case.  To a large

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,199
extent, Israel.  Public moral is

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,880
very important for them.  So, I would

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,000
not be surprised if,

166
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,080
not two, at least one F35 fighter jet

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,800
or even an F16 is shot down by Iran.

168
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,199
Israel will reject it unless there is

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,240
absolutely glaring evidence that you know

170
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,160
debris has been found or you know now you can't hide anything.

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,880
Some pilot was caught.

172
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
Until this thing comes up.  Israel will

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,120
continue to reject it completely.  They also

174
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
know it.  In information warfare, it is very important to reject the enemy's

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,199
claims on time.   The

176
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319

177
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,800
morale of the public and our military

178
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,360
should not fall.  So

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,599
maybe

180
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,560
we may not get any proper information about what actually happened here.

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,039
Because both Iran and Israel will

182
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,680
never openly accept the reality.  Especially

183
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,479
regarding the shootdown of a fighter jet.  And then

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,440
see, this point also comes in the end, so

185
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,400
let's let the media discuss this thing and

186
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,720
since recently USA has offered F35 fighter jet

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,800
to India, so we are very

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
interested here in this particular case

189
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,919
that if the S300 missile defense system itself

190
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,440
destroys the F35 fighter jet, then

191
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
it will be a very risky task for India to

192
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,919
take it tomorrow, which means the

193
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
sleeping air defense systems of Pakistan

194
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,160
can also become active, then China will easily shoot

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
it down and obviously this will have a big impact

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,919
on the future defense sales of F35.

197
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
So we are

198
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
obviously watching here with interest.

199
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,680
But from Israel's perspective they will

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
see what their objectives are.  Like

201
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,560
in Operation Sindoor we saw

202
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,560
what our objectives are.  We destroyed the terrorists wherever

203
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,880
they were in Pakistan.

204
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
Israel's

205
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,160
focus here is also to damage Iran's nuclear

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,519
facilities so much

207
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,680
that Iran is unable to enrich uranium

208
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,920
and they are unable to test the nuclear bomb.

209
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,519
That is the ultimate objective of

210
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,240
Israel.  In this F35 five falls, six

211
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,839
falls.  They don't care.  The Americans had

212
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,360
given F35 fighter jets to Israel at subsidized rates

213
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,040
in the year 2016.  It is said that there

214
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,880
is a rumour on this.  I mean I don't know

215
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
how much of this is true and how much is not.  It is said to be

216
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,720
with the Israeli Air Force.  As soon as the

217
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,399
F35 Farjet Ayana took a flight

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,480
and flew its F35 over the whole Iran

219
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
as a celebration to

220
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,279
tell the Iranians that now we will come anytime and we

221
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
will damage you.  You won't be able to do anything.

222
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
So I leave it to you to decide who is telling the truth here.

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
Please tell us in the comment section

224
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,240

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,920
whom will you believe in this particular case, Iran or Israel.

226
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
Write your thoughts in the comment section.

227
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
I would like to know your opinion.  And by the way

228
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
I would like to say one thing here,

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,880
I saw a worrying scene, there

230
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,880
is a person on social media, he posted that

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,560

232
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,839
if Elon Musk wants to corner the current government of Iran, then you could be the final nail in it.

233
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,399
Iran has banned the internet in its country

234
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,880
so that Iranian people do

235
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,720
not know the truth about what is happening.  So they are

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
saying get internet provided from Starling.

237
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,120

238
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Give free internet to people.  People will start revolting.

239
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Which is also the target of Israel.

240
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,560
They have named their operation as

241
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,480
Operation Rising Line.  The logic behind this is

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
that at one time Iran's flag used to have a

243
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
lion on it.  So literally Israel

244
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,800
's objective is to bring about a coup in Iran.

245
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
Now this can happen.  If

246
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200

247
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,240
these people get after Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the rest of the American government.   If we

248
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,959
start spending money then there might be

249
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,480
a coup in Iran within two to three months.

250
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,959
Now this is what I was

251
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,839
looking for Elon Musk quickly responded

252
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,640
that the beams are on.  I have started doing my work.

253
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,120

254
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,880
We'll start beaming Starling's internet to carry out the coup.

255
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,920
And this is a matter of concern.  If you know

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,399
this will be the use of Starling, then it is understandable

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
why China and Russia did

258
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,560
not allow Starling to enter their countries.  And many

259
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
Indians are also raising this question today

260
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,760
that if Americans use Starling in this way,

261
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,680
then tomorrow they will also start doing something like this in India

262
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
to hurt us,

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
if not then what will we do?

264
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,560
So now look,

265
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,880
a lot of news will come from both Israel and Iran.  A lot will happen.   If there are

266
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,880
updates then I will

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,760
keep bringing you updated videos.  Finally I will

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,079
ask you a question.  She is an actress from India.   The

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,240
country of Maldives has declared him as its Global

270
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,040
Tourism Ambassador.

271
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,800
Indians are going to Maldives in less numbers.  Many

272
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,200
other international tourists are also now

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,519
avoiding Maldives.  So because of this,

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
now Maldives has started approaching Bollywood stars to do

275
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519

276
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
their advertisements, take money

277
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
and you know try to bring

278
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,640
Indian tourists or even international tourists to

279
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,279
Maldives.  So tell me which Bollywood

280
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,519
actress has been appointed by Maldives

281
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,120
as Global Tourism Ambassador? Here

282
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,279
your options are Kareena Kapoor, Katrina Kaif,

283
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
Alia Bhatt or Priyanka Chopra.

284
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,800
Answer in the comment section.  Those who give the correct

285
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
answer, I will give hard marks to their comments

286
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,680
so that others can understand what the correct answer is.

287
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,160
Look, sometime go to any website

288
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,560
where companies post jobs and you will take

289
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,279
notes there.  The demand for data analysts is

290
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,680
continuously increasing.  Whether you are

291
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,480
in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata or

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
anywhere, salaries obviously range based

293
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,959
on your experience.  But you

294
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,720

295
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,959
can easily earn even Rs 50,600 per month from 2025.  Depending on your

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,560
experience, depending on your skills.  And the

297
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,240
impact of data analysts is being

298
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,720
seen in every industry.  It will obviously be seen in the corporate world.

299
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,959
Apart from that,

300
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
articles are being published in medical science and even cricket.

301
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,120
This is a four day old

302
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,440
article about how data

303
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,680
analytics has transformed cricket all together.

304
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,320
I will tell you the reason.  Let

305
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,720
me show you for the first time

306
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,839

307
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,480
how someone can present data if they have the skills of a data analyst.

308
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,279
Once you have the

309
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,320
skills of a data analyst, you can create all of these things.

310
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,519
You will be able to see in what beautiful way

311
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,680
you can see the profit of a company and

312
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,160
how much revenue a company earned in which month.

313
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,639
What is the market share?  This can be made in detail.

314
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Again it's not just like you

315
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,560
just choose this color scheme and

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,200
enter the data.  In this, the formulas, the

317
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
way you enter the data, the way

318
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,079
you present the data, everything matters.

319
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,880
And companies today are

320
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,360
ready to pay people who present the data to them in

321
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,760
such a way and in such a form

322
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,920
so that the companies can decide

323
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,480
what to do in the future.

324
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,360
Where do they want to go in the future?

325
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
With the help of Data Analysis course of Career 247,

326
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
many of our students have already become capable of creating such projects.

327
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600

328
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,320
I am showing you this project of one of our students

329
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,519
and this again is

330
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,279
just 5 to 6% of the total scale.  Apart from that, there are many other

331
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,839
tools in Data Analytics

332
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
in which if you become proficient, then suddenly

333
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,560
your value will increase a lot in the job market.

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,639
What do you simply have to do?

335
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,800
