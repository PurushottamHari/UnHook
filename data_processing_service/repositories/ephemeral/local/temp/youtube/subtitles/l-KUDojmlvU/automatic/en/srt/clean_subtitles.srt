Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. During Nawaz's time, the entire global media, be it American media, European media, everyone is discussing that what had not happened till date has finally happened, has Iran shot down the F35 fighter jet, not once, has this happened twice, you will be able to see it here because the Iranian government has officially claimed that they have shot down two Israeli fighter jets. Now this is the claim from Iran that not only have they shot down two Israeli fighter jets, they have also shot down F35 fighter jets. Some Iranian officials are also saying that they have also captured an Israeli pilot. And look, ever since Iran started claiming this, you will see that many articles have started getting published across the world.  Iran shoots down two Israeli fighter jets.  Iran 's media itself is obviously propelling this. And the funniest thing I saw here is this Chinese media, to which I will frankly say that in terms of credibility, I would give absolutely zero marks out of 10 because these people print anything.  That means it is a global network only in name.  But they have no credibility.  CGTA you might know that these people published the news that the G35 fighter jet has crashed.  Now this image is fake.  This is an AI image. This was spread on social media by some Iranian or maybe some Iran supporter.  this is not real.  Global Time also started reporting that Iranian media has claimed that they have shot down two fighter jets. Now obviously western media has started.  The Chinese media started. Iranian media is talking about it anyway. How could Indian media stay behind? Our news outlets also started reporting that Iran was claiming it had shot down two Israeli F35 Hulk jets. Now see, here Iran has adopted Pakistan's strategy of just saying anything initially.  There is no proof.  There is no evidence.  No images, no videos have surfaced yet.  Nor do we know what happened to the captured Israeli pilot.  But Iran spread all this by saying all this in the international media. Now, the responsibility lies on Israel to prove whether your fighter jets have fallen here or not and look, the world is absolutely interested in the fact that it is said that S400 will fall short to surround the F35 which is said to be the best fighter jet in the world.  The Americans have said it many times that the S400 is suitable only for the fourth generation, 4.5 generation fire jets.  The stealth mode of the F35 FJet is so good that the S400 missile defense system will not even know when the F35 has arrived.  The Americans used to claim these things.  But if what Iran is claiming here turns out to be true, that they shot down two F35s each.  That too not from S400 but from S300. Do you know how old S300 is?  It is an air defence system from the USSR era. Its first variant came out around 1970-1980. Later some of its advanced variants came and today no one even buys it. Russia is a very poor country which does not have the money to defend itself.  Russia hands him this air defence system.  Rest, everyone is buying either S400, be it Turkey, India or China, and everyone is actually waiting for when S500 will arrive? So in the meanwhile tell them that Iran has shot down an F35 fighter jet using the S300.  This puts a big stain on the value and brand value of the F35 fighter jet. Now it is obvious that all this news reached Israel.  Then these people said that look all this stuff is fake, baseless.   They are saying that Iran did not shoot down any of their F35 fighter jets and Iran did not capture any woman pilot.  So these are two versions. I told you both.  Iran's version is resonating more on social media and in international media because now see, this also happens here, many journalists who otherwise write against Israel also stand up in support of Iran. So because of this, the news spread about Iran has spread far and wide. Whereas, on the clarification that Israel is giving, if you assume that articles are being published, around 36 or 40 articles are being published on Iran news, and these supporters of Iran have even gone to Wikipedia, there is a page where it is shown how many accidents have happened with Lockheed Martin's F35 Lightning 2. In this, they have put an entry in the year 2025 that on 13 June 2025, 2 F35s were shot down by Iran during the June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran. These reports are unconfirmed for now, but they have got this thing recorded here in Wikipedia. Now anyone can edit Wikipedia, but I want to show you at what level information warfare is being fought today between Iran and Israel. Now if you ask me, tell me that according to you who is telling the truth, Israel is saying that look, Iran is lying.  Iran is saying that no, we have shot down two F35 fighter jets, Iran has done a feat which no country has been able to do till date. Now again see, Israel had carried out a very big attack on Iran, it had used 200 fighter jets. Now when you use 200 fighter jets, then there is a probability by basic statistics, if I talk about that an air defence system like S300 starts firing blindly, then you know there is a chance that it can hit a fighter jet, even if it is F35, and if you look at many defence forums, then many Americans are already claiming that Russia and China have given intelligence inputs to Iran so that they can identify the F35 jet and shoot it down. Now again these are all claims. Did this happen in reality or not?  It is very difficult to say this without proof.  And let me tell you one thing that is very famous about Israel.  They focus a lot on public morality.  I will have to say this to some extent.  There is same type of approach in Pakistan also.  They will even tell lies to maintain public moral. For example, in the Kargil war we saw that their soldiers were disowned so that the public morale does not go down. Our CDS sir went to Bloomberg and openly said that yes, these were our losses. Whereas if we look from Pakistan's side, has any of their generals, any of their Air Force personnel, given any statement regarding the failure of the HQ9 air defense system ? Nothing.  Everyone is silent.  Have they given any statement regarding the destruction of their air bases?  Nothing just quiet, no general went before the international media and said that yes, India came and caused so much destruction to us.  It is the same case.  To a large extent, Israel.  Public moral is very important for them.  So, I would not be surprised if, not two, at least one F35 fighter jet or even an F16 is shot down by Iran. Israel will reject it unless there is absolutely glaring evidence that you know debris has been found or you know now you can't hide anything. Some pilot was caught. Until this thing comes up.  Israel will continue to reject it completely.  They also know it.  In information warfare, it is very important to reject the enemy's claims on time.   The morale of the public and our military should not fall.  So maybe we may not get any proper information about what actually happened here. Because both Iran and Israel will never openly accept the reality.  Especially regarding the shootdown of a fighter jet.  And then see, this point also comes in the end, so let's let the media discuss this thing and since recently USA has offered F35 fighter jet to India, so we are very interested here in this particular case that if the S300 missile defense system itself destroys the F35 fighter jet, then it will be a very risky task for India to take it tomorrow, which means the sleeping air defense systems of Pakistan can also become active, then China will easily shoot it down and obviously this will have a big impact on the future defense sales of F35. So we are obviously watching here with interest. But from Israel's perspective they will see what their objectives are.  Like in Operation Sindoor we saw what our objectives are.  We destroyed the terrorists wherever they were in Pakistan. Israel's focus here is also to damage Iran's nuclear facilities so much that Iran is unable to enrich uranium and they are unable to test the nuclear bomb. That is the ultimate objective of Israel.  In this F35 five falls, six falls.  They don't care.  The Americans had given F35 fighter jets to Israel at subsidized rates in the year 2016.  It is said that there is a rumour on this.  I mean I don't know how much of this is true and how much is not.  It is said to be with the Israeli Air Force.  As soon as the F35 Farjet Ayana took a flight and flew its F35 over the whole Iran as a celebration to tell the Iranians that now we will come anytime and we will damage you.  You won't be able to do anything. So I leave it to you to decide who is telling the truth here. Please tell us in the comment section whom will you believe in this particular case, Iran or Israel. Write your thoughts in the comment section. I would like to know your opinion.  And by the way I would like to say one thing here, I saw a worrying scene, there is a person on social media, he posted that if Elon Musk wants to corner the current government of Iran, then you could be the final nail in it. Iran has banned the internet in its country so that Iranian people do not know the truth about what is happening.  So they are saying get internet provided from Starling. Give free internet to people.  People will start revolting. Which is also the target of Israel. They have named their operation as Operation Rising Line.  The logic behind this is that at one time Iran's flag used to have a lion on it.  So literally Israel 's objective is to bring about a coup in Iran. Now this can happen.  If these people get after Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the rest of the American government.   If we start spending money then there might be a coup in Iran within two to three months. Now this is what I was looking for Elon Musk quickly responded that the beams are on.  I have started doing my work. We'll start beaming Starling's internet to carry out the coup. And this is a matter of concern.  If you know this will be the use of Starling, then it is understandable why China and Russia did not allow Starling to enter their countries.  And many Indians are also raising this question today that if Americans use Starling in this way, then tomorrow they will also start doing something like this in India to hurt us, if not then what will we do? So now look, a lot of news will come from both Israel and Iran.  A lot will happen.   If there are updates then I will keep bringing you updated videos.  Finally I will ask you a question.  She is an actress from India.   The country of Maldives has declared him as its Global Tourism Ambassador. Indians are going to Maldives in less numbers.  Many other international tourists are also now avoiding Maldives.  So because of this, now Maldives has started approaching Bollywood stars to do their advertisements, take money and you know try to bring Indian tourists or even international tourists to Maldives.  So tell me which Bollywood actress has been appointed by Maldives as Global Tourism Ambassador? Here your options are Kareena Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt or Priyanka Chopra.
