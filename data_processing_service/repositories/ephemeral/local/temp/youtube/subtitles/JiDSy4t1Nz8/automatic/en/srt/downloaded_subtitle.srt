1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
I have so many questions about karma

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,319
today. So what is karma? Karma is

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,840
something that is man-made which we

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,240
carry for many lives. I assume that when

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,719
you take up deeper practices, karmmas

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
get neutralized quicker. You cannot say

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,119
neutralized while trying to complete

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,760
those kmas. We are creating more kmas.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
So would you say that the core skill to

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,679
be upgraded here is to control your

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,439
desires on a very deep level?

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,280
So many people around me trying to

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
accumulate wealth thinking that when I

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
have all that wealth it's going to be

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,440
the perfect wealth and then you become

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
that wealthy and maybe you lose all your

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
health. Sometimes property money they

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
come to you as bad karmmas. Really?

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,160
Yeah. I met a diamond merchant which had

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,559
gone through earthquakes overnight. All

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,520
his property invested in diamonds and

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,500
the shop and just when he woke up he was

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,930
a beggar on the street.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,930
[Music]

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
I know that the spiritual episodes of

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,280
TRS have their own audience. So the

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
intention from here on is to bring you

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
specific topics related to the realms of

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,080
spirituality with our subject experts.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,799
Guru Sakalama returns on TRS. It was one

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,360
of the most loved episodes from last

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
year. I hope that through the course of

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
this particular episode you gain a

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,079
deeper understanding

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,240
about karma about your own life and

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,200
about the practical

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,799
way to live a spiritual life. This is

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,799
Guru Sakalama on TRS.

[Music]

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,200
Ma, welcome back to TRS.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,680
So nice to be sitting with you. Yeah, I

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,399
am also feeling quite excited to come

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,840
back again. Yeah, congratulations on the

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,680
upcoming book. It's ready almost. Yeah.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,879
Um there's a lot of energy in your

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
books. There's a lot of power in your

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,640
books. That's what I'll say because I do

48
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,360
feel that uh there are higher

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,280
masters writing them through you. Uh

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,920
correct me if I'm wrong. 100%.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,760
It's true. Even in the podcast, there is

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,800
something there's a higher force that

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,360
speaks through uh some people sitting on

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,400
that seat. How are you? I'm good. Going

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,360
on? Yeah. Uh I have so many questions

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,360
about karma today. Wow. That I was

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,959
thinking about what to speak to you for

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,800
the last week. Um yeah, I have so many

59
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
questions about the hastening of karma

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,519
once you begin sad because effectively

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,560
you're pulling the divine to yourself.

62
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,640
Therefore, uh I don't think uh you gain

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,680
good karma by praying. I think you

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,959
neutralize your own karma. If if you

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
think I'm saying something wrong, please

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
correct me. But uh I would love to know

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,040
one how do you explain karma to a

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,959
beginner and two to an advanced

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,760
knowledge seeker. It's two very sharp

70
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,720
but important questions. This is one of

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,840
my favorite topics and I have explored

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:36,319
this at my personal life level for the

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:39,200
last 354 years. So karma theory as such

74
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,040
plays a very vital role in our spiritual

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,200
path.

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,239
If we don't pay attention to it or if we

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,599
don't have interest

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,959
to explore that realm of existence that

79
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:59,159
it's inside of you. Our spiritual path

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,159
is always a digression.

81
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,360
So what is karma? I take the name of uh

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,000
Swami Rama. He has written a beautiful

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,720
book on karma. It includes everything

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,760
that is possible to think about on

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,359
karma. It's called freedom from the

86
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,400
bondage of karma. Karma is something

87
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,400
that is man-made and we are not

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,840
spiritual

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,600
and we are more towards the worldly life

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,720
then we are clueless about what this

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,560
karma is all about and what kind of a

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,560
role it plays in our life past present

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,800
and future also karma is something which

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,280
we carry from many lives past lives

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,120
and in all our past lives we We have

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,280
written so many things and in every new

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,759
life

98
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,400
we carry more desires,

99
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:04,080
more kmas and we write it, overwrite it

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,680
and we overrite it and we overwrite it.

101
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,479
So with the multiplicity of rebirth all

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,280
our desires which are written down and

103
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,039
all the kmas that we have performed

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,880
they all get jumbled up

105
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,639
and we are clueless how this life is led

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
by us.

107
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,919
This is the state of karma of every

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,800
human individual

109
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,800
in the sense what is this present life?

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,919
Spirituality says your present life is

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,520
nothing but your past

112
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,720
desiresdriven

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,199
life. So what we experience as karma in

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
this life could be an outcome of what

115
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,320
you've done three or four lives ago as

116
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,199
well. So many lives, all the lives, not

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,840
necessarily immediate previous life. And

118
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
you're just living out all those desires

119
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,360
as well as for lack of better words

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,639
results or punishments even in some

121
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,639
cases punishment is a harsh word. kmas

122
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,120
you're living out those kmas like in

123
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,880
this life uh I assume that when you take

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,720
up deeper practices and uh you're

125
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,400
allowing mantra energy to build up

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,600
inside you all these desires as well as

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,160
karmmas get neutralized quicker not

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:31,199
necessarily you cannot say neutralized

129
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:36,080
see what is the nature of the karma if

130
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,960
you look at it karma is created by our

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,039
own making. So there is no other way

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,120
that it can be removed or neutralized.

133
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,960
We have to take charge of our life and

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,840
complete those kmas in this life. If

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,919
it's not enough come back again again

136
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,120
and again and complete. But the thing is

137
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,880
while trying to complete those kmas you

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
have to notice that we are creating more

139
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,919
kmas.

140
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,520
What is karma? Karma means performing

141
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,199
actions

142
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,039
and in brackets both both good and bad.

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,520
For a normal individual's life, it's a

144
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,800
mixture of both because we are not

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,000
perfect dietes or gods and goddesses

146
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,080
that we don't make any mistakes. out of

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
ignorance, sometimes out of desires,

148
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
temptations

149
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,720
and in the name of fulfilling certain

150
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,440
desires. We don't even know what kmas we

151
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,720
are creating which are sometimes good,

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,039
sometimes bad for us and they're all

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,759
like a fixer deposits.

154
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,639
You perform a bad action today and it's

155
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,639
going to be the result tomorrow

156
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,599
because when you perform a action not

157
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,400
just you are involved in that there are

158
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,879
so many other factors environment

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,280
your relationships with hundreds and

160
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
thousands of people this is a web of

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,160
karma it is called it's not very easy to

162
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,639
understand its connections only a guru

163
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
knows what it is so if you're engaging

164
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,440
with the real world even if you're

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,199
trying to do good, you're still

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,960
accumulating further karmmas. Yeah.

167
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
Because

168
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,120
when you say good,

169
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,680
it means it's a good karma.

170
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,520
The secret of life is connected to these

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,719
kmas. What is that secret?

172
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,159
We come back to life only to reap and

173
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,959
enjoy the fruits of the past kmas which

174
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,959
are both good and bad.

175
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,839
If you look at mantra,

176
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm not going to explain that.

177
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,680
You are requesting the deity

178
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,320
to burn off. Ba means

179
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,600
all the karma should be put in a frying

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,959
pan and then fried in such a way that

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,519
the seeds of karma will not sprout. Wow.

182
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,600
That is the meaning of the mantra.

183
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
I hardly find anyone explaining this

184
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
part.

185
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
They give lot of you know esoteric

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,959
meaninghooa

187
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,160
and all those things. They're all true.

188
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,120
But what is important for you as a

189
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,320
practitioner as a saddaka is to focus on

190
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,640
this word. What is bha? Just now you

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,519
said that while performing actions also

192
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,480
we are creating more kmas. This is a

193
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,760
very relevant question. That means it

194
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,360
shows that you have contemplated a lot

195
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,120
on the nature of the karma whether it is

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,760
good or bad. Karma is karma that you

197
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,720
have to come back and experience. But

198
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,279
for the human mind, bad karmmas are

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,000
miserable to experience. Good karmmas

200
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,720
are very pleasant to experience. But

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,880
from the point of view of the universe,

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,160
which is an eyewitness

203
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,399
to all that is going on. For them, it is

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
one and the same. Whether it is a good

205
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,760
karma or bad karma, whether you are

206
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,560
miserable or you know pleasant about it,

207
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:34,320
it is just in quotes a process.

208
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,000
So spirituality says in fact Swami Rama

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
said such beautiful words on these

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,360
things. He defines karma. Karma is a

211
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,240
rope which binds you. And how that rope

212
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,880
is made up of three strands. Three

213
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,079
strands you take and then make a design

214
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,720
out of it to make it a beautiful rope

215
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
and that rope is binding you as a

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
individual ja.

217
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,560
Why? What are those three threads? One

218
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,800
is your thought process.

219
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,959
Behind that is your karmas samscaraas.

220
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
Karmaas mean there are desires in

221
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,200
different forms influencing your

222
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,640
thoughts and emotions. And these

223
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,920
thoughts and emotions supported by karma

224
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,160
samscara wasas of the desires trigger

225
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,880
off your actions.

226
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,279
So action only is visible. So when you

227
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,079
perform an action and some disaster

228
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,000
happens for example then we say oh my

229
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,920
god why did I do this or why did it

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,839
happen? First of all I am clueless. I am

231
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,720
not the type to do this. Why did it

232
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,640
happen? I'm not able to find an answer

233
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,560
for this.

234
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
And the soul goes through such terrible

235
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,240
suffering

236
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,120
because there's no rationale behind

237
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,640
certain actions that we perform. Your

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
logical mind cannot give any

239
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,000
explanation. But what the world wants

240
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,880
you is your logical explanation and it

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,440
goes by evidences. Right? But that is

242
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,680
not your true self.

243
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
That's not what you are.

244
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,839
So we are at a loss to understand the

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,519
connection between the action that I

246
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,160
have performed and the result that it is

247
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,959
giving

248
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,399
and you said punishment. Yeah. Reward

249
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,120
and punishment are the two faces of this

250
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,720
all these actions. So these three

251
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,800
strands are binding us not just one and

252
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
binding us so tight that we are not able

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
to shake it off.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
So we talk big big words about freedom

255
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,720
in life. The question is when you

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,120
understand karma, the secret, the

257
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,320
mystery behind karma, you know that you

258
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,240
are a bound soul. And this bound soul in

259
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Shvida is called pashu.

260
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,639
And one who takes care of this pashu

261
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,360
towards evolution or expansion is called

262
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,800
pashupati,

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:08,320
the lord of the pashu. So we are humans

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,720
but we are pushu deep within.

265
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
What is the meaning of pushu? Animal

266
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
means we are filled with instincts,

267
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,360
impulses,

268
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
rational is very less. Wisdom is very

269
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
less

270
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,240
and the way we perform actions in our

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,399
life is also like blindfold.

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
The average person only associates kmas

273
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,920
with actions. But there's a deeper layer

274
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
of thoughts and emotions which is then

275
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,480
also influenced by a deeper layer of

276
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,839
desires on a soul level. So you don't

277
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
even actually know what your desires

278
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,920
are. But on some level which I think

279
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,600
people call the subconscious mind. It

280
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,800
may be affecting all your emotions and

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
thoughts and then your thoughts and

282
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,320
emotions take over your actions. That's

283
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,680
what can lead to both good and bad

284
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,920
actions. So would you say that the core

285
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,760
skill to be upgraded here is to somewhat

286
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,399
control your desires on a very deep

287
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,920
level? I'm not very happy with the word

288
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,639
control.

289
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,360
I told you human beings are bound. We

290
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,040
don't have any freedom at all. When you

291
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
look at the mystery of the karma, then

292
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,320
where is the question of controlling?

293
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,399
It is to understand,

294
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,720
understand and go through those phases.

295
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,839
Even the greatest of the greatest souls

296
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,480
have gone through terrible kmas.

297
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,440
If it's a very bad karma, very painful

298
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:35,199
karma is a great karma, wonderful karma

299
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,279
from the spiritual evolution of the

300
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:43,199
soul. So I congratulate.

301
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,920
Thank you. Thank you. And if there is a

302
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,959
damage to your personality, it means

303
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,760
that you're clearing some karma. So you

304
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:57,120
should be happy about it. Yeah. Um, you

305
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,480
know, all in all in retrospect,

306
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,600
um, I feel more still after everything

307
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,240
that's happened, which is a nicer

308
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,639
feeling, and I feel free.

309
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,440
Somewhat some kind of a burden had

310
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,760
accumulated over the years. Now when you

311
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,530
see that burden drop, shoulders feel a

312
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,120
little relaxed.

313
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,079
[Music]

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Life goes on like this and there will

315
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
come a stage where

316
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,320
you are neutral to whether you are

317
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,360
passing through good phase or bad phase

318
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,560
and that is the phase of in astrology

319
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,120
shi period

320
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,959
like a shani mahadasha shani mahadasha

321
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,240
antja mahadasha sad sati

322
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:45,199
anything you call well the planets are

323
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,160
outside and their expressions are inside

324
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,720
of you. So if you look at the movement

325
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,720
of the planetary positions in anybody's

326
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
life which is called kundali or

327
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
horoscope,

328
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
it's all about the phases of kmas that

329
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,040
it speaks about.

330
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,120
So the Saturn element in someone's chart

331
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,839
eventually teaches them to be neutral

332
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,320
about life because

333
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,519
Saturn would bring reward and punishment

334
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,600
in such frequently in that seven seven

335
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,920
and a half years whatever that period

336
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,839
everybody goes through

337
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,040
that initially you feel suffocated. You

338
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,759
want to resist these things I don't want

339
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,360
unhappiness. I want to I always want

340
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,759
happiness. That's what everybody's

341
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,920
definition of life is. Then he starts

342
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
teaching you no you have to taste this

343
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,240
also if you want the other one because

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,120
they are the two faces of the same coin

345
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,079
sorrow and joy. Then once you start

346
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,519
tasting it and then

347
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,079
it's it's fair to say that this happens

348
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,920
in everyone's life. Right? It happens in

349
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,600
everybody's life. Right? If you if

350
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,199
you're in a human body you have to go

351
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,720
through

352
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,279
greatest of the greatest mahatmas.

353
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,959
Nobody is spared only when you have the

354
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,280
guru proper guidance. Then

355
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,640
I have a friend of mine uh she's from an

356
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,559
a very affluent family and uh she like

357
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,559
I've because of the show I've learned a

358
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,559
tiny amount of astrology. So I was

359
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,240
trying to just see her chart and and

360
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,760
we're good friends so she was okay with

361
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,679
it and there was clearly some tiny tiny

362
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,559
problem something in marriage something

363
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,839
you know in like health

364
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,240
uh and when I told her all the good

365
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,960
stuff it didn't matter to her at all but

366
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
she sat on the bad stuff and anyone

367
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
looking at her life from the outside

368
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
would think she has a perfect life but

369
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,559
in her eyes she's got a not so perfect

370
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,880
life and so many people around me you

371
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
know spend so much of the time energy

372
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
effort trying to accumulate wealth

373
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
thinking that when I have all that

374
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,880
wealth it's going to be the perfect life

375
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
and then you become that wealthy maybe

376
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
you lose all your health

377
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,520
and then you realize that this is the

378
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,480
story of every individual yeah um then

379
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,559
tell me what is perfection

380
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,960
can you define what is perfection of

381
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,440
life I'm I'm saying it based on what I

382
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,880
have learned in this last year I I think

383
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,039
perfection is to just stay still as life

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,840
happens around you.

385
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,200
Is it so easy to stay still

386
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,240
especially to a Gemini like you?

387
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,360
Yeah, I mean I'll tell you if I if I

388
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,440
don't spend my mornings in prayer um or

389
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,679
if I don't begin my day somewhat with a

390
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
prayer element then I lose my stillness.

391
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,640
But as long as it begins with prayer I

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,400
find that I'm softer towards the world

393
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,720
and myself.

394
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,919
That's a good beginning.

395
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
Then your whole day should be a prayer.

396
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
There there is nothing a slot like where

397
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,880
you sit for prayer and then you are fine

398
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,960
about it. Then it gets extended and then

399
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,919
you don't see a slot where you have to

400
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,480
sit for prayers.

401
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,919
Then your whole personality your actions

402
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,600
being performed you stay in that state.

403
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,760
That is the evolution everybody goes

404
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,679
through. But unless we are focused about

405
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,240
it, you know the danger of this mind is

406
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,039
it gets accustomed to doing prayer as a

407
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,799
checklist.

408
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,120
Prayer

409
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,919
I'm fine for the day.

410
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,640
But that's not the truth.

411
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,400
It is just following the discipline.

412
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
Anything that everything that you do

413
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
around you,

414
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,280
you have to check again and again. Are

415
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,840
you able to carry that prayerful mood,

416
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,640
prayerful mind?

417
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,000
Then the real sadena begins when it

418
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,240
becomes a part of your breath.

419
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,880
For that what level of awareness one

420
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,520
should develop. But how do you develop

421
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,840
that? Just consciously pulling yourself

422
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,640
back that is also there. That's also

423
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:01,520
there. But against doing sadena more

424
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,080
just increasing your sadha and depends

425
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,400
on what sadena we do. Hundreds and

426
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,120
thousands of sadas are available

427
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,880
especially on YouTube to can confuse the

428
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
human mind and especially the younger

429
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,600
minds

430
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:20,960
right each sadena every sadena

431
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,440
maybe may not be good for me for a

432
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,039
particular individual. That is the

433
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,880
reason why guru has to choose which

434
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,360
sadena should be given. Otherwise

435
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,760
sometimes when we do the sadhana just on

436
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
our own.

437
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,440
We are clueless where we are heading

438
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,640
towards

439
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,360
and when certain experiences happen

440
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,240
spiritual or otherwise then we are

441
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,960
clueless about

442
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,400
our own sadena.

443
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:59,039
And then there is fear, apprehensions,

444
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,640
worries, so on so forth. Choosing a

445
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,440
sadhana is also very important in life.

446
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Would you say it's gut feel driven?

447
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,039
Yeah, that's how everybody moves because

448
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,919
all my initiates who come to me and take

449
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,120
the mantra and then we make a WhatsApp

450
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,679
group because I don't want to be

451
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,720
disconnected after giving the mantra.

452
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,320
But normal fashion around is they take

453
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
the mantra and the guru also gives the

454
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
mantra and they don't know what is

455
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
happening to the disciple because there

456
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,840
is no connection. They come back with so

457
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,760
many experiences which they are not able

458
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,080
to decode

459
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,960
and most of the time they drop the

460
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,559
sadhana cuz out of fear not able to

461
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,919
understand why this is happening in my

462
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,000
life as in outcomes of the outcomes

463
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,320
because every mantra is an energy that

464
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,039
you are going to recreate in your body

465
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,919
and it's going to stay lodged in your

466
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,320
body right I really wonder how people

467
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,799
just take the mantra on YouTube and and

468
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,880
then they practice and then they don't

469
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,080
know what they are doing, how they are

470
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,880
going about it's high risk. I think we

471
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,640
definitely began this whole phase of

472
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,960
spiritual podcast and now it's a

473
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,600
movement now it's on YouTube throughout

474
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120
but I I'll tell you like um now I have

475
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,039
the luxury of meeting all of you souls

476
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,400
you know and every time there's a

477
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
spiritual soul that walks into my

478
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,919
podcast I look at it as a blessing it's

479
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,720
a a lot of light towards me uh but I

480
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,200
know my own practice and I've I've I've

481
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,919
jumped across my practices in my 20ies

482
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
not too much but a little bit And only

483
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,679
over the last three years I feel my

484
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,760
practice has like stabilized fully and I

485
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,559
feel very nice like I feel like my

486
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:47,120
personality matches my practice exactly.

487
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:49,679
Um now I represent someone who has

488
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,080
happened to find that right gut feel

489
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,720
pract gut feelor oriented practice but

490
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
there's a lot of people who are not able

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
to stick to one thing the window

492
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,039
shopping still going on basically I'm

493
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,799
trying to say that does the podcast

494
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,120
industry enhance the spiritual window

495
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,120
shopping opportunities there are there

496
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,840
freedom is there to choose they keep

497
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,200
doing that but one thing we should not

498
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,240
forget whatever little bit we do towards

499
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
spirituality is a big step taken and the

500
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,720
universe is watching you. As in you're

501
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
saying the uh practitioner if you do

502
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,720
anything it's still a good thing. Don't

503
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,919
think so much. Yeah. See there are

504
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,159
unforeseen impact of certain mantras on

505
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,039
them. Even the greatest of the mantra

506
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,440
can also affect in a different way. Not

507
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,360
because there is a fault in the mantra

508
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,039
but because the confluence of sar karma

509
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,039
samscaravakas

510
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,520
and the phase of karma that person is

511
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,240
but at that point of time he's going

512
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,760
through and then it collides with the

513
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,120
mantra he or she is not able to take it

514
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,320
mantra is perfect mantra is fine this is

515
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,120
what I wanted people to understand that

516
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,840
mantra is mantra because it's it's not

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,600
the human mind that has made the mantra

518
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,200
But it has come from the universe.

519
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,880
So how can it be otherwise? For some

520
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,520
people it's good, for some people it's

521
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,400
bad. But it's coming into a combination

522
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,320
with that individual soul with karma

523
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,480
that is carrying on his back.

524
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,480
He or she has to go through certain

525
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,320
things. But the point is here comes the

526
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,120
strength of the tradition, the strength

527
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,159
strength of the guru who can guide them

528
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,080
and make them go through it because all

529
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
the karmmas cannot be neutralized.

530
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,360
That's an answer for your question. All

531
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,320
the kmas cannot be controlled. Some of

532
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,279
them have to be suffered or some of the

533
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,159
good ones have to be enjoyed.

534
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,640
Have to be enjoyed.

535
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,880
Sometimes property, money, big money,

536
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,320
they are all good things. No, they come

537
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:05,120
to you as bad karmmas. Really? Yeah.

538
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,080
I met a person long ago about 20 30

539
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,159
years ago in Karnataka.

540
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,200
What dress he was wearing was one set of

541
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,960
dress that's all he had and no penny in

542
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
his pocket.

543
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,810
But he was a karodati. He gave a big

544
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,279
list of his properties

545
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:25,120
[Music]

546
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,600
Malik. Now because of the legal issues

547
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,520
in his life at that phase of life, he

548
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,360
cannot claim even one single property

549
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,679
even to eat. He has no food. He has to

550
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,840
beg in the street. That's how I met him

551
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,679
near a restaurant.

552
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,919
Doesn't mean that if you have money you

553
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,559
are you have a very happy life. Not

554
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,159
necessarily. Anything everything can be

555
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:52,240
can happen. And I also met a a diamond

556
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:56,000
merchant from Gwal area somewhere which

557
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,960
had gone through a a very bad phase of

558
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,279
uh you know earthquakes

559
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,640
overnight.

560
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,120
All his property invested in diamonds

561
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,039
and the shop

562
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,919
because of the earthquakes. Earthquake

563
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:18,039
gone. M and just when he woke up

564
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,039
he was a beggar on the street.

565
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,240
And this kind of fate

566
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,640
and karma

567
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,960
is expressed in a beautiful way in

568
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,240
astrology as Rahu Ketu and Shani when

569
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,720
they are very strong in your uh you know

570
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,080
horoscopes with so many I mean clauses

571
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm saying it's just a general

572
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,480
observation I'm not an astrologer

573
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,279
but when you compare your personal life

574
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,279
to that those phases you can very

575
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,760
clearly see the indication

576
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:56,159
and they teach you a lot of wisdom how

577
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
to handle your karmas that phase of

578
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,080
life.

579
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,440
So these two examples that I gave are a

580
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,640
beautiful explanation of what

581
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,840
the phase of Rahu in your life can do if

582
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,240
if he's afflicted. Why did he come Rahu

583
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,679
at that phase of your life? Because

584
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,240
certain KMAS are going to sprout now

585
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,120
that needs to be handled, answered,

586
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,960
suffered or enjoyed. So he comes there

587
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,039
to show how it is done. So karma is

588
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,200
something

589
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,440
that needs to be understood properly.

590
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,039
Otherwise what happens? People get into

591
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,799
depression.

592
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,360
People start thinking nothing is in our

593
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,080
hands. Everything is predestined

594
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,360
my whole life till this year.

595
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,039
Um I've been a sports fan and what I've

596
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
learned from sports is if you have

597
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,400
positive energy as a person, if you're

598
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,679
kind, if you love your teammates and

599
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,520
obviously if you work hard and stay

600
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,880
disciplined, everything else takes care

601
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,440
of itself.

602
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,360
And then at age 32, life rettaught me

603
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,919
that

604
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,799
uh I think working hard and being

605
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,880
disciplined plus kindness and trying to

606
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,279
do what's right like integrity. It is a

607
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,279
deposit for your future life or maybe

608
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,919
next life. Yeah. I I think that's how

609
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,960
human life should be and that that these

610
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
are the two things that should govern

611
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
your choices. Yeah. They are all eternal

612
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,440
values. You see, but it doesn't mean

613
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,760
it'll protect you from what is anyway

614
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,760
meant to happen. Because I remember when

615
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,799
all this chaos was happening in my life,

616
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,919
the personal life lesson was that even

617
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,480
beyond discipline and integrity, uh you

618
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,320
need to be able to chase the ability to

619
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,679
be still

620
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,679
coming. I think that is so key. My god,

621
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,000
be be still can be kind of a misgiving

622
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,240
to the listener.

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,720
Because when so much of it is happening

624
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
the mind cannot be still

625
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,520
it is receiving so many inputs from

626
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,760
outside and know it's making cooking up

627
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,320
its own analysis and then you know

628
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,640
conclusions about each response you are

629
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,120
receiving from the external world and

630
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,440
every time it's graph is moving up and

631
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,360
down in the mind.

632
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,559
I know being still what you mean is

633
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,960
not to respond to it one little deeper

634
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,720
layer um you know when I meet people

635
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
like you I actually feel like it's the

636
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,159
divine talking to me through people like

637
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,200
you like you're just channelizing the

638
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,559
divine now similarly when your own body

639
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,399
and mind go through situations like that

640
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,399
I still look at it as the divine talking

641
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,640
to you

642
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,760
there's something happening what can you

643
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,840
do other than sit and observe

644
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,039
So everything is maya leela at the end

645
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,360
of the day. But when that phase the mind

646
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,919
starts ask telling then what is the

647
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,840
purpose of this life then how do I

648
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,600
perform actions

649
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,840
so that any karma doesn't bind me

650
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,039
spirituality says most people don't pay

651
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,440
attention to this part of the solution

652
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,840
they don't even talk about it every

653
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
action

654
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,840
let it be performed

655
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,960
in the realm of surrender

656
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,679
Let every action be performed as an

657
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,399
offering to the divine. This is the key

658
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,320
line in this whole broadcast.

659
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:29,440
That is it's not me. Yeah, it's not me.

660
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,960
So when something bad also happens,

661
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,600
defame phase, you are not there,

662
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,360
then how can it affect you? It's not

663
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:44,600
easy to stay in that phase or that state

664
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,600
of mind. But there is a way. So

665
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,440
this is where it is. Yeah.

666
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,320
This is what got me through.

667
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,360
We perform our actions because we have

668
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,840
to. So our actions are performed

669
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,919
according to the desire deep within

670
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,039
subtle and it is pushing you to do it

671
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,679
right. Well, when you are forced to do

672
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,000
perform certain actions, might as well

673
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,279
do it

674
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,039
with the state that I am not the doer.

675
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,360
I think we've already covered 95%.

676
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,399
The 5% that's remaining in our

677
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,279
conversation is probably the most

678
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,600
important aspect of uh going through a

679
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,799
bad phase, which is that when you're at

680
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,840
rock bottom, how do you handle yourself?

681
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,480
Um I'm I'm going to begin by just giving

682
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,399
some practical input of things that help

683
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,200
me. First of all, the three four people

684
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,279
around you matter a lot. I think they

685
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,679
need to be very positive and ideally

686
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,679
spiritual to guide you through it.

687
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,519
Second, there has to be some kind of

688
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,360
element of prayer or surrender to the

689
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,760
divine. Uh now third, I'll hand it over

690
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,519
to you again. Coming back to the first

691
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,279
uh one then the second one you mentioned

692
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,360
your closest people have to be very

693
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919
positive.

694
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,880
My question is they are your closest

695
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,039
people because of the

696
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,240
past life connections that you made with

697
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,559
these relationships these jas only these

698
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,799
souls they have come back to you and

699
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,200
joined you in a different phase of life.

700
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:31,200
So your bad face of karma

701
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,159
has to fight with in a good way or in a

702
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,360
bad way

703
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,080
connected to those people also but it

704
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,840
need not be always positive. Most

705
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,200
probably it will not be positive. That's

706
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,279
why it's called bad phase that you have

707
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,120
to fight it alone.

708
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:53,120
Any tools to fight it alone? The easiest

709
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,320
but again the toughest is surrender.

710
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,919
flow with it. It's like a big wave is

711
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,480
coming.

712
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,159
If you try to jump over the wave, it's

713
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,880
not possible. What you do? Spend. Let

714
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:12,640
the storm pass by. So some great soul

715
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,240
has said his whole life is a training, a

716
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,320
learning

717
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,039
how to die.

718
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,480
It's not about how to live.

719
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,440
That's beautiful.

720
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,360
That means how to die. How do you learn

721
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,320
that? Yoga says yoga.

722
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,799
Yoga is skillful action in life. Of

723
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,120
life. Yoga is skillful action of life.

724
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:40,240
Wow. And in life both. Why? A yogi knows

725
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,240
the map of karma. It never comes to him

726
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,240
by surprise. It doesn't give him

727
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,240
surprises.

728
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Wow. And there are karmmas. Karmmas are

729
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,039
three in category. One which have

730
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,120
already happened. One are happening in

731
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,000
this phase and which is going to happen

732
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,159
in the future. Sanchita

733
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,559
and agami

734
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,000
both bother you.

735
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,639
But a yogi is aware of all the three. So

736
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,320
what he does is the only solution for

737
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:20,079
this is to handle these kmas is

738
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,639
means you perform your actions in such a

739
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,359
an efficient way

740
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,040
skillful way that it doesn't affect you.

741
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:33,040
It doesn't touch you means whole life is

742
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,839
a learning to perform action which is

743
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,480
not going to touch me. So when it

744
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,079
doesn't touch, you're free. When it

745
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,399
doesn't touch, there is no reason why

746
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,520
you have to come back.

747
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,159
Come back to life again, which is the

748
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,919
goal. That's the actual goal. Actual

749
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,079
goal, the real purpose of your life.

750
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah. There's a beautiful word I learned

751
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,639
through the show. It's called

752
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,200
providence. It means uh the helpful

753
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,839
nature of God throughout life, you know,

754
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,040
and it's a word often used in Bible.

755
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,440
Yeah. Yeah. Um I think it's also called

756
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,240
favor. Same thing. Same when you say

757
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:15,359
okay uh God brings me favor. Uh

758
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,400
you know um

759
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,040
I remember in the last 10 years things

760
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,200
were always going upward but of course I

761
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,720
wanted it to go upward faster and that's

762
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,880
where I would look for providence to

763
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,680
help me like come on God help me out you

764
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,760
know and he would still come and help.

765
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,720
Uh but the real skill of providence is

766
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,640
to find it in difficult phases. You

767
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,880
shouldn't forget that providence is

768
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,800
there for you even in the worst phase.

769
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,320
Uh see I will tell you this good phases

770
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,440
and bad phases. Again it is connected to

771
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,040
the karma. Yeah. It's like you perform a

772
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,280
good action. It's like a deposit. So you

773
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,599
have a deposit of money say about 10,000

774
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,839
rupees. I always give this example. and

775
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,560
you you feel that it should be deposited

776
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,119
not spend

777
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,400
so you go and deposit in the bank and in

778
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,240
those days FD means uh they would give a

779
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,240
certificate you can keep that

780
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,920
certificate with you most of the time

781
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,560
what happens is we keep the certificate

782
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,560
and we don't know where it has gone 10

783
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,560
years

784
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
you don't even know where you have kept

785
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,960
that certificate so all our actions are

786
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,920
like that that we perform and we forget

787
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,680
about it but the banker does not forget

788
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,599
it when it is matures 10 years he will

789
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,440
call you madam your FD is matured you

790
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,920
have to come and take it we cannot say

791
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,839
that I am not interested in that matured

792
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,839
FD either good or bad then he then I am

793
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,520
not able to come I cannot come and take

794
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
it then he'll say no no you cannot do

795
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,960
that you have to come and take it

796
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,560
because in bank we don't have any place

797
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,560
to handle it right that's how it is when

798
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,520
You deposit good actions and when it

799
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,800
matures whatever you touch becomes gold

800
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,560
that you call good face

801
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,320
that is actually the definition the

802
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,960
unseen invisible power of that anything

803
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,680
you touch then you start feeling I have

804
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,599
not put much efforts even if I put

805
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,680
efforts also

806
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,480
there is the desired result doesn't come

807
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,320
right many times that means you are

808
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,720
going through a bad phase of your life

809
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,160
because your bad actions has started

810
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,000
giving fruits of life. But there are

811
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,839
certain phases

812
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,880
where you find that if for the amount of

813
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:41,200
um efforts you have put the results are

814
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,680
much more magnanimous. You can see that.

815
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,680
You can see that.

816
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,320
That's why it's called in samska

817
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,960
adrashta, fortune, luck, a dashta,

818
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,200
dashta that is visible. Adrusta that is

819
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,520
invisible.

820
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,920
So certain actions we are not able to

821
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,079
understand why and how of it because it

822
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,160
is adrusha unseen.

823
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,480
Unseen means it's directly connected to

824
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,359
our past actions of this life. Maybe

825
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,040
past lives. Some give immediate fruits,

826
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,960
actions performed and immediately you

827
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
get the result. But there are certain

828
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,079
karmmas

829
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,400
which take a very long time to get

830
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,960
nourished and strengthen and then sprout

831
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,119
and then start giving the cause effect

832
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,720
of that cause

833
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,880
which is why live life with skill.

834
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm going to end this particular episode

835
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,480
with uh a quote by Bruce Lee. Uh and

836
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,359
it's not a quote that fully fits this

837
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,640
episode, but it will protect you from

838
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,200
the tough phases. Uh because this is the

839
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,440
quote that protected me. Bruce Lee said

840
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,440
that when you're praying to God, ask not

841
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,880
for an easy life but for the strength to

842
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,640
endure a difficult one. Uh I think the

843
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,920
nature of life is not easy and no one

844
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,599
tells you that in school or college.

845
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Everyone just preps you for a family

846
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,119
life and for career success. No one

847
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
tells you that life is going to be

848
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,920
difficult. You're going to lose your

849
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,240
parents, loved ones. You're going to be

850
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,480
alone. People don't know. One aspect of

851
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,240
what I know about you, ma, which I've

852
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,800
not touched upon at all in this whole

853
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,440
conversation, is about your books.

854
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,720
You've seen a very different life.

855
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,480
You've seen a lot of divine experiences

856
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,640
unfold in front of you. If anyone's read

857
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
any of your books, they'd be blown away

858
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
by some of the things you've written

859
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,960
about. My understanding is that you're

860
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,680
documenting your life and experiences

861
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,680
for future generations as well. Exactly.

862
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,599
That's what's happening. Frankly

863
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,160
speaking, I didn't even know that I one

864
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,760
day, you know, would come where I would

865
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,200
be asked to document these things.

866
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,160
I was taken through so many such what

867
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,040
you call supernatural experiences

868
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,000
and uh I really didn't bother to

869
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,560
document them at that point of time when

870
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
it happened I didn't have any support or

871
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,040
memory of all those things then when the

872
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,200
day came when my guru both the guru said

873
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,280
that you are going to document you are

874
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,440
going to write

875
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,520
then I was at a loss I don't have any

876
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,440
material when it happened how it

877
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,839
happened and all those

878
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,920
But when I really made a salpa

879
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,960
resolution that I am going to do it

880
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,240
because my gurus want me to do it the

881
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,359
whole channel opened up and I was left

882
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,280
with the awe that am I capable of doing

883
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,160
all these things.

884
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,119
So I thought I would just write one book

885
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,920
but it did not end. Last year Gurup

886
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:41,200
purim day we released the first book

887
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,320
messages from the Himalayan sages

888
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,400
timely and timeless that name was also

889
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,400
given by the sages.

890
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,119
So with all these experiences I

891
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,920
understood one truth that it's not I who

892
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,079
is going to write the book but they are

893
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,400
going to handle and lead me to write

894
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,560
these books. So it has to be an offering

895
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,880
to them back to them. Then again so many

896
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,359
pro I mean experiences and newer

897
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,240
experiences many have added very recent

898
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:14,800
ones it all started gathering in

899
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,599
increased in number 100 300 400 thousand

900
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,119
and all that. So I said okay then I

901
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,440
think they want me to write the second

902
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,839
book. This is I was inspired to write

903
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,280
this message just from the Himalayan

904
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,960
sage. I wanted to keep the same uh title

905
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,520
with just the addition as instead of

906
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,000
timely and timeless visible and

907
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,520
invisible because how can you serve the

908
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
guru

909
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,359
only by sharing the knowledge that guru

910
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,800
has invested in me sharing the knowledge

911
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,440
with others guru will be happy. So we

912
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,680
are going to offer a kind of a practice

913
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,960
for 9 days and people from all walks of

914
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,200
life I want them to join in a big way

915
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,800
