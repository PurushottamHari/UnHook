Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, recently you must have seen that there is a lot of discussion about Vijay Mallya.  There was a podcast done by him and it was a pretty big podcast.  It was more than 4 hours.  I do n't know how many of you would have been able to watch it completely.  But here's when this podcast came out.  After this, if you see, many memes were also coming. Many Indians were also saying that it seems as if we have to return the money.  Well whatever it is, inside this video we will try to know what is going on right now? Because many people are now confused as to what were the allegations against Vijay Mallya, whether he had committed fraud, whether he had taken a loan, has that loan been repaid?  What is the matter? What are the cases against them?  I will discuss all those things with you in detail so that you can understand them well.  Let's move on. But before that friends, let me tell you all those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026. We have batches like Pratigya Foundation Batch.

The link is given in the comment section and please use this code ankitlive so that you can avail maximum discount. Let's get started.  Look, first of all who is Vijay Mallya here?  A see, Vijay Mallya is an Indian businessman. He had many ventures and was also a former Member of Parliament. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha as an independent candidate.   It is obvious that the political parties support you and only then you go to the Rajya Sabha, and in fact, he has been a member of the Rajya Sabha twice.  in 2002. In 2002, he went to the Rajya Sabha with the support of JDS and Congress.  And in 2010, he again went to Rajya Sabha with the support of JDS and BJP.  And you all know about many of his businesses, about the UV Group which is the maker of Kingfisher beer and apart from this there is Kingfisher Airlines, we will discuss about it in detail because the whole matter is related to this and here he has also been the co-owner of Force India which is an F1 team, he has also been the co-owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team and see, as soon as this whole matter came to light, after this many industrialists are also coming in support of Vijay Mallya, defending him. For example Harsh Goenka, if you see, he said some things here. He said, was Vijay Mallya's lifestyle very high? He said yes.  Have they defaulted ?  He said yes.  But unlike others, their dues of more than 9000 crore rupees which they had to pay have already been settled.  Meantime there are many more big defaulters in the country who are roaming around like this. And if the deuce remains then banks should be told that Vijay Mallya has to pay this much more.  If not, then why is a political punching back being made against Vijay Mallya?  Justice must be fair not selective.  He said this and see, Vijay Mallya also thanked him. Well whatever it is, let us look at some background of the controversy here.  Kingfisher Airlines.  When was Kingfisher Airlines launched? 2005  And let me tell you there is no doubt about the quality of service that King Fisher Airlines provided, I do n't think even today any airline is providing such service. I am talking about Indian Airlines because the first time I flew was in the year 2009.  At that time also I was sitting in Kingfisher Airlines.  And the service was amazing.  No doubt.  Well, whatever it is, here in 2012, Kfizer Airlines collapsed and the allegation was made that there were 17 Indian banks which were being led by SBI and there were many other banks, I will tell you about this later, there were 17 Indian banks which suffered a loss of around ₹9000 crores, they had taken dues, took money, took loans which they did not pay and here more allegations are made against them that the funds of financial mismanagement were diverted, then apart from this, they could not pay the salaries of more than 2000 employees of Kingfer Airlines.  So all these allegations were against her and in view of this, you will see many legal cases against Mallia. First of all is loan default and financial irregularities. So the allegation against him is that he took a lot of loans, that too from public sector banks, without any collateral, just think about it.  So this is one thing that is being told here.  The second allegation was that he diverted the loan he had taken. See, the problem is that when you are taking a loan for your business, then you can invest that loan only in that particular business. You cannot divert it for any personal use or anywhere else.  The allegation against him was that he diverted a lot of money and funds somewhere else.  And keeping this in view, the CBI and ED here claimed that the loans they had procured through false representation.  The loan was taken here in an incorrect manner.  It was misused and here it was ultimately defaulted.  So this is one thing that happened.  Then keeping this in mind you will remember that the Indian Government brought a law. Fugitive Economic Offenders Act 2018 and finally you can see Vijay Mallya is declared fugitive economic offender by the Indian Court in 2019. And India was one of the first countries to impose these charges on high profile businessmen through such a law. Then another thing happens here, contempt of court is declared by the Supreme Court. Basically, what was proved was that he transferred the money worth 40 million dollars to his children and that too at a time when proceedings were already going on against him in the court.  So he couldn't do that.  But despite that he transferred the money. And that is why the Supreme Court found him guilty of contempt and sentenced him to 4 months' imprisonment and asked him to return the entire money. But it is obvious that Vijay Mallya had already left India.  So here next comes the battle of extradition. A lot of efforts were being made to bring Vijay Mallya to India and the UK court had already approved the extradition in 2020 that he would be brought to India. But Vijay Mallya adopted many legal options. Asylum was granted, an appeal was made so that extradition could be delayed.  The situation now in 2025 is that he has lost all his final appeals in the UK courts.  But extradition has not happened yet.  Now what is the reason behind this?  I do n't know ultimately what is happening but you have to understand that all the appeals of Vijay Mallya are actually over.  And next is banking here.  Keep one more thing in mind. This Vijay Mallya case is not the only one going on in Indian courts. If you look in UK, the Indian banks had also reached UK and filed a case against Vijay Mallya. In 2021, the UK court also declared Vijay Mallya bankrupt and in April 2025, his final appeal against the bankruptcy order was also dismissed. This means that the banks can take the overseas assets of Vijay Mallya here. So this is one of its results. Well, these were all allegations.  But the question is what is Vijay Mallya's defense? Because this entire podcast that came out recently was a podcast longer than 4 hours.  So in this he has said many such important things.  Let me just tell you a little bit quickly.  The first thing he said was that I am not a thief.  He admitted that Kingfisher Airlines had failed but he had not stolen any money.  He is saying this in his defense.  He said if you want to call me fugitive go ahead. You can call me fugitive.  But don't call me thief.  Where did this word thief come from? He attacked the Indian media a lot for how his image has been tarnished and at the same time, he also said that he has already repaid whatever loan he had taken, that is, more than whatever was his due. Meaning, whatever money was to be paid by selling their assets which were seized in India, has already been paid to them. Despite that he is still being attacked. And that is why if you see, he said that he is being targeted unfairly.  There is political pressure. He says that he has become a victim of the political system.  He blamed the government and bureaucracy that because of them Kingfisher had collapsed.   In fact, in the podcast that he gave, he said one more thing.  In 2010, you might remember the financial crisis that had hit the entire world in 2008-9.  So here they were trying to cut down, they said that we are cutting down on Kingfisher Airlines so that there can be some savings etc.  The company should not have claps.  So here Pranab Mukherjee ji, who was the Finance Minister, met him.  Pranab Mukherjee He says that Pranab Mukherjee had said that you should not cut down because otherwise there will be a lot of job losses etc.  There will be a lot of problems.  So this is not what we want right now. So this was his statement that now Pranab Mukherjee ji is not there who can clarify this.  So in a way Vijay Mallya is saying that efforts are being made to make him an escape goat and at the same time Vijay Mallya said that he will definitely come to India but only if it is guaranteed that his legal proceedings will be done in a fair manner. They will get dignified treatment.  If the way it works in Indian media is not there then they can definitely come to India.  And as he also mentioned the UK court that the UK court is also concerned about the prison conditions in India.  So all these things have been said by him.  Now the question here is how much does Vijay Mallya give to Indian Banks?  Look at Vijay Mallya, if you see what he does with Indian Banks, it is around ₹9000 crores.  That means it is more than Rs 9000 crore, in fact, let me show you a little. This entire consortium was led by SBI in which all other banks are included.  SBI was leading because it had given the maximum money.  You can see more than 1600 crores.  After that PNB became 800 crores, IDBI, Bank of Baroda, UBI.  Apart from this, there were a total of 17 other banks that had given money here and its total value comes out to be around Rs 9000 crore.  And as you all know Vijay Mallya left India in 2016 and since then he is living in UK. And look, last year an interesting thing came to light.  In December last year in 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ji informed the Lok Sabha that the ED, the Enforcement Directorate has so far recovered 14000 crore worth of assets of Mallya. So, in a way, Vijay Mallya is saying that if suppose I pay ₹6000 crore or ₹9000 crore, then we have already paid it here, but see, there is an important thing here which all of you have to understand.  It is now it is not just about recovering the money.  So, let's assume that in a way it is said that all the money has been recovered.  All these things have happened. But you have to understand that now the matter here is not just about recovery.  Because the investigating agencies have made many more allegations against Vijay Mallya. Charged with criminal conspiracy.  has been accused of fraud. accused of money laundering.  In fact, the bank officials here were also arrested for how they sanctioned loans etc. here. So, here in these facts I will also show you some interesting thing.  You can see this allegation of money laundering. Here the ED had charged Vijay Mallya under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Here the ED alleged that Kingfisher Airlines diverted about ₹3500 crore.  The loan they received was diverted. This is the ED's allegation.  This is an ongoing ED case. Secondly, there is also an allegation of service tax which he did not pay. Basically, it is being said that between 2012 and 2015, the Service Tax Department had filed complaints against Kingfisher Airlines.  Why?  Because here Rs 100 crore had to be paid as service tax. And see what is service tax?  Like today there is GST, which is an indirect tax.  So that is service tax.  Here the company collects money from you and ultimately gives that money to the government. That is not the company's money.  So the allegation is that they collected money from people.  That means they took the service tax charged on the ticket from the customer but did not deposit that money of ₹100 crore with the government.  Apart from this, there are also allegations of corporate misgovernance and fraud. In July 2016, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office issued notices to 17 companies.  These 17 companies are the ones who took money from the bank and ultimately financed KF Airlines.  So here there are allegations of corporate misgovernance and financial irregularities as well.  And ultimately see, all these things that happen, their implications are there in India too.  Ever since Vijay Mallya came here there has been a lot of discussion. A lot happened.  I am sure you all will remember how discussions used to take place every day regarding things.  So it was shown here that how the due diligence that should be done in banks regarding loans was still not being done and an attempt was made to bring in stricter rules here. Especially the approval, audit and external monitoring of corporate loans.  Then along with this a law was brought so that anyone could be declared a fugitive economic offender in our country and efforts were also made to increase banking vigilance here. The quality, asset quality, reforms, I mean all these things have been brought in so that things can be monitored more closely. But look what the ultimate conclusion is?  What we say is that Vijay Mallya is a thief or not.   I mean, what are the people here who are in favor saying?  What is he saying against ?  Is Vijay Mallya a thief?  Look, those who are in favor say that they have already paid it.  In a way, they are being made victims.  So this should not happen. Those who are against Vijay Mallya say that look, whatever evidence there is, it is clear that he has committed fraud , defaulted and diverted the funds. And then the second argument is whether they were unfairly targeted.  Those who are in favour of Vijay Mallya are saying that the politicians have used him and those who are against Vijay Mallya are saying that the legal process was followed properly, he also had a legal council, so it is not that he was targeted unfairly, he was done through proper legal procedure and in the end the question is whether he should come to India ?  He says that Vijay Mallya himself has said that I will come but only if the treatment is done properly.  Indian courts have already said that the Indian judiciary has guaranteed that we will give you proper due process.  You have nothing to worry about. Now let us see whether Vijay Mallya comes to India or not.  But through this video I just hope that you get whatever clarity you needed because a lot of confusion has arisen.  I wanted to tell you about this and before I go further, I have an interesting question for you all.  Just now I told you about Fugitive Economic Offender.
