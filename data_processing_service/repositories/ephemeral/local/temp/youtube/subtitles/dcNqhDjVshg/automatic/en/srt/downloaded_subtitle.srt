00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,840
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, recently

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,759
you must have seen that there is

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,679
a lot of discussion about Vijay Mallya.  There was a

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
podcast done by him and it was a pretty big

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
podcast.  It was more than 4 hours.  I do

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
n't know how many of you would have been

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
able to watch it completely.  But here's

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,160
when this podcast came out.  After this,

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,080
if you see, many memes were also coming.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
Many Indians were also saying that it seems as if

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,320
we have to return the money.  Well

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
whatever it is, inside this video we will try to

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
know what is going on right now?

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
Because many people are now confused

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,280
as to what

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
were the allegations against Vijay Mallya, whether he had committed

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,559
fraud, whether he had taken a loan, has that loan been

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
repaid?  What is the matter?

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
What are the cases against them?  I will discuss all those things with you

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,960
in detail so that you can

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
understand them well.  Let's move on.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
But before that friends, let me tell you all those of

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Let's get started.  Look,

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
first of all who is Vijay Mallya here?  A

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,080
see, Vijay Mallya is an Indian businessman.

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
He had many ventures and was

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
also a former Member of Parliament.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
He was elected to the Rajya Sabha as an independent candidate.   It is

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
obvious that the political parties

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
support you and only then you

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,560
go to the Rajya Sabha, and in fact,

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
he has been a member of the Rajya Sabha twice.  in 2002.

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
In 2002,

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,680
he went to the Rajya Sabha with the support of JDS and Congress.  And

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,079
in 2010,

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
he again went to Rajya Sabha with the support of JDS and BJP.  And

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
you all know about many of his businesses,

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,240
about the UV Group which is the maker of Kingfisher beer

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,840
and apart from this there is Kingfisher Airlines,

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
we will discuss about it in detail

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
because the whole matter is related to this

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
and here he has also been the co-owner of

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,040
Force India which is an F1 team, he has

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,799
also been the co-owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
and see, as soon as this whole

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
matter came to light, after this many

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
industrialists are also

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
coming in support of Vijay Mallya, defending him.

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,560
For example Harsh Goenka, if you

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,520
see, he said some things here.

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,920
He said, was Vijay Mallya's

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
lifestyle very high?

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
He said yes.  Have they defaulted

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,000
?  He said yes.  But unlike

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,720
others, their dues of more than 9000 crore

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,760
rupees which they had to pay have already been

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,000
settled.  Meantime there are many more

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,519
big defaulters in the country who are roaming around like this.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
And if the deuce remains

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,160
then banks should be told that Vijay Mallya has to

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,720
pay this much more.  If not, then

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,879
why is a political punching back being made against

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
Vijay Mallya?  Justice must be

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,360
fair not selective.  He said this and

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
see, Vijay Mallya also thanked him.

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,920
Well whatever it is, let us

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,319
look at some background of the controversy here.  Kingfisher

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
Airlines.  When was Kingfisher Airlines launched?

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,200
2005  And let me tell you there is no doubt about the

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,440

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
quality of service that King Fisher Airlines provided, I do

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,800
n't think even today any airline is providing such service.

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
I am talking about Indian Airlines

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,519
because the first time I

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,599
flew was in the year 2009.  At

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,920
that time also I was

88
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,480
sitting in Kingfisher Airlines.  And the

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,200
service was amazing.  No doubt.  Well, whatever it is, here

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,920
in 2012, Kfizer Airlines collapsed

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,159
and the allegation was made that there were

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,480
17 Indian banks which were being led

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,480
by SBI and there were many other banks,

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,360
I will tell you about this later, there were

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,239
17 Indian banks which suffered a loss of around

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,720
â‚¹9000 crores, they had taken dues, took

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,519
money, took loans which they did not pay and

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,760
here more allegations are made against them that the

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
funds of financial mismanagement were diverted, then

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
apart from this, they could

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560

103
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,360
not pay the salaries of more than 2000 employees of Kingfer Airlines.  So all these

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,080
allegations were against her and in view of this,

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,159
you will see many legal cases against Mallia.

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
First of all is loan

107
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,959
default and financial irregularities.

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,280
So the allegation against him is that he

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,919

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
took a lot of loans, that too from public sector banks, without any collateral, just think about it.  So this is one thing that is being told here.  The

112
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,560
second allegation was that

113
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,280
he diverted the loan he had taken.

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
See, the problem is that when you are

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,919
taking a loan for your business, then you

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
can invest that loan only in that particular business.

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,479
You cannot divert it for any personal use or anywhere else.  The

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,199
allegation against him was

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,000
that he diverted a lot of money and funds

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,639
somewhere else.  And keeping this in

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
view, the CBI and ED here

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,040
claimed that the loans they had

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,639
procured through false representation.  The

124
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
loan was taken here in an incorrect manner.  It was

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
misused and here it was

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,520
ultimately defaulted.  So this is one thing that

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,360
happened.  Then keeping this in mind you will remember that the

128
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,960
Indian Government brought a law.

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,199
Fugitive Economic Offenders Act 2018 and

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
finally you can see Vijay Mallya is

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,440

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
declared fugitive economic offender by the Indian Court in 2019.

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,320
And India was one of the first

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,120
countries to impose

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,280
these charges on high profile businessmen through such a law.

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
Then another thing happens here,

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,919
contempt of court is declared by the Supreme Court.

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
Basically, what was

139
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,600
proved was that he transferred the money worth 40 million dollars

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,720
to his children

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,960
and that too at a time when

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
proceedings were already going on against him in the court.  So he

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
couldn't do that.  But despite that

144
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,720
he transferred the money.

145
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
And that is why the Supreme Court

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
found him guilty of contempt and sentenced him to 4 months'

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
imprisonment and asked him to return the entire money.

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
But it is obvious that Vijay

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,759
Mallya had already left India.  So

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,479
here next comes the battle of extradition.

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,800
A lot of efforts were being made to bring Vijay Mallya to

152
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,160
India and the UK court had

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,160
already approved the extradition in 2020

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,039
that he would be brought to India.

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
But Vijay Mallya adopted many legal options.

156
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,479
Asylum was granted, an appeal was made so that

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,800
extradition could be delayed.  The

158
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,440
situation now in 2025 is that he has lost

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
all his final appeals

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
in the UK courts.  But

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
extradition has not happened yet.  Now

162
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,400
what is the reason behind this?  I do

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,560
n't know ultimately what is happening but you have to understand

164
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,880
that all the appeals of Vijay Mallya are

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
actually over.  And next

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
is banking here.  Keep one more thing in mind.

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
This Vijay Mallya case is not the

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
only one going on in Indian courts.

169
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,199
If you look in UK, the

170
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,360
Indian banks had also reached UK

171
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
and filed a case against Vijay Mallya.

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,560
In 2021, the UK court also declared Vijay Mallya

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,680
bankrupt and

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
in April 2025, his final appeal against the bankruptcy

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,479
order was also dismissed.

176
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
This means that the banks can

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,240
take the overseas assets of Vijay Mallya here.

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,800
So this is one of its results.

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
Well, these were all allegations.  But the question is

180
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,880
what is Vijay Mallya's defense?

181
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
Because this entire podcast that

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
came out recently was a podcast longer than 4 hours.  So

183
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,120
in this he has said many such important

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,880
things.  Let me just tell you a little bit quickly.  The

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,520
first thing he said was that

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,280
I am not a thief.  He admitted that

187
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,280
Kingfisher Airlines had failed but

188
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
he had not stolen any money.  He is

189
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,599
saying this in his defense.  He said

190
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,919
if you want to call me fugitive go ahead.

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,000
You can call me fugitive.  But don't

192
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,639
call me thief.  Where did this word thief come from?

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
He attacked the Indian media

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,039
a lot for how his image has been

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
tarnished and at the same time,

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,680
he also said that he has

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,039

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,000
already repaid whatever loan he had taken, that is, more than whatever was his due.

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,560
Meaning,

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
whatever money was to be paid by selling their assets which were seized in India, has

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,560
already been paid to them.

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,400
Despite that he is still being attacked.

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
And that is why if you see,

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,319
he said that he is being

205
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,720
targeted unfairly.  There is political pressure.

206
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,759
He says that

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,680
he has become a victim of the political system.  He

208
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,919
blamed the government and bureaucracy that

209
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,840
because of them Kingfisher had collapsed.   In

210
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,199
fact, in the podcast that he gave, he

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,440
said one more thing.  In 2010,

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
you might remember the financial

213
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,759
crisis that had hit the entire world in 2008-9.  So

214
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
here they were trying to cut down,

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
they said that

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,479
we are cutting down on Kingfisher Airlines so that there can be

217
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,039
some savings etc.  The company should

218
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
not have claps.  So here

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,440
Pranab Mukherjee ji, who was the Finance Minister,

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
met him.  Pranab Mukherjee He

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
says that Pranab Mukherjee had said

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
that you should not cut down because otherwise there will be

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
a lot of job losses etc.  There will be a lot of

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,279
problems.  So this is not what we want right now.

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
So this was his statement that now

226
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
Pranab Mukherjee ji is not there who

227
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,440
can clarify this.  So in a way Vijay

228
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
Mallya is saying that efforts are being made to make him an escape goat

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
and at the same time

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Vijay Mallya said that he will

231
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,200
definitely come to India but only if it is guaranteed

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,760
that his legal proceedings will be done in a

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,399
fair manner.

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,640
They will get dignified treatment.  If the way it

235
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,320
works in Indian media is not there then they can definitely come to

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
India.  And as

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
he also mentioned the UK court

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,120
that the UK court is also concerned about the

239
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,200
prison conditions in India.  So all these things have been

240
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,240
said by him.  Now the question here is

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,920
how much does Vijay Mallya give

242
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,399
to Indian Banks?  Look at Vijay Mallya,

243
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,440
if you see what he does with Indian Banks,

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,600
it is around â‚¹9000 crores.  That means it is

245
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
more than Rs 9000 crore, in fact, let me

246
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,760
show you a little.

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,920
This entire consortium was led by SBI in which

248
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,040
all other banks are included.  SBI was leading

249
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,959
because

250
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,200
it had given the maximum money.  You can see

251
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,680
more than 1600 crores.  After that PNB

252
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,320
became 800 crores, IDBI, Bank of

253
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Baroda, UBI.  Apart from this, there were a total of 17 other

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
banks that had given money here

255
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,440
and its total value comes out to be

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,839
around Rs 9000 crore.  And as you all

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,080
know Vijay Mallya left India in 2016

258
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
and since then he is living in UK.

259
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,320
And look, last year an

260
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,880
interesting thing came to light.  In December

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
last year in 2024,

262
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Finance Minister Nirmala

263
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,519
Sitharaman ji informed the Lok Sabha that the

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,560
ED, the Enforcement Directorate has

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,040
so far recovered 14000 crore worth of

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,959
assets of Mallya. So, in

267
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,680
a way, Vijay Mallya is saying

268
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,480
that if suppose I pay â‚¹6000 crore or â‚¹9000

269
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,880
crore, then we have already paid it

270
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
here, but see, there is

271
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,160
an important thing here which all of you have to understand.  It

272
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,480
is now it is not just about

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,959
recovering the money.  So, let's assume that in a

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,040
way it is said that all the money has been

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,760
recovered.  All these things have happened.

276
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
But you have to understand that now the

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
matter here is not just about recovery.  Because the

278
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,200
investigating agencies have made

279
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,680
many more allegations against Vijay Mallya.

280
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Charged with criminal conspiracy.  has been

281
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,920
accused of fraud.

282
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
accused of money laundering.  In fact, the

283
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
bank officials here were also

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
arrested for how they

285
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,640
sanctioned loans etc. here.

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,240
So, here in these facts I will

287
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
also show you some interesting thing.  You can see this

288
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
allegation of money laundering.

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,880
Here the ED had charged Vijay Mallya

290
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,279
under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

291
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,279
Here the ED alleged that Kingfisher

292
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,440
Airlines diverted about â‚¹3500 crore.  The

293
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,360
loan they received was diverted.

294
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,079
This is the ED's allegation.  This is an ongoing ED case.

295
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,399
Secondly, there is also an allegation of service tax

296
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,040
which he did not pay.

297
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,839
Basically, it is being said that

298
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
between 2012 and 2015, the Service Tax Department had

299
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,160
filed complaints

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,959
against Kingfisher Airlines.  Why?  Because here Rs

301
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
100 crore had to be paid as service tax.

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,640
And see what is service tax?  Like

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,560
today there is GST, which is an indirect

304
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
tax.  So that is service tax.  Here the

305
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,720
company collects money from you

306
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
and ultimately gives that money to the government.

307
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,959
That is not the company's money.  So the allegation is

308
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
that they collected money from people.  That

309
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,240
means they took the

310
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,399
service tax charged on the ticket

311
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
from the customer but did

312
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480

313
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,560
not deposit that money of â‚¹100 crore with the government.  Apart from this, there are

314
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,360
also allegations of corporate misgovernance and fraud.

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,760
In July 2016, the Serious Fraud

316
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,800
Investigation Office

317
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,880
issued notices to 17 companies.  These 17

318
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,680
companies are the ones who took money from the bank

319
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,440
and ultimately financed KF

320
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
Airlines.  So here there are allegations of corporate

321
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
misgovernance and financial irregularities

322
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,000
as well.  And ultimately see,

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
all these things that happen, their

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,800
implications are there in India too.  Ever since

325
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,320
Vijay Mallya came here there has been a lot of discussion.

326
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
A lot happened.  I am sure you

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
all will remember how

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,440
discussions used to take place every day regarding things.  So it was

329
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,320
shown here that how the

330
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,079
due diligence that should be done in banks

331
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,160
regarding loans was still not being done and an

332
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,240
attempt was made to bring in stricter rules here.

333
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,320
Especially the approval,

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
audit and external monitoring of corporate loans.  Then

335
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
along with this a law was brought so that

336
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,720

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,440
anyone could be declared a fugitive economic offender in our country and

338
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
efforts were also made to increase banking vigilance here.

339
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
The quality, asset

340
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,600
quality, reforms, I mean all these things have been

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
brought in so that things can be monitored more closely.

342
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
But look

343
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,760
what the ultimate conclusion is?  What we say is that

344
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,480
Vijay Mallya is a thief or not.   I

345
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
mean, what are the people here who are in favor

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
saying?  What is he saying against

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,440
?  Is Vijay Mallya a thief?  Look, those who are

348
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,680
in favor say that they have already paid it.  In

349
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600

350
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,200
a way, they are being made victims.  So this should not happen.

351
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
Those who are against Vijay Mallya

352
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
say that look, whatever evidence there is, it is

353
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,720
clear that he has committed fraud

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
, defaulted and diverted the funds.

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
And then the second argument is

356
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
whether they were unfairly targeted.  Those who are in

357
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,440
favour of Vijay Mallya are

358
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,160
saying that the politicians have used him

359
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,079
and those who are against

360
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,560
Vijay Mallya are saying that the legal

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,800
process was followed properly,

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,120
he also had a legal council, so it is not that

363
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,360
he was targeted unfairly, he was done

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
through proper legal procedure and in the end the

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,279
question is whether he should come to India

366
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
?  He says that Vijay Mallya himself has

367
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,360
said that I will come but only if the

368
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,680
treatment is done properly.  Indian courts have

369
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,399
already said that the Indian

370
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
judiciary has guaranteed that we will give you proper due

371
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
process.  You have nothing to worry about.

372
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
Now let us see whether Vijay Mallya

373
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,600
comes to India or not.  But through this video I

374
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,639
just hope that you get whatever

375
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,320
clarity you needed because a lot of

376
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,240
confusion has arisen.  I wanted to

377
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
tell you about this and before I go further, I have

378
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
an interesting question for you all.  Just now

379
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,519
I told you about Fugitive Economic Offender.  Can you

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,160
tell me

381
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,920
under what conditions a person

382
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,440
can be declared a fugitive economic offender

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
and the right answer to this, you all know, it can be

384
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
