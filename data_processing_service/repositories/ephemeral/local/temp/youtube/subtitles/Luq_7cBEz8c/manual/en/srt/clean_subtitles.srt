9 December 2024 Santosh Deshmukh is waiting in his Tata Indigo car at a petrol pump in B District of Maharashtra.  This place is 30 Km.  Far away is Majajok village where Santosh is a sarpanch.  At 3:00 pm his maternal uncle's son Shivraj comes there.  Then both of them go together in the car towards the village. As soon as they cross a toll gate towards the village , suddenly a black Scorpio car comes in front of them.   The license plate number is MA 444z 933 Six men come out of that car, they break the glass of Santosh's car with a stone to see who is inside, then one man opens the door, takes the Sarpanch out and starts beating him with a stick, then these six men drag the Sarpanch and put him in the Scorpio car and leave at 6:30 in the evening, 15 kms from their village. Far away, the Sarpanch's dead body is found on the roadside [MUSIC]. Now many of you might be wondering why I am making a video on the murder case of a Sarpanch leader of a village in Maharashtra ?  Many murders happen in our country. What is the need to make a video on this ?  I am making this video because this case is a very colourful example of all the problems in our country and how goons are given a free hand in our country. How these goons work with politicians and how due to the coordination between these politicians and goons, work and business cannot be done.  Piyush Goyal had recently said that look at the innovations the Chinese companies are doing.  Work on developing electric mobility, battery technologies, semiconductors is growing. Artificial Intelligence is being created for its own country and for its people.  Building chips, AI models.  What are Indian companies doing ?  What should India do?  Do you want to make ice cream or chips?  Indian companies are fighting with the strongmen.  But Santosh Deshmukh was also murdered by a strongman. Valmiki Karad, who is this Valmiki ji and why because of this Valmiki a big minister of Maharashtra had to resign and why if our country has to progress then this rule of the powerful will have to end.  To investigate all these things, I read the 900 page charge sheet regarding the murder of Santosh Deshmukh.  So let us know about the goonda raj in the beat district of Maharashtra.

A Mumbai-based company, Avaada Energy, is setting up a renewable energy project in this village. In this project, she will install several wind turbines in the village. One turbine requires about 7 acres of land and it costs Rs 28 crore. Avaada Energy has claimed that it will invest ₹350 crore through this project in the Beat District.  All the wind turbines together will generate 40 MW of power.  Due to which, Wankhede Stadium can power 10 IPL matches.  Now Vada Energy has chosen the beat districts because the wind potential is good there and because in the traditional areas where such projects are set up like Satara and Sangli, there is a lot of competition now.  Now a lot of land is needed for this project. Therefore, Avaada Energy started talking to the farmers of Massa village to acquire their land from 2023 itself. Many villagers are actually very happy because around 150 people will get jobs through this project.  But in May 2024, problems started arising in this project. Many senior employees of the project started receiving calls from local strongmen and goons demanding extortion money worth ₹ crores. They threaten the company that either give us ₹ crores or this project will be closed. Which strongman is giving this threat ? Valmiki Karad Valmiki Karad is a local strongman. Valmiki from Parli area of ​​B District grew up in a simple farmer's family but he hit the jackpot when he became the right hand man of Dhananjay Munde, a veteran leader of Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party. Now Valmiki does not hold any official post in the party but he handles all the matters of Dhananjay Munde in B District and Valmiki used this very thing to increase his power in the district and to start an extortion racket.  It is as if he has started an organised criminal network. Where many gangs come under his control.  But he extorts money from many companies. If any company or person did not listen to him then he would either file fake cases against them through the police or get their entire business closed down. About 15 criminal cases have been registered against Valmiki. Attempted Murder, Extortion, Cheating, Fake Writing, Unlawful Assembly and many more.  In fact, even after last year's Lok Sabha elections, a case of attempt to murder was registered against him.  Now, due to recovery, he has no shortage of money. Be it high-end cars or land, he lives a life of complete luxury.  In fact, a BJP MLA claimed that Valmik owns property worth more than ₹100 crore in Pune alone. Now how did Valmiki earn so much money?  And this is the recovery that Valmik was doing when he called Avada Energy and said give me ₹ crores or else I will shut down your project.  On May 28, 2024, at 11:00 am, the project manager of Avaada Energy company was kidnapped by Valmiki's men.  The project manager did lodge a complaint but the situation went from bad to worse.  A few months later, on August 28 at 5:00 pm, the project manager received a call from Valmiki. Hey, I know your work is going on over there.   Either you come and meet me here in Parley or stop all your work.  So the land acquisition manager of the company tells Valmiki on the phone that I will come to meet you. After 15 days, another call comes from Valmiki and he repeats that you come to meet me in my office.  On October 8, the land acquisition manager of Shivaji Company finally goes to meet Valmik. what?  Should you tell my demand to your seniors or not?  If you want to continue the work here then you will have to give me Rs. 1 crore right now.  Otherwise all work will have to be stopped in Beed.  If you are not able to do it then give me the number of your senior.  But now these threats have not stopped. On November 29, one of Valmiki's goons calls the company back and says that Anna wants to talk to you.  Then at 1:00 pm that day, one of Valmiki’s men named Sudarshan reaches the site of Avaada Energy. Sudarshan is a 26 years old local goon in Valmiki's team and everyone in the area knows that Sudarshan basically does Valmiki's dirty work.  hey did you talk to Anna ?  Hey, why do you want to create unnecessary trouble? I have come here for only one thing. Anna has told Bhim to stop all this work. Ok.  Last time I stopped your work.  You guys had complained against me, right? Anna just came to know about all this.  Hey, he has gone crazy. Right now I know that your work is going on at four or five more places.  Hey my whole family, I will go straight to Anna now. Anna has the account of your minutes.  Now you see what you have to do with Anna's demands ?  Shivaji who is the land acquisition manager of the company. He also gave a statement to the police regarding this incident that Sudarshan had told me to go and meet Valmiki.  If I had not done this the company's business would have stopped. And I would also get threats about my life. Sudarshan again threatens that today you will have to meet Valmiki.  So out of fear, Shivaji goes to meet Valmiki at 2:00 in the afternoon.  And here Valmiki asks him, what happened to what I told you?  Shivaji says that whatever Valmiki told him, he has informed his seniors and he will remind them.  Now despite all these things the threats did not stop but the company refused to pay ₹ crores.  Then on December 6, Shivaji gets a call.  Sudarshan is on the line who asks if Shivaji is in the office?  Then after a few hours a black Scorpio car MA 44 z93 arrives outside the company gate. Sudarshan and his three men are inside the car. One of the men asks the security guard to open the company gate.   The security guard says that you let me talk to an officer of a company and I will open the gate for you.  Sudarshan then threatens the guard and says I am Sudarshan Gore. Do you have the guts to stop me? Your mother’s. Sudarshan and his men then get out of the car and break the gate and enter inside.  As a security guard tries to stop them, one of Sudarshan's men takes a stick and starts beating him.  When other guards try to help, the goons beat them up too and threaten to kill them if they interfere in their case.  Hearing this fight, Shivaji reaches the gate.  Sudarshan abuses him a lot and says, hey either give me two shops or close down your company Vinni.  At the same time, an official of the company calls Santosh Deshmukh, the Sarpanch of Masajok village to ask what is happening in the company. Santosh Patil Rao Deshmukh was a sarpanch of Massajok village in B District.   A married man with two children, he was involved in village politics since 2013.   In fact his family has been involved in the village for a long time.  His wife also became Sarpanch in 2017 and after 5 years, he himself became Sarpanch. Between 2017 and 24, his village also received 19 awards for development. Like, he got the award for the best water supply and sanitation system in Marathwada, which is a very big thing because in the Marathwada region, there is less rainfall due to which water is like gold.  Veteran politicians like Sharad Pawar also praised Santosh.  By saying that he is a representative who does not get involved in controversies but works hard for his society. That is why when Avadha's security guard called the Sarpanch and informed him that there was some trouble here.  Immediately the Sarpanch arrives there with some villagers and he tells Sudarshan not to close the company. People are getting jobs.  Otherwise, how will they manage their expenses?  Sudarshan then shouts back at the Sarpanch.  Hey Sarpanch, we will deal with you, we will not leave you alive, you bastard. But the Sarpanch tells Shivaji and the other people of Abaddha that you do n't worry, if anyone threatens you then I will help you. The same evening, an FIR is filed against Sudarshan and his men for scuffling with the security guards. Within a few hours, Valmiki's men like Sudarshan are taken into custody. And he gets the belt immediately.  Now at this time Valmiki's men keep calling the Sarpanch and saying see this matter is mine. Don't get involved in this matter otherwise you might even lose your life.  The Sarpanch is scared. And he also tells his brother, daughter and wife about this fear.  His wife says my husband is very scared.  Due to this fear, he is living in Latur, 2 hours away from Massage Jok. When Sudarshan realises that Awada Energy is not fulfilling the demand of Rs 2 crore and now even the Sarpanch is supporting them, then he goes to Valmiki.  Valmiki tells him that if this continues, no company will pay weekly to itself.  From now on, whoever comes between them is sure to be murdered.  Come on, start working.  Yes, talk to Vishnu, he will assist you.  So the next day Sudarshan meets with some of Valmiki's men at a nearby hotel. He tells them about the instructions given by Valmiki and says that if the Sarpanch comes back to Awada then Talab Tadashik. Everyone should know what the consequences of fighting with us are. Next day on 9th October the Sarpanch and his maternal uncle's son are going to their village Massa Jok in a Tata Indigo car.  As soon as they cross a toll gate, a black Scorpio immediately blocks their way. Uncle's son Shivraj knows that this car belongs to local goon Sudarshan.  The goons throw the Sarpanch out, put him in their Scorpio car and head towards Catch in the Beat District. Shivraj immediately gets scared and files an FIR against seven men for kidnapping the Sarpanch. They reach Ganga Mauli Sugar Mill in a desolate area located 14km from Massa Jok.  It is far away.  He throws the Sarpanch out and starts beating him with an iron rod and gas pipe. Where a man continuously beats the Sarpanch.  The second one holds the Sarpanch's mouth and forces him to speak.  Everyone's father is Sudarshan Gude.  Then he urinates on the Sarpanch's face. They take off his clothes, pull his hair and keep beating him.  Blood starts flowing from his body, but the goons cannot hear the Sarpanch's screams. And all these photos that you are seeing on your screen are taken from the charge sheet only.   The goons are recording this entire fight. Then after beating him they pick up that Sarpanch.  They put it in a Scorpio and threw it away from the village at 6:30 in the evening. Now, ever since Shivraj Sarpanch's maternal uncle's son filed the FIR, the police have been searching for the Sarpanch.  But they do n’t get them.  But suddenly they get a tip and within a few minutes the police immediately reaches the location and finds the unconscious body of the Sarpanch. He is immediately taken to the sub-district hospital of Catch but the doctor declares him dead.  It is written in the post-mortem that his body was completely cold.  Which means that it had been a long time since his death.  The injury marks on the body clearly show that he has been physically assaulted.   It is written in the post mortem that due to multiple injuries, haemorrhage and shock occurred which led to his death.  Then the police starts its investigation. First of all, two 21 year old young men who are Valmiki's men are arrested.  On the same day, the police also seize the black Scorpio car that was used for the entire incident. But there is no news about the main actors Valmiki and Sudarshan. Now during this other men of Valmiki get arrested when police conduct several raids in Nashik, Aurangabad and Pune. Finally on 21 December Valmiki surrenders in Pune. Now Valmiki is first arrested in a bus extortion case. But during the investigation a secret witness tells the police that Valmiki is the mastermind behind this entire thing. Witness says that if the recovery money was not paid, Valmik would have not only beaten the people but also killed them.   The second witness tells the police that Valmiki is the strongman here and this whole district is his jungle.  Any company that works in this district pays extortion money to one or the other Valmiki gang.  After obtaining all this information the police finally files a murder case against Valmiki.  But after a month Sudarshan is also arrested. Sudarshan Ghule, accused in the murder of Santosh Deshmukh, confessed to the police.  On February 17, Masazo villagers threatened to go on a hunger strike if the case was not solved.  The murder of a Sarpanch again becomes a big headline in Maharashtra. Because Valmiki is a special man of Maharashtra Minister Dhananjay Munde. Opposition parties say that Dhananjay Munde will have to resign while this investigation is going on. Finally on March 4th, Dhananjay Munde submits his resignation. Cabinet Minister Dhananjay Munde has submitted his resignation.  Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis announced this some time ago. Fadnavis has accepted Munde's resignation.  He is still an MLA but not in any ministerial post. Kalidas Sapet, a senior leader of a farmer union in Maharashtra, says that Dhananjay is so powerful that no one wants to speak against him.  His extortion gangs have been operating in Beed for about a year. But one thing is certain that after the murder of the Sarpanch, the caste politics of Beed came to the fore.  Valmiki Karad and Dhananjay Munde both belong to the Banjari community.  An OBC group while the Sarpanch is from the Maratha community which is politically powerful and is considered upper caste. Both the communities have been living in Beed for many centuries.  But this case showed the divide among communities. Even many police officers removed their surnames from their nameplates so that people could trust them.  An interview with a resident of Beed shows that our society has become polarised.  When I invited a friend to a tea shop, he refused to come there saying that the shop belonged to people from another community.  If we talk about the case, cases were registered against Valmiki Karad and many of his associates due to the three FIRs. One of these cases is under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act ( MCOCA) which is a very serious and non- bailable offence.  For this reason, he is still in custody.  The next hearing of the case will be on April 24.  The Sarpanch's family has requested that this case be fast tracked.  The Sarpanch's brother said that we want justice. This case can be settled in 6 to 7 months in the fast track court. Therefore, we demand an application to the Exact Track Court through the CID. Recently a new TV series Khaki has come where a police officer takes charge in a new police station. He was told that there is a very dangerous goon in the area. Chandan Mahato, it is his responsibility to control him.  Chandan Mahato is a big gangster who runs many extortion businesses. As soon as the officer arrives at the post on his first day, his subordinates serve him a mutton dish.  The officer gets very impressed and tells his colleagues, “This is an amazing scene, friend.”  How much is meat per kg here?  Then a subordinate of the officer replies that who knows, big boss, I never bought it.  So how do we know the price ?  That bhaiya ji sends us 2 kilos of mutton, fish and chicken every day.  Who bhaiya ji?  Chandan Mahato brother Chandan Mahato who is the gangster of the area is the one who is feeding mutton to the police and this is the story of our country, those who are the protectors of justice are the ones eating the salt of the goons.   The story that I told you in the last 15-20 minutes is not just the story of a Sarpanch and a goon but it is the story of our government. And when you look carefully, you will find this same pattern in many corners of the country.  Be it the case of Aati Ahmed or Valmiki Karad.  These people are actually entrepreneurs.  Wherever he gets an opportunity, he jumps at it. But why are they getting this opportunity ?  Because the government is not doing its job. Despite being convicted of murder in Bihar's Siwan district, Mohammad Shabuddin ran his empire from inside the jail. He had a room inside the jail where he used to hold meetings and resolve people's disputes.  why?  Because people neither trusted the police nor the courts. Because of this he will go to Baahubali only. And that is why Atiq Ahmed's supporters used to say that he is definitely a goon but he is our goon. At least he will listen to us.  He will do our work.  What about the police and the courts ?  What is the definition of government? Is Valmik Karad Govt?   The definition of government in political science is any organization that has a monopoly on violence and collecting taxes.  So Valmiki is not Karad Government but he is running a parallel government because he is demanding recovery of Rs. 100 crores from the companies of Maharashtra which is a clear example of state failure when security guards are beaten up.  Companies are threatened and the Panchayat leader is killed.  Political scientist Milan Vaishnav has written in his book that the Bahubali's will definitely seem like criminals to you and me but many locals do not consider them criminals because they are getting the work of the locals done and to get all their work done they are also extorting money from other businesses and if any person raises a question on their empire then they kill him. These people are not outsiders but they are part of the system and they also support the political system.   The logic is very simple.  Political parties need money and muscle and these strongmen leaders can give both to the parties. Politicians don't tolerate them, in fact they need such people and if we want to end this system then basically our government needs to invest in judiciary and police so that people do n't go to these goons and we need this so that people like Santosh, who just want jobs for their villagers, do n't have to sacrifice their lives.
