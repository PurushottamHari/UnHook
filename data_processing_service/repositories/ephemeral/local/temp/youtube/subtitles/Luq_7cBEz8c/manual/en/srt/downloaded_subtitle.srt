00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
9 December

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,160
2024 Santosh Deshmukh is waiting in his Tata Indigo car

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,560
at a petrol pump in B District of Maharashtra.  This place is

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,560
30 Km.  Far away is Majajok village where

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,600
Santosh is a sarpanch.  At 3:00 pm

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,400
his maternal uncle's son Shivraj comes there.  Then

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,560
both of them go together in the car towards the village.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,960
As soon as they cross a toll gate towards the village

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,480
, suddenly a

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,480
black Scorpio car comes in front of them.   The

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,520
license plate number is MA 444z 933

13
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,600
Six men come out of that car, they

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,760
break the glass of Santosh's car with a stone to

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,520
see

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,239
who is inside, then one man opens the door, takes the Sarpanch

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,280
out and starts beating him with a stick,

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,760
 

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,320
then these six men drag the Sarpanch and

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
put him in the Scorpio car and leave at

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
 

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:19,280
6:30 in the evening, 15 kms from their village.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
Far away, the Sarpanch's dead body is found on the roadside

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,560
[MUSIC].

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,960
Now many of you might be wondering

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,880

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,799
why I am making a video on the murder case of a Sarpanch leader of a village in Maharashtra

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
?  Many murders happen in our country.

29
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
What is the need to make a video on this

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,640
?  I am making this video

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,520
because this

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,759
case is a very colourful example of

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,240
all the problems in our country and how

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
goons are given a free hand in our country.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
How these goons work with politicians

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,320
and how due to the coordination between these politicians and

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,399
goons, work and business

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
cannot be done.  Piyush Goyal had

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,719
recently said that look at the innovations the Chinese companies are

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,000
doing.  Work on

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,759
developing electric mobility, battery

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,560
technologies, semiconductors is growing.

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,959
Artificial Intelligence is being

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,760
created for its own country and for its people.  Building

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
chips, AI models.  What are Indian companies doing

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
?  What should India do?  Do you want to make ice cream

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,720
or chips?  Indian

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,280
companies are fighting with the strongmen.  But

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Santosh Deshmukh was also murdered by a strongman.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,720

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
Valmiki Karad, who is this Valmiki

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,440
ji and why because of this Valmiki

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,160
a big minister of Maharashtra had to resign

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,640
and why if our country has to

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,040
progress then this rule of the powerful will have to end.  To

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,720
investigate all these things,

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,280
I read the 900 page charge sheet

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,840
regarding the murder of Santosh Deshmukh.  So let us know

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
about the goonda raj

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
in the beat district of Maharashtra.  Before we move on to the video,

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760

introductory call on Friday at 7:00 p.m.  So don't

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,120
forget to join it.  Now let's come

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,080
back to the video.

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,720

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Massaj Jok is a small village in Kaj taluka of D District.

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,080
A Mumbai-based company, Avaada Energy, is

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
setting up a renewable energy project in this village.

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,079
In this project, she will install several wind turbines in the village.

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,199
One turbine requires about 7 acres of

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,199
land and it costs Rs 28 crore.

100
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,600
Avaada Energy has claimed that it will

101
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,040

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,960
invest ₹350 crore through this project in the Beat District.  All the wind

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,440
turbines together will generate 40 MW of power.  Due

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,320
to which, Wankhede Stadium

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,320
can power 10 IPL matches.  Now

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,400
Vada Energy has chosen the beat districts

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
because the wind potential is good there and

108
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,560
because in the traditional areas where such

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
projects are set up like Satara and

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,199
Sangli, there is a lot of competition now.  Now

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,600
a lot of land is needed for this project.

112
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,840
Therefore, Avaada Energy

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,479

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,639
started talking to the farmers of Massa village to acquire their land from 2023 itself.

115
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
Many villagers are

116
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,000
actually very happy because

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,919
around 150 people will

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,320
get jobs through this project.  But in May 2024,

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
problems started arising in this project.

120
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,240
Many senior employees of the project started

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,120
receiving calls from local strongmen and goons

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
demanding extortion money worth ₹ crores.

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
They threaten the company that either give

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,199
us ₹ crores or this project will be closed.

125
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
Which strongman is giving this threat

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,479
?

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Valmiki Karad Valmiki Karad is a local

128
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,520
strongman. Valmiki from Parli area of ​​B District grew

129
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,560

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,919
up in a simple farmer's family but he hit the jackpot when he

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,280
became the right hand man of Dhananjay Munde,

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,600
a veteran leader of Ajit Pawar's Nationalist

133
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
Congress Party. Now Valmiki does

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
not hold any official post in the party but he

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,440
handles all the matters of Dhananjay Munde

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,759
in B District and Valmiki used this very thing to

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,240

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,479
increase his power in the district and to

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,639
start an extortion racket.  It is as if he has

140
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,600
started an organised criminal network.

141
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,400
Where many gangs

142
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
come under his control.  But he extorts money from many companies.

143
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
If any company or

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,919
person did not listen to him then

145
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,319
he would either file fake cases against them through the police or get

146
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,360
their entire business closed down.

147
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
About 15 criminal cases have been registered against Valmiki.

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Attempted Murder,

149
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,720
Extortion, Cheating, Fake Writing,

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
Unlawful Assembly and many more.  In fact,

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,680
even after last year's Lok Sabha elections, a

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
case of attempt to murder was registered against him.  Now,

153
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
due to recovery, he has no shortage of money.

154
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,039
Be it high-end cars or land,

155
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,919
he lives a life of complete luxury.  In fact, a

156
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,199
BJP MLA claimed that Valmik

157
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,280
owns property worth more than ₹100 crore in Pune alone.

158
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,400
Now

159
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,720
how did Valmiki earn so much money?  And this is the recovery that

160
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,599
Valmik was doing when he called Avada Energy

161
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,280
and said give me ₹ crores or

162
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,599
else I will shut down your project.  On

163
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,840
May 28, 2024, at 11:00 am, the

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,720
project manager of Avaada Energy company was

165
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,520
kidnapped by Valmiki's men.  The

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,800
project manager did

167
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:24,080
lodge a complaint but the situation went from bad to worse.  A

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:28,080
few months later, on August 28 at

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,280
5:00 pm, the project manager

170
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,160
received a call from Valmiki.

171
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Hey, I know your work is going on over there.   Either

172
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,520
you come and meet me here in Parley or

173
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,599
stop all your work.  So the

174
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
land acquisition manager of the company

175
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,560
tells Valmiki on the phone that I will come to meet you.

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,199
After 15 days, another call

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,720
comes from Valmiki and he repeats that you

178
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,599
come to meet me in my office.  On October 8, the

179
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,120
land acquisition manager of Shivaji Company

180
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,759
finally goes to meet Valmik.

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,759
what?  Should you tell my demand

182
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,759
to your seniors or not?  If you want to continue the work here then you will

183
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,000

184
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,160
have to give me Rs. 1 crore right now.  Otherwise all work will have to be stopped

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
in Beed.  If you are not able to do it then

186
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,280
give me the number of your senior.  But now these

187
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,879
threats have not stopped.

188
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,599
On November 29, one of Valmiki's goons

189
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,080
calls the company back and says that

190
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,800
Anna wants to talk to you.  Then at

191
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,919
1:00 pm that day, one of Valmiki’s

192
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,399
men named Sudarshan reaches the site of Avaada Energy.

193
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,399

194
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:44,000
Sudarshan is a 26 years old local goon

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
in Valmiki's team and everyone in the area

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
knows that Sudarshan basically does Valmiki's

197
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,240
dirty work.  hey did you talk to Anna

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,720
?  Hey, why do you want to create unnecessary trouble?

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,800
I have come here for only one thing.

200
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Anna has told Bhim to stop all this work.

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,440
Ok.  Last time I

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,760
stopped your work.  You guys had

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,240
complained against me, right?

204
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Anna just came to know about all this.  Hey, he has gone crazy.

205
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,160
Right now I know that your

206
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
work is going on at four or five more places.  Hey my whole

207
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,480
family, I will go straight to Anna now.

208
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Anna has the

209
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,120
account of your minutes.  Now you see

210
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,080
what you have to do with Anna's demands

211
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
?  Shivaji who is the land acquisition manager of the company.

212
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
He

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,959
also gave a statement to the police regarding this incident that

214
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,600
Sudarshan had told me to

215
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,480
go and meet Valmiki.  If I had not done this the

216
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,880
company's business would have stopped.

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,800
And I would also get threats about my life.

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Sudarshan again threatens that today

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,720
you will have to meet Valmiki.  So

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,959
out of fear, Shivaji goes to

221
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,080
meet Valmiki at 2:00 in the afternoon.  And here

222
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,120
Valmiki asks him,

223
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,680
what happened to what I told you?  Shivaji says

224
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
that whatever Valmiki told him, he has

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,800
informed his seniors and he will

226
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,000
remind them.  Now despite all these things the

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,360
threats did not stop but the company

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,920
refused to pay ₹ crores.  Then on December 6,

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Shivaji gets a call.  Sudarshan is on the line

230
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
who asks if Shivaji is

231
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,600
in the office?  Then after a few hours a black

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,760
Scorpio car MA 44

233
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,480
z93 arrives outside the company gate.

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,200
Sudarshan and his three men are inside the car.

235
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
One of the men asks the security guard to

236
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
open the company gate.   The

237
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,120
security guard says that you let me talk

238
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,760
to an officer of a company and I will

239
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,600
open the gate for you.  Sudarshan then

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,760
threatens the guard and says I am Sudarshan Gore.

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
Do you have the guts to stop me?

242
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Your mother’s.

243
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,760
Sudarshan and his men then get out of the car

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
and

245
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,680
break the gate and enter inside.  As a

246
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,279
security guard tries to stop them,

247
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,079
one of Sudarshan's men takes a stick and

248
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,399
starts beating him.  When other guards

249
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,200
try to help, the goons

250
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,320
beat them up too and threaten to

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,200

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,160
kill them if they interfere in their case.  Hearing this fight,

253
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,920
Shivaji reaches the gate.  Sudarshan

254
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,079
abuses him a lot and says, hey

255
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,800
either give me two shops or close down

256
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,320
your company Vinni.  At the same time,

257
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,760
an official of the company

258
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,399
calls Santosh Deshmukh, the Sarpanch of Masajok village to ask what is happening in the company.

259
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399

260
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,440
Santosh Patil Rao Deshmukh was

261
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,440
a sarpanch of Massajok village in B District.   A

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,800
 

263
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,519
married man with two children, he was

264
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,760
involved in village politics since 2013.   In

265
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,880
fact his family has been involved

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,640
in the village for a long time.  His wife also

267
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,279
became Sarpanch in 2017 and after 5 years, he himself became Sarpanch.

268
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,680
Between 2017 and 24, his village

269
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,639
also received 19 awards for development.

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,200
Like, he got the award for the best water supply

271
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,760
and sanitation system in Marathwada, which is a

272
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,800
very big thing because in the Marathwada region, there is

273
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,760
less rainfall due to which water is

274
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,639
like gold.  Veteran politicians like Sharad Pawar

275
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,560
also praised Santosh.  By

276
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,040
saying that he is a

277
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,320
representative who does not get involved in controversies

278
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,320
but works hard for his society.

279
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,800
That is why when Avadha's

280
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
security guard called the Sarpanch and informed him that there was some

281
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,440
trouble here.  Immediately the Sarpanch

282
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,399
arrives there with some villagers and he

283
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,880
tells Sudarshan not to close the company.

284
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,519
People are getting jobs.  Otherwise,

285
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,120
how will they manage their expenses?  Sudarshan

286
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,279
then shouts back at the Sarpanch.  Hey Sarpanch,

287
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,160
we will deal with you, we will

288
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,560
not leave you alive, you bastard. But the Sarpanch tells Shivaji and the

289
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,760
other people of Abaddha that you do

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,079
n't worry, if anyone threatens you then I will help you. The

291
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,079
 

292
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,560
same evening, an FIR is filed against Sudarshan and his men for

293
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,959
scuffling with the security guards.

294
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,200

295
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:20,160
Within a few hours, Valmiki's men like

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,639
Sudarshan are taken into custody.

297
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,519
And he gets the belt immediately.  Now at this

298
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,480
time Valmiki's men keep calling the Sarpanch and saying

299
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,200
see this matter is mine.

300
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,279
Don't get involved in this matter otherwise you might even lose your life.  The

301
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,480
 

302
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,480
Sarpanch is scared.

303
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:44,480
And he also tells his brother, daughter and wife

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,760
about this fear.  His wife

305
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,320
says my husband is very scared.  Due to this fear,

306
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,959
he is living in Latur, 2 hours away from Massage Jok.

307
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,279
When Sudarshan

308
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,360
realises that Awada Energy is

309
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,760
not fulfilling the demand of Rs 2 crore and

310
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,320
now even the Sarpanch is supporting them,

311
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,279
then he goes to Valmiki.  Valmiki

312
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,760
tells him that if this continues, no

313
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,480
company will pay weekly to itself.  From now on,

314
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,320
whoever comes between them is

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,800
sure to be murdered.  Come on, start working.  Yes,

316
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,760
talk to Vishnu, he will assist

317
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,639
you.  So the next day Sudarshan meets

318
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,040
with some of Valmiki's men at a nearby hotel.

319
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,000
He tells them about the instructions given by Valmiki

320
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,160
and says that if the

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,199
Sarpanch comes back to Awada then Talab Tadashik.

322
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,839
Everyone should know what the consequences of fighting with us are.

323
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,720
Next day on 9th October the Sarpanch

324
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,279
and his maternal uncle's son are

325
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,680
going to their village Massa Jok in a Tata Indigo car.  As soon as

326
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,639
they cross a toll gate,

327
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,120
 

328
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,240
a black Scorpio immediately blocks their way.

329
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,519
Uncle's son Shivraj knows

330
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,760
that this car belongs to local goon Sudarshan.  The

331
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,519
goons throw the Sarpanch out,

332
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,760

333
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,040
put him in their Scorpio car and head towards Catch in the Beat District.

334
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Shivraj immediately gets scared and

335
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,839

336
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,839
files an FIR against seven men for kidnapping the Sarpanch.

337
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,760
They reach Ganga Mauli Sugar Mill

338
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,720
in a desolate area located 14km from Massa Jok.  It

339
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,000
is far away.  He throws the Sarpanch out

340
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and starts beating him with an iron rod and gas pipe.

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,399
Where a man continuously

342
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,000
beats the Sarpanch.  The second one holds the Sarpanch's mouth and

343
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,920
forces him to speak.  Everyone's

344
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,199
father is Sudarshan Gude.  Then he urinates on the Sarpanch's face.

345
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,160

346
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,120
They take off his clothes, pull his hair

347
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,240
and keep beating him.  Blood starts flowing from his body,

348
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,880
but the goons cannot hear the Sarpanch's screams.

349
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,199

350
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,920
And all these photos that you are seeing on your screen are

351
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,880
taken from the charge sheet only.   The

352
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,839
goons are recording this entire fight.

353
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,240
Then after beating him they pick up that Sarpanch.  They

354
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,360
put it in a Scorpio and

355
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,079
threw it away from the village at 6:30 in the evening.

356
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,639
Now, ever since Shivraj Sarpanch's maternal uncle's

357
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,880
son filed the FIR, the

358
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,680
police have been searching for the Sarpanch.  But they do

359
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,639
n’t get them.  But suddenly they

360
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,360
get a tip and within a few minutes the police

361
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,560
immediately reaches the location and

362
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,519
finds the unconscious body of the Sarpanch.

363
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,120
He is immediately taken to the sub-district hospital of Catch

364
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,040
but the doctor declares him dead.  It is

365
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120

366
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,839
written in the post-mortem that his

367
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,720
body was completely cold.  Which means that it had been a

368
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,560
long time since his death.  The

369
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,519
injury marks on the body clearly

370
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,519
show that he has been physically assaulted.   It is

371
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,959
written in the post mortem that

372
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,439
due to multiple injuries, haemorrhage and shock occurred

373
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
which led to his death.  Then the

374
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,959
police starts its investigation.

375
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,520
First of all, two 21 year old young men who are

376
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,400
Valmiki's men are arrested.  On the

377
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,120
same day, the police also seize the black Scorpio

378
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,079
car that was used for the entire incident.

379
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,880
But there is no news about the main actors

380
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,760
Valmiki and Sudarshan.

381
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,240
Now during this other

382
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,160
men of Valmiki get arrested when police conduct

383
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,280
several raids in Nashik, Aurangabad and Pune.

384
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,080
Finally on 21 December Valmiki surrenders in Pune.

385
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,080

386
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,000
Now Valmiki is first arrested in a bus extortion case.

387
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
But

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,919
during the investigation a secret witness

389
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,559
tells the police that Valmiki is the mastermind behind this entire thing.

390
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,600
Witness says that if the

391
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,640
recovery money was not paid, Valmik would have not only

392
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
beaten the people but also killed them.   The

393
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,600
second witness tells the police that

394
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Valmiki is the strongman here and this whole

395
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,720
district is his jungle.  Any company that

396
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,600
works in this district pays

397
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,320
extortion money to one or the other Valmiki gang.  After

398
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,120
obtaining all this information the

399
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,840
police finally files a murder case

400
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,480
against Valmiki.  But after a month

401
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,200
Sudarshan is also arrested.

402
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Sudarshan Ghule, accused in the murder of Santosh Deshmukh,

403
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,720
confessed to the police.  On February 17, Masazo

404
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,360
villagers threatened to go

405
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840
on a hunger strike if the case was

406
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,160
not solved.  The murder of a Sarpanch again

407
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,720
becomes a big headline in Maharashtra.

408
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,080
Because Valmiki

409
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
is a special man of Maharashtra Minister Dhananjay Munde.

410
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,640
Opposition parties say that

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Dhananjay Munde will have to resign while this investigation is going on.

412
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,799
Finally on March 4th,

413
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,600
Dhananjay Munde submits his resignation.

414
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,919
Cabinet Minister Dhananjay Munde has

415
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,000
submitted his resignation.  Maharashtra CM

416
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,320
Devendra Fadnavis announced this some time ago.

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,960
Fadnavis has accepted Munde's

418
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,360
resignation.  He is

419
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,080
still an MLA but not in any ministerial post.

420
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,160
Kalidas Sapet, a

421
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,799
senior leader of a farmer union in Maharashtra,

422
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,200
says that Dhananjay is so powerful that no

423
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,320
one wants to speak against him.  His

424
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,880
extortion gangs have been operating in Beed for about a year.

425
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,600
But one thing is certain that

426
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,320
after the murder of the Sarpanch, the caste politics of Beed

427
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,960
came to the fore.  Valmiki Karad and Dhananjay Munde

428
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,160
both belong to the Banjari community.  An OBC

429
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,880
group while the Sarpanch is from the Maratha community which is

430
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,039
politically powerful and is considered upper caste.

431
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
Both the communities have been

432
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,520
living in Beed for many centuries.  But this case

433
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,160
showed the divide among communities.

434
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,600
Even many police officers

435
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,080
removed their surnames from their nameplates so that people

436
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,080
could trust them.  An interview with a resident of Beed

437
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,559
shows that our society has become

438
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,120
polarised.  When I invited a friend

439
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,760
to a tea shop, he refused to come there

440
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,640
saying that the shop belonged to

441
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,440
people from another community.  If we

442
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240
talk about the case, cases were registered against Valmiki Karad and many of his

443
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,640
associates due to the three FIRs.

444
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,400
One of these cases is under Maharashtra

445
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,039
Control of Organised Crime Act (

446
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,440
MCOCA) which is a very serious and non-

447
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,080
bailable offence.  For this reason, he

448
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,400
is still in custody.  The next hearing of the case will be on

449
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,159
April 24.  The Sarpanch's family has

450
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,039
requested that this case be fast

451
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,679
tracked.  The Sarpanch's brother said that

452
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,240
we want justice.

453
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,880
This case can be settled in 6 to 7 months in the fast track court.

454
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,080
Therefore, we demand an application to the Exact Track Court through the CID.

455
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,799

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,960
Recently a new TV series Khaki has come

457
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,960
where a police officer takes charge in a new police station.

458
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,440
He was told that there is

459
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,559
a very dangerous goon in the area.

460
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,039
Chandan Mahato, it is his responsibility to

461
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,840
control him.  Chandan Mahato is a big

462
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,480
gangster who runs many extortion businesses.

463
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,760
As soon as the officer arrives at the post on his first day,

464
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,840
his subordinates serve him a mutton dish.  The

465
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
officer gets very impressed

466
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,400
and tells his colleagues, “This is an amazing

467
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,159
scene, friend.”  How much is meat per kg

468
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,960
here?  Then a subordinate of the

469
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,720
officer replies that who knows, big boss, I never

470
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,760
bought it.  So how do we know the price

471
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,840
?  That bhaiya ji sends us 2 kilos of mutton,

472
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,679
fish and chicken every day.  Who bhaiya

473
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,799
ji?  Chandan Mahato brother Chandan Mahato who is the

474
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,679
gangster of the area is the one who is feeding mutton to the police

475
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,559
and this is the story of our country, those who are the

476
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,880
protectors of justice are the ones eating the salt of the goons.   The

477
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,280
story that I told you in the last 15-20 minutes is not

478
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,760
just the story of a Sarpanch and a goon

479
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,240
but it is the story of our government.

480
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,480
And when you look carefully, you will find this same

481
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,039
pattern in many corners of the country.  Be

482
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,520
it the case of Aati Ahmed or

483
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,520
Valmiki Karad.  These people

484
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,760
are actually entrepreneurs.  Wherever he

485
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,440
gets an opportunity, he jumps at it.

486
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,440
But why are they getting this opportunity

487
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,679
?  Because the government is not doing its job.

488
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,440

489
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,760
Despite being convicted of murder in Bihar's Siwan district, Mohammad

490
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,480
Shabuddin ran his empire from inside the jail.

491
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,120
He had a room inside the jail

492
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,520
where he used to hold meetings and

493
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,919
resolve people's disputes.  why?  Because people

494
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,400
neither trusted the police nor the courts.

495
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,039
Because of this he will go to Baahubali only.

496
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,919
And that is why Atiq Ahmed's supporters used to say

497
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,080
that he is definitely a goon but he is our goon.

498
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,320
At least he will listen to us.  He

499
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,480
will do our work.  What about the police and the courts

500
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,400
?  What is the definition of government?

501
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,559
Is Valmik Karad Govt?   The

502
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,960
definition of government in political science is

503
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,280
any organization that has a

504
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
monopoly on violence and collecting

505
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,760
taxes.  So Valmiki is not Karad Government

506
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,480
but he is running a parallel government

507
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,960
because he is demanding recovery of Rs. 100 crores

508
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,280
from the companies of Maharashtra which is a

509
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,840
clear example of state failure when

510
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,559
security guards are beaten up.  Companies are

511
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,720
threatened and the Panchayat leader is

512
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,200
killed.  Political scientist Milan

513
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,840
Vaishnav has written in his book that the

514
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,159
Bahubali's will definitely seem like criminals to you and me

515
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,000
but many locals do

516
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,480
not consider them criminals because they are getting the

517
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,200
work of the locals done and to get all their work done they are

518
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,440
also extorting money from other businesses

519
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,919
and if any person

520
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,240
raises a question on their empire then they kill him.

521
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,480
These people are not outsiders

522
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,640
but they are part of the system and they

523
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,200
also support the political system.   The

524
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,520
logic is very simple.  Political parties

525
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
need money and muscle and these

526
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,159
strongmen leaders can give both to the parties.

527
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
Politicians don't tolerate them, in fact

528
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,960
they need such people and

529
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,159
if we want to end this system then

530
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,720
basically our government needs to invest in judiciary and police

531
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,440
so that people do
