I know that this A lot of people get to know through podcasts A chance to learn practical things will get. but at the same time too much You will find peace from this conversation. so thank you You for being in the studio. It is very interesting start because usually I've been told ah the exact opposite. Ah, even if it's the interview world It is said that sitting in front of you Sir, one So, they become restless. Secondly I also constantly It seems to make people a bit restless It is more important to get it done. so for a change you are telling me this about me that I will give you peace. So thank you. thank you You for saying it. yes, you have a hidden side Now people will see it. How are you all? uh i I am fine. I'm learning things and You said that in conversations with you outside, there were many all the things that you normally do when you When you turn 50, your ego starts to take over you. She is stopping that from a 32 year old person There is nothing to learn. but i learned a lot In this conversation. so yes i am looking Forward to the hole. now it's my turn to Learn. yes yes yes Let's start with practicality. Wood You say that confidence is the most important thing in Any industry in any job profile and is it's other aspects and this is why I tell you I am asking because obviously a you are known for taking interview sir but in My eyes are a little psychologically sensitive to you guys you just scan it and that is the actual Craft That You're Getting Better at Even Today I am right to set, which means I am trying I have been and it is true that when you, for example, I'm talking to you right now or just a little bit I was talking to you a while ago, I When I meet a person who If interviews are involved then I would like to introduce the person to I read it almost like I read a book She goes. There are mistakes in reading this book too May be possible. So there is no such claim That whatever I read is exactly like that. But it is definitely, as you said, a Craft is a skill. There is a skill that When you meet people regularly, you could see the ratio of that personality of his Are. As far as we are concerned this is a matter of confidence It depends on where you look What do you call confidence? What Confidence simply means that who Can speak the loudest. Who is the most Can scream louder or show more confidence It just means that I have it inside me I feel proud that I am the only one who is right. then no Such confidence which neither leads to success nor Neither job nor life is the best thing for them Not there. Is it okay? When we are confident to understand it in a slightly nuanced manner Let's try. when it simply means that That you don't look down on yourself. feeling completely sorry for oneself or Don't be filled with self-pity. If Confidence means that definitely Confidence helps, it helps. But the world will be more beautiful. If we take this from binary viewpoints of sorts Don't look. Do not look at it like that, there are some people who are full of confidence and some people who are filled with helplessness. Because Many things are also situational. What How do you behave in the situation? That is ultimately the test of your character Is. We are wow. Ok. Firstly I would say that I would like that social media This generation has come to think of judging people The capacity has increased a lot. yes it is Being rewarded unfortunately. Judging Others Human beings are being rewarded. yes, That's what the sad part is. it is Making everybody more judgemental. in the 90s it It wasn’t true, was it? Less to Less Extent It Habitat. Not to this extent. Ok. and you See the increase of judgement. Hazli Hazli It There is enough social media and there is one reason for this It has increased since. But as I said in society The thing that will be rewarded by the society it will become the nature of the thing to Will start imbibing more. him more To see. In our time, I had this problem even till 90's I know that hate was something that could be Incentivisation was not given. who has bad It was seen with eyes. Is it okay? So they Even the people who had hatred inside them, their I was forced to hide that hatred a little bit let's go. It felt the same way about many other things come into force. Being judgemental is part of that It comes out. when you look at things people It is not just for the people. my worry is More than people. communities, groups to groups, identities, nationalities To. When you see these people and say It is not so, this is what it takes to be judgemental, Where does it ultimately come from? just think about it Look at this. Think on the level of psychology But it will come out clear. being judgemental comes It is because of our intellectual laziness. it is always Intellectual laziness means that our Humans want to do intellectual rigging He is a bit lazy by nature. If he finds a way in which that it will take a little less effort and you will have no time to go there There is another way in which a little If it takes more hard work then most of the time it Chooses the path that requires less effort. this man It is in the nature to conserve energy. it It happens at the mental level as well. when we Let's look at the stereotypes when we give Let us look at the decisions that have been made, which are based on decisions already made have been given and we say this way If we walk with this we don't have to work hard Will need it. This person is coming. its beard is it visible or its turban is visible It has been happening. It means this is what it means. Because their community is like this. How much It became easy, right? Life is sorted. To you Judges Judgments have been served and you only They have to be implemented. on people like this This intellectual laziness is what affects such people. it's worth it to be judgemental because it It's just like pronunciation in a language Pronouns are used more The value of noun is less because for noun you should know okay you should know This should be Ranveer and in his place Say he is a human being, now if he is a human being then it will be easy I went and showed my two hands, two legs and two eyes the person is gone the matter is over so the pronunciation which are pronouns are always easier So it is always easy to be judgemental We are judgemental because we suffer from intellectual laziness. Reasons to avoid doing intellectual work Basically if we are more involved in your life You have free time, you are more judgemental You will go. Not one, that is also one thing. That's why it is very important to stay busy If you become too judgemental There is no self harm factor here The form is formed because you judge yourself as well You start doing it. Ok. In fact, I alone I have learnt something but I have not learnt to judge. Anj Learn to do and learn to un-judge that is more difficult because you Know your bias. You need your Biases are knowing your prejudices. His Despite this, there is no one who is one's own groom. We all have biases. Is it okay? There will definitely be prejudices. This which You have prejudices even when you know them those prejudices in front of you Someone who is supposed to be there comes and you say that I know I have this prejudice But still, I won't judge it. it takes a lot of debt and also a lot As said in all this, a lot of intellectual labour is involved. There is a need also. Being Judgmental Is In Due course by default. Being Unjustified is always conscious. There is more to talk about. Consciously Undoing the Judgment in Your Own Mind. But before we talk about it It is a very simple question sir. Somebody 22 years old What will a person gain from this whole point? For one's own practical life, for one's own For career. Look, what happens is that Where do our voices come from? Our Just like we said that through that socialization We will come and we will come from our comfort zone. You Are you able to understand? This is a comfort zone. You Born as a man. you are a bengali Like, you were born a Punjabi. Correct Isn't it? In what particular way were you born happened? Because of that you have a comfort zone Is. and you want to be in that comfort zone Because as I said that we all are from nature They are lazy. So out of the comfort zone It will take effort to get out. go to a place like this Which will be a place of discomfort. Example Let us understand from this. Suppose any IIT Bombay is a nice place. Top IIT is the country Of. People from all over the country come to IIT Bombay Let's try. Let's assume Actius let's assume in the sense that let's assume Is there any child from Azamgarh? he worked hard I cracked IIT JEE and Advanced He did it and reached IIT Bombay. In that, let's assume it to be mechanical I got engineering. Now just think about it He comes here and says that he is from Azamgarh I want children. Was in Azamgarh. from Azamgarh He knows the language of children. their same He has that mindset. Everything is there. What is his comfort zone? from Azamgarh Children. Even if he comes to IIT Bombay Because he tells other people a particular judges in a manner. So, choose according to your comfort Tries to stay in the zone. Will He Ever be able to actually learn? No. I am 20 I am telling this for a 22 year old kid. 202 year old children when out of this judgemental When this child from Azamgarh comes here To the people of Mumbai, to the people of Gujarat The people of Kashmir live with them instead If you search for the children of Azamgarh then He is challenging himself. Your bias is challenging the . to your presages He is challenging. to be judgemental of yourself He is challenging. and she gives him her in return what are you getting? give him a Diversity is being achieved. this diversity Hazily Contributes to Her Personality will do it. In Other Words Judgment 22 years old I am saying this for the child. Right now I am very I am not giving any deep thoughts. 22 year olds for or 20 years old child non Being judgemental is fighting that battle with yourself in which he is out of his comfort zone He learns to come. Because being judgemental Have to be in the comfort zone. not be judgemental The comfort zone has to be breached. going out Is. I have to go to a place where you feel uncomfortable. Then I have done a Geography but this matter It does not apply only to geography. If You are comfortable only with boys. But there are girls in your group, Are speakers of another language. Second There are people with different sexual preferences. Second They are people of nationality. people of other religions Are. There are people of other castes. So what? You have a diverse peer group. every Interacting with one will be teaching you. Just like if you have a thousand podcasts For all these years, everyone has given you something He taught me because he was different from you. It was different from you. If you say no I I am Ranveer and I am Ranveer's podcast I will do it. You having only people like you agreeing on everything with you will you be able to Learn? No you will be able to learn a little. This is what I called Disarrayments Lead To the depths. Yes. Essentially Not Just Disagreement. Every situation is different from your own, Every situation that is different from your comfort zone Teaches you. makes you a better person Is. And the most important thing is that it's inside you It brings maturity. the maturity you It teaches that a person should Don't judge a book by its cover. Don't judge a person by his appearance Do it. on the basis of his language, his religion, his caste or any of his identity Don't judge on that basis. Where will this come from? it it will come when you are ready for it from the inside that you are out of your comfort zone The easiest intellectual ever to come Laziness' way was to judge someone If it is a boy then it will be like this, if it is a girl then it will be like this If it comes from LGBTQ then it will be like this etc etc what does this mean for you Coming out of the comfort zone that's the key thing And you should not be unjudgmental or judgmental. Actually this is what it teaches, keep in mind this is easy is not the way because you constantly have to We have to fight prejudice. Therefore your Give yourself enough space so that you can make mistakes do. We are not the ones that you are in life Will always be politically correct. I am not Constantly turning this whole conversation into a Scanning from a college student's perspective I have been. sir what is why i am about To say what I'm about to say. Firstly I would like every listener, if possible, to Nor should you carry a notebook. a pen and paper You should take it and yourself Five to 10 self-identifications To list out the points. Right great. I Do it as an exercise in the classroom. I believe that throughout life, every three or four You should do this for yourself once in a while. Two Just see how you ideally every year. every year You keep growing. In Your 20s Having a Mirror is also an ancient skill. Right? I am saying this because when I I was 22 years old before YouTube, I was into fitness I used to train and did fitness training I used a 100 lbs. battery for a month before starting In a relative's engineering factory Work done. Good. Learned a lot there. Very something about life ahh engineering No blue collar person has such skills I can understand. That was my big learning that Friend, if he has an engineering degree If you understand engineering without taking it then that means Very high level skills can also be learned Very easily. it is I mean I know I am Interrupting here. But if I my If I start with life, then my life A lot of learnings in the same way Maybe the audience might not even know. I I teach literature at the university. But before that I studied engineering and I came after studying electrical engineering. so I worked in a factory like you said I did an engineering course in a factory Worked as an engineer. yes and there But I had a workforce of around 20-25 There was a small factory of people In which these people used to make press. Joe Light They used to make weight iron. in 2025 Those three months spent with the workers I worked in this factory Was. I learned from every single one of them And surprisingly, I learned such things. about which you neither have any Actually, she was teaching you engineering, right? The society was teaching. Because you have in mind So there was prejudice, right? For example, all of us The world used to believe this. I give you a I am telling the story. That will make sense. It was always taught that you should give your worker Throw money and they will do more work. Big It was a simple thing and hence it was normal The pattern was that you counted the pieces at the end Will go. How many have you made and based on that But you will get wedges. and I thought that if You can say that you make 100 at one place Make it 150. If you get it, production will increase Should go. and i realise it doesnt work Like that. I was very surprised. I Said friend you have been told that if you score 150 If you make it then let's say you have ₹1000 right now If you get it then you will get 1500. then you Why are you not doing it? all quiet. Then I Tried to identify. So a worker Whose name was Jiyalal. Jiyalal Used To be kind of a leader of that. of the leader Meaning, understand a little about the union value Take it, if they needed it then they would He used to come to us. Sir, do this work. I Jiyal was called and asked from jail What is the reason for working? she gave me a Gave the message of a wonderful life. he said sir If I say that our The team will make 150 irons daily. It's price Three people lost their jobs in paying the bills will go. because in fact what has happened in the last 20 years My understanding tells me this. right now You need 1500 Iron. But the truth is this that the lean season will come and in the lean season we So you must be making it with the same practice. So The owner will find it easiest to choose three of these Fire the people. of those three people To save jobs it is important that we work at the same pace as we do Are. I will definitely keep it to the minimum. I said But why are you thinking so much about it now? And this will make your life better. Then He told another truth. he said sir you Give me 1000 or 1500. this country The life of a laborer is going to be like this I will go and sleep in a slum and go to the railway There was a line. There across the railway line I will go and go to the toilet every morning. Ok? And I will come back. my life ₹500 It will not change from. effectively what i said Is what I learned in management wasn't Functioning in the factory. it wasn't Functioning in the factory. and my judgement about the poor people that they have little money Give it. Now he will do anything. compared to him I am probably from middle class and upper class The person must be strangling his neighbor's friend He will survive in the competition. that person to those There are three unnamed people who are worried about I don't even know yet who will take it out We will know that if we adopt this strategy Then we will be expelled. it changed my Perspective a lot. Human Dynamics Exactly. I learnt it let a lot in Human Relations Approach to Management They say etcetera etcetera. but i learned It's from a Jiyalal. we who was never been to school at all and actually not if This HR skill of yours tells people If this skill is strong then it is always possible to manage Pay off in your career it's as I said it is All About Getting Work Done I am a little bit I would like to say things definitely this is a 32 Year old is perspective and please add to it if you feel that something is missing From my formula I meet many people I have met through the show and met some great people yes, I have noticed some commonalities There are so many successful people in any industry It can be cricket, it can be Bollywood, whatever One commonality among those businesses is that A in some perspective of his craft he He is a specialist. they don't have to be great at all aspects of their craft but they Are usually the best at one aspect. it This is the basis of growth. Basis of career growth. In second place is self-confidence. Self belief or confidence that you're going for it Etc. Here I am talking about execution. I did not stay either, because I believe that Execution hard work is a very base level thing Is. This must happen. This has to be it Needed Meaning this is not their place. This is a must. other than that you are different What qualities can you bring to this? Yes. So first and foremost that specialist In One Aspect of Craft. Seconds Confidence. But a third one is very underrated The factor is that of maturity. and this is you Actually can't work on it. I Feel There are ways to improve it but it's time It is a gift. and it really adds an To edge your career in the long term. Very There are all these people who actually attain maturity. I never chase anyone. Age N Time Mill It goes into the hands. The hands get the edge But I don't get maturity. Perhaps their because of the people around them, maybe Whatever your priorities are in life, Because of priorities, maybe Because of distractions. Butt Maturity There is a very big X factor in careers. I feel that when something big happens in your life Maturity even when accidents happen There is an increase. From Wrigley. butt what are you What would you like to say about my algorithm? In? usually what you said isn't it time It is something that comes with time. In the country How many 32 year olds can understand this? you could say it, you could feel it, or You must have understood. Just try to understand this Let's try. This is what you have collected hundreds of I've got podcasts from you wonderful people meet constantly Are. This gave you the idea of ​​how to do that algorithm. that inside you This understanding was able to create this vision that you could see that there is such a thing as maturity which That it can only come from this type of contact. This can come only from this companionship. That means someone else what did he do in his life? you from him Keep a dog to learn from, not yourself every time You need those accidents in your life that you will be able to learn. where is this coming from Is? This comes from the fact that your There is that maturity inside you to know that For experience and ability to learn every time It is not necessary to go through the tragedy yourself. However, despite that, there are some difficulties in life Tragedies are bound to happen. There will be a couple of crises Whatever I will teach, and that too at my own pace Will come. If you are more popular. If If you work hard then more Will come. But that is a different matter. main The point is whether you care about other people's lives Are you ready to learn from experience or not? Like you have taken hundreds of podcasts. I I have also met those students regularly Those who give interview, clear the mains Yes, he comes for interview. ah i think That's what I learned from them. I I often give this example. I don't Find out if you will be able to connect it or not. But suppose if you look at this table. This is a wooden replica of this table. Correct Isn't it? Cut some stems horizontally Gaya is its replica and it has lines which is visible in If You Remember So what are these tree rings of every tree? The tree rings and I've been talking about it a lot as a metaphor and as a How does it come inside him like life Think about tree rings and see the life of that tree what happened in that tree ring came which Had I ever studied even a little biology or botany? He had read that every year a tree The ring comes and after a whole year has passed its A layer forms on the stem which Later, if it is cut like this, then It will come like a tree. Now just give it a little Think seriously about maturity It will immediately unfold itself. this which Treeing is one year treeing, suppose It has 50 treeings so it means tree The age of the crypt is 50 years. yes its every Treeing represents a year. and that Any good botanist can tell by looking at the trees It is possible that this tree will be cut this year What all I had to endure. wow did the flood come or not I? Is it okay? Was there a drought? Fertilizer Did you get it or not? or somebody somewhere Did you not get any illness? All of this is recorded It will happen in that one year of treeing. Right? And year after year they will continue to grow into trees. If You are a good reader of these trees. You can read the 50 years personality of this Tree. Provided you are a good reader. To you Must be a good read. then you You can read and understand what that tree has suffered Everything can contribute to your life Is. And this is what maturity is Being non judgemental that year this tree Why is it thin? Oh brother, that year it dried up It was lying there. Water not available, nutrition not available That's why this happened. in this tree this one Why did this lump appear on the tree? Illness had arrived. The tree was fighting disease. That's why it appeared inside him. As such It will happen with humans. brother Ranveer's This lump is visible in the personality. Why did you come? Or I could be judgemental Or it is Ranveer's life too. very bad man Is. He is a good man. whichever one or the other The way could be that I am non judgemental. Because I know that every person Our personalities also have rings That which is visible. so i will look at and should I say no this year or this month or In this part of life, a certain person This thing was true which was visible in his personality It has been happening. Because if you know this thing are able to read that a certain person's You will know what is in your personality What work can you do with it And which work is not wise to get done? Is. At the end of the day success is all about Getting work done. success is all about Getting Work Done. But the work isn't down to just that Execution. No it is not with art Have to do it. Not just to do with art. Execution: Maybe you created systems If you give it will happen. But originality Originality is the responsibility of the one who There is work. He is the only one who can bring it. You have your one Did the ideation. You made up an idea. and that Or it will remain only at the level of thought. Let's enjoy that too. honestly i this I do not believe that when all the ideas come down to earth They are useful only when they go. the moment when You created a joy came to you at that very moment. But when you see it in a tangible form, He has a different kick after execution Is. Whatever we have talked about and come feel it's very very useful for a young Professional. even if they don't understand It's on the surface level. These thoughts sit in their minds and turn into trees. I will go one day. that's what i feel which is why come back to that practical Exercise. because one of my aunts said this taught me that if you are 22 years old and you yourself don't know what to do in your career Have to do it. Or if you have five UPSC The attempts are over. Same Position lost but with Data Points. Ah I feel I should buy a paper. from five 10 self identification points of yourself You should write about personality. That I am this, I am this, I am this. at the same time Three such strengths should be written down once a day. That These three things probably made my career can move forward. When I was 22 years old, My three strengths that I listed out What he did was fitness and communication skills, and marketing. Marketing to me I understood that because there was a lot of marketing Had done all the internships. personality was good in college and was very fit and I also did a fitness course. So There was an understanding of fitness science. those three things I sat with the I thought about it and eventually I decided that yes Maybe I can become a fitness YouTuber. Correct Is. Started a fitness YouTube channel. There From became a fashion youtuber. Great. Fashion From YouTuber to podcaster again. Definitely have a nice journey. and podcaster After being made now we are going moving on to the Next stage. which will also be about Business YouTube. But that is the beginning It was done through paper. Ok? and this same paper, Notebook, This is what Penn is trying to highlight yes for the audience. that friend do this Do exercise. At the beginning of his career Write three or four strains of your own. But every year 10 selfies with a pen and paper Write down the identification points, especially the Negative things that make you feel embarrassed The things you judge by are your weaknesses Yourself about variant i think it's actually a life long process it is it is but it is not just that i mean there is a different version of it which i do in the class cool If we understand this properly by combining it with our He said that we have some weaknesses. Yes and we have some strengths. These Normally this is what we call corporates I do it too. Sort Analysis, Strength, weakness etc. butt of humans Sort analysis takes place. be technical It can. But I'll take it one step further I am going to ask. For the last 22 years I have been I am working on taking interviews. Mock Interviews in which people appear for main exam Let me clear it. then come in front of me Are. we people i mean in front of us They come and we take the interview. And Based on that, this is my understanding that if we understand from this principle who is successful Who succeeded and who did not? In between these Are the differences based only on individual traits? Are there differences? Differences in Individual Qualities Or is there a bigger difference than that? like you did I told you there are some things, that is the base. Like hard work is fine, hard work has to be done. No one will be successful without hard work. Ok No? Hard work, commitment and dedication is required. Correct Isn't it? and individual trades that occur Rest of the CF but is this a thing to be in itself is the differentiating factor. unfortunately no because all the people or most of the people You are keeping these trades, right? Brother I am preparing for UPSC I am coming to UPSC but this is not all Will be applicable on . to prepare for UPSC Every person knows that hard work is necessary Will have to do it. He is working hard for 810 hours Is. The commitment is already showing. away from home He is coming and staying here. The dedication is already showing. Dream He already has it. Is it okay? Everything is there. But unfortunately everyone has it. So any of these differentiating factors does not survive. hum because everybody is doing the Same thing. Every person is working hard. every The person is showing dedication. every person Showing commitment. Things like that. So what are the differentiating factors? one carefully and I will give this to the class I do exercise. I say that this is It is up to you whether you succeed or fail All these things are required in this. but this big These are minor variables in the equation. Unfortunately I am saying unfortunately. Unfortunately the major variables are in your hands Not there. What are those variables? that is What are your privileges? And your What are deprivations? Is it okay? where are you Were born? Which was your school? on your own The family you were born in What did dad do? who has them From what privileges were available? Which ones Were there resources? did you go to IIT or Changmal Went to inter college. All This Gonna Matter Because there are the social structure. so there our privileges and similarly they are Departures. This is what I say in class I exercise with my kids Identify your 10 identity markers. In the Same Way as You Say the Strength to Me Recognize. 10 Identity Markers You Know Which class do you come from? Financial The situation is yours. which area do you come from Are? What is your religion? your race Etc. etc. you can create your 10 identities Identify the markers. what is your language is it c? do you know english or not Is. Is it okay? marker and beyond Write whether he is privileged or He is deprived. let's have it in Categories only. Is it okay? Obviously I No it's a spectrum. but it is easy to Identify whether you are privileged or not So what is your language? So you say that You come from an English-speaking family Are. You are good in English. so you Are privileged. and you say no I only know Bhojpuri so you are Dipped. Right? You did not do this society has done it. But on the basis of this, just look at these Make a list of these 10. Out of these 10 In front of how many have you written P Privilege And how many have deprivation written in front of them? Count it. and then please work on each off It. if it is a privilege and I am Making a point here. if it is a Privilege then you have to work to Transients that privilege. You have to do this for your You have the privilege because you are a man I was born like this because I was born in a rich family because you need to go to an English school sent in etc etc then you have to do this in the next one year that you will get this We had received privileges and they have to be encroached upon. you have to go by this and if it deprives you, Deprivation is more than you have to work to Overcome this. Not always in your hand. so it will it take its going to be a long life Long project. Is it okay? our country In many cases I work my whole life Even after doing this, you can not use that privilege Can't complete the deprivation that you need Got it from birth. but still work on Dec. If you are able to work on these two things it is going to be more than Working on individual trades as you can. And this is how it works. Trust Me It Works. because i have seen this in my life It works. I'm sure I did that I have met students whose lives I work in. So I hope so that work in the life of many people Will do it. We have basically covered three exercises The list has been got out. First exercise three Put out the strength list. Right? by the force of But I want to make my own career. weaknesses then 10 these privileges or Deprivation points. Right? that where you from Have you come? Etsetra Etsetra. End Unfortunately, for some people, 10s Point depreciation occurred. yes here privilege Privilege happened here. and unfortunately both its a sad story both ways Trust me. This is the reality of India. yes this This is the reality of India. I am in my class I teach such girls. we are the class I do it. This is when I teach identity yes, this is the exercise of that paper. And I tell the students that you Tell me with your imagination in Vijay Chauhan's There is deprivation and there are privileges. and in Most points ahead of Vijay Chauhan Privilege is written there. I say you tell me when you compare yourself to me So you can feel that I had so many privileges. You How will we fight the battle? if it comes to fighting will come. Thankfully this is not a fight. I am so I am teaching them. This is an important I always think about this factor. that's why I This collective is more important than this individual because he asked for all these deprivations were not there. Now he has earned these privileges weren't there either. met most of the Privileges because 15-20 year olds I am talking about. to them which they have Those are privileges given by parents, family privileges given by the society Are. He did not do anything in that. Such deprivation is also not their fault. have been given to them. But they had to fight Such is the penetration. Stepping Away From Privilege It is also the same. what we talked about that judgement move away from. Yes. Right. if you are able to Unj You Are Able to Transcend Your Privilege YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS His absences were working behind him. This much There are more value adding podcasts. I don't No. I mean I am saying what I believe in. All the things I have not learned in the last 10 years I have learnt it. we are giving people in a podcast To. The exercise I was mentioning that exercise itself comes from a place of Privilege. it's no i didn't want to Say it in these many words. i didn't want to say in these many words that's why i Brother I was being polite here. But this is what When we look at this thing at the individual level Because that’s what management schools do. This is what management schools tell us because All the kids who have come before him are those who are 20 I have come after seeing the fees of Rs one lakh. So to them this It seems very easy to teach, look at you You have to see your strength to get the work done And they need to be sharpened even more. I Sometimes I say that whoever you consider as your strength I am saying once on the individual level please put your hand on his heart for a little while Find the source. for example i am Doing this exercise. you mentioned about Three things. You said about fitness. Right? the second thing you mentioned about your Communication and the third thing you mentioned. Marketing. Right? just be honest here how much of it is actually a product of your private all of it's 100% what i said about myself i mean there were some deviations in my initial life but most of the time now it is coming out of privilege so this matter is a little bit It also makes us honest and honest towards ourselves A little bit shouldn't be too much But it also makes you a little self critical It also teaches a little self-criticism. Own A little criticism. like you said no that you distance yourself a little bit Let's see, friend, the things that I have known till now I was assuming my earnings, a lot of them These things were not my earnings. I was given the Or it fell into my hands. to someone we not even found guilty of privilege Can. trust me i am very very It is clear to me that I cannot tell anyone now that brother you are rich and that is why you start Luthing. no privileges whatsoever is the way Deprivation from someone by giving application I did not take it. someone has the privilege because They too should not be judged. But if this You have your own privileges then you must work Should be done. I'm just telling them To transcend. Don't even want to leave it. Being mindful of your privileges is a Variant Step in Your Life. Self Awareness. Exactly. Two exercises talk Curry. To get the strength list out first. Second This is Privilege versus Deprivation Third Exercise: Self Identification Factors behind societal self Identification. Ok? Because the one who Exercise of Privilege Versus Deprivation Yes, they are all social. Right now this is mine The third list is this is from the perspective Of self improvement. Ok? then i would To divide it into two parts. may be the The first five are areas you can improve. No what else can I do? what are My actual weaknesses? This is very important At this stage. and the next five probably I don't know More Self-Identification Factors That You Can Know From what perspective do you view the world? own From what perspective do you look at life? Where Do you want to go? you know dreams dreams and aspirations if all these things are yours Are in front. It's a very strong mirror too Work from. Assuming that you are executing You are doing it, you are working hard etc. But Sir, I would like to ask you this now, please accept If there is a person who has that privilege Versus deprivation everywhere on the chart Deprivation or deprivation in many places Six out of 10 deprivation points or Even five out of 10 that person is third How to Approach the List of My Weaknesses and dreams and aspirations you rightly point out a predicament here There is a kind of irony here, an RNA Which needs to be understood. Yes. This exercise which I have told you many times that this exercise is also for you Exercises that come out of your privileges that if you assume that you have this I made a list of eight, nine or ten of them. If the privilege comes out then you are already on the elephant Went and boarded it. You are all over the world It has been happening. But like you said, there is no The person is mostly depressed. They How did you nurture your dreams? how does he fulfil his dreams try to do. So I have used this Talked about overcoming depreciation. You Society cannot be changed immediately. an ideal society In an ideal society such a situation does not arise Should have come. but our society also reproduces deprivations and It also reproduces privileges. It is very easy to understand. Did you understand it? Let's say your parents are very wealthy. There were persons. What to do? to our own child Will put you in school. This is their job, brother. What happened to being a parent? Privileges reproduce privileges Did. Same reproductiveism as deprivation It goes together as well. They are poor parents. Poor thing If you cannot send them to school or if you do will send him to some poor school where he And he might be learning less. Hence the major point There are two things. Forest Because this is not an ideal society. Ideal If there was a society then the poor child would also be in the same school The school where a rich man's child would be going I would have been going. So despite this poverty The impact of deprivation would be less because Reproduction would have been less but we are not Living in an Ideal Society. So a society like this in whichever you are, the child coming from depression are they or are they for them these deprivations a way to overcome So you need to start exercising. But secondly you also have to understand that You don't have to have the exact same dreams The compulsion you have with that person Who has constant privileges. this to this The way I say it is, Please do a reality check. Ouch. Ok? and try and start working on a The Incremental Thing. Ok? my language If I talk about it then I would say straight IAS Don't think of becoming one. Then if you have it It is not that you can tolerate five failures Can be done. Assume four failure tolerance You have to be there in the sixth attempt. Your You have the right to tolerate five failures There must be an ecosystem nearby. a thriving place The person coming from Five Failures can tolerate it. Five startups Can tolerate failure. five second Can tolerate failure. but you Can't do it. So what do you do? you again Do it incrementally. let's start with the SSC Preparation. Ok? now this is What I am saying is wrong. in a sense that In an ideal society such a situation should not arise A motivational speaker should have said this That you should dream small. I am saying that the People are saying always dream big. that is coming from certain privileges. You Start with your reality check. first thing because any dream can happen to individuals Have written whole papers on this. dreams and Aspirations are constructs There are. They are not objective. so The whole country has the same dreams But this is a scary thing. first of all you Made them stand at different places. Then all of the Take all the different dreams of the same person. That means that Everyone's starting point is different. or else I told you that this is everyone's target. Who Everybody knows he will win. I am one of life I would like to talk about the truth sir. Please do what Virat does for us in cricket It is Kohli. HARD WORK, Success, A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT A COBI BRAND There is a famous Nike ad which is actually their It is based on mentality. That’s basically what he’s saying there. and their Mentality is not known all over the world This is age Mamba mentality. because their The nickname was Black Mamba which was the name of a snake It happens. Right? because when you see them You will watch those basketball clips, right? Plays exactly like an aggressive snake. Play with a lot of concentration and dedication. And he was famous for his training regime. That means the discipline was of a very high level their. But the logic of his life was basic. That friend, you don't need to become a parent Not there. All you need is Betterment. That was a simple message from Nikki. don't worry About the long term. just try getting Better Everyday. Just get better. That's all. I I think this is somewhere, especially me I am looking around in my age group Many people are forgetting this. to Betterment leave it it's easier to get better through your 20h. I don't drive that much after 30 years In many cases, they get removed. come in many Let's go. See this also, two groups are being formed. The one who is chasing Betterment. Others Those who left Betterment with a little Is. This is what I observe. a butt please Correct me if I am wrong. so i feel that Even if you don't have privilege in your life Even then this logic will apply. Exactly it is a matter of getting better somewhere try that's what i said overcoming the This is what devolution of privileges means that and that's why i am saying be a better Person Than You Were Yesterday. Lived this many times. IATA change is 1% change. Suppose you are racing Reached the track and another one with you The person is standing. You said I will do this I will leave it behind to run. It is possible He's an Olympian. Is it okay? It is possible He might have given that thing 15 years ago. Maybe he has some other privilege. Don't compare yourself with that person. Compare yourself with you of yesterday. If you work for this much then you are disrespectful Your deprivations. You will be able to overcome Many many aspects of your depression. Brother, when I look at myself, I I see that yes I did and I am nothing I can do it. I cannot claim that I am the best teacher in the world. Country I am the best teacher. I claim this can't. I just more and more I can claim that last semester Like I taught it. I am trying to I can hope that I can meet him this semester I will teach better. Vijendra as a human being Chauhan comes out of the poverty that he faced Is. Vijendra Chauhan, a poor slum in Delhi It comes out from. On that basis I I have travelled something. i may not be on The Top of the World. Is it okay? I may not B and I don't intend to. But I have read that I have done the journey. journey is Morant Then Destination. There is another career factor. And I would love for you to break this down Career factor and what ever. and disagree with me. I call this factor ethical Messy behavior. Right? I will answer you. this people Also called street smarts. Don't hurt anyone's feelings, or anyone's career Do not hurt anyone in life Don’t bring a pen. Yet a little bit of bastardry is alive Keep it for your own protection. End A To move forward faster. Self To accelerate the career of. See if this If it is in your control then I don't think so Is there any problem in this? I am from an example If I tell you, maybe you will understand better I will come. You will now find out that About my privileges and deprivations What are my principles? On that basis I I often say one thing. I say that If and when you understand the reference to this You will understand. I say that if you of Uttar Pradesh, of Bihar, of Rajasthan Which is called Hindi region. many people This is called cow belt, cow dung strip Are. Many call it Hindi speaking states. whichever you Call it right. here are the boys coming from So I say that you should study hard to become an IAS. If it comes to your mind then Should be rejected. think again Needed has it come again or not Even if I want to become one, please reject me. Think about it for the third time. survives even after three times If it is there then become it. and here comes the second thing Which is about you. but if you are in this area She is a girl from and not in your mind I also want to become an IAS. but you have to leave home It is proposed that son Delhi Go and get ready. Grab it quickly. Now you can see that this makes sense I have the smartness that I'm saying if you are a boy then I am saying that This isn't yours at all. Someone else gave me the dream has given it. You are being sent forcibly. The family members need God. family members needs money. money as dowry to the family Needed The family members felt a kind of The word going around in the area is 'we want Bhaukaal'. That's why I am asking you to become an IAS. But if you are a girl and you have to face even more liars It is said that go son and prepare yourself Grab it immediately and that one next The smart thing is coming and the ethical thing is going It is a matter of cleverness. I say this Why? So if you go to Delhi they prepare and after 2 years of preparation You would not have been selected. even then in this 2 years Living in a big city, away from the confines of home Staying away, freedom, it teaches you so much which otherwise you will not be able to learn. Now This is a kind of cleverness. with family members There is definitely some dishonesty involved as well. Is it okay? Dishonesty in the sense that the family They are saying that become an IAS. You know That you don’t even have to become. you also want Not there. Maybe you have that thing inside you There is no caliber of variety either. But you I know that this path is giving you some taste of freedom which otherwise is not available to girls of this particular Reese. So what happened to one kind of thing? exactly Same is applicable on other things. If this cleverness to bypass those deprivations Comes with tools of. We, including you, have no There was no role. Your Society Provided to You gave you, were social and gave you a little You are able to cleverly bypass it. I don't see any arm in it. so would you also that the more the privilege the more More cleverness on the contrary what I am Saying so awesome. I'm saying if you are Coming from deprivation then some cleverness is It is forgiveable. Ok? If you are coming from deprivation. If you are coming from privileged Otherwise you will find meanness in your language Teaches. Is it okay? and you his and If you are using it more then it is like you are already on a horse and you have the most That sharp sword was also given. you will End up killing people work deprecated. We If you already assume that it means Mumbai I am saying this because I am sitting here. let's assume You come from a star family. Struggle I am doing this to enter Bollywood. Correct Isn't it? Already comes from a star family. All the directors know. to dad The producers know. Is it okay? and such I mean something else which you are calling cleverness They were also trying to suppress these four people For. That's unfair to some extent. But This is also the truth of the world. Exactly this It also happens. in fact these are the privileges You have this cleverness and more I teach because these privileges have It is seen that to survive and to thrive. If you have these things inside you, then you will do better because a big fight will follow In fact, Joe There are rightful contenders to suppress them fight with. Sir, I know the feeling of meanness There is a place and there is also a degree. Yes There is also a degree. more or less but one of his There should be a limit. Exactly and for me And I know we probably disagree a little Bit on this but for me that bastard I I limit my likes because of God I always think in my mind that God is watching everything and he is thinking Let's live our life, no one cares about it Welcome to Ristron wherever it comes from. Ok No? but I mean you know I I am relatively an atheist person. so I I don't leave it at that thing. But Certainly, I take it for granted that Being ethical is the responsibility of being a human being. But how do you bring in this limitingness again? Look, you can think of it this way, maybe This is the age difference. atheism which not believing in god is This is the stage after believing Is. There is no stage before this. you understand Are you getting it? This is after that, all of us, all of us People's families would just make a theist and move on Isn't it? when you transcend it say no maybe now I'm at that level I have reached the point where I can be moral I don't need the extra curbs. I accept my responsibility to I will remain ethical. Brother where did you come from ultimately These? This is the success of faith in God Where does the whole philosophy come from? It comes from this When a human is born, he has to do some work Some good deeds are bad. You had to give this sense, right? Anyone. Earlier there was no state. after When I came to the state, it was decided that this It is a crime, it is not a crime. So the law is I started thinking that if you do any such work if you do something that is not good for the society You can be sent to jail. to you and others crime criminal wala which is justice delivery They can do it. Earlier even this was not there. So why would anyone do this? It was said that No, you are doing anything. There's somebody who sees Used to be. Is it okay? So you are in awe of this someone I was doing ethical work. become moral because you were afraid that otherwise In the Past After Life You will have to go to hell. you have another Had to do something. but once you as a human Being Realize once you realize that no not because someone is watching you Being moral is the essence of being human There is responsibility. Once you feel this inside you If it comes, you will get the whip of this extra control the need will be reduced. It will end. One Once this time comes you don't have to fear it is it not because I will die for it Afterwards I will get heaven or hell. So that To be moral in this life is to be human Because it is my responsibility. This one time If you realize then you will get this extra There will be no need for controls. So this is his It is a later stage. there is no earlier stage that you because you want to mess everything up That is why you don't believe in God. But also only 1% people are able to do this. Very It's going to be difficult but mind it This thing is going on a lot these days. so You may have noticed that those who believe There are also people like you, I am not talking about them. You So a little bit of spirituality Philosophy must have been created. But most people only for your god only for your god Believe. If the rest of the 400 religions are accepted then If taken for 399 then that too is no confidence I do the same. even if you are a very great Devout Believer You Are Believer Only 255% Because for the rest of the believers you are Atheist. You don’t believe in Islam. You are not believing in Allah. You Don't believe in Sikhism. I am not doing it in Buddhism. African Banging I am not doing it in religion. stay in india The surnames are not in the code. you india We are not doing it in the religion of the tribals. You are 399 out of 400, even you are not sure are doing it. We are doing it in the same way. I I'm not doing it in even one of those. Bus That's the only difference. a while ago we Talked about privilege. then there are some People where 10 out of 10 points are privileged come to the section Will go. People I've met through the show. International guests too who are the richest and The most evolved, the most powerful, the most successful There are people who can do this. Others Apathy towards religion Yes but that's also n The Outcome of Huge Privilege. Hughes Privilege agreed but at the same time please Understand what it is always going to be Easy to hate. We would be the easiest to hate. well why is it that we assume I believe in this religion. I am not I believe but suppose I follow this religion I agree. Yes and I believe in that religion Is. I also respect him. But B My attitude towards the religion which I do not believe in not only is there despondency inside but it could be I hate it. Where could this have come from? this this thing May have come from. Mostly it must have come from this because either I was told that from a The condition of loving someone is that you are a I hate or dislike everyone else. either I have been told this. It could be someone It may be done in religion. Or I can call B I don't know it. We are strangers. stranger kiss produces the thing? creates fear. Because where did religions originate from? those Born from tribes, right? Tribals Born from tribes, right? we are all tribals It was there only. So this was the condition in the tribes. If you want to survive, you have to stay alive. This is a fight for survival if you are the other The people of the tribe do not suspect him If you keep it, and don't doubt it, then it will never tell you can finish it. This fear is actually due to unfamiliarity Is born. If you work very hard, If you try very consciously, then You can probably get the most equal distance. But In most cases you have an attachment to one and unfortunately for everyone else Al attachment is developed. i feel kit Whatever experiences of life No, I mean I knew that at a young age I had a lot of I have seen something. I'm not just talking About the control. i am also talking About all the good stuff. Definitely. Gin I have met people. I came from my own idol Whatever dreams I had in my heart during college all of which were completed by the time I was 26 or 27 I'm 32 now so I've lived a very long time Nice 10 years of my career were difficult Career Butt There were many good moments in these 10 years The best of all these good moments in Moments not life changing travel based moments were right means this is the peak of the Privileges Peak of the Experiences Peak of the blessings the travel experiences When I go out and meet other people There Privately Podcast Without Camera would have done it those were the moments that really expanded My brain, why does traveling make us generous? Just think about it, this happens isn't it so when you travel Actually you believe that you learn a lot from here this happens only because of this i am Just saying that this gives you the same starting point Teaches you how to un-judge people. At home living in a city living in a town While living in the village, the more The smaller the unit, the more you will The responsibility of being judgemental comes upon us will remain. I told the girl that if she You will leave the town and come to Delhi city So this will be freedom for you. because there You can do or see such things happening Who are considered bad in your town. Don't leave the house at 7:00. told the girl Will you go? Don't leave the house at 6:30. 7 You When you reach the city you will be told no You can stay till 10:00. a little bit right now It did not happen that you became completely free. But your horizons rose a little. you are abroad If you go, you will find out whether or not the girl is on top of you What does curfew timing mean? When You can go as you wish. Yes. Ok. you learn to unz Because all those things which are prohibited in your place Were. Those things which you feel bad about It is believed. The things that you have here There is a prohibition above which is considered bad. You find that in other societies they have to face as much It is not considered bad. then it's in your mind The question arises that why is it bad for me here It is believed? You were a little critical Are. I'm right or wrong but you Even after that you might still consider him bad are. But at least he should be allowed to tolerate it Your capacity will increase because you will know that is acceptable in any other society. So You will not believe that those who live in my society It is said that everything is fine. Brother In Afghanistan, any capable man has this if his wife is according to him then he has the right If it's not working then kill her. kill him Put it. For honor, some from our country too These cases of honour killing are heard in some parts Was. You go abroad and you see that This is a society in which a girl is ignored for her body She can decide for her own relationship. When you see that you will know that it is an honour killing Will you raise a question on that or not? You You will pick it up and say that friend it is his life. She has the right to decide who she wants to be with Will she go? Whom will she marry, whom will she marry I will not do any relationship with whom She will make it, it is her right. when you think like this Let's start with, where did this come from? It is then came when you saw the bigger world and You have given bias to your previous planets You started eliminating those that were there. This is why traveling makes us generous Because it's also true that we can control our prejudices Ask questions. I think at every turn of life But you don't have to define your own life. Do you try? It's just an overthinking brain is the outcome. that again from the same intellectual base that if Suppose we see something unusual and we want to If you are not able to justify this then we Looks like something is wrong. then we are nobody also formulate theories that would help them You should be justified. at this point in life After reaching the turn, I realized that that I am working hard on myself first For the family and the team is also in the family Is included. Ok? that surrounds me of my tribe my people for whom every day is my Eyes open for them but the personal selfishness The angle of working hard is travel so that I can I afford the travel Actually I am hungry to study and My life is best because of studies and not traveling during this time you are absolutely great yes books without the podcast without the people on through think the exact opposite think that he Society that said don't travel. Our This country was once a society whose The rules said that you should not travel. He The person who crosses the ocean will be called a brotherhood should be removed from. It is our society’s It was in principles. What did he want? They Maybe it wanted you not to open your eyes. He probably wanted you to be free from prejudice You should not be free. He probably wanted you to Don't be free, learn it. that's why next for the next generation for the next generation we People should ensure that the There are boundaries which we call national Boundaries are called state boundaries It is said that it is the boundary of language And so on. These boundaries are actually the thinking There would be boundaries to restrict only Are. Get free from them once and for all. One So affordability is an issue in itself. But be free from it. you are a better person Will be made. Would you like to read this whole podcast? The core message is that if you have more experience in your career In an era where we have to move forward rapidly Where everyone is working hard. Then Street smarts are needed, Self Awareness is needed, maturity is needed There is need. Well, all these things are needed. all of these Things have their own processes which Through whom this will be decided. But my message is this There is a little bit more. this thing in that message This also includes those who are likely to succeed rapidly. We have an aspiration, a little question on this too pick him up a little bit that critically It is equally important to see this as something else because Ranveer think about this It is true that having fame, having money, moving forward Who would not want to grow? To all It must be happening. But is this the ultimate purpose? of life does it give? Is this what life is Is there any meaning? There will be something besides this No? Because Hitler had everything. This was also famous. Everybody is listening to him Were. He doesn't like the people who were his own used to do it. There were people dying for him. Right? Was Hitler's life purposeful? What was life? I'm sure you will agree That it was not. so the ultimate purpose is He is not the only one who can ensure quick success It can be considered. We need to go beyond that. If you ask me I would like to What is succulence? I will say two things. Forest Is this how much respect? how much respect you Earn, Respect, Attention, Influence From People Unlike You? who is not like you Is. Is it okay? that is one marker and second marker and i'm giving something Controversial. second marker is how much Dislike and sometimes hate but hate is too harsh The word sometimes how much you dislike it you get from The People Like You for the Privileges of Yours. That is also to me. In my view It is also a marker of how much you Think about Gandhiji while travelling. Gandhiji is a rich variety of Gujarat He was a person coming from the families of. Character He was a person coming from a Varnik family. But who respected Gandhiji? Mango The poor man. Other people did. Ok No? who were not like him. The Muslims the other British they were fighting other people who were not like them People respected him while his own people People in the community were not very happy. Correct Isn't it? To me, this is a marker for me. So when I'm including my That's why I am saying this. so when the people who tell me Like he is not respectful to me There are. He respects me. me me Gives identification. I feel happy. But Probably happier than when people I love those who are like me come from from from backgrounds. Which started around me. no i I'm going beyond that. I am social I am going to the categories. Nowadays I like most Which people troll the most? Those people Who are people with upper caste privilege And in what sense does it cost that this The person speaks against the upper caste. it Individuals against these social categories He speaks. Do I come from these categories. It is a point to be noted. what about me You will be abused that whatever lower caste you are All those names are abused for Taking it as given that you talk about them. You You are like them. A lot of people believe that that I probably fall into those categories Am. This to me is a medal. which means that Like people come to share my privileges people are disliking me Because I speak against those privileged people From which I come and from me Different people reject me or I like it. Dispite the fact that I I am different from them. To me this is success. This Attention can always be monetized also. You No attention once you have the money It is a very easy and quick process to make, I am an agency Rush to that sir you have so much attention. Do you have 10 million followers or There are so many subscribers. we will give you that Cat of Money. That is an easy part of it. So Mot monetization will get money, fame, you will get some identity is it will come In due course. That means I am not not Saying it's wrong. I'm not even saying that This is a bad thing. Should not do. But he so once you have this attention and respect come It will go away. I think again sir a very free I've been writing this entire podcast from a position of flow. had started. This was an unplanned podcast. but i new i am going to talk about the The Human Journey and Maturity Mainly. it It was my theme. I'm just sharing one thing And then you can shed light on it. A: They say that the five people around you There are people, you become an average of them. The People you spend time. It is a great truth Of life. And the game is to have a bit of Rotation in those five people. as you keep Growing Older. Little Things Like When You're with people older than you Spend time getting to know their personality Some things rub off on you. and i think it's wonderful for everyone Human beings like to hang out with older people. A very simple career hack Actually. If you can lead the learnings into Your career. a that's the final thing i want To say in this hole algorithm. because here We have drawn out a maturity algorithm I have told him to do this exercise Do exercise. But I feel that someone is different from you big one is the one with whom you have fun and who Challenges you with a growth mindset Tell me the time individually with them. Well Ranbir for the first time in this Conversation happened for the first time so late In conversation. I mean I saw your beach facing Balcony. I saw this seven camera setup. I Saw This Wonderful Studio Everything Not Even once i had this element in me thinking about you this is the first time having a In Person Life that is yours can criticize you A little bit of panic can also cause a crisis to occur It also hides and this is the first time i am having this Element of Envy I mean this is a personal thing that I Records of losing good friends in life Have made it. Ok? continuously one after the other good maybe my friend Just like you said, there are many foolish things of mine It happens many times or sometimes you have to take tough decisions I get scared. Some of you make those decisions You are not able to take what you should take. and you End up paying the price. ah so i totally Agree when you say that having friends especially the friends who have the ability to critic you and as you said you said you This is another big achievement for a little bigger than because you are with them and you are with them I am learning. There is nothing unique about this It doesn't exist. But he makes you feel worth it I am able to share this with you It can. Little Mature Still Believing And for a very long period of time. it There is a blessing, a blessing that you It should be kept absolutely safe. and that means i You said that I am an atheist Am. I don't believe in all these things But even then, if the evil eye falls on you It will be focused on this thing only. believe in everything else Do it, it doesn't matter. I came and wished that your it remains large and grows but if that Even if it doesn't happen, if you are able to hold on to this particular thing i mean it is Worth holding. Ok? so this never plays Musical chairs with this aspect. it's not A thing that you should be testing every day. Ok? If You Have Been Tested Once or Twice In the life that much is enough. Good Friends Hold on to it. but infact i am taking this opportunity to say sorry to all my friends who consider that rightly and wrongly they believe that i have been unfair to Them. Because it is such an achievement if you have There are some friends like this and there are only a few like this Needed It cannot be 100 50 150 200. There can be 100 50 150 200 quants. They It may also contribute to your life Do it. I am not at all denying that. But Friends who catch you and criticize you and in that criticism you may once again think It also does not appear that there is anything behind this criticism There are ulterior motives. this is a prized Position. so please have my nva And blessings oh that's what there is After the crisis, it would value it even more I am please do friendship why so many times all the people are gone the ones that stay you love them The Once I Had Nobody to Give Many Sure shots and nobody to give you advice but who left or suppose you think that He shouldn't be standing with you Was Needed. A little sympathy for them too Be a little compassionate, a little generous because many times people think of us as you don't have to feel it because you Thankfully ideologically your placed in a A place where there are less worries about this. I am ideologically placed where these consistently there is a concern that you The establishment won't like it. To you Governments will not like it etc. That is why we know such people more closely Let's see who should do what, who should say what They should avoid speaking. where stood You should avoid standing there. And it is also true that this is always done out of fear. I wouldn’t be doing it. Sometimes more than fear Greed plays a big role. Some small getting some small proximities, Get some benefits. but both ways it is Human It's human to be afraid. it's It's human to be a little greedy. whatever you say I understand theoretically that you are like this. I understand but this thing is inside my heart Hasn't gone yet. I totally understand that i am saying so because as i said you still you had friends that Was there for you in your time of need. ever to me Sometimes I feel that my friends know this It might seem so. I'm sorry to say that When they needed Vijendra, he was there I did not stand firmly with them. and I I'm taking this opportunity to say sorry to you. Do you miss anyone? Say This Is What I Mean Thfully there is no friend for whom I can do this Let me say that he dumped me. i can not say with confidence that it is not like that They must be saying this. so they can be us people Stories is very complex. They are very complicated. simple life So only in geometry notebook is shown. in which a scale was placed and Drawn it with a pencil. life's straight line I kept walking. Sometimes I know what I I think about the romantic breakups that happen Yes, they give you pain for some time. The breakups that happen between the Butt brothers They keep pricking you throughout your life. yes this and the other thing is that in our country And you will find that just once again I am Sorry I am taking you there again. but this which is the construct of friendship, this is friendship construct of men's friendship It is constructed. How to Look Carefully Men are raised here. It happens in that, isn't it, he is just a brother here standing. You do whatever you want to do. I am yours I stand with you. The brother the friend will not judge You. Whether what you did was right or not. Was it ethical or not? Is it okay? When I my About my own friendship breakups I think. especially with the brothers, those Where there was such friendship with people. So Often this thought comes to my mind that Friend, even if we patch up, the friendship remains the same She will not stay. But that's why maybe I need a patch up don't do it because it's here 200% And not that. You want it absolutely pure. Perfection and purity, maybe these are my emotional There is a limitation. But I did not understand. I Am I totally respect this feeling s True, but I have many friends like this for example. Friends with whom I spent months talking it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen for months but when again When there is a conversation, you don't have any warm up you have to start from the place where you left ok and the reason is that dost He will not judge you because you did 3 I did not take any care of myself for four months no actually what do they say actually The one who breaks up after a fight no i am talking about that, that's it, it is said not not losing touch losing touch wala ok yes not losing i was talking about losing touch i was not talking about fights I have a bag full of friendship for those who fight Have less experience. Experiencing a tumultuous friendship I have less. there are one or two and she teases Are. But I learn to get over this. Painfully Butt Coming But I was able to talk to those with whom I could go At least one I still remember talking to I couldn't give them to others whom I have Given signals that I don't just want to talk but i'm very eager to end whenever they are ready i will be happy to maybe this it happens with age yes beyond a point you no look understand this also friends once in a while after i might be theoretically possible But my understanding is that after a while the new It becomes difficult to make friends. Ok No? So the friends you grew up with Assume those friends are in your mind Or they have something very clear in their mind It turns out you were wrong on one point. Its Despite this, I have friendship with the same person Yet, there remains scope to do so. Agreeing and Disagreeing on a Particular The point is that you were wrong or I was wrong Was. but new friends new friends once upon a time It is difficult to become later. more than a limit and that's why I always say new friends not to leave old friends for Needed Now you can probably see this in your life So he must have definitely come. We who are a reached a particular level of fame, people reached the identities of, people started recognizing began. We have had major complaints This is one of the complaints given. now you are He has become a big man. why are you on our side will you see? but i have realised that those are the two which even today in terms of the fame and Success and money and all is nothing or one Living an average life. i make it a point I am not saying that I will do it 100% I find that when I meet him, he has a Don't feel it even for a second. I give them this I provoke you sometimes I provoke you I am literally thinking that he makes fun of me about this that yes friend you are right now, now you are Why is he talking to us after meeting Ranveer? will do that kind of thing ok because this is a right which I give only to the friends this is a privilege this is a one Dekhna is our Hindi word Privilege These privileges are my parents Neither do my family have it An unknown person doesn't have the courage but friends have this privilege that they have over those things of mine Things that other people can make fun of I praise you. Brother, please make fun of me. How to quit did you give it friend? sometimes now deliberately end as a communication person we know how to do it Used to be. Is it okay? Now suppose this I said this Ranveer thing. So the At that time somebody must be doing this sa tell me knowingly that this guy will catch this To Cue. Will you catch this cue then? He will make fun of me. after that by doing that you Will you feel shy? Come on friend, get up. Does anybody know also na sir a career about friends Doesn't talk from perspective. but this I have observed it. again the reason for this show I haven't learned much about life since Have you learnt. and top of the top people always have a There is always a small friend group. says That Shahrukh Khan also has a core friend The group is still there. which they maintain Are. That is their rush in life. but no one Nos who are his friends? no i know about The Popular and Successful People They Crave crave for this thing and those who for some the reason we've lost it I I have full money because the price they have Paid for this success is more than what is it worth the price loneliness one is definitely loneliness and the second is that you run out of people who are your Looking you in the eye and telling you your mistakes Could. It's not just loneliness. These Well, loneliness has its place and you Rightly pointed it out. But if you Someone, your childhood friend, is just like your eyes I could not look into his eyes and say that Vijendra You oppose something, it is correct Is. But look at the boundary at this place You are crossing it. because someone else will say it So I'll assume it's a troll. But if any my friend will say then I will realize that this person is just saying this to me Is. On Friendship is the Treasure of Life Don't make so many friends that you I will not be able to maintain friendship or you will be my friend I can't fulfill it Such a practical end Important statement. Because suppose that If you are career driven, you are going to be busy yes. Family life in that busy schedule Putting it aside and spending time with friends It is difficult to spend. you have a limited Amount of friends you can keep? Yes. And There is a big advantage in having more friends The problem is also that subconsciously you end up Substituting Comfortable Friends in the the place of friends who can make you Uncomfortable. Which is again awkwardness. That means there should be depth in friendship too. That is what friendship is for. yes butt Be careful in friendship like fame As if money is not a criteria. same way If I'm a little older than you And if I can give advice then I am telling you. By the way only Don't make intellectual equality a condition. What happens many times is that you find yourself Because you have experience. You have a particular track of life So you think that now you can't Let's go to the abstract level. Now you The principles make sense. Philosophy to you I understand it. You understand spirituality It comes in. That is why your friend who is Has not gone through the process. he is not Uniform. Don't conclude that. This is from late 20s Many people make mistakes. till late 20 Little does one know that a good career Do this. I have grown out. Him You Never Outgrow your friends.
