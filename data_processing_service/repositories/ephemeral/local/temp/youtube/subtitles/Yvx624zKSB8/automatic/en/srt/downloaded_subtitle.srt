2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome Vijendra Sir. The entry is good

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,200
But the sitting style is still very casual

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Is.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,040
Now you can discover a hidden side of yourself through this podcast

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,679
People will see it. This is very interesting

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,080
It is the beginning. you are known for taking interview

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,920
Sir. But you guys need to be a little psychologically

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
You can scan it. there is no milkman

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
Would. We all have biases and you

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
but still I won't judge him

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
I will do it. Ultimately your character

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,880
The test is the same.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,680
would you say that confidence is the most

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
Important thing in any job profile?

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,800
If I talk in my language, I would say

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,399
If you don't have it you can't get five

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,360
If you can tolerate failure then do it straight away

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,520
Don't think of becoming an IAS then. A Reality

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
Check it.

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
What is the point of this whole 22 year old person?

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,520
He will gain it. For a 22 year old kid I

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,360
I say this to those who are trying to succeed fast

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
There is aspiration. There might be something besides this too.

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,680
Hitler had everything. Hitler's

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Was life a purposeful life? So

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,359
The only sure thing is what the ultimate purpose is

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Shot quick success cannot be considered.

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,439
We need to go beyond that.

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
Judge of humans in the social media generation

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,520
The capacity to do this has increased a lot. Brother

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,119
You are sitting happily. Now a great car

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,640
I am going in. and then you pass a judgement

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,600
We do. Poor people do not work hard.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Where is it coming from? it is coming from

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Pure. Because a lot of things are situational

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,080
also happens. If you are from Uttar Pradesh,

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,080
There are boys from Bihar and Rajasthan. If

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,479
Did you think of becoming an IAS?

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,640
If it is, then it should be rejected. But

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
If you are a girl from this area.

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
You are offered a home visit that

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,320
Son, go to Delhi and get ready. quick pounce

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,560
Let's take

45
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Take it. Our country was such a society for a long time

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,600
in whose rules it was stated that the person who

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,840
He will be expelled from the community across the ocean

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,520
should be given. What did he want? He probably is this

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,159
I wanted your eyes not to open.

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
A simple life is just a geometry notebook

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
in which a scale was placed and

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,159
Drawn with pencil. life in a straight line

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,080
In the students' circuit. But my promise

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,800
I want you to know about an unknown side of these people today.

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,000
You will see it in this episode. but my intention is this

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,360

The theme of the episode is maturity. and this

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,920

Will have to keep it and consume it. Because we have a

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,239
Welcome Vijendra Sir to The Ranveer Show.

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,239
Thanks Ranveer. I know that this

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,959
A lot of people get to know through podcasts

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,040
A chance to learn practical things

82
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,400
will get. but at the same time too much

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,959
You will find peace from this conversation. so thank you

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,040
You for being in the studio. It is very

85
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,599
interesting start because usually

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,439
I've been told ah the exact opposite.

87
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
Ah, even if it's the interview world

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,280
It is said that sitting in front of you Sir, one

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
So, they become restless. Secondly I also constantly

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,360
It seems to make people a bit restless

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,879
It is more important to get it done. so for a

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,040
change you are telling me this about me

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,200
that I will give you peace. So thank you. thank you

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,079
You for saying it. yes, you have a hidden side

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,199
Now people will see it. How are you all? uh i

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,600
I am fine. I'm learning things and

97
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,520
You said that in conversations with you outside, there were many

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,680
all the things that you normally do when you

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,280
When you turn 50, your ego starts to take over you.

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
She is stopping that from a 32 year old person

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,720
There is nothing to learn. but i learned a lot

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,880
In this conversation. so yes i am looking

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Forward to the hole. now it's my turn to

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,440
Learn. yes yes yes

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,800
Let's start with practicality. Wood You

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:52,400
say that confidence is the most important thing in

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,479
Any industry in any job profile and is

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,759
it's other aspects and this is why I tell you

109
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,880
I am asking because obviously a

110
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,160
you are known for taking interview sir but in

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,160
My eyes are a little psychologically sensitive to you guys

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,880
you just scan it and that is the actual

113
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,520
Craft That You're Getting Better at Even

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,560
Today I am right to set, which means I am trying

115
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
I have been and it is true that when you, for example,

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm talking to you right now or just a little bit

117
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
I was talking to you a while ago, I

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
When I meet a person who

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
If interviews are involved then I would like to introduce the person to

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,919
I read it almost like I read a book

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
She goes. There are mistakes in reading this book too

122
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,759
May be possible. So there is no such claim

123
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
That whatever I read is exactly like that.

124
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,680
But it is definitely, as you said, a

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,199
Craft is a skill. There is a skill that

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,759
When you meet people regularly, you

127
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,800
could see the ratio of that personality of his

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,960
Are. As far as we are concerned this is a matter of confidence

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
It depends on where you look

130
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,880
What do you call confidence? What

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
Confidence simply means that who

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,440
Can speak the loudest. Who is the most

133
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Can scream louder or show more confidence

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,280
It just means that I have it inside me

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,560
I feel proud that I am the only one who is right. then no

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Such confidence which neither leads to success nor

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
Neither job nor life is the best thing for them

138
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,759
Not there. Is it okay? When we are confident

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,479
to understand it in a slightly nuanced manner

140
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,759
Let's try. when it simply means that

141
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,440
That you don't look down on yourself.

142
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,080
feeling completely sorry for oneself or

143
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't be filled with self-pity. If

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,720
Confidence means that definitely

145
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,360
Confidence helps, it helps.

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,520
But the world will be more beautiful. If we take this

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,000
from binary viewpoints of sorts

148
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't look. Do not look at it like that, there are some people who

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
are full of confidence and some people

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,319
who are filled with helplessness. Because

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
Many things are also situational. What

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,440
How do you behave in the situation?

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,800
That is ultimately the test of your character

154
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,240
Is. We are wow. Ok. Firstly I would say that

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,039
I would like that social media

156
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:07,680
This generation has come to think of judging people

157
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,560
The capacity has increased a lot. yes it is

158
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,319
Being rewarded unfortunately. Judging Others

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,199
Human beings are being rewarded. yes,

160
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,759
That's what the sad part is. it is

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
Making everybody more judgemental. in the 90s it

162
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,759
It wasn’t true, was it? Less to Less Extent It

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,280
Habitat. Not to this extent. Ok. and you

164
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,520
See the increase of judgement. Hazli Hazli It

165
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,160
There is enough social media and there is one reason for this

166
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,680
It has increased since. But as I said in society

167
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,080
The thing that will be rewarded by the society

168
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
it will become the nature of the thing to

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,720
Will start imbibing more. him more

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,680
To see. In our time, I had this problem even till 90's

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,400
I know that hate was something that could be

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Incentivisation was not given. who has bad

173
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,160
It was seen with eyes. Is it okay? So they

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,800
Even the people who had hatred inside them, their

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,360
I was forced to hide that hatred a little bit

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,039
let's go. It felt the same way about many other things

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
come into force. Being judgemental is part of that

178
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,879
It comes out. when you look at things people

179
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,879
It is not just for the people. my worry is

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,319
More than people. communities, groups

181
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,160
to groups, identities, nationalities

182
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,479
To. When you see these people and say

183
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
It is not so, this is what it takes to be judgemental,

184
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,280
Where does it ultimately come from? just think about it

185
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,479
Look at this. Think on the level of psychology

186
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,919
But it will come out clear. being judgemental comes

187
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,160
It is because of our intellectual laziness. it is always

188
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,839
Intellectual laziness means that our

189
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,000
Humans want to do intellectual rigging

190
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
He is a bit lazy by nature.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,959
If he finds a way in which

192
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,240
that it will take a little less effort and you will have no time to go there

193
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,240
There is another way in which a little

194
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
If it takes more hard work then most of the time it

195
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Chooses the path that requires less effort. this man

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,920
It is in the nature to conserve energy. it

197
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,320
It happens at the mental level as well. when we

198
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,160
Let's look at the stereotypes when we give

199
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
Let us look at the decisions that have been made, which are based on decisions already made

200
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,440
have been given and we say this way

201
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,279
If we walk with this we don't have to work hard

202
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,279
Will need it. This person is coming. its beard

203
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,640
is it visible or its turban is visible

204
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,240
It has been happening. It means this is what it means.

205
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,800
Because their community is like this. How much

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,760
It became easy, right? Life is sorted. To you

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Judges Judgments have been served and you only

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,600
They have to be implemented. on people like this

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,680
This intellectual laziness is what affects such people.

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,160
it's worth it to be judgemental because it

211
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,600
It's just like pronunciation in a language

212
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,959
Pronouns are used more

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
The value of noun is less because for noun

214
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,360
you should know okay you should know

215
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
This should be Ranveer and in his place

216
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,880
Say he is a human being, now if he is a human being then it will be easy

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
I went and showed my two hands, two legs and two eyes

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
the person is gone the matter is over so the pronunciation which

219
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
are pronouns are always easier

220
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
So it is always easy to be judgemental

221
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,200
We are judgemental because we suffer from intellectual laziness.

222
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,200
Reasons to avoid doing intellectual work

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Basically if we are more involved in your life

224
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,800
You have free time, you are more judgemental

225
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,480
You will go. Not one, that is also one thing.

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
That's why it is very important to stay busy

227
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,440
If you become too judgemental

228
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,120
There is no self harm factor here

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
The form is formed because you judge yourself as well

230
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,360
You start doing it. Ok. In fact, I alone

231
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,360
I have learnt something but I have not learnt to judge. Anj

232
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,440
Learn to do and learn to un-judge

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
that is more difficult because you

234
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,880
Know your bias. You need your

235
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,880
Biases are knowing your prejudices. His

236
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,279
Despite this, there is no one who is one's own groom.

237
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,200
We all have biases. Is it okay?

238
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,959
There will definitely be prejudices. This which

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,880
You have prejudices even when you know them

240
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,760
those prejudices in front of you

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,519
Someone who is supposed to be there comes and you say that

242
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,240
I know I have this prejudice

243
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,920
But still, I won't judge it.

244
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,240
it takes a lot of debt and also a lot

245
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,240
As said in all this, a lot of intellectual labour is involved.

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,000
There is a need also. Being Judgmental Is In

247
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,560
Due course by default. Being Unjustified

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,839
is always conscious.

249
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,519
There is more to talk about.

250
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,399
Consciously Undoing the Judgment in Your Own

251
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:10,120
Mind. But before we talk about it

252
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:13,760
It is a very simple question sir. Somebody 22 years old

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,680
What will a person gain from this whole point?

254
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
For one's own practical life, for one's own

255
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
For career. Look, what happens is that

256
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
Where do our voices come from? Our

257
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,040
Just like we said that through that socialization

258
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,200
We will come and we will come from our comfort zone. You

259
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,839
Are you able to understand? This is a comfort zone. You

260
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
Born as a man. you are a bengali

261
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,920
Like, you were born a Punjabi. Correct

262
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,160
Isn't it? In what particular way were you born

263
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,399
happened? Because of that you have a comfort zone

264
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Is. and you want to be in that comfort zone

265
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,800
Because as I said that we all are from nature

266
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
They are lazy. So out of the comfort zone

267
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,680
It will take effort to get out. go to a place like this

268
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Which will be a place of discomfort. Example

269
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,800
Let us understand from this. Suppose any IIT

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,279
Bombay is a nice place. Top IIT is the country

271
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,160
Of. People from all over the country come to IIT Bombay

272
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,440
Let's try. Let's assume Actius

273
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,200
let's assume in the sense that let's assume

274
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,920
Is there any child from Azamgarh? he worked hard

275
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
I cracked IIT JEE and Advanced

276
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
He did it and reached IIT Bombay.

277
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
In that, let's assume it to be mechanical

278
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,399
I got engineering. Now just think about it

279
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,839
He comes here and says that he is from Azamgarh

280
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,600
I want children. Was in Azamgarh. from Azamgarh

281
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
He knows the language of children. their same

282
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,279
He has that mindset. Everything is there.

283
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,800
What is his comfort zone? from Azamgarh

284
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,800
Children. Even if he comes to IIT Bombay

285
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,480
Because he tells other people a particular

286
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
judges in a manner. So, choose according to your comfort

287
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,920
Tries to stay in the zone. Will He

288
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,560
Ever be able to actually learn? No. I am 20

289
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,720
I am telling this for a 22 year old kid. 202

290
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,200
year old children when out of this judgemental

291
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,360
When this child from Azamgarh comes here

292
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,399
To the people of Mumbai, to the people of Gujarat

293
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,800
The people of Kashmir live with them instead

294
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,680
If you search for the children of Azamgarh then

295
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,519
He is challenging himself. Your bias

296
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,920
is challenging the . to your presages

297
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,920
He is challenging. to be judgemental of yourself

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,519
He is challenging. and she gives him her in return

299
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
what are you getting? give him a

300
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
Diversity is being achieved. this diversity

301
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,079
Hazily Contributes to Her Personality

302
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,600
will do it. In Other Words Judgment 22 years old

303
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
I am saying this for the child. Right now I am very

304
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,880
I am not giving any deep thoughts. 22 year olds

305
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,000
for or 20 years old child non

306
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Being judgemental is fighting that battle with yourself

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,160
in which he is out of his comfort zone

308
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,440
He learns to come. Because being judgemental

309
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,800
Have to be in the comfort zone. not be judgemental

310
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,600
The comfort zone has to be breached. going out

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
Is. I have to go to a place where you feel uncomfortable. Then

312
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,279
I have done a Geography but this matter

313
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
It does not apply only to geography. If

314
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,760
You are comfortable only with boys.

315
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,079
But there are girls in your group,

316
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,160
Are speakers of another language. Second

317
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,800
There are people with different sexual preferences. Second

318
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,040
They are people of nationality. people of other religions

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,639
Are. There are people of other castes. So what?

320
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,120
You have a diverse peer group. every

321
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,680
Interacting with one will be teaching you.

322
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,240
Just like if you have a thousand podcasts

323
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,720
For all these years, everyone has given you something

324
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
He taught me because he was different from you.

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,320
It was different from you. If you say no I

326
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
I am Ranveer and I am Ranveer's podcast

327
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
I will do it.

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,519
You having only people like you agreeing

329
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,519
on everything with you will you be able to

330
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
Learn? No you will be able to learn a little.

331
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,720
This is what I called Disarrayments Lead

332
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,880
To the depths. Yes. Essentially Not Just

333
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,399
Disagreement. Every situation is different from your own,

334
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,440
Every situation that is different from your comfort zone

335
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,519
Teaches you. makes you a better person

336
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,680
Is. And the most important thing is that it's inside you

337
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,680
It brings maturity. the maturity you

338
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,160
It teaches that a person should

339
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,160
Don't judge a book by its cover.

340
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Don't judge a person by his appearance

341
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,760
Do it. on the basis of his language, his religion,

342
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,560
his caste or any of his identity

343
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
Don't judge on that basis. Where will this come from? it

344
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,199
it will come when you are ready for it

345
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,519
from the inside that you are out of your comfort zone

346
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
The easiest intellectual ever to come

347
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
Laziness' way was to judge someone

348
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
If it is a boy then it will be like this, if it is a girl then it will be like this

349
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,560
If it comes from LGBTQ then it will be like this

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,800
etc etc what does this mean for you

351
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,079
Coming out of the comfort zone that's the key thing

352
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,720
And you should not be unjudgmental or judgmental.

353
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,040
Actually this is what it teaches, keep in mind this is easy

354
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,600
is not the way because you constantly have to

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
We have to fight prejudice. Therefore your

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,920
Give yourself enough space so that you can make mistakes

357
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
do. We are not the ones that you are in life

358
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
Will always be politically correct. I am not

359
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,399
Constantly turning this whole conversation into a

360
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,480
Scanning from a college student's perspective

361
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,399
I have been. sir what is why i am about

362
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,880
To say what I'm about to say. Firstly

363
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,839
I would like every listener, if possible, to

364
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,440
Nor should you carry a notebook. a pen and paper

365
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,839
You should take it and yourself

366
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,240
Five to 10 self-identifications

367
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,959
To list out the points. Right great. I

368
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,360
Do it as an exercise in the classroom.

369
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,759
I believe that throughout life, every three or four

370
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,480
You should do this for yourself once in a while. Two

371
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:10,320
Just see how you ideally every year. every year

372
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,440
You keep growing. In Your 20s Having a

373
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,199
Mirror is also an ancient skill. Right?

374
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,880
I am saying this because when I

375
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,959
I was 22 years old before YouTube, I was into fitness

376
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,320
I used to train and did fitness training

377
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,160
I used a 100 lbs. battery for a month before starting

378
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
In a relative's engineering factory

379
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,839
Work done. Good. Learned a lot there. Very

380
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,959
something about life ahh engineering

381
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,519
No blue collar person has such skills

382
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,000
I can understand. That was my big learning that

383
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,160
Friend, if he has an engineering degree

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,240
If you understand engineering without taking it then that means

385
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,680
Very high level skills can also be learned

386
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,360
Very easily. it is I mean I know I am

387
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,600
Interrupting here. But if I my

388
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,399
If I start with life, then my life

389
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,040
A lot of learnings in the same way

390
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,120
Maybe the audience might not even know. I

391
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,160
I teach literature at the university.

392
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,240
But before that I studied engineering and

393
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,839
I came after studying electrical engineering.

394
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,919
so I worked in a factory like you said

395
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,480
I did an engineering course in a factory

396
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,120
Worked as an engineer. yes and there

397
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,559
But I had a workforce of around 20-25

398
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,880
There was a small factory of people

399
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,000
In which these people used to make press. Joe Light

400
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,799
They used to make weight iron. in 2025

401
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Those three months spent with the workers

402
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,919
I worked in this factory

403
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Was. I learned from every single one of them

404
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,960
And surprisingly, I learned such things.

405
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,200
about which you neither have any

406
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
Actually, she was teaching you engineering, right?

407
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,120
The society was teaching. Because you have in mind

408
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,880
So there was prejudice, right? For example, all of us

409
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
The world used to believe this. I give you a

410
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,120
I am telling the story. That will make sense.

411
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,520
It was always taught that you should give your worker

412
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,320
Throw money and they will do more work. Big

413
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
It was a simple thing and hence it was normal

414
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,240
The pattern was that you counted the pieces at the end

415
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,840
Will go. How many have you made and based on that

416
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,919
But you will get wedges. and I thought that if

417
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,480
You can say that you make 100 at one place

418
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,120
Make it 150. If you get it, production will increase

419
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,919
Should go. and i realise it doesnt work

420
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Like that. I was very surprised. I

421
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,360
Said friend you have been told that if you score 150

422
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,360
If you make it then let's say you have ₹1000 right now

423
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,160
If you get it then you will get 1500. then you

424
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,480
Why are you not doing it? all quiet. Then I

425
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Tried to identify. So a worker

426
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,320
Whose name was Jiyalal. Jiyalal Used

427
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,480
To be kind of a leader of that. of the leader

428
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,480
Meaning, understand a little about the union value

429
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Take it, if they needed it then they would

430
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
He used to come to us. Sir, do this work. I

431
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,960
Jiyal was called and asked from jail

432
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,799
What is the reason for working? she gave me a

433
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,280
Gave the message of a wonderful life. he said sir

434
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,400
If I say that our

435
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,080
The team will make 150 irons daily. It's price

436
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Three people lost their jobs in paying the bills

437
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,799
will go. because in fact what has happened in the last 20 years

438
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,679
My understanding tells me this. right now

439
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,760
You need 1500 Iron. But the truth is this

440
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,919
that the lean season will come and in the lean season we

441
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,000
So you must be making it with the same practice. So

442
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
The owner will find it easiest to choose three of these

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,440
Fire the people. of those three people

444
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,440
To save jobs it is important that we

445
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,760
work at the same pace as we do

446
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
Are. I will definitely keep it to the minimum. I said

447
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
But why are you thinking so much about it now?

448
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,960
And this will make your life better. Then

449
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,760
He told another truth. he said sir you

450
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,760
Give me 1000 or 1500. this country

451
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,520
The life of a laborer is going to be like this

452
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,880
I will go and sleep in a slum and go to the railway

453
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,080
There was a line. There across the railway line

454
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,559
I will go and go to the toilet every morning.

455
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Ok? And I will come back. my life ₹500

456
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,679
It will not change from. effectively what i said

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,240
Is what I learned in management wasn't

458
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,760
Functioning in the factory. it wasn't

459
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,120
Functioning in the factory. and my judgement

460
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,760
about the poor people that they have little money

461
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,360
Give it. Now he will do anything. compared to him

462
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
I am probably from middle class and upper class

463
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,840
The person must be strangling his neighbor's friend

464
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,679
He will survive in the competition. that person to those

465
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,120
There are three unnamed people who are worried about

466
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,679
I don't even know yet who will take it out

467
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,000
We will know that if we adopt this strategy

468
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,400
Then we will be expelled. it changed my

469
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Perspective a lot. Human Dynamics

470
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Exactly. I learnt it let a lot in

471
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,640
Human Relations Approach to Management

472
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,520
They say etcetera etcetera. but i learned

473
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
It's from a Jiyalal. we who was never

474
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,960
been to school at all and actually not if

475
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,840
This HR skill of yours tells people

476
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,720
If this skill is strong then it is always possible to manage

477
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,039
Pay off in your career it's as I said it is

478
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
All About Getting Work Done I am a little bit

479
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,200
I would like to say things definitely this is a 32

480
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,280
Year old is perspective and please add

481
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,520
to it if you feel that something is missing

482
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
From my formula I meet many people

483
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,440
I have met through the show and met some great people

484
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
yes, I have noticed some commonalities

485
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,080
There are so many successful people in any industry

486
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,640
It can be cricket, it can be Bollywood, whatever

487
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,480
One commonality among those businesses is that

488
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,120
A in some perspective of his craft he

489
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,559
He is a specialist. they don't have to be great

490
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,600
at all aspects of their craft but they

491
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,400
Are usually the best at one aspect. it

492
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,640
This is the basis of growth. Basis of career growth.

493
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,360
In second place is self-confidence. Self

494
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,760
belief or confidence that you're going for it

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,039
Etc. Here I am talking about execution.

496
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,480
I did not stay either, because I believe that

497
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,000
Execution hard work is a very base level thing

498
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Is. This must happen. This has to be it

499
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,640
Needed Meaning this is not their place.

500
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
This is a must. other than that you are different

501
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,280
What qualities can you bring to this?

502
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,919
Yes. So first and foremost that specialist

503
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,919
In One Aspect of Craft. Seconds

504
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:54,000
Confidence. But a third one is very underrated

505
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,760
The factor is that of maturity. and this is you

506
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,280
Actually can't work on it. I Feel

507
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,039
There are ways to improve it but it's time

508
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:09,120
It is a gift. and it really adds an

509
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,640
To edge your career in the long term. Very

510
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,600
There are all these people who actually attain maturity.

511
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,320
I never chase anyone. Age N Time Mill

512
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,159
It goes into the hands. The hands get the edge

513
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,559
But I don't get maturity. Perhaps their

514
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,360
because of the people around them, maybe

515
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
Whatever your priorities are in life,

516
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Because of priorities, maybe

517
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,480
Because of distractions. Butt Maturity

518
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,480
There is a very big X factor in careers. I

519
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,799
feel that when something big happens in your life

520
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,120
Maturity even when accidents happen

521
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,200
There is an increase. From Wrigley. butt what are you

522
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,679
What would you like to say about my algorithm?

523
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,400
In? usually what you said isn't it time

524
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:51,120
It is something that comes with time. In the country

525
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,400
How many 32 year olds can understand this?

526
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,880
you could say it, you could feel it, or

527
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,360
You must have understood. Just try to understand this

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,720
Let's try. This is what you have collected hundreds of

529
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,600
I've got podcasts from you wonderful people

530
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,840
meet constantly

531
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:15,559
Are. This gave you the idea of ​​how to do that algorithm.

532
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,360
that inside you

533
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:22,320
This understanding was able to create this vision that you could see

534
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,039
that there is such a thing as maturity which

535
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,120
That it can only come from this type of contact.

536
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,679
This can come only from this companionship. That means someone else

537
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:34,159
what did he do in his life? you from him

538
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,640
Keep a dog to learn from, not yourself every time

539
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,559
You need those accidents in your life

540
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
that you will be able to learn. where is this coming from

541
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,640
Is? This comes from the fact that your

542
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,679
There is that maturity inside you to know that

543
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,000
For experience and ability to learn every time

544
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,679
It is not necessary to go through the tragedy yourself.

545
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,159
However, despite that, there are some difficulties in life

546
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,559
Tragedies are bound to happen. There will be a couple of crises

547
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,720
Whatever I will teach, and that too at my own pace

548
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
Will come. If you are more popular. If

549
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
If you work hard then more

550
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,360
Will come. But that is a different matter. main

551
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,360
The point is whether you care about other people's lives

552
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,600
Are you ready to learn from experience or not?

553
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,000
Like you have taken hundreds of podcasts. I

554
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,240
I have also met those students regularly

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Those who give interview, clear the mains

556
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,440
Yes, he comes for interview. ah i think

557
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,600
That's what I learned from them. I

558
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,080
I often give this example. I don't

559
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,240
Find out if you will be able to connect it or not.

560
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,799
But suppose if you look at this table.

561
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760
This is a wooden replica of this table. Correct

562
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,760
Isn't it? Cut some stems horizontally

563
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,559
Gaya is its replica and it has lines

564
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,240
which is visible in If You Remember

565
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,919
So what are these tree rings of every tree?

566
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
The tree rings and I've been talking

567
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,279
about it a lot as a metaphor and as a

568
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,360
How does it come inside him like life

569
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,600
Think about tree rings and see the life of that tree

570
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,840
what happened in that tree ring came which

571
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Had I ever studied even a little biology or botany?

572
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,400
He had read that every year a tree

573
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,919
The ring comes and after a whole year has passed its

574
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,919
A layer forms on the stem which

575
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,240
Later, if it is cut like this, then

576
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,240
It will come like a tree. Now just give it a little

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,120
Think seriously about maturity

578
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,440
It will immediately unfold itself. this which

579
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
Treeing is one year treeing, suppose

580
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,000
It has 50 treeings so it means tree

581
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,720
The age of the crypt is 50 years. yes its every

582
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,440
Treeing represents a year. and that

583
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Any good botanist can tell by looking at the trees

584
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,080
It is possible that this tree will be cut this year

585
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,799
What all I had to endure. wow did the flood come or not

586
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,520
I? Is it okay? Was there a drought? Fertilizer

587
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,320
Did you get it or not? or somebody somewhere

588
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,720
Did you not get any illness? All of this is recorded

589
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,760
It will happen in that one year of treeing. Right?

590
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,600
And year after year they will continue to grow into trees. If

591
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,960
You are a good reader of these trees. You

592
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,600
can read the 50 years personality of this

593
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
Tree. Provided you are a good reader. To you

594
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,320
Must be a good read. then you

595
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,480
You can read and understand what that tree has suffered

596
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,080
Everything can contribute to your life

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,559
Is. And this is what maturity is

598
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,240
Being non judgemental that year this tree

599
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,159
Why is it thin? Oh brother, that year it dried up

600
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,159
It was lying there. Water not available, nutrition not available

601
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,600
That's why this happened. in this tree this one

602
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,400
Why did this lump appear on the tree?

603
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,480
Illness had arrived. The tree was fighting disease.

604
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
That's why it appeared inside him. As such

605
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
It will happen with humans. brother Ranveer's

606
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
This lump is visible in the personality.

607
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,919
Why did you come? Or I could be judgemental

608
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,679
Or it is Ranveer's life too. very bad man

609
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,440
Is. He is a good man. whichever one or the other

610
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,440
The way could be that I am non judgemental.

611
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
Because I know that every person

612
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
Our personalities also have rings

613
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,400
That which is visible. so i will look at

614
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,039
and should I say no this year or this month or

615
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,080
In this part of life, a certain person

616
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,559
This thing was true which was visible in his personality

617
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,640
It has been happening. Because if you know this thing

618
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,880
are able to read that a certain person's

619
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,039
You will know what is in your personality

620
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
What work can you do with it

621
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,159
And which work is not wise to get done?

622
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Is. At the end of the day success is all about

623
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,799
Getting work done. success is all about

624
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,360
Getting Work

625
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:14,000
Done. But the work isn't down to just that

626
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,840
Execution. No it is not with art

627
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,120
Have to do it. Not just to do with art.

628
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,039
Execution: Maybe you created systems

629
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,559
If you give it will happen. But

630
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:26,320
originality

631
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,120
Originality is the responsibility of the one who

632
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,640
There is work. He is the only one who can bring it. You have your one

633
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,559
Did the ideation. You made up an idea. and that

634
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Or it will remain only at the level of thought.

635
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,880
Let's enjoy that too. honestly i this

636
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,600
I do not believe that when all the ideas come down to earth

637
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,080
They are useful only when they go. the moment when

638
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,919
You created a joy came to you at that very moment.

639
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,679
But when you see it in a tangible form,

640
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,840
He has a different kick after execution

641
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,080
Is. Whatever we have talked about and come

642
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,000
feel it's very very useful for a young

643
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,480
Professional. even if they don't understand

644
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,200
It's on the surface level.

645
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,000
These thoughts sit in their minds and turn into trees.

646
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,679
I will go one day. that's what i feel which

647
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
is why come back to that practical

648
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,039
Exercise. because one of my aunts said this

649
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,200
taught me that if you are 22 years old

650
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,440
and you yourself don't know what to do in your career

651
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Have to do it. Or if you have five UPSC

652
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,679
The attempts are over. Same Position

653
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,919
lost but with

654
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,520
Data

655
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,080
Points.

656
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,840
Ah I feel I should buy a paper. from five

657
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
10 self identification points of yourself

658
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,559
You should write about personality. That

659
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:39,360
I am this, I am this, I am this. at the same time

660
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,840
Three such strengths should be written down once a day. That

661
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
These three things probably made my career

662
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,159
can move forward. When I was 22 years old,

663
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,120
My three strengths that I listed out

664
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,720
What he did was fitness and communication

665
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,840
skills, and marketing. Marketing to me

666
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,399
I understood that because there was a lot of marketing

667
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,559
Had done all the internships. personality

668
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,240
was good in college and was very fit and

669
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,360
I also did a fitness course. So

670
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,399
There was an understanding of fitness science. those three things

671
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,679
I sat with the

672
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,559
I thought about it and eventually I decided that yes

673
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,760
Maybe I can become a fitness YouTuber. Correct

674
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,080
Is. Started a fitness YouTube channel. There

675
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,760
From became a fashion youtuber. Great. Fashion

676
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,480
From YouTuber to podcaster again.

677
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,960
Definitely have a nice journey. and podcaster

678
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,880
After being made now we are going moving on to the

679
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,880
Next stage. which will also be about

680
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
Business YouTube. But that is the beginning

681
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,080
It was done through paper. Ok? and this same paper,

682
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Notebook,

683
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,760
This is what Penn is trying to highlight

684
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,919
yes for the audience. that friend do this

685
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Do exercise. At the beginning of his career

686
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,520
Write three or four strains of your own. But every year

687
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,240
10 selfies with a pen and paper

688
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,919
Write down the identification points, especially the

689
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,320
Negative things that make you feel embarrassed

690
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,960
The things you judge by are your weaknesses

691
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,640
Yourself

692
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,600
about variant i think it's actually a

693
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,679
life long process it is it is but it is

694
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,799
not just that i mean there is a different

695
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,200
version of it which i do in the class cool

696
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,919
If we understand this properly by combining it with our

697
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,640
He said that we have some weaknesses.

698
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,399
Yes and we have some strengths. These

699
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Normally this is what we call corporates

700
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,039
I do it too. Sort Analysis,

701
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,279
Strength, weakness etc. butt of humans

702
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,840
Sort analysis takes place. be technical

703
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,640
It can. But I'll take it one step further

704
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,960
I am going to ask. For the last 22 years I have been

705
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
I am working on taking interviews. Mock

706
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
Interviews in which people appear for main exam

707
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,039
Let me clear it. then come in front of me

708
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,200
Are. we people i mean in front of us

709
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,919
They come and we take the interview. And

710
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Based on that, this is my understanding

711
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:54,200
that if we understand from this principle who is successful

712
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,679
Who succeeded and who did not? In between these

713
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,480
Are the differences based only on individual traits?

714
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,880
Are there differences? Differences in Individual Qualities

715
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,799
Or is there a bigger difference than that? like you did

716
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,360
I told you there are some things, that is the base.

717
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,960
Like hard work is fine, hard work has to be done.

718
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,200
No one will be successful without hard work. Ok

719
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,200
No? Hard work, commitment and dedication is required. Correct

720
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,799
Isn't it? and individual trades that occur

721
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,399
Rest of the CF but is this a thing to be in itself

722
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,120
is the differentiating factor. unfortunately

723
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,840
no because all the people or most of the people

724
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,440
You are keeping these trades, right? Brother

725
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,799
I am preparing for UPSC

726
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,240
I am coming to UPSC but this is not all

727
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,760
Will be applicable on . to prepare for UPSC

728
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
Every person knows that hard work is necessary

729
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,080
Will have to do it. He is working hard for 810 hours

730
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,480
Is. The commitment is already showing. away from home

731
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,960
He is coming and staying here. The dedication is already showing. Dream

732
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,279
He already has it. Is it okay? Everything is there.

733
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,120
But unfortunately everyone has it.

734
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,600
So any of these differentiating factors

735
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,440
does not survive. hum because everybody is doing the

736
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,640
Same thing. Every person is working hard. every

737
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,559
The person is showing dedication. every person

738
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,000
Showing commitment. Things like that.

739
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,679
So what are the differentiating factors?

740
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,080
one carefully and I will give this to the class

741
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,880
I do exercise. I say that this is

742
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,679
It is up to you whether you succeed or fail

743
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,240
All these things are required in this. but this big

744
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,159
These are minor variables in the equation.

745
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,080
Unfortunately I am saying unfortunately.

746
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
Unfortunately the major variables are in your hands

747
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Not there. What are those variables? that is

748
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,159
What are your privileges? And your

749
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,440
What are deprivations? Is it okay? where are you

750
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,880
Were born? Which was your school? on your own

751
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,640
The family you were born in

752
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,399
What did dad do? who has them

753
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,799
From what privileges were available? Which ones

754
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,679
Were there resources? did you go to IIT or Changmal

755
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,760
Went to inter college. All This Gonna Matter

756
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,960
Because there are the social structure. so there

757
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,480
our privileges and similarly they are

758
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,039
Departures. This is what I say in class

759
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,720
I exercise with my kids

760
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,559
Identify your 10 identity markers.

761
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,440
In the Same Way as You Say the Strength to Me

762
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,840
Recognize. 10 Identity Markers You Know

763
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,919
Which class do you come from? Financial

764
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,440
The situation is yours. which area do you come from

765
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,120
Are? What is your religion? your race

766
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
Etc. etc. you can create your 10 identities

767
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
Identify the markers. what is your language

768
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,159
is it c? do you know english or not

769
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,559
Is. Is it okay? marker and beyond

770
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,720
Write whether he is privileged or

771
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,640
He is deprived. let's have it in

772
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,960
Categories only. Is it okay? Obviously I

773
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,120
No it's a spectrum. but it is easy to

774
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
Identify whether you are privileged or not

775
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,159
So what is your language? So you say that

776
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,600
You come from an English-speaking family

777
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,360
Are. You are good in English. so you

778
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,519
Are privileged. and you say no

779
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,240
I only know Bhojpuri so you are

780
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,760
Dipped. Right? You did not do this society

781
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
has done it. But on the basis of this, just look at these

782
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,039
Make a list of these 10. Out of these 10

783
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,039
In front of how many have you written P Privilege

784
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,559
And how many have deprivation written in front of them?

785
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,039
Count it. and then please work on each off

786
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,039
It. if it is a privilege and I am

787
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,120
Making a point here. if it is a

788
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,120
Privilege then you have to work to

789
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,840
Transients that privilege. You have to do this for your

790
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,760
You have the privilege because you are a man

791
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,760
I was born like this because I was born in a rich family

792
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,720
because you need to go to an English school

793
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,039
sent in etc etc then you have to do this

794
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,120
in the next one year that you will get this

795
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,760
We had received privileges and they have to be encroached upon.

796
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,679
you have to go by

797
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,639
this and if it deprives you,

798
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,240
Deprivation is more than you have to work to

799
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,679
Overcome this. Not always in your hand. so it

800
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,399
will it take its going to be a long life

801
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,000
Long project. Is it okay? our country

802
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,679
In many cases I work my whole life

803
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
Even after doing this, you can not use that privilege

804
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,720
Can't complete the deprivation that you need

805
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,879
Got it from birth. but still work on

806
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,000
Dec. If you are able to work on these two

807
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,599
things it is going to be more than

808
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,240
Working on individual trades as you can.

809
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,000
And this is how it works. Trust Me It Works.

810
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,399
because i have seen this in my life

811
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,919
It works. I'm sure I did that

812
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,760
I have met students whose lives

813
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,359
I work in. So I hope so

814
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,760
that work in the life of many people

815
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,240
Will do it. We have basically covered three exercises

816
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
The list has been got out. First exercise three

817
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Put out the strength list. Right? by the force of

818
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
But I want to make my own career.

819
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,400
weaknesses then 10 these privileges or

820
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,920
Deprivation points. Right? that where you from

821
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,760
Have you come? Etsetra Etsetra. End

822
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Unfortunately, for some people, 10s

823
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,839
Point depreciation occurred. yes here privilege

824
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,079
Privilege happened here. and unfortunately

825
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,240
both its a sad story both ways

826
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,599
Trust me. This is the reality of India. yes this

827
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,960
This is the reality of India. I am in my class

828
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
I teach such girls. we are the class

829
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,079
I do it. This is when I teach identity

830
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,839
yes, this is the exercise of that paper. And

831
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,160
I tell the students that you

832
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
Tell me with your imagination in Vijay Chauhan's

833
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,359
There is deprivation and there are privileges. and in

834
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,839
Most points ahead of Vijay Chauhan

835
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,920
Privilege is written there. I say you

836
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,520
tell me when you compare yourself to me

837
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,599
So you can feel that

838
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,760
I had so many privileges. You

839
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,359
How will we fight the battle? if it comes to fighting

840
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,520
will come. Thankfully this is not a fight. I am so

841
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,599
I am teaching them. This is an important

842
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,480
I always think about this factor. that's why I

843
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,480
This collective is more important than this individual

844
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,079
because he asked for all these deprivations

845
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,240
were not there. Now he has earned these privileges

846
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,560
weren't there either. met most of the

847
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,000
Privileges because 15-20 year olds

848
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,000
I am talking about. to them which they have

849
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,839
Those are privileges given by parents, family

850
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,599
privileges given by the society

851
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,760
Are. He did not do anything in that.

852
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,599
Such deprivation is also not their fault.

853
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,720
have been given to them. But they had to fight

854
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,839
Such is the penetration. Stepping Away From Privilege

855
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,560
It is also the same. what we talked about that judgement

856
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,440
move away from. Yes. Right. if you are able to

857
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,359
Unj You Are Able to Transcend Your Privilege

858
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,640
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS

859
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,040
His absences were working behind him. This much

860
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,800
There are more value adding podcasts. I don't

861
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,560
No. I mean I am saying what I believe

862
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
in.

863
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,280
All the things I have not learned in the last 10 years

864
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,480
I have learnt it. we are giving people in a podcast

865
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,760
To.

866
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
The exercise I was mentioning that

867
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,960
exercise itself comes from a place of

868
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,800
Privilege. it's no i didn't want to

869
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,040
Say it in these many words. i didn't want

870
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,760
to say in these many words that's why i

871
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,680
Brother I was being polite here. But this is what

872
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,200
When we look at this thing at the individual level

873
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Because that’s what management schools do.

874
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,240
This is what management schools tell us because

875
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
All the kids who have come before him are those who are 20

876
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,320
I have come after seeing the fees of Rs one lakh. So to them this

877
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,160
It seems very easy to teach, look at you

878
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,160
You have to see your strength to get the work done

879
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,079
And they need to be sharpened even more. I

880
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,240
Sometimes I say that whoever you consider as your strength

881
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,079
I am saying once on the individual level

882
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,800
please put your hand on his heart for a little while

883
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,640
Find the source. for example i am

884
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,520
Doing this exercise. you mentioned about

885
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,200
Three things. You said about fitness. Right?

886
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,520
the second thing you mentioned about your

887
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,119
Communication and the third thing you mentioned.

888
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,079
Marketing. Right?

889
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,320
just be honest here how much of it is

890
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,280
actually a product of your private all of

891
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,079
it's 100% what i said about myself i mean

892
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,160
there were some deviations in my initial life

893
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,599
but most of the time now it is coming out

894
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,400
of privilege so this matter is a little bit

895
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,160
It also makes us honest and honest towards ourselves

896
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
A little bit shouldn't be too much

897
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,320
But it also makes you a little self critical

898
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,560
It also teaches a little self-criticism. Own

899
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,000
A little criticism. like you said no

900
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
that you distance yourself a little bit

901
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Let's see, friend, the things that I have known till now

902
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,839
I was assuming my earnings, a lot of them

903
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,720
These things were not my earnings. I was given the

904
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,480
Or it fell into my hands. to someone we

905
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,720
not even found guilty of privilege

906
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,040
Can. trust me i am very very

907
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,200
It is clear to me that I cannot tell anyone now

908
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,280
that brother you are rich and that is why you start

909
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,280
Luthing. no privileges whatsoever is the way

910
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Deprivation from someone by giving application

911
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,839
I did not take it. someone has the privilege because

912
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,119
They too should not be judged. But if this

913
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,760
You have your own privileges then you must work

914
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,680
Should be done. I'm just telling them

915
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,480
To transcend. Don't even want to leave it.

916
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,480
Being mindful of your privileges is a

917
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,599
Variant Step in Your Life. Self

918
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,160
Awareness. Exactly. Two exercises talk

919
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,960
Curry. To get the strength list out first. Second

920
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,520
This is Privilege versus Deprivation

921
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,119
Third Exercise: Self Identification

922
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,960
Factors behind societal self

923
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,560
Identification. Ok? Because the one who

924
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,119
Exercise of Privilege Versus Deprivation

925
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,079
Yes, they are all social. Right now this is mine

926
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,240
The third list is this is from the perspective

927
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,960
Of self improvement. Ok? then i would

928
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,599
To divide it into two parts. may be the

929
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,680
The first five are areas you can improve.

930
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,440
No what else can I do? what are

931
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,119
My actual weaknesses? This is very important

932
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,920
At this stage.

933
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,079
and the next five probably I don't know

934
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,760
More Self-Identification Factors That You Can Know

935
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,680
From what perspective do you view the world? own

936
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
From what perspective do you look at life? Where

937
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,720
Do you want to go? you know dreams dreams

938
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,880
and aspirations if all these things are yours

939
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,359
Are in front. It's a very strong mirror too

940
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,760
Work from. Assuming that you are executing

941
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:43,200
You are doing it, you are working hard etc.

942
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,200
But Sir, I would like to ask you this now, please accept

943
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,760
If there is a person who has that privilege

944
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,160
Versus deprivation everywhere on the chart

945
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,000
Deprivation or deprivation in many places

946
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,320
Six out of 10 deprivation points or

947
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Even five out of 10 that person is third

948
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,920
How to Approach the List of My Weaknesses

949
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,720
and dreams and aspirations

950
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,880
you rightly point out a predicament here

951
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,280
There is a kind of irony here, an RNA

952
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,160
Which needs to be understood. Yes. This exercise which

953
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
I have told you many times that this exercise is also for you

954
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,760
Exercises that come out of your privileges

955
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,520
that if you assume that you have this

956
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,599
I made a list of eight, nine or ten of them.

957
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,359
If the privilege comes out then you are already on the elephant

958
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,119
Went and boarded it. You are all over the world

959
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,200
It has been happening. But like you said, there is no

960
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,560
The person is mostly depressed. They

961
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,560
How did you nurture your dreams? how does he fulfil his dreams

962
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,680
try to do. So I have used this

963
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,640
Talked about overcoming depreciation. You

964
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,359
Society cannot be changed immediately. an ideal society

965
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,160
In an ideal society such a situation does not arise

966
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,520
Should have come. but our society

967
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,680
also reproduces deprivations and

968
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,440
It also reproduces privileges.

969
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,359
It is very easy to understand. Did you understand it?

970
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Let's say your parents are very wealthy.

971
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,599
There were persons. What to do? to our own child

972
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,520
Will put you in school. This is their job, brother.

973
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,200
What happened to being a parent?

974
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,319
Privileges reproduce privileges

975
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,480
Did. Same reproductiveism as deprivation

976
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,160
It goes together as well. They are poor parents. Poor thing

977
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,599
If you cannot send them to school or if you do

978
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,359
will send him to some poor school where he

979
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,319
And he might be learning less. Hence the major point

980
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,839
There are two things. Forest

981
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:23,520
Because this is not an ideal society. Ideal

982
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,440
If there was a society then the poor child would also be in the same school

983
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,240
The school where a rich man's child would be going

984
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,839
I would have been going. So despite this poverty

985
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,599
The impact of deprivation would be less because

986
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,240
Reproduction would have been less but we are not

987
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,480
Living in an Ideal Society. So a society like this

988
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,720
in whichever you are, the child coming from depression

989
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,839
are they or are they for them these deprivations

990
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,680
a way to overcome

991
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,520
So you need to start exercising.

992
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,240
But secondly you also have to understand that

993
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,920
You don't have to have the exact same dreams

994
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,480
The compulsion you have with that person

995
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,200
Who has constant privileges. this to this

996
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,640
The way I say it is,

997
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Please do a reality check. Ouch. Ok?

998
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,760
and try and start working on a

999
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,359
The Incremental Thing. Ok? my language

1000
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,000
If I talk about it then I would say straight IAS

1001
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,680
Don't think of becoming one. Then if you have it

1002
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It is not that you can tolerate five failures

1003
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,000
Can be done. Assume four failure tolerance

1004
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,599
You have to be there in the sixth attempt. Your

1005
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,160
You have the right to tolerate five failures

1006
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,839
There must be an ecosystem nearby. a thriving place

1007
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,119
The person coming from Five Failures

1008
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,880
can tolerate it. Five startups

1009
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,560
Can tolerate failure. five second

1010
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,160
Can tolerate failure. but you

1011
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,319
Can't do it. So what do you do? you again

1012
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,960
Do it incrementally. let's start with the

1013
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,200
SSC Preparation. Ok? now this is

1014
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,880
What I am saying is wrong. in a sense that

1015
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,520
In an ideal society such a situation should not arise

1016
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,000
A motivational speaker should have said this

1017
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,720
That you should dream small. I am saying that the

1018
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,040
People are saying always dream big. that

1019
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,680
is coming from certain privileges. You

1020
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,319
Start with your reality check. first thing

1021
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,280
because any dream can happen to individuals

1022
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:01,040
Have written whole papers on this. dreams and

1023
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,079
Aspirations are constructs

1024
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,400
There are. They are not objective. so

1025
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,160
The whole country has the same dreams

1026
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,160
But this is a scary thing. first of all you

1027
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,440
Made them stand at different places. Then all of the

1028
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,040
Take all the different dreams of the same person. That means that

1029
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,960
Everyone's starting point is different. or else

1030
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,119
I told you that this is everyone's target. Who

1031
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,280
Everybody knows he will win. I am one of life

1032
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,800
I would like to talk about the truth sir.

1033
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,640
Please do what Virat does for us in cricket

1034
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,480
It is Kohli. HARD WORK,

1035
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,240
Success,

1036
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,480
A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT A COBI BRAND

1037
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,200
There is a famous Nike ad which is actually their

1038
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,520
It is based on mentality.

1039
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,920
That’s basically what he’s saying there. and their

1040
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Mentality is not known all over the world

1041
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,440
This is age Mamba mentality. because their

1042
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,280
The nickname was Black Mamba which was the name of a snake

1043
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,960
It happens. Right? because when you see them

1044
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
You will watch those basketball clips, right?

1045
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,240
Plays exactly like an aggressive snake.

1046
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,640
Play with a lot of concentration and dedication.

1047
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,640
And he was famous for his training regime.

1048
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,400
That means the discipline was of a very high level

1049
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,599
their. But the logic of his life was basic.

1050
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,760
That friend, you don't need to become a parent

1051
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,800
Not there. All you need is Betterment.

1052
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,119
That was a simple message from Nikki. don't worry

1053
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,480
About the long term. just try getting

1054
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,800
Better Everyday. Just get better. That's all. I

1055
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,880
I think this is somewhere, especially me

1056
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,599
I am looking around in my age group

1057
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,680
Many people are forgetting this. to Betterment

1058
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,760
leave it it's easier to get better through your

1059
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,839
20h. I don't drive that much after 30 years

1060
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,520
In many cases, they get removed. come in many

1061
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,440
Let's go. See this also, two groups are being formed.

1062
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,280
The one who is chasing Betterment. Others

1063
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,800
Those who left Betterment with a little

1064
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,960
Is. This is what I observe. a butt please

1065
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,480
Correct me if I am wrong. so i feel that

1066
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,119
Even if you don't have privilege in your life

1067
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,000
Even then this logic will apply. Exactly

1068
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,920
it is a matter of getting better somewhere

1069
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,720
try that's what i said overcoming the

1070
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,880
This is what devolution of privileges means

1071
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,480
that and that's why i am saying be a better

1072
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,000
Person Than You Were Yesterday. Lived this many times.

1073
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,000
IATA change is 1% change. Suppose you are racing

1074
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,599
Reached the track and another one with you

1075
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The person is standing. You said I will do this

1076
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,079
I will leave it behind to run. It is possible

1077
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,920
He's an Olympian. Is it okay? It is possible

1078
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,680
He might have given that thing 15 years ago.

1079
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,680
Maybe he has some other privilege.

1080
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,000
Don't compare yourself with that person.

1081
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,720
Compare yourself with you of yesterday.

1082
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,920
If you work for this much then you are disrespectful

1083
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,800
Your deprivations. You will be able to overcome

1084
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,400
Many many aspects of your depression.

1085
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,240
Brother, when I look at myself, I

1086
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,920
I see that yes I did and I am nothing

1087
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,079
I can do it. I cannot claim that

1088
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,599
I am the best teacher in the world. Country

1089
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,960
I am the best teacher. I claim this

1090
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,280
can't. I just more and more

1091
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,000
I can claim that last semester

1092
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,680
Like I taught it. I am trying to

1093
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I can hope that I can meet him this semester

1094
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,560
I will teach better. Vijendra as a human being

1095
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,720
Chauhan comes out of the poverty that he faced

1096
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,040
Is. Vijendra Chauhan, a poor slum in Delhi

1097
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,760
It comes out from. On that basis I

1098
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,079
I have travelled something. i may not be on

1099
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,880
The Top of the World. Is it okay? I may not

1100
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,280
B and I don't intend to. But I have read that

1101
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,400
I have done the journey. journey is

1102
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,000
Morant Then

1103
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,079
Destination. There is another career factor.

1104
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,240
And I would love for you to break this down

1105
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,880
Career factor and what ever. and disagree

1106
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:36,400
with me. I call this factor ethical

1107
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,640
Messy behavior. Right? I will answer you. this people

1108
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,880
Also called street smarts.

1109
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:46,560
Don't hurt anyone's feelings, or anyone's career

1110
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:50,800
Do not hurt anyone in life

1111
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:54,680
Don’t bring a pen. Yet a little bit of bastardry is alive

1112
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:58,160
Keep it for your own protection. End

1113
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:02,280
A To move forward faster. Self

1114
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:06,160
To accelerate the career of. See if this

1115
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,560
If it is in your control then I don't think so

1116
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,560
Is there any problem in this? I am from an example

1117
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,720
If I tell you, maybe you will understand better

1118
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,319
I will come. You will now find out that

1119
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,319
About my privileges and deprivations

1120
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,720
What are my principles? On that basis I

1121
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,280
I often say one thing. I say that

1122
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,000
If and when you understand the reference to this

1123
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,440
You will understand. I say that if you

1124
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,040
of Uttar Pradesh, of Bihar, of Rajasthan

1125
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,040
Which is called Hindi region. many people

1126
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,800
This is called cow belt, cow dung strip

1127
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,839
Are. Many call it Hindi speaking states. whichever you

1128
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,720
Call it right. here are the boys coming from

1129
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,760
So I say that you should study hard to become an IAS.

1130
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,240
If it comes to your mind then

1131
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,240
Should be rejected. think again

1132
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,079
Needed has it come again or not

1133
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,560
Even if I want to become one, please reject me.

1134
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,880
Think about it for the third time. survives even after three times

1135
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,319
If it is there then become it. and here comes the second thing

1136
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,920
Which is about you. but if you are in this area

1137
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:02,000
She is a girl from and not in your mind

1138
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,599
I also want to become an IAS. but you have to leave home

1139
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,119
It is proposed that son Delhi

1140
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,040
Go and get ready. Grab it quickly.

1141
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,880
Now you can see that this makes sense

1142
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,040
I have the smartness that I'm saying

1143
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,520
if you are a boy then I am saying that

1144
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,960
This isn't yours at all. Someone else gave me the dream

1145
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,119
has given it. You are being sent forcibly.

1146
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,599
The family members need God. family members

1147
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,400
needs money. money as dowry to the family

1148
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,319
Needed The family members felt a kind of

1149
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,480
The word going around in the area is 'we want Bhaukaal'.

1150
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,359
That's why I am asking you to become an IAS.

1151
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,599
But if you are a girl and you have to face even more liars

1152
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,440
It is said that go son and prepare yourself

1153
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
Grab it immediately and that one next

1154
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,440
The smart thing is coming and the ethical thing is going

1155
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,559
It is a matter of cleverness. I say this

1156
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,880
Why? So if you go to Delhi

1157
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,520
they prepare and after 2 years of preparation

1158
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,400
You would not have been selected. even then in this 2 years

1159
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:56,559
Living in a big city, away from the confines of home

1160
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,680
Staying away, freedom, it teaches you so much

1161
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,160
which otherwise you will not be able to learn. Now

1162
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,480
This is a kind of cleverness. with family members

1163
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,920
There is definitely some dishonesty involved as well.

1164
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,280
Is it okay? Dishonesty in the sense that the family

1165
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,480
They are saying that become an IAS. You know

1166
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,880
That you don’t even have to become. you also want

1167
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,960
Not there. Maybe you have that thing inside you

1168
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,280
There is no caliber of variety either. But you

1169
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,680
I know that this path is giving

1170
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,079
you some taste of freedom which otherwise is

1171
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,520
not available to girls of this particular

1172
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:27,240
Reese. So what happened to one kind of thing? exactly

1173
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,880
Same is applicable on other things. If this

1174
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:34,160
cleverness to bypass those deprivations

1175
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Comes with tools of. We, including you, have no

1176
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,960
There was no role. Your Society Provided to You

1177
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,160
gave you, were social and gave you a little

1178
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,960
You are able to cleverly bypass it.

1179
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,520
I don't see any arm in it. so would you

1180
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,920
also that the more the privilege the more

1181
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,079
More cleverness on the contrary what I am

1182
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,079
Saying so awesome. I'm saying if you are

1183
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,559
Coming from deprivation then some cleverness is

1184
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,040
It is forgiveable.

1185
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,680
Ok? If you are coming from deprivation.

1186
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,839
If you are coming from privileged

1187
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,720
Otherwise you will find meanness in your language

1188
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,040
Teaches. Is it okay? and you his and

1189
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,720
If you are using it more then it is like

1190
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,800
you are already on a horse and you have the most

1191
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,880
That sharp sword was also given. you will

1192
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:24,400
End up killing people work deprecated. We

1193
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,839
If you already assume that it means Mumbai

1194
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,079
I am saying this because I am sitting here. let's assume

1195
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,599
You come from a star family. Struggle

1196
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,520
I am doing this to enter Bollywood. Correct

1197
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,040
Isn't it? Already comes from a star family.

1198
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,520
All the directors know. to dad

1199
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,960
The producers know. Is it okay? and such

1200
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,720
I mean something else which you are calling cleverness

1201
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,200
They were also trying to suppress these four people

1202
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,000
For. That's unfair to some extent. But

1203
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,960
This is also the truth of the world. Exactly this

1204
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,640
It also happens. in fact these are the privileges

1205
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,559
You have this cleverness and more

1206
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:58,480
I teach because these privileges have

1207
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,640
It is seen that to survive and to thrive.

1208
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,880
If you have these things inside you, then you

1209
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,160
will do better because a big fight will follow

1210
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,839
In fact, Joe

1211
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,440
There are rightful contenders to suppress them

1212
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,319
fight with. Sir, I know the feeling of meanness

1213
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,240
There is a place and there is also a degree. Yes

1214
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:19,280
There is also a degree. more or less but one of his

1215
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,119
There should be a limit. Exactly and for me

1216
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,920
And I know we probably disagree a little

1217
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,680
Bit on this but for me that bastard I

1218
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,440
I limit my likes because of God

1219
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,440
I always think in my mind that

1220
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,480
God is watching everything and he is thinking

1221
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,800
Let's live our life, no one cares about it

1222
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,160
Welcome to Ristron wherever it comes from. Ok

1223
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,319
No? but I mean you know I

1224
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,359
I am relatively an atheist person. so I

1225
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,200
I don't leave it at that thing. But

1226
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,240
Certainly, I take it for granted that

1227
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,720
Being ethical is the responsibility of being a human being.

1228
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,800
But how do you bring in this limitingness again?

1229
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,160
Look, you can think of it this way, maybe

1230
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,160
This is the age difference. atheism which

1231
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,520
not believing in god is

1232
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,800
This is the stage after believing

1233
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,720
Is. There is no stage before this. you understand

1234
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,400
Are you getting it? This is after that, all of us, all of us

1235
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,559
People's families would just make a theist and move on

1236
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,119
Isn't it? when you transcend it

1237
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,160
say no maybe now I'm at that level

1238
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,880
I have reached the point where I can be moral

1239
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,680
I don't need the extra curbs.

1240
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,920
I accept my responsibility to

1241
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,200
I will remain ethical. Brother where did you come from ultimately

1242
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,680
These? This is the success of faith in God

1243
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,000
Where does the whole philosophy come from? It comes from this

1244
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,480
When a human is born, he has to do some work

1245
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,800
Some good deeds are bad. You had to give this sense, right?

1246
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,040
Anyone. Earlier there was no state. after

1247
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,040
When I came to the state, it was decided that this

1248
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,800
It is a crime, it is not a crime. So the law is

1249
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,480
I started thinking that if you do any such work

1250
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,240
if you do something that is not good for the society

1251
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,119
You can be sent to jail. to you and others

1252
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,640
crime criminal wala which is justice delivery

1253
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,119
They can do it. Earlier even this was not there.

1254
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,720
So why would anyone do this? It was said that

1255
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,280
No, you are doing anything. There's somebody who sees

1256
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,319
Used to be. Is it okay? So you are in awe of this someone

1257
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,160
I was doing ethical work. become moral

1258
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,599
because you were afraid that otherwise

1259
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,680
In the Past After Life

1260
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:18,400
You will have to go to hell. you have another

1261
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,240
Had to do something. but once you as a human

1262
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,720
Being

1263
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:25,280
Realize once you realize that

1264
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,960
no not because someone is watching you

1265
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,680
Being moral is the essence of being human

1266
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,160
There is responsibility. Once you feel this inside you

1267
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,359
If it comes, you will get the whip of this extra control

1268
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,280
the need will be reduced. It will end. One

1269
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,359
Once this time comes you don't have to fear it

1270
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,440
is it not because I will die for it

1271
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,079
Afterwards I will get heaven or hell. So that

1272
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,240
To be moral in this life is to be human

1273
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,760
Because it is my responsibility. This one time

1274
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,079
If you realize then you will get this extra

1275
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,920
There will be no need for controls. So this is his

1276
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,119
It is a later stage. there is no earlier stage

1277
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,880
that you because you want to mess everything up

1278
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,680
That is why you don't believe in God.

1279
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,880
But also only 1% people are able to do this. Very

1280
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,480
It's going to be difficult but mind it

1281
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,440
This thing is going on a lot these days. so

1282
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,680
You may have noticed that those who believe

1283
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,359
There are also people like you, I am not talking about them. You

1284
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,000
So a little bit of spirituality

1285
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,839
Philosophy must have been created. But most people

1286
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,760
only for your god only for your god

1287
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,920
Believe. If the rest of the 400 religions are accepted then

1288
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,000
If taken for 399 then that too is no confidence

1289
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,480
I do the same. even if you are a very great

1290
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,040
Devout Believer You Are Believer Only 255%

1291
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,640
Because for the rest of the believers you are

1292
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,559
Atheist. You don’t believe in Islam.

1293
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,920
You are not believing in Allah. You

1294
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,400
Don't believe in Sikhism.

1295
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,240
I am not doing it in Buddhism. African Banging

1296
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,400
I am not doing it in religion. stay in india

1297
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,760
The surnames are not in the code. you india

1298
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,839
We are not doing it in the religion of the tribals.

1299
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,359
You are 399 out of 400, even you are not sure

1300
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,040
are doing it. We are doing it in the same way. I

1301
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,359
I'm not doing it in even one of those. Bus

1302
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,359
That's the only difference. a while ago we

1303
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,400
Talked about privilege. then there are some

1304
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,280
People where 10 out of 10 points are privileged

1305
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,040
come to the section

1306
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:11,599
Will go. People I've met through the show.

1307
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:15,680
International guests too who are the richest and

1308
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,800
The most evolved, the most powerful, the most successful

1309
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:22,480
There are people who can do this. Others

1310
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:24,240
Apathy towards religion Yes but that's also n

1311
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,240
The Outcome of Huge Privilege. Hughes

1312
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,160
Privilege agreed but at the same time please

1313
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:35,200
Understand what it is always going to be

1314
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:37,359
Easy to hate. We would be the easiest to hate.

1315
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,839
well why is it that we assume

1316
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,359
I believe in this religion. I am not

1317
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,839
I believe but suppose I follow this religion

1318
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:46,079
I agree. Yes and I believe in that religion

1319
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,119
Is. I also respect him. But B

1320
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:52,400
My attitude towards the religion which I do not believe in

1321
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,720
not only is there despondency inside but it could be

1322
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,880
I hate it. Where could this have come from? this this thing

1323
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,599
May have come from. Mostly it must have come from this

1324
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,160
because either I was told that from a

1325
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,799
The condition of loving someone is that you are a

1326
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,400
I hate or dislike everyone else. either

1327
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,079
I have been told this. It could be someone

1328
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,680
It may be done in religion. Or I can call B

1329
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,839
I don't know it. We are strangers. stranger kiss

1330
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,599
produces the thing? creates fear.

1331
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,240
Because where did religions originate from? those

1332
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,160
Born from tribes, right? Tribals

1333
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,040
Born from tribes, right? we are all tribals

1334
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,960
It was there only. So this was the condition in the tribes.

1335
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,839
If you want to survive, you have to stay alive.

1336
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,960
This is a fight for survival if you are the other

1337
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:36,000
The people of the tribe do not suspect him

1338
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,480
If you keep it, and don't doubt it, then it will never tell you

1339
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,680
can finish it. This fear is actually due to unfamiliarity

1340
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,920
Is born. If you work very hard,

1341
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,799
If you try very consciously, then

1342
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,200
You can probably get the most equal distance. But

1343
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,280
In most cases you have an attachment to one

1344
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,960
and unfortunately for everyone else

1345
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,640
Al attachment is developed. i feel kit

1346
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,040
Whatever experiences of life

1347
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,640
No, I mean I knew that at a young age I had a lot of

1348
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,680
I have seen something. I'm not just talking

1349
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,319
About the control. i am also talking

1350
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:11,319
About all the good stuff. Definitely. Gin

1351
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:15,200
I have met people. I came from my own idol

1352
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:18,240
Whatever dreams I had in my heart during college

1353
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,200
all of which were completed by the time I was 26 or

1354
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,000
27 I'm 32 now so I've lived a very long time

1355
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,720
Nice 10 years of my career were difficult

1356
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,720
Career Butt

1357
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:33,200
There were many good moments in these 10 years

1358
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:36,160
The best of all these good moments in

1359
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,880
Moments not life changing travel based

1360
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:42,559
moments were right means this is the peak of the

1361
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:45,440
Privileges Peak of the Experiences Peak

1362
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,480
of the blessings the travel experiences

1363
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,960
When I go out and meet other people

1364
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,880
There Privately Podcast Without Camera

1365
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,079
would have done it

1366
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,400
those were the moments that really expanded

1367
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,720
My brain, why does traveling make us generous?

1368
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,200
Just think about it, this happens

1369
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,319
isn't it so when you travel

1370
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,799
Actually you believe that you learn a lot from here

1371
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,319
this happens only because of this i am

1372
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:15,839
Just saying that this gives you the same starting point

1373
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:18,160
Teaches you how to un-judge people. At home

1374
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,720
living in a city living in a town

1375
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,440
While living in the village, the more

1376
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,680
The smaller the unit, the more you will

1377
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,599
The responsibility of being judgemental comes upon us

1378
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,680
will remain. I told the girl that if she

1379
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,440
You will leave the town and come to Delhi city

1380
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,400
So this will be freedom for you. because there

1381
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,720
You can do or see such things happening

1382
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,520
Who are considered bad in your town.

1383
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,839
Don't leave the house at 7:00. told the girl

1384
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,119
Will you go? Don't leave the house at 6:30. 7 You

1385
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,799
When you reach the city you will be told no

1386
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,319
You can stay till 10:00. a little bit right now

1387
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,880
It did not happen that you became completely free.

1388
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,720
But your horizons rose a little. you are abroad

1389
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,079
If you go, you will find out whether or not the girl is on top of you

1390
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,839
What does curfew timing mean? When

1391
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:58,720
You can go as you wish. Yes. Ok. you learn to unz

1392
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,359
Because all those things which are prohibited in your place

1393
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,520
Were. Those things which you feel bad about

1394
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:06,640
It is believed. The things that you have here

1395
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,119
There is a prohibition above which is considered bad. You

1396
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,200
find that in other societies they have to face as much

1397
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,960
It is not considered bad. then it's in your mind

1398
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,200
The question arises that why is it bad for me here

1399
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,440
It is believed? You were a little critical

1400
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,040
Are. I'm right or wrong but you

1401
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,280
Even after that you might still consider him bad

1402
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,880
are. But at least he should be allowed to tolerate it

1403
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,040
Your capacity will increase because you will know

1404
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,880
that is acceptable in any other society. So

1405
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,119
You will not believe that those who live in my society

1406
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,119
It is said that everything is fine. Brother

1407
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,760
In Afghanistan, any capable man has this

1408
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,280
if his wife is according to him then he has the right

1409
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,680
If it's not working then kill her. kill him

1410
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,280
Put it. For honor, some from our country too

1411
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,599
These cases of honour killing are heard in some parts

1412
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,760
Was. You go abroad and you see that

1413
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,559
This is a society in which a girl is ignored for her body

1414
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,880
She can decide for her own relationship.

1415
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,960
When you see that you will know that it is an honour killing

1416
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,799
Will you raise a question on that or not? You

1417
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,480
You will pick it up and say that friend it is his life.

1418
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,799
She has the right to decide who she wants to be with

1419
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,559
Will she go? Whom will she marry, whom will she marry

1420
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,960
I will not do any relationship with whom

1421
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,280
She will make it, it is her right. when you think like this

1422
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,240
Let's start with, where did this come from? It is then

1423
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,520
came when you saw the bigger world and

1424
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,720
You have given bias to your previous planets

1425
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,200
You started eliminating those that were there.

1426
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,160
This is why traveling makes us generous

1427
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:23,119
Because it's also true that we can control our prejudices

1428
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,920
Ask questions. I think at every turn of life

1429
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,720
But you don't have to define your own life.

1430
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,520
Do you try? It's just an overthinking brain

1431
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,839
is the outcome.

1432
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,920
that again from the same intellectual base that if

1433
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,920
Suppose we see something unusual and we want to

1434
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,599
If you are not able to justify this then we

1435
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,280
Looks like something is wrong. then we are nobody

1436
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,119
also formulate theories that would help them

1437
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:48,559
You should be justified. at this point in life

1438
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,599
After reaching the turn, I realized that

1439
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,680
that I am working hard on myself first

1440
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,400
For the family and the team is also in the family

1441
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,119
Is included. Ok? that surrounds me

1442
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:04,960
of my tribe my people for whom every day is my

1443
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:08,079
Eyes open for them but the personal selfishness

1444
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,440
The angle of working hard is travel so that I

1445
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:14,319
can I afford the travel

1446
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,160
Actually I am hungry to study and

1447
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:18,799
My life is best because of studies and not traveling

1448
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,200
during this time you are absolutely great yes books

1449
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:26,440
without the podcast without the people on

1450
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:29,520
through think the exact opposite think that he

1451
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:32,319
Society that said don't travel. Our

1452
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:36,400
This country was once a society whose

1453
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:40,079
The rules said that you should not travel. He

1454
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,839
The person who crosses the ocean will be called a brotherhood

1455
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,079
should be removed from. It is our society’s

1456
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:48,559
It was in principles. What did he want? They

1457
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,119
Maybe it wanted you not to open your eyes.

1458
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,000
He probably wanted you to be free from prejudice

1459
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,680
You should not be free. He probably wanted you to

1460
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,359
Don't be free, learn it. that's why next

1461
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:04,880
for the next generation for the next generation we

1462
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,520
People should ensure that the

1463
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,040
There are boundaries which we call national

1464
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,400
Boundaries are called state boundaries

1465
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,040
It is said that it is the boundary of language

1466
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,680
And so on. These boundaries are actually the thinking

1467
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,359
There would be boundaries to restrict only

1468
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,119
Are. Get free from them once and for all. One

1469
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,440
So affordability is an issue in itself.

1470
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,240
But be free from it. you are a better person

1471
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:28,079
Will be made. Would you like to read this whole podcast?

1472
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:31,119
The core message is that if you have more experience in your career

1473
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:33,920
In an era where we have to move forward rapidly

1474
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,160
Where everyone is working hard. Then

1475
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,240
Street smarts are needed, Self

1476
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,480
Awareness is needed, maturity is needed

1477
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,400
There is need.

1478
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,839
Well, all these things are needed. all of these

1479
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:49,760
Things have their own processes which

1480
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:52,799
Through whom this will be decided. But my message is this

1481
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:57,599
There is a little bit more. this thing in that message

1482
01:02:52,799 --> 01:03:01,520
This also includes those who are likely to succeed rapidly.

1483
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:04,000
We have an aspiration, a little question on this too

1484
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,599
pick him up a little bit that critically

1485
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,880
It is equally important to see this as

1486
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:14,559
something else because Ranveer think about this

1487
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,400
It is true that having fame, having money, moving forward

1488
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,599
Who would not want to grow? To all

1489
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,319
It must be happening. But is this the ultimate purpose?

1490
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,640
of life does it give? Is this what life is

1491
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:27,920
Is there any meaning? There will be something besides this

1492
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,720
No? Because Hitler had everything.

1493
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,960
This was also famous. Everybody is listening to him

1494
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,480
Were. He doesn't like the people who were his own

1495
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,520
used to do it. There were people dying for him.

1496
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:41,920
Right? Was Hitler's life purposeful?

1497
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,960
What was life? I'm sure you will agree

1498
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:49,200
That it was not. so the ultimate purpose is

1499
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,839
He is not the only one who can ensure quick success

1500
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,319
It can be considered. We need to go beyond that.

1501
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:57,599
If you ask me I would like to

1502
01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:02,720
What is succulence? I will say two things. Forest

1503
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:06,640
Is this how much respect? how much respect you

1504
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:10,079
Earn, Respect, Attention, Influence

1505
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,520
From People Unlike You? who is not like you

1506
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:16,039
Is. Is it okay? that is one marker and

1507
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:21,559
second marker and i'm giving something

1508
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:25,039
Controversial. second marker is how much

1509
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:28,319
Dislike and sometimes hate but hate is too harsh

1510
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:33,720
The word sometimes how much you dislike it you get from

1511
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:37,920
The People Like You for the Privileges of

1512
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:41,200
Yours. That is also to me. In my view

1513
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,440
It is also a marker of how much you

1514
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:48,760
Think about Gandhiji while travelling.

1515
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:52,079
Gandhiji is a rich variety of Gujarat

1516
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:54,240
He was a person coming from the families of. Character

1517
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:57,039
He was a person coming from a Varnik family.

1518
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,839
But who respected Gandhiji? Mango

1519
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:03,920
The poor man. Other people did. Ok

1520
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:06,559
No? who were not like him. The Muslims

1521
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,640
the other British they were fighting

1522
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,799
other people who were not like them

1523
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,599
People respected him while his own people

1524
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:17,280
People in the community were not very happy. Correct

1525
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:19,599
Isn't it? To me, this is a marker for me.

1526
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,160
So when I'm including my

1527
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:25,039
That's why I am saying this. so when the people who tell me

1528
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,240
Like he is not respectful to me

1529
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:31,119
There are. He respects me. me me

1530
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,960
Gives identification. I feel happy. But

1531
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,079
Probably happier than when people

1532
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,240
I love those who are like me

1533
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,720
come from from from backgrounds.

1534
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,240
Which started around me. no i

1535
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,160
I'm going beyond that. I am social

1536
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,799
I am going to the categories. Nowadays I like most

1537
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,760
Which people troll the most? Those people

1538
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,520
Who are people with upper caste privilege

1539
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,680
And in what sense does it cost that this

1540
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,520
The person speaks against the upper caste. it

1541
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,400
Individuals against these social categories

1542
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,880
He speaks. Do I come from these categories.

1543
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,079
It is a point to be noted. what about me

1544
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,680
You will be abused that whatever lower caste you are

1545
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,200
All those names are abused for

1546
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,599
Taking it as given that you talk about them. You

1547
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,599
You are like them. A lot of people believe that

1548
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,920
that I probably fall into those categories

1549
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:20,240
Am. This to me is a medal. which means that

1550
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,559
Like people come to share my privileges

1551
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,920
people are disliking me

1552
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,160
Because I speak against those privileged people

1553
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,680
From which I come and from me

1554
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,520
Different people reject me or

1555
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,359
I like it. Dispite the fact that I

1556
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:38,000
I am different from them. To me this is success. This

1557
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:40,319
Attention can always be monetized also. You

1558
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,039
No attention once you have the money

1559
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,960
It is a very easy and quick process to make, I am an agency

1560
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,280
Rush to that sir you have so much attention.

1561
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,960
Do you have 10 million followers or

1562
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,960
There are so many subscribers. we will give you that

1563
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:55,280
Cat of Money. That is an easy part of it. So

1564
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:58,720
Mot monetization will get money, fame,

1565
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,640
you will get some identity is it will come

1566
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,000
In due course. That means I am not not

1567
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,760
Saying it's wrong. I'm not even saying that

1568
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,839
This is a bad thing. Should not do. But he

1569
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,880
so once you have this attention and respect come

1570
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:11,599
It will go away. I think again sir a very free

1571
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,799
I've been writing this entire podcast from a position of flow.

1572
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:17,760
had started. This was an unplanned podcast.

1573
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:20,559
but i new i am going to talk about the

1574
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,039
The Human Journey and Maturity Mainly. it

1575
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:26,440
It was my theme. I'm just sharing one thing

1576
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:29,440
And then you can shed light on it.

1577
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,280
A: They say that the five people around you

1578
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,160
There are people, you become an average of them. The

1579
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:37,200
People you spend time. It is a great truth

1580
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,280
Of life. And the game is to have a bit of

1581
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,839
Rotation in those five people. as you keep

1582
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,960
Growing Older. Little Things Like When You're

1583
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:47,200
with people older than you

1584
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,920
Spend time getting to know their personality

1585
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,440
Some things rub off on you.

1586
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,839
and i think it's wonderful for everyone

1587
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,359
Human beings like to hang out with older people.

1588
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:59,839
A very simple career hack

1589
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:03,599
Actually. If you can lead the learnings into

1590
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:05,280
Your career. a that's the final thing i want

1591
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,440
To say in this hole algorithm. because here

1592
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,440
We have drawn out a maturity algorithm

1593
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,160
I have told him to do this exercise

1594
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,839
Do exercise. But I feel that someone is different from you

1595
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,000
big one is the one with whom you have fun and who

1596
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:18,679
Challenges you with a growth mindset

1597
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,759
Tell me the time individually with them.

1598
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:25,839
Well Ranbir for the first time in this

1599
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:30,159
Conversation happened for the first time so late

1600
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:33,839
In conversation. I mean I saw your beach facing

1601
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:37,199
Balcony. I saw this seven camera setup. I

1602
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:40,640
Saw This Wonderful Studio Everything Not Even

1603
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:43,640
once i had this element in me thinking

1604
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,199
about you this is the first time having a

1605
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:52,719
In Person

1606
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:55,679
Life that is yours can criticize you

1607
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:58,279
A little bit of panic can also cause a crisis to occur

1608
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,440
It also hides

1609
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:05,040
and this is the first time i am having this

1610
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,040
Element of Envy

1611
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,960
I mean this is a personal thing that I

1612
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:13,920
Records of losing good friends in life

1613
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,920
Have made it. Ok? continuously one after the other

1614
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,080
good

1615
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:20,880
maybe my friend

1616
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:23,679
Just like you said, there are many foolish things of mine

1617
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:27,679
It happens many times or sometimes you have to take tough decisions

1618
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:29,600
I get scared. Some of you make those decisions

1619
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:34,400
You are not able to take what you should take. and you

1620
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:38,000
End up paying the price. ah so i totally

1621
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:40,719
Agree when you say that having friends

1622
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,520
especially the friends who have the ability to

1623
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:45,520
critic you and as you said you said you

1624
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,520
This is another big achievement for a little bigger than

1625
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,159
because you are with them and you are with them

1626
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,120
I am learning. There is nothing unique about this

1627
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:55,280
It doesn't exist. But he makes you feel worth it

1628
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,560
I am able to share this with you

1629
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,600
It can. Little Mature Still Believing

1630
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:05,440
And for a very long period of time. it

1631
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:09,520
There is a blessing, a blessing that you

1632
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,280
It should be kept absolutely safe. and that means i

1633
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,080
You said that I am an atheist

1634
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,960
Am. I don't believe in all these things

1635
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,360
But even then, if the evil eye falls on you

1636
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,840
It will be focused on this thing only. believe in everything else

1637
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:24,320
Do it, it doesn't matter. I came and wished that your

1638
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,640
it remains large and grows but if that

1639
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,120
Even if it doesn't happen, if you are able to hold

1640
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,719
on to this particular thing i mean it is

1641
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,280
Worth holding. Ok? so this never plays

1642
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:38,320
Musical chairs with this aspect. it's not

1643
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,159
A thing that you should be testing every day.

1644
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,040
Ok? If You Have Been Tested Once or Twice

1645
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,120
In the life that much is enough. Good Friends

1646
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,440
Hold on to it. but infact i am

1647
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,719
taking this opportunity to say sorry to all

1648
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:53,840
my friends who consider that rightly and

1649
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,080
wrongly they believe that i have been unfair to

1650
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,120
Them.

1651
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:01,120
Because it is such an achievement if you have

1652
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,800
There are some friends like this and there are only a few like this

1653
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:08,159
Needed It cannot be 100 50 150 200.

1654
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,760
There can be 100 50 150 200 quants. They

1655
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,920
It may also contribute to your life

1656
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,960
Do it. I am not at all denying that. But

1657
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,040
Friends who catch you and criticize you

1658
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,440
and in that criticism you may once again think

1659
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:23,120
It also does not appear that there is anything behind this criticism

1660
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:28,719
There are ulterior motives. this is a prized

1661
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:32,239
Position. so please have my nva

1662
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:35,280
And blessings oh that's what there is

1663
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:38,080
After the crisis, it would value it even more

1664
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:42,719
I am please do friendship why so many times

1665
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:45,920
all the people are gone the ones that stay you love them

1666
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:47,920
The Once I Had Nobody to Give Many Sure

1667
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,960
shots and nobody to give you advice but

1668
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,199
who left or suppose you think that

1669
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:57,040
He shouldn't be standing with you

1670
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:59,520
Was Needed. A little sympathy for them too

1671
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,400
Be a little compassionate, a little generous

1672
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,640
because many times people think of us as

1673
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,880
you don't have to feel it because you

1674
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,800
Thankfully ideologically your placed in a

1675
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,960
A place where there are less worries about this. I am

1676
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,360
ideologically placed where these consistently

1677
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,120
there is a concern that you

1678
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,040
The establishment won't like it. To you

1679
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,719
Governments will not like it etc.

1680
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,120
That is why we know such people more closely

1681
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,280
Let's see who should do what, who should say what

1682
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,440
They should avoid speaking. where stood

1683
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,679
You should avoid standing there.

1684
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,840
And it is also true that this is always done out of fear.

1685
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:33,600
I wouldn’t be doing it. Sometimes more than fear

1686
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:36,480
Greed plays a big role. Some small

1687
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,199
getting some small proximities,

1688
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:43,920
Get some benefits. but both ways it is

1689
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:47,679
Human It's human to be afraid. it's

1690
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,440
It's human to be a little greedy. whatever you say

1691
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,440
I understand theoretically that you are like this.

1692
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,320
I understand but this thing is inside my heart

1693
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:57,520
Hasn't gone yet. I totally understand

1694
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,239
that i am saying so because as i said you

1695
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,960
still you had friends that

1696
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,960
Was there for you in your time of need. ever to me

1697
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:08,800
Sometimes I feel that my friends know this

1698
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:12,159
It might seem so. I'm sorry to say that

1699
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,040
When they needed Vijendra, he was there

1700
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:17,920
I did not stand firmly with them. and I

1701
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,199
I'm taking this opportunity to say sorry to you.

1702
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,239
Do you miss anyone? Say This Is What I Mean

1703
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:27,520
Thfully there is no friend for whom I can do this

1704
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:31,120
Let me say that he dumped me. i can

1705
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:34,880
not say with confidence that it is not like that

1706
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,120
They must be saying this. so they can be us people

1707
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,560
Stories is very complex.

1708
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,719
They are very complicated. simple life

1709
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,719
So only in geometry notebook

1710
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:47,280
is shown. in which a scale was placed and

1711
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,520
Drawn it with a pencil. life's straight line

1712
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,159
I kept walking. Sometimes I know what I

1713
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,280
I think about the romantic breakups that happen

1714
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:57,920
Yes, they give you pain for some time.

1715
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:01,520
The breakups that happen between the Butt brothers

1716
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:04,400
They keep pricking you throughout your life. yes this

1717
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:07,040
and the other thing is that in our country

1718
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,760
And you will find that just once again I am

1719
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,600
Sorry I am taking you there again. but this

1720
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,880
which is the construct of friendship, this is friendship

1721
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,560
construct of men's friendship

1722
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,000
It is constructed. How to Look Carefully

1723
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,159
Men are raised here.

1724
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,120
It happens in that, isn't it, he is just a brother here

1725
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:28,480
standing. You do whatever you want to do. I am yours

1726
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:31,440
I stand with you. The brother the friend will not judge

1727
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,400
You. Whether what you did was right or not.

1728
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,640
Was it ethical or not? Is it okay? When I my

1729
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,640
About my own friendship breakups

1730
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,920
I think. especially with the brothers, those

1731
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:45,440
Where there was such friendship with people. So

1732
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:48,239
Often this thought comes to my mind that

1733
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,480
Friend, even if we patch up, the friendship remains the same

1734
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:56,320
She will not stay. But that's why maybe I need a patch up

1735
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:59,360
don't do it because it's here 200%

1736
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,520
And not that. You want it absolutely pure.

1737
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,280
Perfection and purity, maybe these are my emotional

1738
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,920
There is a limitation. But I did not understand. I

1739
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:10,480
Am I totally respect this feeling s

1740
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:12,719
True, but I have many friends like this for example.

1741
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:16,320
Friends with whom I spent months talking

1742
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:18,880
it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen for months but when again

1743
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,239
When there is a conversation, you don't have any warm up

1744
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:26,719
you have to start from the place where

1745
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,880
you left ok and the reason is that dost

1746
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:32,080
He will not judge you because you did 3

1747
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:35,440
I did not take any care of myself for four months

1748
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:38,000
no actually what do they say actually

1749
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,199
The one who breaks up after a fight

1750
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,159
no i am talking about that, that's it, it is said

1751
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,760
not not losing touch losing touch wala ok

1752
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,520
yes not losing i was talking about

1753
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,960
losing touch i was not talking about fights

1754
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,360
I have a bag full of friendship for those who fight

1755
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,600
Have less experience. Experiencing a tumultuous friendship

1756
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,320
I have less. there are one or two and she teases

1757
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,280
Are.

1758
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:03,040
But I learn to get over this. Painfully Butt

1759
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,600
Coming

1760
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,080
But I was able to talk to those with whom I could go

1761
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,960
At least one I still remember talking to

1762
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:14,640
I couldn't give them to others whom I have

1763
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:17,280
Given signals that I don't just want

1764
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,920
to talk but i'm very eager to end whenever

1765
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,719
they are ready i will be happy to maybe this

1766
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:26,800
it happens with age yes beyond a point you

1767
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:30,320
no look understand this also friends once in a while

1768
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,719
after i might be theoretically possible

1769
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,440
But my understanding is that after a while the new

1770
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:37,840
It becomes difficult to make friends. Ok

1771
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:41,920
No? So the friends you grew up with

1772
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,640
Assume those friends are in your mind

1773
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,760
Or they have something very clear in their mind

1774
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,080
It turns out you were wrong on one point.

1775
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,560
Its

1776
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:54,760
Despite this, I have friendship with the same person

1777
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,520
Yet, there remains scope to do so.

1778
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,600
Agreeing and Disagreeing on a Particular

1779
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,719
The point is that you were wrong or I was wrong

1780
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,840
Was. but new friends new friends once upon a time

1781
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,920
It is difficult to become later. more than a limit

1782
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,440
and that's why I always say new friends

1783
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:13,520
not to leave old friends for

1784
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,040
Needed Now you can probably see this in your life

1785
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,280
So he must have definitely come. We who are a

1786
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,199
reached a particular level of fame, people

1787
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,520
reached the identities of, people started recognizing

1788
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:23,280
began. We have had major complaints

1789
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,040
This is one of the complaints given. now you are

1790
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,080
He has become a big man. why are you on our side

1791
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:30,719
will you see? but i have realised that those are the two

1792
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,159
which even today in terms of the fame and

1793
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:38,360
Success and money and all is nothing or one

1794
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:41,360
Living an average life. i make it a point

1795
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:43,679
I am not saying that I will do it 100%

1796
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,520
I find that when I meet him, he has a

1797
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:49,520
Don't feel it even for a second. I give them this

1798
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,920
I provoke you sometimes I provoke you

1799
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,159
I am literally thinking that he makes fun of me about this

1800
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,679
that yes friend you are right now, now you are

1801
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:58,480
Why is he talking to us after meeting Ranveer?

1802
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:01,600
will do that kind of thing ok because this

1803
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,880
is a right which I give only to the

1804
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,760
friends this is a privilege this is a one

1805
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,080
Dekhna is our Hindi word

1806
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,480
Privilege These privileges are my parents

1807
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,480
Neither do my family have it

1808
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,239
An unknown person doesn't have the courage

1809
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,880
but friends have this

1810
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:21,120
privilege that they have over those things of mine

1811
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,360
Things that other people can make fun of

1812
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:26,239
I praise you.

1813
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,480
Brother, please make fun of me. How to quit

1814
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:30,960
did you give it friend? sometimes now deliberately end as a

1815
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,960
communication person we know how to do it

1816
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,360
Used to be. Is it okay? Now suppose this

1817
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,960
I said this Ranveer thing. So the

1818
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,360
At that time somebody must be doing this

1819
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,520
sa tell me knowingly that this guy will catch this

1820
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,480
To Cue. Will you catch this cue then?

1821
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,199
He will make fun of me. after that by doing that you

1822
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:50,080
Will you feel shy? Come on friend, get up. Does anybody know

1823
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:52,080
also na sir a career about friends

1824
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,960
Doesn't talk from perspective. but this

1825
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,480
I have observed it. again the reason for this show

1826
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,840
I haven't learned much about life since

1827
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,920
Have you learnt. and top of the top people always have a

1828
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,600
There is always a small friend group. says

1829
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,960
That Shahrukh Khan also has a core friend

1830
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,679
The group is still there. which they maintain

1831
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,920
Are. That is their rush in life. but no one

1832
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:16,000
Nos who are his friends? no i know about

1833
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:19,040
The Popular and Successful People They Crave

1834
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
crave for this thing and those who for some

1835
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:25,920
the reason we've lost it

1836
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I I have full money because the price they have

1837
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:34,640
Paid for this success is more than what

1838
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:38,800
is it worth the price loneliness one is

1839
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:43,040
definitely loneliness and the second is that

1840
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:47,000
you run out of people who are your

1841
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:49,520
Looking you in the eye and telling you your mistakes

1842
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,840
Could. It's not just loneliness. These

1843
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,000
Well, loneliness has its place and you

1844
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,600
Rightly pointed it out. But if you

1845
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,239
Someone, your childhood friend, is just like your eyes

1846
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,239
I could not look into his eyes and say that Vijendra

1847
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,640
You oppose something, it is correct

1848
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:06,400
Is. But look at the boundary at this place

1849
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,880
You are crossing it. because someone else will say it

1850
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,120
So I'll assume it's a troll. But if any

1851
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,199
my friend will say then I will realize that

1852
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,600
this person is just saying this to me

1853
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:20,239
Is. On Friendship is the Treasure of Life

1854
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,360
Don't make so many friends that you

1855
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:26,239
I will not be able to maintain friendship or you will be my friend

1856
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:28,640
I can't fulfill it Such a practical end

1857
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:31,760
Important statement. Because suppose that

1858
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:34,719
If you are career driven, you are going to be busy

1859
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,360
yes. Family life in that busy schedule

1860
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,840
Putting it aside and spending time with friends

1861
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,719
It is difficult to spend. you have a limited

1862
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,199
Amount of friends you can keep? Yes. And

1863
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:49,640
There is a big advantage in having more friends

1864
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:52,880
The problem is also that subconsciously you end up

1865
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:55,760
Substituting Comfortable Friends in the

1866
01:20:52,880 --> 01:21:00,880
the place of friends who can make you

1867
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:03,840
Uncomfortable. Which is again awkwardness.

1868
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,840
That means there should be depth in friendship too.

1869
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:10,080
That is what friendship is for. yes butt

1870
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:13,920
Be careful in friendship like fame

1871
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,920
As if money is not a criteria. same way

1872
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,640
If I'm a little older than you

1873
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,360
And if I can give advice then I am telling you. By the way

1874
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,360
only

1875
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:26,480
Don't make intellectual equality a condition.

1876
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,480
What happens many times is that you find yourself

1877
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,560
Because you have experience.

1878
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,239
You have a particular track of life

1879
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,560
So you think that now you can't

1880
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,560
Let's go to the abstract level. Now you

1881
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,080
The principles make sense. Philosophy to you

1882
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,880
I understand it. You understand spirituality

1883
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,960
It comes in. That is why your friend who is

1884
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,320
Has not gone through the process. he is not

1885
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:49,120
Uniform. Don't conclude that. This is from late 20s

1886
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,719
Many people make mistakes. till late 20

1887
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:54,960
Little does one know that a good career

1888
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:58,840
Do this. I have grown out. Him You Never

1889
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,840
Outgrow your friends.

1890
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:04,480
[Laughter]

1891
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,800
Where did you start from? How far have you reached? I

1892
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,719
mean that's the fun of being Ranveer and you are

1893
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,440
Able to extract things which I have

1894
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,600
Not said on camera to almost anybody. I

1895
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,280
I am glad sir. I hope I get to meet you

1896
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,040
Again in life. That's all I say. Had fun

1897
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,159
With you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Vary

1898
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,960
Memorable afternoon sir. I genuinely hope that

1899
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:23,480
Audience Haze

1900
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,560
Rhinoceros

1901
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:28,560
Value. Hopefully for the next 30 years.

1902
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,960
Thank you. Thank you Ranveer. thank you for

1903
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,080
Being with us Vijay sir. sorry to call you vijay

Great. That's all I would like to say. and I

1907
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,520
Genuinely hope life makes us meet again.

1908
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,440
