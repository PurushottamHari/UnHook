See Things Are Getting

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,240
Out of Control in the Middle East.  Last night, Iran carried out

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
a massive attack on Israel and I would say that this attack

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,840
appears to be successful to a large extent

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,920
because the Iron Dome failed at many places and

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,320
many videos have surfaced where a

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,600

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,480
lot of rockets have fallen on Israel's main city, which is its capital.   There has

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,279
been a lot of destruction and at one point it was even

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,480
reported that Israel had instructed its media to ensure

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,040
that the country's morale is not broken.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,520
You are seeing a lot of visuals of

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,480
these rockets falling in the air, do not

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,719
broadcast them everywhere and this

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,320
massive attack by Iran on Israel in which it is being

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,200
said that they have shot down 150 ballistic missiles, shot down

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520
100 drones all over Israel,

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,320
basically overwhelmed Israel's Iron Dome missile

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,359
defense system.  So

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,920
many attacks were made, specifically on Telway,

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,559
that the Iron Dome failed in many places and

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,600
Israel had to suffer losses after that.

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,680
Interestingly, Iran has

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
also stood up to Israel in information warfare.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Now again who is winning in information warfare

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,880

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
depends largely on one's perspective.  But

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,000
Iran has released this video.  These people

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,479
here are saying that life will become bitter

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,320
for them.  This will make life bitter for these people.

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,799
And here you will see that this

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
video has been released by Iran.  These

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
Iranian missiles are all

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
ready to be launched.  Clearly I can see that this time they were

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
also ready for information warfare.

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
Basically, the morale of our people

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
should not be lowered in all this.  This is variant.

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
And here you will be able to see these

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,119
blasting missiles of Iran, the supreme leader of

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
Iran is saying that we never started them.

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,560
But we will answer that these type of

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
visuals have come here and

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,079
all these rockets were launched and after that the

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,320
devastation that happened in the cities of Israel has been

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,119
shown here by these people.  Now

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
of course many people in Iran are thinking that

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,440
Iranian rockets have fallen many times

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
on residential areas of Israel as

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
well.  If Israel also

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,959
starts doing the same thing then where will this war go?

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
For example, you will be able to see this video.

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,360
Here is Iran's ballistic missile and

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,080
how it is falling on the oil fields.

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,040
This attack that Iran is carrying out is being done

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,400

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,519
under Operation Two Promise Part Three.  This is Israel's operation against

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Iran, this is the Rising Line.  And Iran's

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,120
operation against Israel right now is

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,280
Operation Two Promise Three.  And if you are wondering

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
how Iran has achieved so much success this time?  Because you will see in many places

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640
that these missiles of Iran have fallen in Israel very

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
comfortably just like

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,640
India was raining missiles

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,640
on Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.  No air defense system

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,599
appeared to be working.  In this case, out of the

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
150 missiles fired by Iran,

68
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,879
many were intercepted by Israel but there has been a

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,840
mistake somewhere; Iron Dome

70
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,239
and even Arrow 3 were not able to perform well this time

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
and because of this,

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
a lot of such visuals have come to the fore and it is being told from Iran's side

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,959
that so far these people have

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,280

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,239
hit Israel's financial centre on the sole; it is being

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
told near the Israeli Defense Ministry that

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
one missile has fallen, but the visuals of how close

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
it fell are not confirmed.

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,280
A missile has fallen near the Ministry of Economy of Israel.

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,680
They have an Tel Knock airbase.  A

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
missile has fallen there.

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
Missiles have fallen at several locations in Hafa C.  And if you are

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
wondering how Iran has suddenly

84
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
achieved so much success?  So

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,080
this is also a reason behind it.  What did Iran do this time? It is being

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,159
said that it also fired missiles from submarines

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
towards Israel.  Due to this, their air

88
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,120
defence system has become genuinely overwhelmed.  It

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,319
clearly seems that Iran had

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,799
planned this attack better compared to the

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
last time.  Operation True Promise Two

92
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,040
looks better than Operation True

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Promise Three here.  But overall can I say who has caused the most

94
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,159
damage to whom so far?  I would

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,319
say that Israel has still caused a lot of

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,560
damage to Iran.  Because Israel has

97
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
literally destroyed these refugee centers of Iran.  The

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,919

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,120
top generals of their military have been killed.  Whereas

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
till now none of their top generals or

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
military personnel have been killed in Israel.  It is being

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,160
said that around 60 people have been injured

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
and two people have died.  But again

104
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
these figures, as you know,

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,120

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,880
keep changing as the conflict progresses.  And many people

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
also noted one thing that the

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,560
tweeted that I received a phone call from Benjamin

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,720
Ethan Yahoo. Benjamin Ethan Yahoo had initially

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
called some world leaders and told them

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,280
that these people had attacked Iran,

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,360
one of them was Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

114
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160
So regarding this, PM Modi

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,639
posted here that he briefed me on

116
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,880
how the situation is evolving.

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,840
I expressed India's concerns and

118
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,240
emphasized that peace should be restored as soon as possible

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,400
so that stability can be achieved in the

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,880
region.  You will see that PM Modi has

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
not written anywhere in his post that Israel

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,160
has a right to defend itself and

123
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,400
whatever Israel is doing here, it is doing it in defense.

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,639
Nothing.  The reason behind this is simple.

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Look, whatever Israel is doing today,

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,520
if you look at it,

127
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,680
India is actually incurring losses because oil prices are

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,199
continuously increasing.

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,000
Oil prices had shot up by over 8% in a single day and now it is being

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
said that the intensity with which

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Iran and Israel are attacking each other is increasing.

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,440
Crude oil may again

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
go above $ per barrel.  Already you guys are seeing

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,360
that crude oil is currently hovering around $78 a barrel.

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Many financial experts in the USA who

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,039
make predictions are

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,720
saying that if

138
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,120
things continue like this, the

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,280
price of oil will reach $120 per barrel and

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,840
such articles have already started getting published.

141
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,639
Energy Prices Search India

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,720
faces oil supply challenge and this challenge is being faced not

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,919
only in India region but also by all the countries like

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,479
Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, even

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,639
Japan, China.

146
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,720
JP Morgan has even said

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,360
that oil prices could reach $120 and also

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,639
said that this would lead to

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,840
inflation in the USA reaching 5%.  Look at this

150
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
it will hurt the whole world.

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,479
If inflation in USA increases too much then their

152
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
stock market will start falling.

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,639
You will see its impact on Indian and European stock

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
markets, stock markets across the world will

155
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,880
start falling and just

156
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,960
look, Iran has just taken the biggest step

157
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,199
due to which the whole world is nervous about

158
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,440
closing the Strait of Hermouse.

159
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,759
Here you will be able to see that this is the map of Iran

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,319
and below here is UAE and here

161
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,960
you will be able to see that this is Oman.  This

162
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,080
important choke point here is called

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,120
The Strait of Hermos.

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,319
In case the Iranian Navy chokes it,

165
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,520
you can imagine that such a panic may occur.

166
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,840
Oil prices will reach around $10 to $200

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,319
and this will have a huge negative

168
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,479
impact on the global economy.  Now

169
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,599
why are we saying today that the State of

170
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,960
Hermos can be closed because till now

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,520
Netin Yau has not given any indication from anywhere that

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,000
now this will stop.  Israel is saying that

173
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
we still have a lot to do.  They are

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,560
proceeding on this assumption.  Actually, if you look,

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,319
even before Iran's attack, the Israeli

176
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
government had said that yes, we know Iran

177
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,680
will attack.  All this will happen.  People will be killed and

178
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,080
injured.  But we will do whatever we have to do.

179
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,479
So right now it seems that Israel will continue attacking Iran

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,639
under Operation Rising Line for many days.  There

181
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,199

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,639
will be many attacks.  Iran will retaliate.  And

183
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,599
again I would say the biggest fear would be that

184
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,759
if Israel directly targets the supreme leader of Iran.  The

185
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,319

186
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,560
State of Harmoos went to that case.  In that case, you

187
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
can say now again, for how many days will it be blocked

188
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,840
?  I don't know.  3 days, 5 days, 6 days

189
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,080
in that case the Strait of Hermos can be closed completely.

190
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,319
And I would tell all of you to

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
keep an eye on this area.  The rest, whatever these two countries are doing against

192
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
each other, that is sad to see.

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
But once this area becomes choked for the global economy then

194
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680
big decisions

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
will have to be made.  The US Navy will get involved

196
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,919
and you know China will

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
start supplying missiles

198
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,120
to Iran on a very large scale.  Then in that case you will see that the situation will become

199
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
very different.  And

200
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,440
in the midst of all this, this report is also coming.

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,719
Again, I am telling you this from unconfirmed sources.  In

202
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
many US defense

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,640
forums, many experienced people,

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,519
many experienced writers who write

205
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,240
for various articles, have

206
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,279
told in hushed tones that the Pakistan

207
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Air Force is

208
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,959
collecting this data around the Iran border and

209
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,519
this data is being quietly sent to the US so that

210
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,080
Israel can get information about what should be their next targets and

211
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,560
where to attack.

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Shahbaz Sharif is writing on social media

213
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,959
that we condemn the attack

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,959
on Iran, it is a very wrong attack on Iran

215
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,560
and it is also being said in the parliament of Pakistan

216
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,240
that we do not support Israel

217
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,040
etc but on the ground level Pakistan

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Air Force is providing this data to

219
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
USA which is being indirectly obviously

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,839
sent to Israel, this has been

221
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,560
told by many sources, now again is this

222
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,320
100% confirmed, we do not know yet and

223
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,720
actually this thing is confirmed, you cannot even do it,

224
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
this thing is told to a large extent

225
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
through sources only.  Now there

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
is another very important claim from Iran.  Let me

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,080
tell you this also.  Iran's media,

228
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Tehran Times, is claiming here

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,760
that they have shot down two Israeli jets.

230
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,320
Both were F35 and one

231
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,480
pilot has also been captured.  Now

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,240
how much truth is there in this because it is a big thing that

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,640
shooting down the F35 jet is a

234
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,880
big accomplishment.  That too with S300 missile

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
defence system.  Now this

236
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,959
is also not confirmed.  I will bring a separate video on this topic

237
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,920
whether Iran has really shot

238
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,000
down F35 Fire Jet?  Because this

239
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,120
news also directly

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
impacts India because the US is selling this fire jet to

241
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
India on the basis that it is

242
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,000
very advanced.

243
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,120
No one can compete with it.  If it falls because of S300 then

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,360
this is a huge story.  So

245
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,839
I will bring a separate video on this very soon in a few hours

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
and finally

247
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,640
I will ask you guys a question here.

248
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,200
Therefore, this area is in a lot of news these days.

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,839
UN agencies have

250
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,560
confirmed that a major attack took place here

251
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,040
and now radiation leakage is also being talked about

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,160
here.  You have to tell

253
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,079
in which country you will get the Natansh.

254
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,880
This location is in the news a lot these days.

255
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,240
Here are your options: Iran,

256
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,399
Pakistan, Israel or USA.

257
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
Answer in the comment section.  Those who give the correct

258
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
answer, I will give hard marks to their comments

259
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,640
so that others can understand what the correct answer is.

260
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,120
Look, sometime go to any website

261
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,519
where companies post jobs and you will take

262
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
notes there.  The demand for data analysts is

263
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,640
continuously increasing.  Whether you are

264
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,440
in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata

265
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,279
or anywhere.  Salaries obviously range based

266
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,440
on your experience.  But you

267
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,680

268
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,920
can easily earn Rs. 50-60,000 per month from 2025 onwards.  Depending on your

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,519
experience, the impact of skills and

270
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,200
data analysts is being

271
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,680
seen in every industry.  It will obviously be seen in the corporate world.

272
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Apart from that,

273
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
articles are being published in medical science and even cricket.

274
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
This is a four day old

275
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
article about how data

276
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,640
analytics has transformed cricket all together.  Let

277
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,279
me tell you the reason.  Let

278
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,680
me show you for the first time

279
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,800

280
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,440
how someone can present data if they have the skills of a data analyst.

281
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,240
Once you have the

282
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,360
skills of a data analyst, you can create all of these things.

283
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,480
You will be able to see in what beautiful way the

284
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,639
profit of a company and

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
how much revenue a company earned in which month.

286
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,600
What is the market share?  This can be made in detail.

287
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,959
Again it's not just like you

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,519
just choose this color scheme and

289
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,160
enter the data.  In this, the formulas, the

290
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,320
way you enter the data, the way

291
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,040
you present the data, everything matters.

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,839
And companies today are

293
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,320
ready to pay people who present the data to them in

294
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,720
such a way and in such a form

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,880
so that the companies can decide

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,440
what to do in the future.

297
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,320
Where do they want to go in the future?

298
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,560
With the help of Data Analysis course of Career 247,

299
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
many of our students have already become capable of creating such projects.

300
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,639

301
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,279
I am showing you this project of one of our students

302
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,480
and this again is

303
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,240
just 5 to 6% of the total scale.  Apart from that, there are many other

304
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,800
tools in Data Analytics

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
in which if you become proficient, then suddenly

306
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,519
your value will increase a lot in the job market.

307
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,600
What do you simply have to do?

308
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,760
