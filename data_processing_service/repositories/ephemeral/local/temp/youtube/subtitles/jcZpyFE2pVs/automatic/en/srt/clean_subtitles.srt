See Things Are Getting Out of Control in the Middle East.  Last night, Iran carried out a massive attack on Israel and I would say that this attack appears to be successful to a large extent because the Iron Dome failed at many places and many videos have surfaced where a lot of rockets have fallen on Israel's main city, which is its capital.   There has been a lot of destruction and at one point it was even reported that Israel had instructed its media to ensure that the country's morale is not broken. You are seeing a lot of visuals of these rockets falling in the air, do not broadcast them everywhere and this massive attack by Iran on Israel in which it is being said that they have shot down 150 ballistic missiles, shot down 100 drones all over Israel, basically overwhelmed Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system.  So many attacks were made, specifically on Telway, that the Iron Dome failed in many places and Israel had to suffer losses after that. Interestingly, Iran has also stood up to Israel in information warfare. Now again who is winning in information warfare depends largely on one's perspective.  But Iran has released this video.  These people here are saying that life will become bitter for them.  This will make life bitter for these people. And here you will see that this video has been released by Iran.  These Iranian missiles are all ready to be launched.  Clearly I can see that this time they were also ready for information warfare. Basically, the morale of our people should not be lowered in all this.  This is variant. And here you will be able to see these blasting missiles of Iran, the supreme leader of Iran is saying that we never started them. But we will answer that these type of visuals have come here and all these rockets were launched and after that the devastation that happened in the cities of Israel has been shown here by these people.  Now of course many people in Iran are thinking that Iranian rockets have fallen many times on residential areas of Israel as well.  If Israel also starts doing the same thing then where will this war go? For example, you will be able to see this video. Here is Iran's ballistic missile and how it is falling on the oil fields. This attack that Iran is carrying out is being done under Operation Two Promise Part Three.  This is Israel's operation against Iran, this is the Rising Line.  And Iran's operation against Israel right now is Operation Two Promise Three.  And if you are wondering how Iran has achieved so much success this time?  Because you will see in many places that these missiles of Iran have fallen in Israel very comfortably just like India was raining missiles on Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.  No air defense system appeared to be working.  In this case, out of the 150 missiles fired by Iran, many were intercepted by Israel but there has been a mistake somewhere; Iron Dome and even Arrow 3 were not able to perform well this time and because of this, a lot of such visuals have come to the fore and it is being told from Iran's side that so far these people have hit Israel's financial centre on the sole; it is being told near the Israeli Defense Ministry that one missile has fallen, but the visuals of how close it fell are not confirmed. A missile has fallen near the Ministry of Economy of Israel. They have an Tel Knock airbase.  A missile has fallen there. Missiles have fallen at several locations in Hafa C.  And if you are wondering how Iran has suddenly achieved so much success?  So this is also a reason behind it.  What did Iran do this time? It is being said that it also fired missiles from submarines towards Israel.  Due to this, their air defence system has become genuinely overwhelmed.  It clearly seems that Iran had planned this attack better compared to the last time.  Operation True Promise Two looks better than Operation True Promise Three here.  But overall can I say who has caused the most damage to whom so far?  I would say that Israel has still caused a lot of damage to Iran.  Because Israel has literally destroyed these refugee centers of Iran.  The top generals of their military have been killed.  Whereas till now none of their top generals or military personnel have been killed in Israel.  It is being said that around 60 people have been injured and two people have died.  But again these figures, as you know, keep changing as the conflict progresses.  And many people also noted one thing that the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has tweeted that I received a phone call from Benjamin Ethan Yahoo. Benjamin Ethan Yahoo had initially called some world leaders and told them that these people had attacked Iran, one of them was Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So regarding this, PM Modi posted here that he briefed me on how the situation is evolving. I expressed India's concerns and emphasized that peace should be restored as soon as possible so that stability can be achieved in the region.  You will see that PM Modi has not written anywhere in his post that Israel has a right to defend itself and whatever Israel is doing here, it is doing it in defense. Nothing.  The reason behind this is simple. Look, whatever Israel is doing today, if you look at it, India is actually incurring losses because oil prices are continuously increasing. Oil prices had shot up by over 8% in a single day and now it is being said that the intensity with which Iran and Israel are attacking each other is increasing. Crude oil may again go above $ per barrel.  Already you guys are seeing that crude oil is currently hovering around $78 a barrel. Many financial experts in the USA who make predictions are saying that if things continue like this, the price of oil will reach $120 per barrel and such articles have already started getting published. Energy Prices Search India faces oil supply challenge and this challenge is being faced not only in India region but also by all the countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, even Japan, China. JP Morgan has even said that oil prices could reach $120 and also said that this would lead to inflation in the USA reaching 5%.  Look at this it will hurt the whole world. If inflation in USA increases too much then their stock market will start falling. You will see its impact on Indian and European stock markets, stock markets across the world will start falling and just look, Iran has just taken the biggest step due to which the whole world is nervous about closing the Strait of Hermouse. Here you will be able to see that this is the map of Iran and below here is UAE and here you will be able to see that this is Oman.  This important choke point here is called The Strait of Hermos. In case the Iranian Navy chokes it, you can imagine that such a panic may occur. Oil prices will reach around $10 to $200 and this will have a huge negative impact on the global economy.  Now why are we saying today that the State of Hermos can be closed because till now Netin Yau has not given any indication from anywhere that now this will stop.  Israel is saying that we still have a lot to do.  They are proceeding on this assumption.  Actually, if you look, even before Iran's attack, the Israeli government had said that yes, we know Iran will attack.  All this will happen.  People will be killed and injured.  But we will do whatever we have to do. So right now it seems that Israel will continue attacking Iran under Operation Rising Line for many days.  There will be many attacks.  Iran will retaliate.  And again I would say the biggest fear would be that if Israel directly targets the supreme leader of Iran.  The State of Harmoos went to that case.  In that case, you can say now again, for how many days will it be blocked ?  I don't know.  3 days, 5 days, 6 days in that case the Strait of Hermos can be closed completely. And I would tell all of you to keep an eye on this area.  The rest, whatever these two countries are doing against each other, that is sad to see. But once this area becomes choked for the global economy then big decisions will have to be made.  The US Navy will get involved and you know China will start supplying missiles to Iran on a very large scale.  Then in that case you will see that the situation will become very different.  And in the midst of all this, this report is also coming. Again, I am telling you this from unconfirmed sources.  In many US defense forums, many experienced people, many experienced writers who write for various articles, have told in hushed tones that the Pakistan Air Force is collecting this data around the Iran border and this data is being quietly sent to the US so that Israel can get information about what should be their next targets and where to attack. Shahbaz Sharif is writing on social media that we condemn the attack on Iran, it is a very wrong attack on Iran and it is also being said in the parliament of Pakistan that we do not support Israel etc but on the ground level Pakistan Air Force is providing this data to USA which is being indirectly obviously sent to Israel, this has been told by many sources, now again is this 100% confirmed, we do not know yet and actually this thing is confirmed, you cannot even do it, this thing is told to a large extent through sources only.  Now there is another very important claim from Iran.  Let me tell you this also.  Iran's media, Tehran Times, is claiming here that they have shot down two Israeli jets. Both were F35 and one pilot has also been captured.  Now how much truth is there in this because it is a big thing that shooting down the F35 jet is a big accomplishment.  That too with S300 missile defence system.  Now this is also not confirmed.  I will bring a separate video on this topic whether Iran has really shot down F35 Fire Jet?  Because this news also directly impacts India because the US is selling this fire jet to India on the basis that it is very advanced. No one can compete with it.  If it falls because of S300 then this is a huge story.  So I will bring a separate video on this very soon in a few hours and finally I will ask you guys a question here. Therefore, this area is in a lot of news these days. UN agencies have confirmed that a major attack took place here and now radiation leakage is also being talked about here.  You have to tell in which country you will get the Natansh. This location is in the news a lot these days. Here are your options: Iran, Pakistan, Israel or USA. Answer in the comment section.
