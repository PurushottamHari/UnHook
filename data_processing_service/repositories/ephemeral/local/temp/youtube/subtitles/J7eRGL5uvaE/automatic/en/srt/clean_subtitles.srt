[Music] It's a war. [Music] Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are at war. Meltdown. The Elon Musk and Donald Trump alliance has gone up in flames. Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. Disappointed to see the massive spending bill. Elon poured in $260 million to back Trump's campaign. He got Trump back on Twitter and even showed up in rallies just to support Trump. In a dramatic political comeback, Donald Trump will return to the White House. And if he's going to share the credit for his victory with anyone, it's this guy. Where is he? Come on up here, Elon. Come here. Elon Musk. The nearly $200 million that must spend along with his intense campaigning both on X and on the ground dwarfs president. Aar is born Elon. President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America. The future is going to be amazing. [Applause] So Elon gave Trump both the mic and the money. But in the past 10 days, everything has changed and in a dramatic turn of events, Elon and Trump have become arch enemies. I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. I think a bill could be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be. The bromance is definitely over. President says that he has no plans to speak with Musk. The very public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk exploded on social media yesterday with both men trading insults. Donald Trump has called Elon a madman and he even threatened to cancel billiond dollar contracts with SpaceX. And the market, the market started to panic. Elon Musk owns a major defense contractor. It's called SpaceX. US government is their most important client. Trump has now threatened to cut off government contracts with Musk's companies, which has led to the billionaire announcing that his rocket company SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. I'm very disappointed in Elon. and I've helped Elon a lot. In just one day, Tesla lost over $150 billion in value. And now the empire that Elon spent decades building, Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City, all of it is walking on a tight rope. Now, even though Elon has apologized, the one big beautiful bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives and it is now headed to the Senate. So, the question is, what is the one big beautiful bill? Will Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City suffer the consequences of this battle? And most importantly, what does this story teach us about power, politics, and business? Before we dive in, I want to thank ODO for supporting our content.

[Music] This is a story that dates back to the Biden era when Elon Musk wasn't just building companies. He was rewriting what innovation looked in America. He turned electric cars into the sexiest machines on the planet. He challenged Boeing and made rockets land backwards. He slapped solar panels on rooftops and sold sunlight like a subscription plan. And by the time the dust settled, Elon Musk had gone from a Silicon Valley dreamer to the richest man on Earth. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Elon Musk. Yes. Elon Musk is one of the world's richest men. Businesses in electric cars, space travel, and satellite powered internet for the masses have made him famous around the world and into the center of American power. Elon Musk. I'm not just MAGA. I'm dark Gothic MAGA. Do we have a new star? A star is born. Elon. But here's what most people forget. Elon's empire wasn't built on innovation alone. It was also built on three powerful tools handed out by the US government. Contracts, grants, and tax breaks. Take Tesla for example. Every time an American buys a Tesla, they don't just get a sleek EV. They also get a $7,500 federal tax credit. Now, that's not a discount from Tesla. That's the US government literally paying people to drive Elon's cars. In 2023 alone, Tesla got 2.8 8 billion worth of credits, making them the biggest EV player in America. Then in 2021, under Biden, NASA handed Elon a $2.9 billion contract to land astronauts on the moon. So basically, the US government hired Elon Musk to run America's moon program. And then came the solar investment tax credit. So if your solar setup costs $10,000, the government of United States covers $3,000 or 30% of your cost. So you pay just $7,000. This one policy kept the American solar dream alive. And just like that, you will be shocked to know that Elon Musk's companies have racked in over $ 38 billion in federal funding in the past two decades. But guess what? twothird of that funding, I repeat, twothird of that funding came under President Joe Biden. And barely any of it came during the presidency of Donald Trump. And during that time, Elon and Trump absolutely hated each other. He's not going to be president. That I can tell you. And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be. He wasn't born in this country. So, he's another artist, but he's not going to be Biden. The Tesla CEO wrote on X, "I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset." You know, hopefully Trump doesn't get the nomination of, you know, the Republican party. That's cuz I think that's um Yeah, that wouldn't be good. Even after all this support from Biden, when the elections arrived, surprisingly, Elon Musk supported Trump. And suddenly, Elon and Trump were the new best friends on the street. Have a new star. A star is born. Elon, he created the first major American car company in generations. And his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot. So the question is suddenly, how did Elon become best friends with Trump? When Tesla's self-driving cars were crashing, the government stepped in and started investigating whether Tesla was putting lives at risk. And when it comes to SpaceX rockets, they were built and ready to fly, but they were getting delayed not because of engineering, but because of paperwork. In fact, Elon Musk famously said that it takes less time to build a rocket than to get government approval to launch it. Similarly, when Neuralink started testing brain chips on monkeys, the monkeys started dying. So the government called it cruelty and blocked Neuralink from starting human trials. In fact, at one point more than 20 government cases were going against Elon's companies. So Elon Musk wasn't just fighting against competitors, he was fighting against the American system and that is why backing Trump felt like the perfect shortcut. And the other reason has to do with the fact that America's debt is a ticking time bomb. America is also going bankrupt extremely quickly. Um, and and nobody seems to everyone seems to be sort of whistling past the graveyard on this one. Look at this. Since 2001, the US government has been spending far more than it earns. And this gap just keeps getting bigger, bigger, and bigger. So to cover it, the government keeps on borrowing. And by 2025, America hit a staggering $36 trillion in debt. And Elon knew that if America collapses into a recession, then no one's buying a Tesla when they don't have jobs. No one's installing solar panels when they can't afford electricity. And no one's funding Mars missions when people are running out of jobs. Can now project the winner of the presidential race, Donald Trump, wins the presidency. What started off as unlikely, impossible, is now reality. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down. Ladies and gentlemen, Please welcome the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. So when Trump promised to slash wasteful spending, Elon saw a financial savior and he gave millions of dollars to make him the president of the United States of America. And when Donald Trump became the president of the United States, he made Elon the head of a new entity called the Department of Government Efficiency, also called Doge. And Doge had two bold goals. Number one, they wanted to cut $2 trillion in government waste and save $1 trillion by September 2025. And secondly, they wanted to destroy bureaucracy, remove the red tape, and speed up innovation. And for a while, the bromance was unstoppable. Cable news couldn't stop talking. Wall Street couldn't stop buying. And Tesla's stock shot up by 169%. Eventually, Elon Musk became the richest man on Earth again. And just when everybody thought that Elon and Trump will rule the world, something crazy happened. Within just 5 months, Doge collapsed. Within 1 week, Doge was hit with 31 lawsuits. Government workers revolted. Legal experts called it an unconstitutional overreach. And every time Doge tried to cut spending, the court said, "Nice try, Iron Man, but this is not how democracy works." And the worst part was that Doge had no legal power to change regulations. only the Congress could do it. So while Doge was held responsible, it practically had no control. And it failed so badly that while they aimed to save $2 trillion, by June 2025, Doge had saved just $180 billion. And by May, Elon Musk stepped down from Doge. And this is when, ladies and gentlemen, Trump dropped a bombshell. Donald Trump introduced something called the one big beautiful pill. And this is where the Elon Trump war truly begins. President Donald Trump with his so-called big beautiful bill on the line. We call it a great big beautiful bill cuz that's what it is. And uh again, biggest tax cuts in history, biggest economic development moves anywhere. We've never done anything like it. You know, I was like disappointed to see the massive spending b. So the question is, what the hell is the one big beautiful bill? Well, on paper it just looks like a mix of tax cuts and reforms. But in reality, it's a corporate earthquake, especially if your name is Elon Musk. Why? Let's break it down. The first reason is that economists believe that it is the perfect recipe for an economic collapse. In fact, Elon believes that this bill will reduce America's revenue by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years. And Elon believes that this bill could push the United States into another economic collapse. The second reason is that this bill is practically a death sentence to EVs. This bill kills the $7,500 EV tax credit, which means Tesla's will instantly become $7,500 more expensive. And if this happens, what will happen? The middle class buyers, Tesla's largest base will simply stop buying. And then comes the third reason, which are the Chinese battery tariffs. You see, the United States imposed tariffs of up to 721% on Chinese battery supplies. Sounds like a punishment to the Chinese, right? But guess what? It actually ends up choking Tesla. Why? Because nearly 40% of Tesla's battery suppliers are Chinese. And now every battery cell is getting more expensive. And this is why, ladies and gentlemen, there's a chain reaction which practically strangles Tesla. How? No EV tax credit means Teslas will get more expensive. If Teslas get more expensive then the demand will crash. Similarly, if the tariffs are very very high, input costs will rise. If input costs rise, margins will shrink. And when the sales slow down and the cost start rising, what will happen? Tesla's stock will start crashing. And when the stocks come crashing down, Tesla's expansion might be put on hold. And this is not just happening to Tesla, guys. It's also happening to SpaceX. You see, NASA and Pentagon gave Elon $22 billion in contracts. But now Trump says that they are bloated and they may cancel $845 million in upcoming launches. And then comes the broadband plan. You see the US government set aside $42.45 billion to connect every corner of the country using the internet. And Starlink was poised to benefit the most, but now even that is at risk. Thirdly, there is a hit to Solar City. This bill also cuts the 30% solar tax credit that powered Solar City's growth. And lastly, to make matters worse, even Grock is being hit. You see, the AI engine of Grock runs on supercomput. But the catch over here is that its power source has been operating without a Clean Air Act permit. And if the Environmental Protection Agency cracks down, Grock's power could fall from 1,200 megawatt to just 150 megawatt. And that would the entire operation of Grock. So, long story short, Tesla stock is bleeding. Solar City is on the edge. SpaceX is under threat and Grock might just face a power cut. All of this is happening because of just one bill. One deceptively named bill called the one big beautiful bill. This is how what started as a bromance has now turned into a no rules showdown. The scary part is that this showdown is happening between the richest man on earth and the most powerful man on earth. This is a battle that could literally decide the future of American innovation. And by the time this war ends, either Elon Musk's empire will burn or Washington will finally understand what happens when you push a disruptor too far. And this entire story has three very important lessons to teach us. Lesson number one, innovation can build empires, but policies can break them overnight. In this case, Tesla isn't being disrupted by a competitor, it's being crippled by a tax code revision. Lesson number two, if the system can give you wings, please remember it can also clip them. So always deal with the system very very carefully. And last and most importantly, we must never confuse proximity to power with the delusion of control over it. In politics, you are an ally only until you are a liability. So if you build your future on borrowed power, make sure you know who owns the switch because one day that switch will flip.
