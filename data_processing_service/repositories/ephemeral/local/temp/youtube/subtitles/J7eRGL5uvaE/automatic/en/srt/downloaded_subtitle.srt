[Music]

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,750
It's a war.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,750
[Music]

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk and

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,720
Donald Trump are at war. Meltdown. The

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Elon Musk and Donald Trump alliance has

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,519
gone up in flames. Elon and I had a

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
great relationship. I don't know if we

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,360
will anymore. Disappointed to see the

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,440
massive spending bill. Elon poured in

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,680
$260 million to back Trump's campaign.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,600
He got Trump back on Twitter and even

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,640
showed up in rallies just to support

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
Trump. In a dramatic political comeback,

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Donald Trump will return to the White

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
House. And if he's going to share the

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
credit for his victory with anyone, it's

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,520
this guy. Where is he? Come on up here,

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,239
Elon. Come here. Elon Musk. The nearly

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,120
$200 million that must spend along with

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,720
his intense campaigning both on X and on

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,680
the ground dwarfs president. Aar is born

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,080
Elon. President Trump must win to

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,799
preserve the Constitution. He must win

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,860
to preserve democracy in America. The

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,840
future is going to be amazing.

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,560
[Applause]

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
So Elon gave Trump both the mic and the

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
money. But in the past 10 days,

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
everything has changed and in a dramatic

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,439
turn of events, Elon and Trump have

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
become arch enemies. I'm very

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,920
lot. I think a bill could be big or it

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,640
could be beautiful, but I don't know if

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
it could be. The bromance is definitely

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
over. President says that he has no

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
plans to speak with Musk. The very

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,119
public feud between Donald Trump and

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
Elon Musk exploded on social media

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,560
yesterday with both men trading insults.

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Donald Trump has called Elon a madman

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
and he even threatened to cancel

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
billiond dollar contracts with SpaceX.

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
And the market, the market started to

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
panic.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Elon Musk owns a major defense

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
contractor. It's called SpaceX. US

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
government is their most important

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
client. Trump has now threatened to cut

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
off government contracts with Musk's

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,879
companies, which has led to the

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
billionaire announcing that his rocket

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,879
company SpaceX will begin

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,879
decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,800
immediately. I'm very disappointed in

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,599
Elon. and I've helped Elon a lot. In

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
just one day, Tesla lost over $150

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,959
billion in value. And now the empire

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,000
that Elon spent decades building, Tesla,

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
SpaceX, Solar City, all of it is walking

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
on a tight rope. Now, even though Elon

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
has apologized, the one big beautiful

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
bill has already been passed by the

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,599
House of Representatives and it is now

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
headed to the Senate. So, the question

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,560
is, what is the one big beautiful bill?

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Will Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,319
suffer the consequences of this battle?

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
And most importantly, what does this

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,720
story teach us about power, politics,

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,720
and business?

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480

register now and I will see you at the

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:08,799
ODO community day 2025.

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,239
[Music]

102
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
This is a story that dates back to the

103
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
Biden era when Elon Musk wasn't just

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,400
building companies. He was rewriting

105
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,320
what innovation looked in America. He

106
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,160
turned electric cars into the sexiest

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
machines on the planet. He challenged

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Boeing and made rockets land backwards.

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
He slapped solar panels on rooftops and

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
sold sunlight like a subscription plan.

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
And by the time the dust settled, Elon

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,560
Musk had gone from a Silicon Valley

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,040
dreamer to the richest man on Earth.

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,919
the stage Mr. Elon Musk.

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes.

117
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,199
Elon Musk is one of the world's richest

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,040
men. Businesses in electric cars, space

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
travel, and satellite powered internet

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
for the masses have made him famous

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,040
around the world and into the center of

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,520
American power. Elon Musk.

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,639
I'm not just MAGA. I'm dark Gothic MAGA.

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
Do we have a new star? A star is born.

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,160
Elon.

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
But here's what most people forget.

127
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
Elon's empire wasn't built on innovation

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
alone. It was also built on three

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,600
powerful tools handed out by the US

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,919
government. Contracts, grants, and tax

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080
breaks. Take Tesla for example. Every

132
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
time an American buys a Tesla, they

133
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
don't just get a sleek EV. They also get

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,800
a $7,500

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
federal tax credit. Now, that's not a

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
discount from Tesla. That's the US

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,720
government literally paying people to

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,840
drive Elon's cars. In 2023 alone, Tesla

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,320
got 2.8 8 billion worth of credits,

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,000
making them the biggest EV player in

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,039
America. Then in 2021, under Biden, NASA

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,120
handed Elon a $2.9 billion contract to

143
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
land astronauts on the moon. So

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,479
basically, the US government hired Elon

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,039
Musk to run America's moon program. And

146
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,199
then came the solar investment tax

147
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,919
credit. So if your solar setup costs

148
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:10,160
$10,000, the government of United States

149
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,039
covers $3,000 or 30% of your cost. So

150
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,759
you pay just $7,000.

151
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,400
This one policy kept the American solar

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
dream alive. And just like that, you

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,960
will be shocked to know that Elon Musk's

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,199
companies have racked in over $ 38

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,080
billion in federal funding in the past

156
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,960
two decades. But guess what? twothird of

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,000
that funding, I repeat, twothird of that

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,400
funding came under President Joe Biden.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
And barely any of it came during the

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,759
presidency of Donald Trump. And during

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
that time, Elon and Trump absolutely

162
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,840
hated each other. He's not going to be

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,319
president. That I can tell you. And I'm

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,639
safe. You know why? He can't be. He

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
wasn't born in this country. So, he's

166
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
another artist, but he's not

167
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,880
going to be Biden. The Tesla CEO wrote

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,639
on X, "I don't hate the man, but it's

169
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
time for Trump to hang up his hat and

170
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
sail into the sunset." You know,

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
hopefully Trump doesn't get the

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,680
nomination of, you know, the Republican

173
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,400
party. That's cuz I think that's um

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,560
Yeah, that wouldn't be good. Even after

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,280
all this support from Biden, when the

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,080
elections arrived, surprisingly, Elon

177
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
Musk supported Trump. And suddenly, Elon

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,840
and Trump were the new best friends on

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,800
the street. Have a new star.

180
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,440
A star is born. Elon, he created the

181
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,000
first major American car company in

182
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,639
generations. And his rocket company is

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,360
the only reason we can now send American

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
astronauts into space. We had one

185
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,080
president who couldn't climb a flight of

186
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,800
stairs and another who was fist pumping

187
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,880
after getting shot. So the question is

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
suddenly, how did Elon become best

189
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,319
friends with Trump? When Tesla's

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,919
self-driving cars were crashing, the

191
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
government stepped in and started

192
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,199
investigating whether Tesla was putting

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,440
lives at risk. And when it comes to

194
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,599
SpaceX rockets, they were built and

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,240
ready to fly, but they were getting

196
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,120
delayed not because of engineering, but

197
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,360
because of paperwork. In fact, Elon Musk

198
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,440
famously said that it takes less time to

199
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,280
build a rocket than to get government

200
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
approval to launch it. Similarly, when

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
Neuralink started testing brain chips on

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
monkeys, the monkeys started dying. So

203
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
the government called it cruelty and

204
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
blocked Neuralink from starting human

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,160
trials. In fact, at one point more than

206
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,240
20 government cases were going against

207
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,319
Elon's companies. So Elon Musk wasn't

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,720
just fighting against competitors, he

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
was fighting against the American system

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
and that is why backing Trump felt like

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
the perfect shortcut. And the other

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
reason has to do with the fact that

213
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,519
America's debt is a ticking time bomb.

214
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,200
America is also going bankrupt extremely

215
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,640
quickly. Um, and and nobody seems to

216
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
everyone seems to be sort of whistling

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,040
past the graveyard on this one. Look at

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,360
this. Since 2001, the US government has

219
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,160
been spending far more than it earns.

220
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,720
And this gap just keeps getting bigger,

221
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
bigger, and bigger. So to cover it, the

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,480
government keeps on borrowing. And by

223
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,880
2025, America hit a staggering $36

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,040
trillion in debt. And Elon knew that if

225
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
America collapses into a recession, then

226
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,560
no one's buying a Tesla when they don't

227
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
have jobs. No one's installing solar

228
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
panels when they can't afford

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
electricity. And no one's funding Mars

230
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,920
missions when people are running out of

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
jobs. Can now project the winner of the

232
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,880
presidential race, Donald Trump, wins

233
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:30,560
the presidency. What started off as

234
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:33,760
unlikely, impossible, is now reality.

235
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,080
I will fight for you with every breath

236
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,360
in my body, and I will never ever let

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,000
you down. Ladies and gentlemen,

238
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,040
Please welcome the next president of the

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,720
United States, Donald J. Trump. So when

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,600
Trump promised to slash wasteful

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
spending, Elon saw a financial savior

242
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,160
and he gave millions of dollars to make

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
him the president of the United States

244
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,080
of America. And when Donald Trump became

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
the president of the United States, he

246
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,800
made Elon the head of a new entity

247
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,080
called the Department of Government

248
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,080
Efficiency, also called Doge. And Doge

249
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,079
had two bold goals. Number one, they

250
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,120
wanted to cut $2 trillion in government

251
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,519
waste and save $1 trillion by September

252
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
2025. And secondly, they wanted to

253
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,000
destroy bureaucracy, remove the red

254
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,560
tape, and speed up innovation. And for a

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,640
while, the bromance was unstoppable.

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,640
Cable news couldn't stop talking. Wall

257
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,800
Street couldn't stop buying. And Tesla's

258
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,200
stock shot up by 169%. Eventually, Elon

259
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,040
Musk became the richest man on Earth

260
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
again. And just when everybody thought

261
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,000
that Elon and Trump will rule the world,

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,120
something crazy happened. Within just 5

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,519
months, Doge collapsed. Within 1 week,

264
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
Doge was hit with 31 lawsuits.

265
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
Government workers revolted. Legal

266
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
experts called it an unconstitutional

267
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,160
overreach. And every time Doge tried to

268
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,480
cut spending, the court said, "Nice try,

269
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,519
Iron Man, but this is not how democracy

270
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,200
works." And the worst part was that Doge

271
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
had no legal power to change

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
regulations. only the Congress could do

273
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
it. So while Doge was held responsible,

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,079
it practically had no control. And it

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,680
failed so badly that while they aimed to

276
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:21,200
save $2 trillion, by June 2025, Doge had

277
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,519
saved just $180 billion. And by May,

278
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
Elon Musk stepped down from Doge. And

279
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
this is when, ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,160
Trump dropped a bombshell. Donald Trump

281
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,320
introduced something called the one big

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,279
beautiful pill. And this is where the

283
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,440
Elon Trump war truly begins. President

284
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,680
Donald Trump with his so-called big

285
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
beautiful bill on the line. We call it a

286
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,480
great big beautiful bill cuz that's what

287
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,560
it is. And uh again, biggest tax cuts in

288
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
history, biggest economic development

289
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,640
moves anywhere. We've never done

290
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,040
anything like it. You know, I was like

291
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,279
disappointed to see the massive spending

292
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,600
b. So the question is, what the hell is

293
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
the one big beautiful bill? Well, on

294
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
paper it just looks like a mix of tax

295
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,720
cuts and reforms. But in reality, it's a

296
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,600
corporate earthquake, especially if your

297
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
name is Elon Musk. Why? Let's break it

298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
down. The first reason is that

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
economists believe that it is the

300
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,440
perfect recipe for an economic collapse.

301
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,160
In fact, Elon believes that this bill

302
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
will reduce America's revenue by $2.5

303
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
trillion over the next 10 years. And

304
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,200
Elon believes that this bill could push

305
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
the United States into another economic

306
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,279
collapse. The second reason is that this

307
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,440
bill is practically a death sentence to

308
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,639
EVs. This bill kills the $7,500

309
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,519
EV tax credit, which means Tesla's will

310
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
instantly become $7,500

311
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,200
more expensive. And if this happens,

312
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,639
what will happen? The middle class

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,720
buyers, Tesla's largest base will simply

314
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,800
stop buying. And then comes the third

315
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,639
reason, which are the Chinese battery

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,480
tariffs. You see, the United States

317
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,160
imposed tariffs of up to 721% on Chinese

318
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
battery supplies. Sounds like a

319
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,160
punishment to the Chinese, right? But

320
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,959
guess what? It actually ends up choking

321
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,200
Tesla. Why? Because nearly 40% of

322
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,680
Tesla's battery suppliers are Chinese.

323
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
And now every battery cell is getting

324
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,079
more expensive. And this is why, ladies

325
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
and gentlemen, there's a chain reaction

326
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,360
which practically strangles Tesla. How?

327
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,360
No EV tax credit means Teslas will get

328
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
more expensive. If Teslas get more

329
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
expensive then the demand will crash.

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
Similarly, if the tariffs are very very

331
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,639
high, input costs will rise. If input

332
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
costs rise, margins will shrink. And

333
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,639
when the sales slow down and the cost

334
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,880
start rising, what will happen? Tesla's

335
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,959
stock will start crashing. And when the

336
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,760
stocks come crashing down, Tesla's

337
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,600
expansion might be put on hold. And this

338
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
is not just happening to Tesla, guys.

339
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
It's also happening to SpaceX. You see,

340
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,360
NASA and Pentagon gave Elon $22 billion

341
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,440
in contracts. But now Trump says that

342
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,639
they are bloated and they may cancel

343
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,360
$845 million in upcoming launches. And

344
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,920
then comes the broadband plan. You see

345
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,399
the US government set aside $42.45

346
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,399
billion to connect every corner of the

347
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,040
country using the internet. And Starlink

348
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,440
was poised to benefit the most, but now

349
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,320
even that is at risk. Thirdly, there is

350
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,120
a hit to Solar City. This bill also cuts

351
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,279
the 30% solar tax credit that powered

352
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,600
Solar City's growth. And lastly, to make

353
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,920
matters worse, even Grock is being hit.

354
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
You see, the AI engine of Grock runs on

355
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,160
supercomput. But the catch over here is

356
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,279
that its power source has been operating

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,040
without a Clean Air Act permit. And if

358
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,360
the Environmental Protection Agency

359
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,720
cracks down, Grock's power could fall

360
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,279
from 1,200 megawatt to just 150

361
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,680
megawatt. And that would the

362
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,000
entire operation of Grock. So, long

363
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,320
story short, Tesla stock is bleeding.

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,959
Solar City is on the edge. SpaceX is

365
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,959
under threat and Grock might just face a

366
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,880
power cut. All of this is happening

367
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,600
because of just one bill. One

368
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,240
deceptively named bill called the one

369
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,399
big beautiful bill. This is how what

370
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,440
started as a bromance has now turned

371
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,360
into a no rules showdown. The scary part

372
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
is that this showdown is happening

373
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
between the richest man on earth and the

374
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
most powerful man on earth. This is a

375
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
battle that could literally decide the

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
future of American innovation. And by

377
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
the time this war ends, either Elon

378
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,279
Musk's empire will burn or Washington

379
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,000
will finally understand what happens

380
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,079
when you push a disruptor too far. And

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,240
this entire story has three very

382
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
important lessons to teach us. Lesson

383
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
number one, innovation can build

384
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,120
empires, but policies can break them

385
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,120
overnight. In this case, Tesla isn't

386
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,680
being disrupted by a competitor, it's

387
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,920
being crippled by a tax code revision.

388
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
Lesson number two, if the system can

389
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,800
give you wings, please remember it can

390
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,279
also clip them. So always deal with the

391
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,759
system very very carefully. And last and

392
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,320
most importantly, we must never confuse

393
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,040
proximity to power with the delusion of

394
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,160
control over it. In politics, you are an

395
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,759
ally only until you are a liability. So

396
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,240
if you build your future on borrowed

397
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,040
power, make sure you know who owns the

398
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,199
switch because one day that switch will

399
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,680
flip. This is what we need to learn from

400
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,959
the Elon Trump saga. That's all from my

401
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
side for today guys. If you learned

402
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,440
