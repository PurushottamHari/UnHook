1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Every Single Book Pitch Has Toppers Like

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,040
But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it wo

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
n't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
then what is the use of reading them again and again

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
?

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
IQ.

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,079
Hello Friends.  Friends, finally the second

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,160
black box of the Air India plane crash has been

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
recovered.  You can see the

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,760
news Second black box recovered from Air

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,760
India plane crash site.  So here

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
many questions might be coming to your mind

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
because just two-three days ago you might have

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
heard that a black box has been recovered.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,399
So is

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
this the second black box since it was already recovered?

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,800
How many black boxes are there?  I will

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
give you detailed information about everything

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
so that you do not have any doubt.  Let's

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,039
move on.  Look, first of all let me

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,879
tell you that last late night the news came that an official statement was issued by PK

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,119
Mishra, who is the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Narendra

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,360
Modi,

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,680

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,400
and in it he told that the second

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
black box, that is cockpit voice

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,600
recorder CVR, was recovered

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
because the first black box was

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
already recovered on Friday

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
from the roof top.  You all know that the Air India

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,520
plane which had crashed, had crashed into the

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,159
hostel building which is the medical student's

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
hostel building and the

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
first black box was recovered from the roof top

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
but the second one has

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
finally been recovered now. Keep in mind that there are

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
basically two types of black boxes inside any aircraft.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
We call this one, flight data

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,479
recorder.  I will tell you about it in detail

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,280
and the second one is Cockpet Voice

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,840
Recorder.  So, what was recovered here on the first Friday was the

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,399
flight data

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,200
recorder and the flight data recorder was

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,520
intact, it was absolutely safe and it has been

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
sent to Delhi for analysis by the

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,800
Aircraft Accident Investigation

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,959
Bureau and here, the US NTSB,

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,440
Boeing experts are also being taken for help.

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
So the news that came in late last night is that the

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
second black box that has been

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
recovered is your cockpit voice

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
recorder and it was a little difficult to find it

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,440
because of the

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,080
debris that had accumulated all over the site and

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
it was not found there.

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,480
What happens finally is that the help of drones etc. is

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,879
taken.

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,599
This second black box, the

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
cockpit voice recorder, was found in the debris using drone-assisted thermal imaging.

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,000
Aldo, it is also being told that this too was

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
burnt badly.  Meaning, this second black

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,720
box had burnt, but it was

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,040
burnt only superficially.  The main structure inside is

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
intact.  Meaning the data is

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,160
safe here and will be finally checked.

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Well now the question here is what is the

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,040
main function of these two black boxes

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
?  The first one we found on

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,239
Friday was the flight data recorder.  Its

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,879
purpose is to collect the technical performance data,

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,120
basically the

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,360
technical performance data of the aircraft.  That

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,159
means you can understand that there are 80 to

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
100 such parameters whose data it

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,040
records.  For example,

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,599
attitude, air speed, and vertical

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
acceleration, which are gravitational forces.

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,680
Then apart from this there is the flap and slat

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
position.  In fact, you are seeing that there is a lot of

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,920
discussion that in the Air India

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,560
plane accident, the flaps were

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,040
closed, it should have been 5Â°, that means

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
you must be getting to see different opinions about auto pilot

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
setting, flight control surface position, a

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,879
lot of such technical performance

95
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,120
data is recorded by the flight

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,440
data recorder and the question here is also that

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,680
how old data is found in it, so it is

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,120
said that in the modern

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
flight data recorders, you

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,920
can recover at least 25 hours of flight data, that means

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,080
past 24-25 hours and the storage

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,360
medium is Solid State Memory with

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,319
Crash Survival Unit.  Well, the second one

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
that was recovered yesterday is the cockpit voice

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,920
recorder.  Again this is very important.  In

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
fact both are very

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,400
important for you.  But

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,040
if you look at this second one,

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,120
it records the human intervention here.

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
Meaning

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,680
it captures all the sounds inside the cockpit.  Suppose

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
what conversation is taking place between the one who is a pilot and the one who is a co-pilot?

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
What is happening with the communication with air traffic control?  Data regarding alarms,

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,479
warnings etc is

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,960
captured here.  The ambient cockpit

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,199
sound means that if inside the cockpit the

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
pilot is pressing a button then

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
its sound will be heard.  So it captures all the ambient sounds around you.

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,840

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
And if you see its recording, it is not

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,759
very long.  But yes, in the modern

125
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
cockpit voice recorders

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
you will get at least 2 hours of recording.  In the

127
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
old ones,

128
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,880
you only got 30 minutes.  What is end data

129
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,280
?  It is overwritten in a loop

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,280
so that the old

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
data gets deleted and new data

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
keeps getting captured on it.  Now the question is

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,759

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
why is this corporate voice recorder so crucial?  Because it helps in

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,400
investigating the human factor here.

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Meaning, was there

137
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,120
any miscommunication between the pilots?  Was there

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
any kind of panic?  How

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,080
was the reaction?  How was the situation awareness regarding emergencies

140
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,479
?  So, it records such data which relates to human factors which are

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
very difficult to understand

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,639
and its

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
analysis again becomes very important.

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,320
So here in fact the question also

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
arises that

146
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
what is the design and construction of this black box?  Look, the

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,199
black box is made with such a structure, that is, it is

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
made in such a way that

149
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
it can stand any kind of extreme

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
conditions.

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,919
Meaning it should not break easily.  And keep in mind that

152
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,000
its colour is bright orange.  Many

153
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
times people think that the name is Black Box.  So

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
it would be black in colour.  No, this

155
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
is a myth.  It is not black in colour.  Again you

156
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
can see, you will see something like this.

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
Flight recorder and

158
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
what's here is that it also has reflective strips

159
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
so that it can be identified from a distance.

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
What is the material used?   The

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,360
casing is made of titanium or stainless steel so that the data inside it is

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,160
not lost easily.  There is crash resistance.

164
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,440
Meaning it can survive

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,600
impact up to 3400 G.  Now what is this g?

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
This is not a village.  This

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,000
is gravitational force.  That means

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,720
it can withstand 3400 times the gravitational force. You can imagine that

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,360
it can withstand up to 3400 times the force of

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,560
gravity.  And then there is fire

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
resistance.  Meaning

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,639
it will be able to withstand up to 1100 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.  So it

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
is obvious that you must have seen the

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
crash that happened in Ahmedabad.  As soon as the crash

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,840
happened, the whole thing came out like a ball of fire.  Meaning, the

176
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
temperature had become so high that you can

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,319
understand that if it is not made like this then

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,560
this flight data recorder and this

179
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
black box will be completely

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
destroyed, so apart from this, there is

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
also water resistance here because

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,080
in most of the cases you must have seen many times that the

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
flight falls into the sea,

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,759
so in such a situation, what is there is

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
deep sea submersion, meaning

186
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
it can withstand pressure up to 2000 feet and there are

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
also underwater locator beacons here, meaning, what

188
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,440
you will see on the side, this is the underwater

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,160
locator beacon.  Every second, for the

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,240
next 30 days after the crash, you will

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,039
see light emitting here.  Meaning, whatever is

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,880
pink comes out.  Well,

193
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
know the myths and facts about the black box.

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
First of all, I have already told you that it is

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,319
not black in colour.  It is of bright orange colour.  Is

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
video recording also done here

197
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,960
?  No.  Here only

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,280
audio and data are recorded.

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,160
Instax, this can never break.  No

200
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,199
means it is very difficult to break but not 100%

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
indestructible.  Is it always

202
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
available?  No.  For example, the

203
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
black box of MSH 370 has

204
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,199
not been found yet.  So, these are all issues.  well

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,000
what is its location?  Please take care.

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,759
Basically it is kept at the back.  The

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
tail end that you are seeing, and both the

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
black boxes, the cockpit voice recorder and the

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
flight data recorder, are both towards your back

210
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
because the chances of impact are less here.  There

211
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639

212
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,560
is more security.  So because of this,

213
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,479
it is selected there.  Well, why does this black box

214
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,800
matter so much?  Because it

215
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,360
helps a lot in accident investigation.

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,400
We investigated all the crashes that happened here, including Air France 447 and Ethiopian Airlines 302.

219
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,960
Meaning, a lot was revealed through the black box.

220
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,399
Apart from this, the design of the aircraft is

221
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
also improved.  Like

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,839
Boeing 737 Max was having many accidents.

223
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,000
So after the accident, based on the

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,640
data recovered through the black box, the

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
flight design, which is a kind of design of the

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
aircraft, was

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
improved.  Apart from this,

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
regulatory reforms are also brought in.

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,399
Because of this, safety recommendations are also included.

230
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
Whenever we get any important

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
thing from this black box.  So

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
because of this it matters a lot so that no

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,040
kind of accident happens in the future.

234
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,040
Well, efforts are now being made to improve this black box as well.

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,440

236
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
Meaning, we don't always have to search for it again and again.

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,519

238
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,200
Many times I am never able to find it.  This should never happen.  So

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
here, for example, it is being said

240
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
that suppose a plane

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,480
falls into the sea, then your black box should automatically get

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
detached and start floating in the sea

243
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,279
so that it can be recovered easily.

244
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,160
This has already been placed inside some military planes.

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,880
Then real time

246
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,720
data streaming means that critical data is

247
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,560
directly sent to the satellite.

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Why do we have to wait till we

249
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,720
find the black box, only then we will be able to recover the data.

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
Nowadays

251
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
you can get it directly through satellites etc.  So all this

252
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
is important.  Apart from this,

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
we can also keep cloud based backup of it.  This means

254
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,560
that recordings in encrypted form

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,120

256
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
can also be put into a secure server.  Nowadays it is the era of AI.

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Whatever data is there here, with the help of AI, we will be

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
able to know about better things.  So because of this

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
you will see the future of black box also

260
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,839
differently.  Well,

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,399
now the question arises here that

262
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
both the black boxes of the Air India plane crash have now been

263
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
found.  So now

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,560
what will be the objective of the investigation here?

265
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
Look, the most important thing will be that the

266
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,440
data will be synchronized.  The

267
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,480
flight data recorder and the cockpit

268
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,760
voice recorder will be

269
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,399
matched on the timeline so that it can be ascertained whether the

270
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,399
technical things that were happening along with the

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
things that were happening in the cockpit are

272
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,760
matching or not.  So an

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
attempt will be made to synchronize it.

274
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,959
Secondly, in the audio here,

275
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
what decisions were taken in the cockpit?

276
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
How was the communication during the pilot?  What was the alert tone like

277
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
?  It will be analyzed here.

278
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
Then there is review of technical parameters,

279
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,320
meaning whether the mechanical and electronic

280
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
systems were functioning properly or

281
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
not.  Then apart from this there is

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,560
sabotage here, has someone done something

283
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
wrong?  There has been some external problem

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,320
or there has been a bird strike.

285
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,839
Foreign object has been damaged.  Meaning, an attempt will be made

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
here to find out some things.

287
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,839
Initially, let me

288
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,480
tell you the hypothesis that is being given.   It

289
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
is said that the engine had failed.   Could

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
not get thrust.  Now look, it is

291
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,040
very difficult to understand what could have happened that

292
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,160
both the engines failed simultaneously

293
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,320
because there were two engines in it and it would be a very rare

294
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,399
chance that both the engines would

295
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
fail simultaneously.  So there is a need to understand

296
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
how this happened.  Suppose a bird had

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
struck and one engine might have failed

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,600
and in these modern aircrafts,

299
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
you can easily land it

300
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
and take it off with just one engine.

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
Then in addition the auto pilot computer has

302
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,640
malfunctioned.  Something like this is being told.

303
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,120
Flap deployment is improper in that.   A

304
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
crude disorientation had occurred.  Failure to

305
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
respond warning.  Somewhere here we were

306
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,200
unable to respond to the warning.  So this

307
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,480
could be one as well.  Then there is talk of contamination.  Is there

308
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,640
any contamination in the fuel and hydraulic fluid?  So these

311
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,640
kind of hypotheses are being given for now.

312
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Well,

313
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,079
who all are involved in the entire investigation that is going on here?

314
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,680
You will find many agencies inside it.

315
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,720
For example, the lead

316
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,800
investigator in this is AAIB, which

317
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,519
is Aircraft Accident

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,920
Investigation Bureau.  Ok?

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
Whose prime responsibility is to ultimately

320
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,839
find out what has happened.  Then it

321
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,839
is obvious that India's regulator, DGCA, is

322
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,680
involved.  Boeing will

323
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
have to get involved.  Now since Boeing is an American

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
company, the USA regulator

325
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
NTSB has also been included.

326
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
Apart from this, local police forensic team has

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
also been included here.  Well,

328
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,600
what will happen next?  Look, it is being

329
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,839
said that the preliminary report may come in the next 30 days

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,839
including raw data.  It may take

331
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,360
6 months to 12 months for the final report to arrive.  I

332
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
mean it depends,

333
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
you cannot say it exactly.  Then there is talk of bringing reforms

334
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
in Air India and the overall aviation sector.   There will

335
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,920

336
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,839

337
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
now be changes in pilot certification, audit maintenance and many other things.

338
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,440
Let's see what happens from here.  But I

339
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
hope that

340
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,120
you have understood everything that was being discussed regarding the black box.

341
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,399
And before I go, a very

342
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
interesting question.  Can you tell

343
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,600
?  Which international body sets

344
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,160
standards for black box design and

345
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
crash survivability?  Which is the

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,079
international body that sets standards

347
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
for black boxes?  And

348
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,360
you all know the right answer to this.  You

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You

350
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
can get

351
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,720

buy these batches with maximum discount.  Every single book pitch has topper

364
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,760
suggested but nothing works for me.  I was

365
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
like it, it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not

366
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
happening then what is the use of reading them again and again

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,880
?

368
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,519
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

370
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,200

371
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,200
Even after that he did not

372
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,839
leave me.  I have taken this mock I study

373
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,760

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,000
