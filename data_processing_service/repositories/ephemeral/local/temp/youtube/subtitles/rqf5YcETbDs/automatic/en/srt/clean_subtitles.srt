And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, finally the second black box of the Air India plane crash has been recovered.  You can see the news Second black box recovered from Air India plane crash site.  So here many questions might be coming to your mind because just two-three days ago you might have heard that a black box has been recovered. So is this the second black box since it was already recovered? How many black boxes are there?  I will give you detailed information about everything so that you do not have any doubt.  Let's move on.  Look, first of all let me tell you that last late night the news came that an official statement was issued by PK Mishra, who is the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in it he told that the second black box, that is cockpit voice recorder CVR, was recovered because the first black box was already recovered on Friday from the roof top.  You all know that the Air India plane which had crashed, had crashed into the hostel building which is the medical student's hostel building and the first black box was recovered from the roof top but the second one has finally been recovered now. Keep in mind that there are basically two types of black boxes inside any aircraft. We call this one, flight data recorder.  I will tell you about it in detail and the second one is Cockpet Voice Recorder.  So, what was recovered here on the first Friday was the flight data recorder and the flight data recorder was intact, it was absolutely safe and it has been sent to Delhi for analysis by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and here, the US NTSB, Boeing experts are also being taken for help. So the news that came in late last night is that the second black box that has been recovered is your cockpit voice recorder and it was a little difficult to find it because of the debris that had accumulated all over the site and it was not found there. What happens finally is that the help of drones etc. is taken. This second black box, the cockpit voice recorder, was found in the debris using drone-assisted thermal imaging. Aldo, it is also being told that this too was burnt badly.  Meaning, this second black box had burnt, but it was burnt only superficially.  The main structure inside is intact.  Meaning the data is safe here and will be finally checked. Well now the question here is what is the main function of these two black boxes ?  The first one we found on Friday was the flight data recorder.  Its purpose is to collect the technical performance data, basically the technical performance data of the aircraft.  That means you can understand that there are 80 to 100 such parameters whose data it records.  For example, attitude, air speed, and vertical acceleration, which are gravitational forces. Then apart from this there is the flap and slat position.  In fact, you are seeing that there is a lot of discussion that in the Air India plane accident, the flaps were closed, it should have been 5Â°, that means you must be getting to see different opinions about auto pilot setting, flight control surface position, a lot of such technical performance data is recorded by the flight data recorder and the question here is also that how old data is found in it, so it is said that in the modern flight data recorders, you can recover at least 25 hours of flight data, that means past 24-25 hours and the storage medium is Solid State Memory with Crash Survival Unit.  Well, the second one that was recovered yesterday is the cockpit voice recorder.  Again this is very important.  In fact both are very important for you.  But if you look at this second one, it records the human intervention here. Meaning it captures all the sounds inside the cockpit.  Suppose what conversation is taking place between the one who is a pilot and the one who is a co-pilot? What is happening with the communication with air traffic control?  Data regarding alarms, warnings etc is captured here.  The ambient cockpit sound means that if inside the cockpit the pilot is pressing a button then its sound will be heard.  So it captures all the ambient sounds around you. And if you see its recording, it is not very long.  But yes, in the modern cockpit voice recorders you will get at least 2 hours of recording.  In the old ones, you only got 30 minutes.  What is end data ?  It is overwritten in a loop so that the old data gets deleted and new data keeps getting captured on it.  Now the question is why is this corporate voice recorder so crucial?  Because it helps in investigating the human factor here. Meaning, was there any miscommunication between the pilots?  Was there any kind of panic?  How was the reaction?  How was the situation awareness regarding emergencies ?  So, it records such data which relates to human factors which are very difficult to understand and its analysis again becomes very important. So here in fact the question also arises that what is the design and construction of this black box?  Look, the black box is made with such a structure, that is, it is made in such a way that it can stand any kind of extreme conditions. Meaning it should not break easily.  And keep in mind that its colour is bright orange.  Many times people think that the name is Black Box.  So it would be black in colour.  No, this is a myth.  It is not black in colour.  Again you can see, you will see something like this. Flight recorder and what's here is that it also has reflective strips so that it can be identified from a distance. What is the material used?   The casing is made of titanium or stainless steel so that the data inside it is not lost easily.  There is crash resistance. Meaning it can survive impact up to 3400 G.  Now what is this g? This is not a village.  This is gravitational force.  That means it can withstand 3400 times the gravitational force. You can imagine that it can withstand up to 3400 times the force of gravity.  And then there is fire resistance.  Meaning it will be able to withstand up to 1100 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.  So it is obvious that you must have seen the crash that happened in Ahmedabad.  As soon as the crash happened, the whole thing came out like a ball of fire.  Meaning, the temperature had become so high that you can understand that if it is not made like this then this flight data recorder and this black box will be completely destroyed, so apart from this, there is also water resistance here because in most of the cases you must have seen many times that the flight falls into the sea, so in such a situation, what is there is deep sea submersion, meaning it can withstand pressure up to 2000 feet and there are also underwater locator beacons here, meaning, what you will see on the side, this is the underwater locator beacon.  Every second, for the next 30 days after the crash, you will see light emitting here.  Meaning, whatever is pink comes out.  Well, know the myths and facts about the black box. First of all, I have already told you that it is not black in colour.  It is of bright orange colour.  Is video recording also done here ?  No.  Here only audio and data are recorded. Instax, this can never break.  No means it is very difficult to break but not 100% indestructible.  Is it always available?  No.  For example, the black box of MSH 370 has not been found yet.  So, these are all issues.  well what is its location?  Please take care. Basically it is kept at the back.  The tail end that you are seeing, and both the black boxes, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, are both towards your back because the chances of impact are less here.  There is more security.  So because of this, it is selected there.  Well, why does this black box matter so much?  Because it helps a lot in accident investigation. We investigated all the crashes that happened here, including Air France 447 and Ethiopian Airlines 302. Meaning, a lot was revealed through the black box. Apart from this, the design of the aircraft is also improved.  Like Boeing 737 Max was having many accidents. So after the accident, based on the data recovered through the black box, the flight design, which is a kind of design of the aircraft, was improved.  Apart from this, regulatory reforms are also brought in. Because of this, safety recommendations are also included. Whenever we get any important thing from this black box.  So because of this it matters a lot so that no kind of accident happens in the future. Well, efforts are now being made to improve this black box as well. Meaning, we don't always have to search for it again and again. Many times I am never able to find it.  This should never happen.  So here, for example, it is being said that suppose a plane falls into the sea, then your black box should automatically get detached and start floating in the sea so that it can be recovered easily. This has already been placed inside some military planes. Then real time data streaming means that critical data is directly sent to the satellite. Why do we have to wait till we find the black box, only then we will be able to recover the data. Nowadays you can get it directly through satellites etc.  So all this is important.  Apart from this, we can also keep cloud based backup of it.  This means that recordings in encrypted form can also be put into a secure server.  Nowadays it is the era of AI. Whatever data is there here, with the help of AI, we will be able to know about better things.  So because of this you will see the future of black box also differently.  Well, now the question arises here that both the black boxes of the Air India plane crash have now been found.  So now what will be the objective of the investigation here? Look, the most important thing will be that the data will be synchronized.  The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder will be matched on the timeline so that it can be ascertained whether the technical things that were happening along with the things that were happening in the cockpit are matching or not.  So an attempt will be made to synchronize it. Secondly, in the audio here, what decisions were taken in the cockpit? How was the communication during the pilot?  What was the alert tone like ?  It will be analyzed here. Then there is review of technical parameters, meaning whether the mechanical and electronic systems were functioning properly or not.  Then apart from this there is sabotage here, has someone done something wrong?  There has been some external problem or there has been a bird strike. Foreign object has been damaged.  Meaning, an attempt will be made here to find out some things. Initially, let me tell you the hypothesis that is being given.   It is said that the engine had failed.   Could not get thrust.  Now look, it is very difficult to understand what could have happened that both the engines failed simultaneously because there were two engines in it and it would be a very rare chance that both the engines would fail simultaneously.  So there is a need to understand how this happened.  Suppose a bird had struck and one engine might have failed and in these modern aircrafts, you can easily land it and take it off with just one engine. Then in addition the auto pilot computer has malfunctioned.  Something like this is being told. Flap deployment is improper in that.   A crude disorientation had occurred.  Failure to respond warning.  Somewhere here we were unable to respond to the warning.  So this could be one as well.  Then there is talk of contamination.  Is there any contamination in the fuel and hydraulic fluid?  So these kind of hypotheses are being given for now. Well, who all are involved in the entire investigation that is going on here? You will find many agencies inside it. For example, the lead investigator in this is AAIB, which is Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.  Ok? Whose prime responsibility is to ultimately find out what has happened.  Then it is obvious that India's regulator, DGCA, is involved.  Boeing will have to get involved.  Now since Boeing is an American company, the USA regulator NTSB has also been included. Apart from this, local police forensic team has also been included here.  Well, what will happen next?  Look, it is being said that the preliminary report may come in the next 30 days including raw data.  It may take 6 months to 12 months for the final report to arrive.  I mean it depends, you cannot say it exactly.  Then there is talk of bringing reforms in Air India and the overall aviation sector.   There will now be changes in pilot certification, audit maintenance and many other things. Let's see what happens from here.  But I hope that you have understood everything that was being discussed regarding the black box. And before I go, a very interesting question.  Can you tell ?  Which international body sets standards for black box design and crash survivability?  Which is the international body that sets standards for black boxes?  And you all know the right answer to this.  You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You can get its correct answer from Telegram.
