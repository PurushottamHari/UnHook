Friends, Iran is going to launch a massive attack on Israel.  It is going to retaliate.  And I am saying this because the Shia Muslims living in Iran have now declared that we will take revenge from Israel.  You are seeing the dome of Jamkaran Mosque. You can see this red colored flag on top of its dome. This means that revenge will be taken now. So whenever this red cloth or this flag is seen on mosques inside Iran, they are now ready to take revenge. So, it means that Iran has suffered losses and Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed by Israel.  Now this tricolour on Jamkaran Mosque means that something big is going to happen somewhere. Israel and Iran are now entangled with each other. But what is its root cause after all ?  This lecture is going to be amazing. I promise you that after watching this lecture many concepts will become clear to you and I will also tell you about the villain hidden behind the curtain, who is the villain behind this and how has he controlled the whole world.  Everything is scripted.  He has scripted everything. Be it Iran, be it Israel, be it Ukraine, be it Russia.  Everything, every entire movie is scripted.  The way it has been destroyed. You can see the scene of devastation. Israel attacked with a missile. Tabriz, Tehran, Arak, Kermanshah, Nataaj which are very important nuclear sites for Iran.  Isfan, nuclear attacks have been carried out here, that is, attacks have been carried out on the nuclear sites so that they can be destroyed and almost they have been destroyed. So you people can see the scene of devastation.  The way Israel attacked on 13th June, Israel was saying, brother, we were going to carry out this attack, not today, but earlier too. Ishmael's Ishmael's has been eliminated here.  That means, Ismail has been killed in the incident and you can see inside Iran that massive attacks are taking place everywhere, even during the night. Whose plane is this?  Who is inside it?  It stars Benjamin Etan Yahoo. Benjamin Eden Yahoo is being scouted by his Air Force fighter jets. Actually, all the F16 and F15 American fighter jets are with Israel today and America has completely filled Israel with weapons. Benjamin Tania is in it who is going to Greece and after going to Greece, he is taking himself to a safe zone.  This picture was released by the media that Benjamin Nitin Yau is leaving the country and going to some safe place.  PM Modi also received a call and he tweeted that he received a phone call from PM Nitan Yau of Israel.  Ok?  And he briefed me about what kind of situation it was?  What is going to happen and how the Middle East is burning in flames.  Donald Trump: Look, Donald Trump is a very important person.  He says just do it.  This work has to be done. Which work now?  The task of destroying Iran. Because he is not obeying.  But no matter how hard it is, it doesn't matter. Attack in any way you can.  But Iran has to be taught a lesson here.  This is the message of Donald Trump and at the end he says that before it is too late.  Get this done before it's too late.  God bless you.  This message is what Donald Trump says. Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Yahoo said in a video that he had ordered his military officials to destroy Iran's nuclear program in November 2024.  That means it is about November 2024 only.  At the time when they were ready to attack Iran.  But the attack was scheduled for late April.  So the order was given completely within the number 2024 and it was said to attack and these people were going to attack within April.  But due to some reasons it was postponed.  What was the reason that the Iranian alliance in the region broke down after the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September 2024.  After this it became clear that Iran will now do something big. He will prepare his nuclear weapons. But now Israel is saying that we do not have any option.  Because Iran has nuclear weapons, our existence here will end.  So Israel says that our existence will end.  So, let us do something before our existence ends.  This is what Israel says.  But ultimately the question is who is the villain behind this curtain?   The villain is USA.  And I have told you many times that USA is a very strong player.  Now see what should be done if Iran does this ?  What Iran did was to deploy Houthi rebels inside Yemen. What Iran did was to create Hezbollah inside Syria.  And what Iran did was to prepare Hamas. Meaning, Iran has created a small military component here with the help of its Revolutionary Guard. Like Hamas, Hezbollah and they directly attack Israel.  They directly attack Israel.  But why did Iran feel the need to attack Israel ?  Because Israel is a puppet of the US.  So is Peppet from the USA. Israel will do whatever the USA wants.  So USA prepared a big weapon of its own.  Brother, someone should make nuclear weapons.  Someone makes missiles.  So an entire country was prepared as a missile and that is Israel.  And what will Israel do? Will attack Iran.  Recently you might know that when Nova Festival was a music festival in Israel, Hamas attacked it.  Israel also completely destroyed the Gaza Strip to eliminate Hamas.   The people in the Gaza Strip, the children, are now dying of hunger there.  Ok? But in the meantime, there were clashes with Iran as well because Israel was troubled by Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas, and Israel also knew that Iran was supporting them because it was supplying weapons to them, supplying them weapons in the defense sector, and Iran was behind this.  So Israel thought that they will destroy Iran so that Hezbollah remains active inside Syria. This will be over.  Active inside Lebanon. With this, this entire activity inside Yemen will end.  Now what does the USA do?  He provides Israel with all possible weapons to fight. Now where does this actually start from?  US Iran nuclear talks means that US wants to make a nuclear deal with Iran.  A meeting regarding this deal was also held in Oman. But she failed.   There was no discussion on this.  So Mark Rubio was there.  We have been very clear that Iran is never going to have nuclear weapons.  Meaning it was clear, USA was clear that Iran will not make any nuclear weapon.  I think that's what led to the meeting Mr. Rubio said during the cabinet.  Meaning what they were saying was that we will not allow it to be made under any circumstances.  And this was in April.  But Iran, being what it is, was not stopping at this. Israel Wood Be the Leader.  Meaning, what Trump is saying is that Israel will be the leader.  Who will strike on Iran?  The meaning is clearly visible that USA has prepared one of its weapons in the name of Israel.  And whenever USA faces trouble, who will it field ?  will take down Israel.  And this is how you guys can see it.  So the talks that are going on are happening here. Now where did it actually start from?   The CIA, for the first time, accepted that we had done something in 1953 against Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mossa Desh.  So this Prime Minister that you are seeing was actually a puppet of USA. This happened inside Iran and it was declared on 19th August 2013. After so many years, for the first time the CIA has admitted it publicly.  So Mohammad Mosa De was a beloved figure in Iran.  So, the people of Iran knew him very well. During his tenure he introduced a range of social and economic policies, the most significant being the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry.  Now what actually happened?  Actually what happened was that Great Britain wanted to control Iran's oil facilities and when it was unable to control them properly, what it did was that it thought it best to place one of its puppets there. So here the CIA admitted for the first time that we had indirectly interfered in all the political moves of Iran.  Now actually in 2016 a deal was made with Iran that it will not build nuclear facilities and Barack Obama was in the leadership at that time, but still Iran secretly started developing nuclear facilities in basements, underground; you can see the weapons were designed in this way, and in that deal, which was made on January 16, 2016, it was said that what Iran will actually do is 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium.  It will send it out of the country, ship it, dismantle the sentry figure which triggers the nuclear weapons and remove it. This means that it will directly remove all the heavy water reactors etc. from there.   Will gradually destroy nuclear facilities. And a deal is struck.  A deal is made between USA and Iran that if we do not obey its instructions of the deal then sanctions will be imposed.  So what happened to highly enriched uranium?   Was blocked.  As well as the uranium that was being used on top of the facilities. Everything was blocked there.  But now Iran has understood that if we make a deal, then after making the deal we will be able to make bombs etc. there only to a limited extent. Only a few will be able to make bombs.  But what did Iran do without the deal?  Within a short time they started making bombs.  Ok? As you can see, they started making enriched uranium as well as centrifuges.  It was possible for Iran without a deal within two to three months and it could have moved ahead well because Iran wanted that it should be able to compete with other countries in the Middle East, but it was aware of the policies of USA that it will surely betray it.  So now the USA said that if they don't make a deal then there will be bombing.  This would be a bombardment like they had never seen before. So this is what USA said about Iran.  Now the thing is that USA keeps the entire world completely scripted.  Like Iran is to attack nuclear Iran because Iran is enriching its nuclear facilities.  It is increasing.  So he used Israel.  Right now he is using Pakistan.  He is using Ukraine against India. Over Russia.  So he has scripted everything. So if you guys agree with this, then please let me know.  And there has been a lot of damage inside Iran.  Now Iran has fired 100 missiles on Israel and Israel has also sent its fighter jets inside Iran.  So what actually happened?  The Resistance of Axis: Iran has placed its military components, what we can call Hezbollah, Houthi, Hamas, all around Israel.  Well, the country in the middle is stuck.  That is Iraq.  If you look at the map, Iraq is stuck between Israel and Iran.  Now Iraq went to the UN and said, why is Israel forcibly using our airspace when we have closed our airspace here?  We have refused it.  So he goes to the UN regarding this matter.  Where does one go with this?  He is going inside the UN. Now see, it will definitely have an impact on the world and the oil prices will go to very high levels due to this.  India can also face a lot of problems because the route for India to reach Europe can be quite long.  But anyway, that is a different matter.  But the root cause here right now is the nuclear deal between the US and Iran not being able to be signed.  And USA is saying that if the nuclear deal is signed then we will not launch any attack.  It is clearly evident that whatever is happening is happening at the behest of USA.  Today, if USA tells Israel to stop the attack, they will stop the attack.
