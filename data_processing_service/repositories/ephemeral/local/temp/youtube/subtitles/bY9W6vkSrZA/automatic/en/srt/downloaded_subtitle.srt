1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,480
Friends, a big plane accident has happened in India.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,760
A plane that takes

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,880
off at 1:38 and

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,200
crashes on the roof of a hostel at 1:40.  It does

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,400
n't take much time.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,840
Within two minutes, 241 people are killed.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,920
Whereas there were 242 people on board that plane.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,720
A person who is, survives.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,960
He is saved by his luck.  There have been many casualties.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
After all, why did this incident happen?

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
We will analyse it very carefully.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,559
How many people have been killed?   The

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
important thing is that what was the problem with this flight after all

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,399
?  There is a person named

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,879
Akash Vats, he had already warned Air India

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,440
that there were some problems inside the flight.

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,480
I have just

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,719
taken the flight.  You must make improvements in it.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,719
Do whatever improvement is possible.   There

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,640
is a problem inside this flight.  It feels like

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,640
I am sitting inside a taxi.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,080
Who said this?  This was said by the person

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,240
who was coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,040
and the same flight was now going from Ahmedabad to

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,159
London.  The person who was

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad told everything and

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,159
he also recorded a video and sent it which

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,840
I am going to tell you all.  In the end

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
I will tell you what

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,040

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,280
could be the possible reason, the maximum possible reason due to which this flight got

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
completely destroyed.  So many people

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,799
lost their lives in this.  Let us know in great detail.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,520
First of all you guys will see that this is

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,200
an animated video there.  In this you will

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
see that this is the airport whose name

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
Airport which is located in Ahmedabad.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,079
Whenever a flight flies, the

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,960
plane uses the entire runway while flying.

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
Actually this

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
airplane goes from here and after

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,320
taking a U-turn, to achieve its desired speed and

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
velocity, it comes and

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,759
stands over the runway, and

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,159
after coming and standing over the runway, it

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
takes a complete runway from here and then

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,360
takes off.  But just

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,640
two minutes after taking off, it

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,800
falls on top of a doctors' hostel.  Some

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
experts say that this runway has

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
not been fully utilized.

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Before that it took off and while flying

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
it could not attain the velocity it required

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
and then this plane accident happened.  The

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,200
total length of this runway is approximately 3.5 km.  Is.

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,520
3505 meters and this is what has fallen inside the residential area.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,920
You guys can see that the

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,560
debris is there, you will see it.  A lot of

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
smoke was flying from there.  The people from there

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,239
started running away again.

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,720
People started coming there to save many people.

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,040
Ok?  But this plane accident is

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
very sad.  Such a big

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,480
plane accident has never happened in India till date.

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
You guys see how the

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
plane has been completely destroyed.  Now, at the place where the

68
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
plane broke down, there was an emergency

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,120
door and a man, who was a British citizen, got out through that emergency door

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
and what he said was that

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,040
within just 30 seconds, I decided that

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,120
I have to get out of it.  That is,

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,280
when the plane was coming down,

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
this thought started going on in his mind that I have to

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,120
get out of this plane.  And as soon as that plane

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,200
comes and collides, that plane breaks in the middle.  There is an

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
emergency door there and

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,239
the person goes out from there.  Out

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,319
of 242 people, only one person managed to escape from there and

81
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,200
save his life.  Meaning one

82
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,680
person's life was saved.  There was also a girl

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
who was late for that flight.

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
And because of being late by just 10 minutes, the crew

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
members and all the immigration

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
staff present there did not allow her entry and she was

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
returning back to her home.  She

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,159
was inside the taxi and she comes to know that this

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,319
plane accident has happened and she says,

90
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,360
friend, it's okay, we survived but many other

91
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,439
people have lost their lives in this.  So it

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,599
is a matter of luck, here

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
we will say that the plane accident happened in this manner.

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,040

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
Some people were eating food at the hostel where I fell.   The

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,680
doctors were having their food and the

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,799
place was completely destroyed and five to six doctors

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
also got killed in it.  Now let me

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,720
tell you guys.  There is a person named Akash

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,919
Vats.  Akash Vats tweeted this message

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,840
and the timing of the tweet is

102
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,000

103
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,800
visible here as 12th June.  June 12th, 2025 around 4:20.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,680
Ok?  But it is written that I was

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,120
in the same damn flight.  I

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,080
was on the same flight.  This flight left Ahmedabad two hours before it took off.

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,800
I came in

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,800
this from Delhi to Ahmedabad.  He was

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad.  Notice

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
unusual things.  Meaning, he had noticed

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
that unusual things were

112
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,360
happening in this place.  Made a video.

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,120
Made another video and tweeted it

114
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
to Air India.  Now I am going to show you what that video was.

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
In the video you will see that he will explain

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
how he is feeling that there is a

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,280
taxi.  Look, in this video you will see

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,710

120
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,479
entertainment not working

121
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,639
[music]

122
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,479
meaning in this video, it is being told that

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
all the equipment is not working.  I am

124
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
trying a lot.   The

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
equipment is not working.  The aces are

126
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,280
not working.  Ok?  The AC is

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
not working.  You will watch the entire video.

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,280

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
Saying this, I feel as if

130
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
I am sitting inside a taxi.

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
I am not getting the feel of the plane or the airplane.  A

132
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,000
lot of people are

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,160
fanning themselves with their hands because the AC isn't working.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,080
See, none of the electrical

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
appliances are working.   The

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
display is not working and a

137
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
tweet regarding this video was made

138
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,080
by them at that time.

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,120
Dream Liner: This was Flight 78 of Boeing. The

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,400
length of the entire

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,720
plane was 56 meters. The

142
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
width of its wings was 60 meters. It had two engines

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
installed in it. Both the

144
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,039
turbo engines were working very well.

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,800
Its maximum speed was 954 km and it

146
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,440
attained a height of about 650 feet.

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,639
After gaining the height, it came back down at a very fast

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,960
speed, about 450 feet per hour.

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,400
Ok?

150
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,360
Its cost was around ₹5000 crores and it

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,360
was manufactured by Boeing company.  Ok?  Now let

152
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,919
us tell you, look,

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
you can see the fuel capacity in this is 12,6000

154
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,280
litres.  So you can assume that

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,759
if there was 12,6,000 litres of fuel inside it, then

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,880
it means that if you

157
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,759

158
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,400
assume the weight of one person to be 100 kg, then how many

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,560
people were inside it?  And

160
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,639
such a

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,440
huge fuel capacity was filled inside it to transport 242 people to their destination.

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,919
Vijay Runi was riding inside it.  He was

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,440
also going to London to meet his daughter.

164
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,280
But the thing is that he is no longer

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,960
in this world.  The question is

166
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,360
what could be the possible reasons that

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
it got completely destroyed within 30 seconds.

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
See what could be the first reason?

169
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
I will clarify each one and tell you

170
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,440
what the reasons could be.  The first thing is

171
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,240

172
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,639
why did the aircraft landing gear

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
not go back inside the plane?  This is one possible reason.

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,520
We will discuss what technical fault may arise from it.

175
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,240
Did the aircraft suffer a dual

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,280
engine failure?  How did both the engines

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,000
fail simultaneously?  Did the engines die because

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
of possible fuel, that is, the fuel actually

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
says that it got blocked.

180
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,039
Filters have not been cleaned.  At the

181
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,520
same time the flaps on the wings are lowered for

182
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,440
take off.  Meaning, the wings were

183
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,840
not working properly.  He was in his lower

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,919
position.  Could a bird means that even a

185
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,759
bird can hit it and the

186
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,360
engine will stop working.  We look at each one of them.

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
Look, first of all you guys

188
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
look at the plane.  Inside this plane, there is the

189
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,440
cockpit from where the entire control takes place.  You must have

190
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
heard the name of black box.

191
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,840
Even though the name of the black box is black,

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
its colour is orange, which is

193
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400
fitted at the back.  It also has two

194
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
parts.  We will cover separately

195
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,360
how it works.   The

196
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
main components in it are

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
its wings, inside which the fuel is

198
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
filled.  Now inside these wings of the fuel here, there are

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,360

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,800
different spans for providing different lift and drag.

201
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,599
Ok?  Also there are

202
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,039
jet engines inside it which generate

203
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,640
thrust.  The thing to understand here is

204
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,719
that at that time the plane was in the air

205
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,200
and its speed was gradually decreasing.   It was

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,959
coming downwards.  The pilots were saying

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,279
that mide mide means danger.  And at the

208
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,600
same time he said that he is loosening the thrust.

209
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
And where are you losing the thrust

210
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,800
from?  From the engine.  Because there are two turbo engines

211
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,959
fitted inside it and the rest you will

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,279
see is that the wings control it.

213
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,000
Flaps are there to

214
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,880
cut through the air and create the aerodynamic shape of the airplane.  By

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,519
cutting the air its lift should be

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,920
increased.  So actually that plane

217
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
gained some lift but it

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,640
came back towards downfall.

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Now you guys see why he came.  The first thing

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,399
we were talking about was the landing gear.  See, the

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,240
rising of the landing gears, that is, their

222
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
coming out and not going back in, does

223
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,640

224
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,120
not depend on thrust at all.  Meaning, even if the landing gear is

225
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,200
outside, there will

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
not be any significant impact on the thrust.  Yes,

227
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
it is possible that many mechanical

228
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
equipment may not work in it.

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,680
So the landing gear is

230
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,720
not connected to the thrust somewhere.  But as the

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,120
pilot said.  The second possible reason is that a

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
bird came and hit it.  But

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,839
if the bird had come and hit, it would have

234
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,680
hit an engine.  You

235
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,160
cannot do both of them together.  Whereas both the engines

236
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
went towards failure simultaneously.  So

237
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,200
here, if the bird hits, then because of the

238
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,440
hit of the bird, the fan

239
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,760
blades of the turbo break

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,560
and it is not able to generate the power that it should have.

241
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,040
So one

242
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,959
possible reason here is that Bird took the hit.

243
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,680
But here also there is a small loop hole

244
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,240
as to how both the engines got damaged simultaneously.  Now let

245
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,079
us move towards the next region.  See,

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
whenever a bird collides with the plane, the

247
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,120
plane gets damaged to such an extent.

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,120
Then the thing is that the

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,760
turbo engines on both sides failed simultaneously.

250
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
We come here folks.  To understand this

251
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
you will have to understand what is here.

252
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,560
Actually, the engine of a plane

253
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,360
works due to the fuel.  The fuel is

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,600
inside it.  Besides air, there is a

255
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,760
mix of both air and fuel in it.

256
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,800
If we assume that there is 4 litres of

257
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,440
air in it, then there is 1 litre of fuel in it.

258
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Ok?  First of all you people should understand that the

259
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,560
mixture of air and fuel

260
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
acts as fuel for the engine.

261
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,519
Like there is petrol in it, so

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,079
if you mix petrol and air

263
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,079
then it will work as fuel for the engine.

264
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:10,720
But the air should be properly mixed with

265
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,200
the fuel.  Now, if the air and

266
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,519
petrol are mixed properly,

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
in the ratio of one and four, only then

268
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,720
the engine will be able to get proper power.

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,120
But at this current time, the

270
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,000
air density has reduced to a great extent.

271
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,560
So the density of air decreased.  Due

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,800
to the decrease in air density, its particles and

273
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,440
molecules moved far away.  So

274
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
if those molecules go away then the

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
air is not getting mixed in the ratio in which it should have been mixed.

276
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959

277
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,600
It is decreasing because the

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,920
density has increased to a great extent.

279
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,279
So the air is not getting mixed in that ratio.

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
Whereas the fuel is

281
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,560
getting mixed.  If this proper ratio is not maintained

282
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
then the engine will

283
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,279
not get the proper fuel and if the fuel is not available

284
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,680
then the thrust of both the turbo engines will

285
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,320
not be developed.  Therefore, the

286
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,079
possible reason could be that the pilot

287
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,839
said during the last movement that we are

288
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
not able to generate proper thrust.

289
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,880
Power is not being generated in both the engines.

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,920
So this is the possible reason that the

291
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
mixer of air and fuel there was

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
not able to mix properly

293
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,639
because the density of air was very low.  This is the

294
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,639
most valid and proper reason and it is

295
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
visible in this.  Ok?  Which

296
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,519
we have just understood.  One reason is that the

297
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
lift power of the wings there was

298
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
not working properly.

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Now actually what happens is that if the

300
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
lift is not working then there is

301
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,880

302
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,440
not a tremendous downfall due to the thrust used in both the engines.  Is it okay

303
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
?  There isn't as much of a tremendous downfall and

304
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,720
at the same time it has an aerodynamic shape inside.

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Many times these wings etc.

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
depend on how strong the wind is blowing and

307
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
in which direction it is blowing.

308
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
But one possible reason being suggested is

309
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,639
that the fuel mix did

310
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,079
not reach the engine properly and what happened to it?

311
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,160
Thresh could not be found proper.  Ok?

312
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,240
Well now that investigation is ongoing.  Only after that we will be

313
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,639
able to know what the actual reason is.

314
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
But till now the possible reason is as per the people who

315
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,160
know about it,

316
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,600
they have just clarified it.  So the

317
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,079
point is that plane accidents also happened

318
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,160
because the engine was not checked properly.   There

319
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
was a technical fault.  Proper

320
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,920
maintenance was not done inside it.  If a

321
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,240
person is coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad,

322
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,920
he is also seeing the fault that the

323
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
electric equipment is

324
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,480
not working properly.  The displays are

325
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,800
completely hanging.  The AC is

326
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,639
not working and when this was

327
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
tweeted there was no reply.

328
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,680
So there must have been a technical fault somewhere.

329
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,360
So actually,

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,320
this accident has happened because the maintenance was not done properly.

331
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,160
What is your opinion,

332
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
please tell me in the comment section.

333
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,680
But today we have lost 241 people plus those who were

334
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,920
living inside the hostel.

335
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,720
So we

336
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,959
can never recover what we have.  Ok?

337
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
If you also think what is the possible reason

338
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
then please tell me in the comment section.

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,639
