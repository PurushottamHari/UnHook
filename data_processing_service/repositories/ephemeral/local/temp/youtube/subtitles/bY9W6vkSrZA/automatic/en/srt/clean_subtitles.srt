Friends, a big plane accident has happened in India. A plane that takes off at 1:38 and crashes on the roof of a hostel at 1:40.  It does n't take much time. Within two minutes, 241 people are killed. Whereas there were 242 people on board that plane. A person who is, survives. He is saved by his luck.  There have been many casualties. After all, why did this incident happen? We will analyse it very carefully. How many people have been killed?   The important thing is that what was the problem with this flight after all ?  There is a person named Akash Vats, he had already warned Air India that there were some problems inside the flight. I have just taken the flight.  You must make improvements in it. Do whatever improvement is possible.   There is a problem inside this flight.  It feels like I am sitting inside a taxi. Who said this?  This was said by the person who was coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad and the same flight was now going from Ahmedabad to London.  The person who was coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad told everything and he also recorded a video and sent it which I am going to tell you all.  In the end I will tell you what could be the possible reason, the maximum possible reason due to which this flight got completely destroyed.  So many people lost their lives in this.  Let us know in great detail. First of all you guys will see that this is an animated video there.  In this you will see that this is the airport whose name is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport which is located in Ahmedabad. Whenever a flight flies, the plane uses the entire runway while flying. Actually this airplane goes from here and after taking a U-turn, to achieve its desired speed and velocity, it comes and stands over the runway, and after coming and standing over the runway, it takes a complete runway from here and then takes off.  But just two minutes after taking off, it falls on top of a doctors' hostel.  Some experts say that this runway has not been fully utilized. Before that it took off and while flying it could not attain the velocity it required and then this plane accident happened.  The total length of this runway is approximately 3.5 km.  Is. 3505 meters and this is what has fallen inside the residential area. You guys can see that the debris is there, you will see it.  A lot of smoke was flying from there.  The people from there started running away again. People started coming there to save many people. Ok?  But this plane accident is very sad.  Such a big plane accident has never happened in India till date. You guys see how the plane has been completely destroyed.  Now, at the place where the plane broke down, there was an emergency door and a man, who was a British citizen, got out through that emergency door and what he said was that within just 30 seconds, I decided that I have to get out of it.  That is, when the plane was coming down, this thought started going on in his mind that I have to get out of this plane.  And as soon as that plane comes and collides, that plane breaks in the middle.  There is an emergency door there and the person goes out from there.  Out of 242 people, only one person managed to escape from there and save his life.  Meaning one person's life was saved.  There was also a girl who was late for that flight. And because of being late by just 10 minutes, the crew members and all the immigration staff present there did not allow her entry and she was returning back to her home.  She was inside the taxi and she comes to know that this plane accident has happened and she says, friend, it's okay, we survived but many other people have lost their lives in this.  So it is a matter of luck, here we will say that the plane accident happened in this manner. Some people were eating food at the hostel where I fell.   The doctors were having their food and the place was completely destroyed and five to six doctors also got killed in it.  Now let me tell you guys.  There is a person named Akash Vats.  Akash Vats tweeted this message and the timing of the tweet is visible here as 12th June.  June 12th, 2025 around 4:20. Ok?  But it is written that I was in the same damn flight.  I was on the same flight.  This flight left Ahmedabad two hours before it took off. I came in this from Delhi to Ahmedabad.  He was coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad.  Notice unusual things.  Meaning, he had noticed that unusual things were happening in this place.  Made a video. Made another video and tweeted it to Air India.  Now I am going to show you what that video was. In the video you will see that he will explain how he is feeling that there is a taxi.  Look, in this video you will see entertainment not working [music] meaning in this video, it is being told that all the equipment is not working.  I am trying a lot.   The equipment is not working.  The aces are not working.  Ok?  The AC is not working.  You will watch the entire video. Saying this, I feel as if I am sitting inside a taxi. I am not getting the feel of the plane or the airplane.  A lot of people are fanning themselves with their hands because the AC isn't working. See, none of the electrical appliances are working.   The display is not working and a tweet regarding this video was made by them at that time. Dream Liner: This was Flight 78 of Boeing. The length of the entire plane was 56 meters. The width of its wings was 60 meters. It had two engines installed in it. Both the turbo engines were working very well. Its maximum speed was 954 km and it attained a height of about 650 feet. After gaining the height, it came back down at a very fast speed, about 450 feet per hour. Ok? Its cost was around â‚¹5000 crores and it was manufactured by Boeing company.  Ok?  Now let us tell you, look, you can see the fuel capacity in this is 12,6000 litres.  So you can assume that if there was 12,6,000 litres of fuel inside it, then it means that if you assume the weight of one person to be 100 kg, then how many people were inside it?  And such a huge fuel capacity was filled inside it to transport 242 people to their destination. Vijay Runi was riding inside it.  He was also going to London to meet his daughter. But the thing is that he is no longer in this world.  The question is what could be the possible reasons that it got completely destroyed within 30 seconds. See what could be the first reason? I will clarify each one and tell you what the reasons could be.  The first thing is why did the aircraft landing gear not go back inside the plane?  This is one possible reason. We will discuss what technical fault may arise from it. Did the aircraft suffer a dual engine failure?  How did both the engines fail simultaneously?  Did the engines die because of possible fuel, that is, the fuel actually says that it got blocked. Filters have not been cleaned.  At the same time the flaps on the wings are lowered for take off.  Meaning, the wings were not working properly.  He was in his lower position.  Could a bird means that even a bird can hit it and the engine will stop working.  We look at each one of them. Look, first of all you guys look at the plane.  Inside this plane, there is the cockpit from where the entire control takes place.  You must have heard the name of black box. Even though the name of the black box is black, its colour is orange, which is fitted at the back.  It also has two parts.  We will cover separately how it works.   The main components in it are its wings, inside which the fuel is filled.  Now inside these wings of the fuel here, there are different spans for providing different lift and drag. Ok?  Also there are jet engines inside it which generate thrust.  The thing to understand here is that at that time the plane was in the air and its speed was gradually decreasing.   It was coming downwards.  The pilots were saying that mide mide means danger.  And at the same time he said that he is loosening the thrust. And where are you losing the thrust from?  From the engine.  Because there are two turbo engines fitted inside it and the rest you will see is that the wings control it. Flaps are there to cut through the air and create the aerodynamic shape of the airplane.  By cutting the air its lift should be increased.  So actually that plane gained some lift but it came back towards downfall. Now you guys see why he came.  The first thing we were talking about was the landing gear.  See, the rising of the landing gears, that is, their coming out and not going back in, does not depend on thrust at all.  Meaning, even if the landing gear is outside, there will not be any significant impact on the thrust.  Yes, it is possible that many mechanical equipment may not work in it. So the landing gear is not connected to the thrust somewhere.  But as the pilot said.  The second possible reason is that a bird came and hit it.  But if the bird had come and hit, it would have hit an engine.  You cannot do both of them together.  Whereas both the engines went towards failure simultaneously.  So here, if the bird hits, then because of the hit of the bird, the fan blades of the turbo break and it is not able to generate the power that it should have. So one possible reason here is that Bird took the hit. But here also there is a small loop hole as to how both the engines got damaged simultaneously.  Now let us move towards the next region.  See, whenever a bird collides with the plane, the plane gets damaged to such an extent. Then the thing is that the turbo engines on both sides failed simultaneously. We come here folks.  To understand this you will have to understand what is here. Actually, the engine of a plane works due to the fuel.  The fuel is inside it.  Besides air, there is a mix of both air and fuel in it. If we assume that there is 4 litres of air in it, then there is 1 litre of fuel in it. Ok?  First of all you people should understand that the mixture of air and fuel acts as fuel for the engine. Like there is petrol in it, so if you mix petrol and air then it will work as fuel for the engine. But the air should be properly mixed with the fuel.  Now, if the air and petrol are mixed properly, in the ratio of one and four, only then the engine will be able to get proper power. But at this current time, the air density has reduced to a great extent. So the density of air decreased.  Due to the decrease in air density, its particles and molecules moved far away.  So if those molecules go away then the air is not getting mixed in the ratio in which it should have been mixed. It is decreasing because the density has increased to a great extent. So the air is not getting mixed in that ratio. Whereas the fuel is getting mixed.  If this proper ratio is not maintained then the engine will not get the proper fuel and if the fuel is not available then the thrust of both the turbo engines will not be developed.  Therefore, the possible reason could be that the pilot said during the last movement that we are not able to generate proper thrust. Power is not being generated in both the engines. So this is the possible reason that the mixer of air and fuel there was not able to mix properly because the density of air was very low.  This is the most valid and proper reason and it is visible in this.  Ok?  Which we have just understood.  One reason is that the lift power of the wings there was not working properly. Now actually what happens is that if the lift is not working then there is not a tremendous downfall due to the thrust used in both the engines.  Is it okay ?  There isn't as much of a tremendous downfall and at the same time it has an aerodynamic shape inside. Many times these wings etc. depend on how strong the wind is blowing and in which direction it is blowing. But one possible reason being suggested is that the fuel mix did not reach the engine properly and what happened to it? Thresh could not be found proper.  Ok? Well now that investigation is ongoing.  Only after that we will be able to know what the actual reason is. But till now the possible reason is as per the people who know about it, they have just clarified it.  So the point is that plane accidents also happened because the engine was not checked properly.   There was a technical fault.  Proper maintenance was not done inside it.  If a person is coming from Delhi to Ahmedabad, he is also seeing the fault that the electric equipment is not working properly.  The displays are completely hanging.  The AC is not working and when this was tweeted there was no reply. So there must have been a technical fault somewhere. So actually, this accident has happened because the maintenance was not done properly. What is your opinion, please tell me in the comment section. But today we have lost 241 people plus those who were living inside the hostel. So we can never recover what we have.  Ok? If you also think what is the possible reason then please tell me in the comment section.
