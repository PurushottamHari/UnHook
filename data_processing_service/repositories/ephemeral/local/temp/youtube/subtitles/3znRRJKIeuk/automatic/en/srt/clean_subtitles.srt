Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, you will see a big development between Israel and Gaza. You all know that for the last few days there has been continuous discussion that Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza.  All the advertising material is not able to reach Gaza.  In view of this, an international initiative was taken under which Greta Thunberg was travelling towards Gaza in a boat and it is said here that the operation was conducted by Israel and the boat was intercepted and as soon as this happened, a video of Greta Thunberg came out in which she said that she was kidnapped.  You can see this news Greta Thunberg Claims She Has Been Kidnapped.  So let's understand this in a little bit of detail as to what is happening because here a complete mission is being run so that the ad can be delivered to Gaza.  So I will tell you about it in detail. Let's move on. But before that let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026, must avail our Pratigya Foundation Batch.  The link is given in the comment section and you have to use this code AnkitLive so that you can avail maximum discount. Let's get started.  First let us see what exactly happened. Look, today it is being said that the Israeli naval forces have seized a British- flagged aid vessel named MV Madeline.  You can see this here, we are talking about MV Madeline boat.   It is being said that there were many activists in this boat, total of around 12 people including Greta Thunberg and this particular boat was intercepted and seized by the Israeli naval forces.  And keep in mind that it is being said that the place where this was seized has not happened in territorial waters. You all must know where the territorial water of any country is located ?  Up to 12 nautical miles from its coast. Meaning, up to 12 nautical miles, it falls within the territorial waters.  Meaning it comes under that country.  But beyond that, we call it international water.  So it is being told that the Israeli Naval Forces seized this boat in international waters. You can see the Mediterranean Sea, this is its entire Eastern side, here this boat has been seized and this ship was part of the Freedom Flotilla. I will tell you further that this entire international campaign is being run so that the blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza can be broken.  So, under Freedom Fertila, this MV Madeline boat of yours was heading towards Gaza and you can see that there were about 12 activists on this boat, including Greta Thunberg, who is a Swedish climate activist.  Apart from this, there is a lot of discussion about French Member of European Parliament Reema Hassan. This was also on this board.  Apart from this, you will see many activists from Malaysia, Norway, Canada and UK.  Well, look at the background behind this, which I told you about the Freedom Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla is a coalition, a civil society led initiative, so that the blockade that has been put here by Israel, basically if you look at Gaza, it has been many years in fact, for the last few months, it has been a continuous state of war since October 7, 2023.  So here now in recent times it is being said that a kind of blockade has been imposed on a large scale.  This means that no advertising material etc. is able to enter Gaza.   It is available in very limited quantity. Because of which the people living here in Gaza Strip are very troubled. A lot of children are dying here. You will get to see mail nourishment.  So this is being challenged in a way under this particular campaign and it is a kind of effort that if Israel is not allowing humanitarian aid through land, then it should be brought here from here through the sea.  Apart from this, global awareness should be raised about the humanitarian catastrophe taking place in the Gaza Strip. Now look, this boat, which I told you about, in which Greta Thunberg was coming, basically started its journey on 1st June from Italy and it is being said that there were medical kits, baby formula, prosthetics, diapers, floors, water filters – there were a lot of things. Yes, it was not in large quantity but it was a kind of symbolic gesture that we are taking aid here and Israel is trying to stop it. In fact, if you see, a few days ago I also made a video where it was said on behalf of the United Nations that if aid is not allowed, then 14,000 children may die in Israel in the next 48 hours.  So you will get to see such news continuously. Well, looking at all these things, it became known earlier that Greta Thunberg was going towards the Gaza Strip. So what was Israel's response here ?  You can see from the Israeli side that their navy has intercepted the ship here in the international waters itself and it is said that the ship was told and instructed to raise its hands and wear a life jacket and the ship was basically taken towards the Ashdod port in Southern Israel, if you see, this was the Gaza Strip here in Israel and this interception was basically done in international waters, close to the Gaza Strip.  It is being told.  Meaning beyond 12 nautical miles.  But again it is in international waters.  So all the people who were on this ship and the ship itself, you can see, is located at Asdod Port, which is very close to the Gaza Strip. It was taken here. Well, what do the Israeli officials say?  Israel's Defense Minister has said that the flotilla is a kind of propaganda stunt.  Meaning, propaganda is being done in the name of giving ads to Hamas. Not a humanitarian mission.  The Defense Minister says that we will show all the detainees the footage of the attack that was carried out by Hamas on 7th October. That means, all the people including Greta Thunberg, who are activists, 12 people have been arrested.  We will show them some kind of footage to show how much atrocities were committed by Hamas.   On the Seventh of October 2023, we will give a message that whatever Israel is doing here with Gaza is right somewhere.  So in a way it has also been said here that we will deliver the ads etc. from Israel through the crossing.   That means, if you see that there are many crossings here, Israel says that you have brought ads, whatever ad material you need, we ourselves will provide it inside Gaza through the crossing, that is, through the land border, and along with this, all the activists are safe.  That means, a video of Greta Thunberg comes out shortly after her arrest and in that video she says that we have been arrested, we have been kidnapped, in fact.  But Israel has given clarification here that he has been kept in custody.  We are keeping them properly. Whatever food and water is to be provided, we will deport them after some time. What is a good legal and diplomatic concern?  Because remember what I told you, that boat was seized from international waters.  And because of this, legal and ethical concerns arise. Because the law is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This basically says that if any humanitarian mission is in international waters and there is no threat from it, meaning either there is any threat to you from it or a blockade has been formally declared, whatever has happened, then you can seize it, but if that boat is not posing any threat to you in international waters, then you cannot seize it, so Israel says that there is a blockade somewhere, in a way, the blockade that has been imposed on Gaza, Israel says that it is legal, based on military necessity.  We have imposed this blockade on Gaza keeping our security in mind. But the opponents believe that this is a collective punishment.  Suppose if Hamas has made the mistake, then you are torturing all the humans, that is, the people living inside Gaza, which should not happen.  And that is why if you see, many reactions are coming globally also.  There are many ships in the flotilla and many other activists here, they say that this raid carried out by Israel is nothing less than kidnapping in international waters.  He says that the ship was not posing any threat to Israel.  And it was clearly meant for just ad.  Meaning, we were going to deliver aid to the people of Gaza.  We were not a threat to Israel.  And here the European port authorities had given multiple clearances.  Only then did we come here. So, in a way, we are being caught. Meaning, in a way, he is being kidnapped. And in view of this, there has been a reaction from Hamas as well.  Hamas has said that it is nothing but state terrorism and piracy.  Hamas says it has appealed to the international community to take action against Israel's aggressive naval policies. You can also see from the United Nations side, here is the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Palestine.  He has kind of defended the flotilla and said we should allow humanitarian access to Gaza. And the blockade imposed by Israel, it is illegal and inhuman.  And there are protests globally as well. If you look at protests in many cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Toronto, Paris, London, the protesters are demanding that the detainees be released, the blockade be lifted and access inside Gaza be allowed. Well note that Greta Thunberg was also used here.  Maybe look, Greta Thunberg is a climate activist. But he has raised his voice many times regarding all the issues that are happening globally. Be it global justice, colonialism or human rights.  Recently he also participated in COP 28 and European Parliament.  And here he also talked about everything from climate crisis to war and displacement inside Gaza. So, in a way, by taking them on board, this symbolic gesture is being given in a way to grab the attention of the international community that look, Israel is doing wrong in Gaza.  Now in the end the question that comes is what next?  Look, from here it is possible that all the activists who have been detained by Israel will be deported within 72 hours. But the blockade imposed by Israel will continue. Besides this, the Freedom Flotilla, which is a campaign being run to deliver aid, may send further boats towards Gaza and maybe Israel may seize those boats as well and bring them back. The UN rights groups at the port may push the investigation into the emergency aid corridor to allow this to be allowed.  Greta Thunberg may be able to push it further. He may come back when he is released.  It depends, let's see what happens next regarding this.
