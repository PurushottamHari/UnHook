00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
you will see a big development between Israel and Gaza.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,639
You all know

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
that for the last few days there has been continuous discussion

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,600
that Israel has imposed a blockade on

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,680
Gaza.  All the advertising material is

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
not able to reach Gaza.  In view of this, an

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,359
international initiative was taken under which

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,920
Greta Thunberg was

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,079
travelling towards Gaza in a boat and it is

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
said here that the operation was conducted by Israel

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,719
and the boat was intercepted

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,960
and as soon as this happened,

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
a video of Greta Thunberg came

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
out in which she said that she was

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
kidnapped.  You can see this news

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
Greta Thunberg Claims She Has Been

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
Kidnapped.  So let's understand this in a little bit of detail as

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
to what is happening

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
because here a complete mission is being run

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
so that the ad

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
can be delivered to Gaza.  So I will tell you about it in detail.

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's move on.

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,399
But before that let me tell you all that

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026,

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's get started.  First let us

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
see what exactly happened.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,360
Look, today it is being said that the Israeli

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,320
naval forces have seized a British-

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,799
flagged aid vessel named MV

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,640
Madeline.  You can see this here,

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
we are talking about MV Madeline boat.   It is being

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,520
said that there were many activists in this boat, total of around 12 people

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,320
including Greta

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,479
Thunberg and this particular boat was intercepted

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
and seized

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,520
by the Israeli naval forces.  And keep in mind that it is being said

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
that the place where

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,240
this was seized has not happened in territorial waters.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
You all must know where the territorial water of any country is located

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,840

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,799
?  Up to 12 nautical miles from its coast.

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,720
Meaning, up to 12 nautical miles, it

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
falls within the territorial waters.  Meaning it

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,280
comes under that country.  But

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
beyond that, we call it international

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
water.  So it is being told that the

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,720
Israeli Naval Forces

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,640
seized this boat in international waters.

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
You can see the Mediterranean Sea, this is its

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,760
entire Eastern side, here this boat has been

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
seized and this ship was

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,040
part of the Freedom Flotilla. I will tell you further

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
that this entire international campaign is being

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
run so that the

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,239
blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,000
can be broken.  So, under Freedom Fertila,

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,160
this MV Madeline boat of yours was

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
heading towards Gaza and you can see that there

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
were about 12 activists on this boat,

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,319
including Greta Thunberg, who is a Swedish

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,879
climate activist.  Apart from this, there is a

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,120

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,040
lot of discussion about French Member of European Parliament Reema Hassan.

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
This was also on this board.  Apart from this,

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,760

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
you will see many activists from Malaysia, Norway, Canada and UK.  Well,

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
look at the background behind this, which

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,840
I told you about the Freedom Flotilla,

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,720
Freedom Flotilla is a coalition, a

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,879
civil society led initiative, so that the

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,200
blockade that has been put here by Israel,

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,840
basically if you look at Gaza, it has been

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,400
many years in fact, for the last few months, it has been a

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
continuous state of war since October 7, 2023.  So here

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
now in recent times it is being said that

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,040
a kind of blockade has been imposed on a large scale.  This

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
means that no advertising material

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
etc. is able to enter Gaza.   It is

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,720
available in very limited quantity.

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
Because of which the people living here

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,280
in Gaza Strip are very troubled.

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
A lot of children are dying here.

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,760
You will get to see mail nourishment.  So

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,879
this is being challenged in a way

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,200
under this particular campaign and it is a

94
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
kind of effort that

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
if Israel is not allowing humanitarian aid through land,

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,560
then it should be brought here from here through the sea.  Apart from

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,640
this,

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,200

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,280
global awareness should be raised about the humanitarian catastrophe taking place in the Gaza Strip.

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,360
Now look, this boat, which I

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
told you about, in which Greta

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
Thunberg was coming, basically

103
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,400
started its journey on 1st June from Italy

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
and it is being said that there were medical

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,159
kits, baby formula, prosthetics, diapers,

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
floors, water filters – there were

107
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
a lot of things. Yes, it was

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,720
not in large quantity but it was a kind of symbolic

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
gesture that we are taking aid here and

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,160
Israel is trying to stop it. In

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
fact, if you see, a few days

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
ago I also made a video where it was

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,199
said on behalf of the United Nations that if

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
aid is not allowed, then

115
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,759
14,000 children may die in Israel

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
in the next 48 hours.  So

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
you will get to see such news continuously.

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
Well, looking at all these things,

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,759
it became known earlier that Greta

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
Thunberg was going towards the Gaza Strip.

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
So what was Israel's response here

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,479
?  You can see from the Israeli side that

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,280
their navy has intercepted the

124
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,240
ship here in the international waters itself and it is

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,040
said

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,840
that the ship was told and instructed to

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,720
raise its hands and

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,520
wear a life jacket and the

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
ship was basically taken towards the Ashdod port

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
in Southern Israel, if you see,

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
this was the Gaza Strip here in Israel and

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
this interception was

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,720
basically done in international waters, close to the Gaza Strip.  It is being

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
told.  Meaning

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
beyond 12 nautical miles.  But again it

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,320
is in international waters.  So all the people who were on this ship

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
and the ship itself,

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,479
you can see, is located at Asdod Port, which is very close to the Gaza Strip.

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
It was taken here.

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,280
Well, what do the Israeli officials

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
say?  Israel's Defense Minister has

142
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
said that the flotilla is

143
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,479
a kind of propaganda stunt.  Meaning,

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
propaganda is being done in the name of giving ads to Hamas.

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,639
Not a humanitarian

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,759
mission.  The Defense Minister says

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,560
that we will show all the detainees the footage of the

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
attack that was carried out by Hamas on 7th October.

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,960
That means, all the

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
people including Greta Thunberg, who are activists, 12

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
people have been arrested.  We will show them some kind of

152
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,800
footage to show how much

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,240
atrocities were committed by Hamas.   On the

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,880
Seventh of October 2023, we will

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,680
give a message that whatever Israel is

156
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,080
doing here with Gaza is

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,639
right somewhere.  So in a way it has also been

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,520
said here that we will deliver the ads etc. from Israel

159
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,440
through the crossing.   That

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,759
means, if you see that there are many

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,000
crossings here, Israel says

162
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
that you have brought ads, whatever ad

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800
material you need, we ourselves will provide it

164
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,880
inside Gaza through the crossing, that is, through the land border,

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,039
and along with this, all the

166
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
activists are safe.  That means, a

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
video of Greta Thunberg comes out

168
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,280
shortly after her arrest

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
and in that video she says that

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,199
we have been arrested, we have been kidnapped, in

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,039
fact.  But Israel has

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,080
given clarification here that he has been

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,240
kept in custody.  We are keeping them properly.

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
Whatever food and water is to be provided,

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,720
we will deport them after some time.

176
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,080

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
What is a good legal and diplomatic concern?  Because remember

178
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,120
what I told you, that boat was

179
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,120
seized from international waters.  And because of this,

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,599
legal and ethical concerns arise.

181
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Because the law is the United Nations Convention

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,639
on the Law of the Sea.  This basically says that

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,080
if any humanitarian mission is

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,560
in international waters and there is no threat from it,

185
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,599
meaning either there is any threat to you from it

186
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,880
or a blockade has been formally declared,

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,120
whatever has happened, then you can seize it,

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
but if that boat is not posing any threat to you in international waters, then

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
you cannot seize it,

190
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,400
so Israel says that there is a

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,720
blockade somewhere, in a way, the

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,800
blockade that has been imposed on Gaza, Israel

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
says that it is legal, based on

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,000
military necessity.  We have

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
imposed this blockade on Gaza keeping our security in mind.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,919
But the opponents believe that this is a

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
collective punishment.  Suppose

198
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,880
if Hamas has made the mistake, then you are torturing all the

199
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
humans, that is, the

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,800
people living inside Gaza,

201
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
which should not happen.  And that is why

202
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,639
if you see, many reactions are coming globally also.  There are many

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720

204
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560

205
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,960
ships in the flotilla and many other activists here,

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,440
they say that this raid carried out

207
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,840
by Israel is nothing less than

208
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,400
kidnapping in international waters.  He says

209
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,039
that the ship was not posing any threat

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,240
to Israel.  And it was clearly

211
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,560
meant for just ad.  Meaning, we were

212
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,879
going to deliver aid to the people of Gaza.  We were

213
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
not a threat to Israel.  And here the European

214
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,199
port authorities had

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
given multiple clearances.  Only then did we come here.

216
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,000
So, in a way, we are being caught.

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
Meaning, in a way, he is being kidnapped.

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,479
And in view of this, there has been a

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,959
reaction from Hamas as well.  Hamas has said

220
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
that it is nothing but state terrorism and

221
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,839
piracy.  Hamas says it has appealed

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
to the international community to take action against Israel's

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
aggressive naval policies.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,399

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
You can also see from the United Nations side, here is the UN

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,279
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
Palestine.  He has

228
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,320
kind of defended the flotilla and said

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,080
we should allow humanitarian access to Gaza.

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
And the

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,320
blockade imposed by Israel, it is illegal and

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,560
inhuman.  And there are protests globally as well. If you

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,800
look at protests in many cities like Brisbane, Sydney,

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,720
Toronto, Paris, London, the

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
protesters are demanding that the

236
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
detainees be released, the

237
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,040
blockade be lifted and access inside Gaza be allowed.

238
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,200
Well note that

239
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,200
Greta Thunberg was also

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
used here.  Maybe look,

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Greta Thunberg is a climate activist.

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,440
But he has

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,920
raised his voice many times regarding all the issues that are happening globally.

244
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,080
Be it global justice, colonialism or

245
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
human rights.  Recently he

246
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399

247
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,279
also participated in COP 28 and European Parliament.  And here he also talked about everything

248
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,519
from climate crisis to war and displacement

249
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,760
inside Gaza.

250
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
So, in a way, by taking them on board,

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
this symbolic gesture is being given in a way to

252
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720

253
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,040
grab the attention of the international community that look,

254
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Israel is doing wrong in

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,920
Gaza.  Now in the end the question that

256
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
comes is what next?  Look, from here it is

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,480
possible that all the activists who have been

258
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
detained by Israel will be

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
deported within 72 hours.

260
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
But the blockade imposed by Israel will continue.

261
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,200

262
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,760
Besides this, the Freedom Flotilla, which is a campaign being

263
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,079
run to deliver aid,

264
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,399
may send further boats

265
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
towards Gaza and maybe Israel may

266
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,360
seize those boats as well and bring them back. The

267
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,320
UN rights groups at the port

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,320
may push the investigation into the emergency aid corridor to allow

269
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,640
this to be

270
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
allowed.  Greta Thunberg

271
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,560
may be able to push it further.

272
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,320
He may come back when he is released.  It

273
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
depends, let's see

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,240
what happens next regarding this.  But since morning this

275
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
news was coming about Greta Thunberg, I

276
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
hope you have understood it well

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,000
and before leaving, an interesting

278
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,880
question is in which year did the United Nations Convention on the

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,720
Law of the Sea come into force, in

280
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
which year was it implemented,

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
