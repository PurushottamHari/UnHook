Now I now Tell me if I tell you this thing then no one will He will accept this thing. That's crazy bro. Isn't it? What a crazy thing is this. Yes. then and and and What is the matter? This is the only thing I remember But all this happened in it after that, friend, remember Let me do all this. when you grow up then running around with friends from school You might have started here. yes then when I When I grew up a bit, I felt that now my friend I need to upgrade. do not run tires I have it. Now I have to ride a scooter. I want a machine with tyres You have a scooter. Yes. then after that I did not want to do it according to my own will Get out of. Ok. now in the street Let go.

What impact will it have now? to be as dirty as was it became. He saw me driving a tyre happened. What could be worse than this? Tires Taking out photo. He saw it. Yes. then after that again friend friend made it because the schools in Delhi mean we We were in Faridabad, ok, one turn for us Once in my total life I closed the school I went to visit Delhi and this didn't happen to me I went to the dazzling wow big city these people are here what do you do but I was thinking this After school life is also big in Delhi You must be entertaining brother, doing many things to go here and there on scooters To make friends he goes to school itself We did that in school itself, that means me There used to be cousins ​​etc. so what next? this was my next step my friend that my family members told me that even my cousin Only he can maintain friendship. So that means I didn’t say it But that was it for them that I didn’t care much about. I let him meet me. My dad is what I'm telling you When I used to scold him, he used to say that in the street don't hang out with the boy its his boy Don't hang out together. This is him spoiled It is spoiled. my tire doesn't work at least. Look at me I'm driving a tyre I. They say this about me. You say that in your homes, friend Look, his son drives tyres, friend.

So with all my might I am going to give up on these cousins I used to hang out with. anymore or max mohit with mohit who makes videos with me If I hang out with her, what have we done? We used to do this, finish our work at 7-8 pm There used to be school etc. I also took tuition After completing my studies, we used to go to Rohini New momos were there to drive around And there was a huge crowd for momos beautiful there lovely Girls used to come. We also used to go dressed up And we also used to style it. That too us I used to watch. We used to watch them too. it goes on It was there at that time. Every day from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm Yes from 6:00 to 8:00. After Tuition There used to be a set time after tuition yes this time we will go to kill the dog When the momo vendor has new momos What a madness it was Momo Bhai I came for the first time When I ate the bar I wondered what I had eaten Before I hit a six for the first time I said this So very g yes I said g feed me that it is better yes after that brother then I put the tyre Extracted nickel Then I went out on my tyre I told this to my home, brother respect brother, this Respect to reveal yes then After that now slowly try again If you ever feed me then it will be fun I have eaten a lot and the way I felt at that time I heard there was a soda in Rohini too for ₹5 I used to get soda of Rs. 1000, tried every flavour yes it is the one which looks like a machine press the machine They used to give this much glass, yes, the one for ₹5 We took out that soda which cost ₹5 and bought it in that. that fruit beer fruit beer and I'm thinking I was drinking alcohol and eating crackers I used to imagine that I was a drunkard Papa, today I have become like you. Brother Brother, you came out from very dark corners yes. oh this is right this one used to be a machine like this and There were 12-13 flavours in it. yes this crepe Lemon used to be this. All this used to happen. ₹5 All we got was a small glass. ₹10 big Glass. This shop was in Rohini and here So my decision was that I should drink a soda every day. Me today. This would have become an overall Post Tuition in Culture 10th 11th 12th Now we will all have fun by going and fighting we will hang out with each other and then those talks will become big It gets crooked brother at that time, I mean then I don't know when a man grows up Those things just stay like that and are remembered not even then that once upon a time at last I don't know if he might have visited this place last time It must be that today is the last one. I am actually that I am able to visualize that shop because There was a shop behind the market where I used to get this where I would say, yes friend Sisterfucker, I forgot that I ever did this This happened and that would have happened too, friend They used to play a game with coins, these ones, Total fun in which different takes are included There used to be no one there, there was no taker Street Fighter Namco and that Contra contra and that one mustafa mustafa means That character's name was Cady the Dinosaur It was a game of us, that meant she told a lot of people He is known only by the name of Mustafa. So this is as much as People of Pitampura are also watching, they should know Which game am I talking about? Do you remember the one in which you inserted that cassette used to play video games in which olympics There used to be a There was a circus guy who jumped up and there was a guy in it There was also a game after doing adventure. Mario Just as it was. There was one on the island, Guy. No one remembers me like this No. That was the time of video gaming. Yes. What fun it is if space doesn't work then blow it with spit He would hit me and then apply the same. This used to happen a lot. And when the lights went out, that was it. Now nothing happens Can. Now you have to wait for another while It will have to be No game was saved. Yes. This one, yes. It contains 256 games, 112 games Talk to him 80,000 games in one go and repeat all It used to happen. Yes, the first two were correct. Because of that it was repeated more. My I have a friend, he is wearing this one. The machine that you insert a coin into He has put all the money in his house. My There is also a console nearby. He walks here. These All games are played. PS PS3's. Yes. That PS3 Even games have been played inside it. already It is loaded. Proper, that one with the joystick.

I told the boys to do something do it. Watch what's best with Harsh Beniwal What is the search term? You know what comes? Girlfriend not girlfriend also comes. I have asked that. Yes. Height. height yes yes I told you about the height Have you ever been in the market? How much are you selling? Tall is that an issue? Overall? no to me I have an issue brother, it has happened so much. Issue? Yes. in school time yes that means I think the people who say this right now Speak less. Listening too much at school I took it. that they used to bully at school You must be on this matter. If we are bullied then we will bully too Were. On top of that, people from the neighborhood bully me. Were. Even relatives used to bully me. Bully too Did he do that? Oh, let it stay just like that Is it all gone? So I have heard this much No. Now I feel like laughing and I Looks like you'd better bring the roast. I Then I do it myself too. Yes. so that Now that it's mine, it's gone Wala K. I felt bad about the height. But you are a very good looking guy overall. Meaning Someone is fine. At first I used to be very upset about the height It was like, friend, he is short in height, he is short in height. But After that, I realised that now It is not in my hand, look. I I hang as much as I can, I swing as much as I can I did a lot, I did a lot of running. he go he This is what I have got after doing everything. don't think about it I would have done it. If I didn't do it, I would have got the table placed below, friend. So then I feel that now I have to It doesn't matter now. yes friend, i mean How much is buried in the mind of a man Insecurity sometimes continues for a long time. Isn't it? Yes, there is no use, my friend. And if you are on camera, do the whole acting you are doing promotion, then this The camera itself is such an insecurity shows himself that he You have to remove the ghost from your mind. YouTube comments show everything Insecurity brother. Hmm. when to abuse come to YouTube or Twitter, then everyone It opens up in my mind at that time. To you He has to leave it. so listen so much Lee na, now I feel that no, this is I am talking about very basic things. Then What is the height? height yaar meri aar around 5 4 It became 55. It is 55. Yes, it seems to be 55 only. Yes It will be 55. Yes that is correct. yes and what? Yes I don't even measure. It should be visible and should not appear small. so therefore I think that leave it with time I didn't say anything the last time, Measurement. Now when I get it, right Someone's brother, you are very young, my friend. I I said, yes you are down to earth. all these things Let's go. All these things happen. take let's go. Let's go. actually this is a good Question. I want to ask you here Because I have heard this too. Ok? Acting is not my profession. i meet a Lots of actors, I meet lots of you. And I have heard this thing some time or the other. And I feel like this from my Experience I host a podcast. A Harsh Beniwal is going to get me so Many more viewers. so many more brands work. so much more relevance than somebody who is Purely an actor. And no shade. I am their Nobody wants to do evil. I think Acting is an art. and in doing that too which requires holes to be made inside the brain This is not a joke. but have you found that in There is such an elitism in circuits that Hey you are the YouTube guy and I am the acting guy are going to. Is this real? yes definitely remains. So it will get better in two-three years. These people will go. Brother, look at this now I am improving. I mean the thing with me is that I if someone does this to me that you just If he is a youtuber then I will work with him does not. This has happened so many times that Bollywood collabs have come and they have said that you come and do it. I'll give you an hour And you do that. I said ok money. We ask why are actors paying money No? I said actor roti in my house He will give me a little. Yes, that is correct. I have the money Needed Yes. So if he had refused there now ok brother don't do it. and frankly me I don't think any actor thinks like this. no yes the teams that are in between them Brother, the kettle is hotter than the tea. The kettle is hot. He is nobody, nothing to them It wouldn't have happened that now my brother I had seen so many Even when I met the actor, he used to say hey brother what a great script you wrote Of. Oh man, yes, he knows it too He is an artist but these people around him It happens that their father would feel bad Baba will not give more than an hour brother Baba, at least ask Baba once more Baba After coming, I had to sit for two hours We drink tea and talk about the world they do it too they even give their phone numbers but The team members around who carry all the paraphernalia Isn't it brother, all the collaborations with me I did it, I took everyone's money, brother If you also see me on Instagram Although there is very little movie promotion I took money from everyone who has an actor in them it is there and I don't know what the problem is There is one thing that even the people around are not in the actor Like any other fellow creator, he is an actor They get it and happily run away and make it there are videos, it is not there, its use No, that too on its own in a short time will level out because look man The only difference is that Harsh did not I started acting from Delhi. He has also done scripting in his YouTube channel did the direction as well as set the slides He did everything with his team and Then he became so famous that now he is doing acting doing. The second way is to go to Bombay Go take acting classes, then you Give auditions around the world and meet them See who is auditioning from around the world. My first experience of Bombay when I I started podcasting, I was a friend of mine Was staying at the house of. hmm a mail from that friend An actor friend had come. Ok, good. Yes, he had come like this and was sitting there. of the day It is something, he is doing some preparation etc. Will be. We are brothers, I swear on that guy's mother I saw only sadness in his eyes. we are six five It has been going on for a year. and I will tell its story I have been. You can even slightly lose signal Put it. Your home, family, friends, Meet me somewhere among friends of friends The man who had been to Bombay sometime or the other will go To become an actor. Brother, very well decided topic of. means this thing has started because That's my character in Lafange, hum. Beans That's it. that he went to Bombay? that he should become He is an actor. He wants to be a superstar and he He goes to Bombay and is struggling And those seven-eight people were staying in one room. Are. Seven to eight people are staying in one room Are. Everyone wants to become an actor. she is complete He is the one who is living the struggle. The actor who is a They belong to the actor. You should think so much Aaramnagar who resides in or near the residential area I shot with so much struggle brother. I I looked and I actually found out People live here. even anud which is mine with this inside the show there is anud he I told him that brother, me and Gagan, in fact Gagan He is saying that he has done his journey like this START. Think about it brother and some of that too Brother, we can achieve a breakthrough. and then in that We can achieve some more breakthrough through this. There is a reason Shahrukh Khan is Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan is Aamir Khan. Salman Khan Is Salman. There's a thousand feet of dirt beneath it. a thousand feet and all these people below it Those who are trying brother. Because it's me I will remove him from acting. from me The person I am getting married to is a painter. This is his painting. I always give them this I am saying that your game is an art one. This is a game of gate keeping. I just I Art, that's what I'm talking about. I of the painting I am not talking about acting. if a gallery The one says I bet on the cloud If I want you to go ahead. Your Art To find out whether someone is better or worse than you There isn't any way to do it either. any objective There is no way. Still in acting. I am not saying this. But to a large extent it is a The man has to be selected out of 1000. His I don't know if that will work as well. it's a very Probabilistic game. like UPSC Preparations are made. preparing for IIT Is. If it doesn't happen then people get carried away. So if a man makes his own way Why is he weak? I am asking this Am. Not at all. Yes. I am asking I am on behalf of Apuva, ​​Poorav, Harsh, Ashish, Bhuvan and whoever else went into acting, what about these Is there anything missing brother? Harsh, Gujral, Anubhav Bassi in What do people lack in these? He himself Made a way for. Dude I feel like that that I too have made a mistake It seems to me that whoever comes whoever is the creator, if he comes very let them settle for very less we you them a Give him some screen time You will be happy that I too had become my even he felt yes a lot yes so friend he Now I guess the desperation that happens Bhuvan hit the desperation mark very well What offers might not have come to Bhuvan or Bhuvan Why wouldn't you have come and become my friend Bhuvan had brains, Bhuvan knew about it Age in Hero Ka Dost Hero Ka Dost Wale role yes okay he knew what the vision was He knew what he would do next, so he I guessed that everyone should learn this thing from Bhuvan We need these things from our creators They settle down very quickly so if you If you stop settling then you will get such roles I will not be seen, you tell me I am not doing it I can increase your appetite, yes you tell me I am not doing this, you tell me that Give me something equal to you, you say as if I have no Am I done with four characters? give me a character so I don't want to become that friend if I come just for 5 minutes You will do that, we all will do that together, then You will be left with no option. To you Viewership then you need their viewership Needed You need their promotion. Free Key You need marketing. But you give it to them Do you want a 5 minute role? So there you I understand a little bit what you are saying and Frankly I have never met Bhuvan. I have only heard Bhuvan's words. End I have heard this. but in goa fest When we met there. Yes, I got it. I met him then for 5-7 minutes. me too then That was the first time we met you. Maybe it's in the gym. you were at the gym Then. I was in the gym at that time. yes when we I met him but I have met Rohit a lot and Bhai means Bhuvan's strength is very big Reason Rohit and his level headedness is you Will you meet Rohit too? Yes, I am a very top man yes friend for me my career journey in life Rohit bhai, do I ever have any problem with you? And they always have time and such a level Heads give advice, not to me I think I don't know Rohit Bhai needs publicity or not but i want to let the World No Bhuvan is a talent like no other Rohit is a businessman support like no other Ya bro hats off bhai Rohit bhai thank you so much for what you are true yes absolutely and Has this ever happened to you because these questions So anyway people ask The Khan that Was there ever any competition amongst you people? There has never been a time between Ashish bhai and Bhuvan mam There was competition my friend, competition means nothing Don't we have anyone like that What should I say friend, there is never such competition Because I have seen them brother already No, I consider him greater than me. I talk to Bhuvan like a brother. I would have done it with Ashish By doing this, I started Bhuvan from myself Since then he has given a status to friend and you I never had any competition with my elder brother It didn't happen because A I don't know content, we both are very different 's blessing and I still used to be the same There was no competition even with the content Because competition is where I may be equal to you but I am much better than Ashish I am up let's Go finish this matter brother, this is the punch line, I wait kar tha ashish i have no opinion on you Brother like I love you bro I have no one but Harsh said I laughed Let's go bro yes this is what I came to hear I am yes and then tell me that it is only that friend who has no There is no competition, but it does mean No, I am not genuine to me I don't feel any competition and all this Our field means we know each other a lot Our WhatsApp group is all four of mine Carry Bhuvan Ashish we talk to each other Are. I have never felt any competition till today. I have some great work to do. tweeting this Are. Let's post this. Does someone come to them? I post it. I tweet. And sometimes it becomes difficult to do it without even saying anything We give it. Sometimes like I am very special There is work. They don't know, they don't even know Has arrived. Like I made Checkmate. So I said brother I want this thing Go ahead. without a word. I just shared In Diya group. He put it in. So I think that that thing is not very People also make excuses that they don't have a friend I am putting it. I ignore it because I They know I won't ask again. For that thing. daala bhuvan ashi all this Dude, very ahead in liking and supporting Are. So how can I compete with all this? the right thing is not the right thing I understood and this This solidarity generally involves comedians and rappers. I have seen it in everything. a four walled his brother also works with him do. Yash will also work with him. this which Our independent industry has emerged Generally, this solidarity is enough in this, isn't it? It is right to help each other of. And if this person is good then he will move ahead It will remain relevant till then. We there are many people who are not good He is not visible. Now what is the name like I will google it. You can Google it. No, you just tell me, we will do the BP. to me I don't know, I have no idea Who could those people be? There is a lot. I am sure. I am sure.

Current This is what I learned from Vali Giving mental peace to your partner is a lot It is important. yes any like you can If you are in a relationship, you can make the other person How much mental peace are you giving me. So it is very It is important. give a lot of peace It is important. So this is what I learned How do you present your partner to the person in front of you? When they come back tired after work or any If there is a problem then how can you give him peace of mind? You can see the person in front of you. Brother respect me I didn't think you would answer this. You answered this directly, respect this. But this piece is it gives you that piece. You grind them. Friend he to me and then I'm learning that How can I give it to him also? because to me it I am used to trouble. because it hurt me I am not used to it, friend. Boys don't do all this No friend. It means that they themselves May I get mental peace. Then he himself is the one who The girl wants that, she doesn't do that. So I know I'm very into this thing I am bad. Yes. And she corrects me. Good. She explains. Yes. and I say Friend, yes, I am such a bad man. that I I am. Yes. that I don't realize Would. And I keep looking at him sometimes I am, friend. Girl Girl Goddess Goddess Mother Mother, what a dirty man I am that I If I am harassing a girl like that then that thing and in spite of that if you mean According to me, everyone is in a relationship Things are off course but I feel like this that I'm a bit of a bastard who You bother me too much but now I don't want to do this I have learned a lot from this thing and also an edge it has happened and with time when you are in relationship If it happens to you, then you realize that you are every Do you learn something from a relationship? something happened in the past or it happens to you that you don't repeat it here so I am trying that that I'll correct the mistakes that I made in the past I won’t do it here. I am right in that thing I am done. But now I need a circle of I found out about the mistakes I make I am improving now. well i am not i am I never knew I was on YouTube Not at all. when you guys are especially torn Your generation of creators I have seen on YouTube I started catching up last year. Before that I was something special on YouTube I did not see it. so to me i don't know if This is public knowledge. but i really want to No for somebody who has been there for 10 years. hmm 10 It's been years. I've been in this game for 10 years. What has been your lowest point in life? And how were your parents around that time? Man, what a support system he had around him? yaar the lowest point is not a point like that Was. I mean this thing about social media, friend It goes up and down all the time. not like that that means my first 2 years ago It was the lowest point. It has happened to me that For some time I don't understand it What content should I create? So I to him too I can consider it the lowest. Never leave team members If I had gone, that would have been my lowest point Something in life or personal relationships I am struggling so that is also my work If it affects me then that too at the lowest point If it happens then it is not that I have only one It was the lowest point and it hit me a lot If I did it then things went up and down and It's the case with me that I don't share My family knows those things till today what is my lowest point Whatever I am feeling at that time, sleep how do you do it when your partner is around Anything like down days come I talk I want to do this for our fans Nor can this time be with us or with them It's good that it shouldn't happen to him. I would like to talk to them I am trying. what do you do with that? I Let me tell you the truth I I talk to myself and I ignore I will do it. this is very big with me There is a problem. I am unable to share. My It feels like this is my defense mechanism guess that I feel like this If I tell my friends, it might not be a joke Fly it. That's correct. Ok. and it might be Let's blow it away, right? Maybe he might understand it also. Now I talk seriously with my friends a lot. I can do less. this was our conversation Are. Get it done, do it all. to the bare minimum It also happened that I told him You have given me this feeling brother Is. I went and did it. Otherwise he Just say something jokingly and take it as a joke Let's go and talk. So I think that too There is a different therapy. That is also a different therapy. Boys themselves have 10 things in their mind It must be going on. He also doesn't understand it How did he talk? So me and my Friends, I never talk to serious people Do. I sometimes tell my partner I told him that if this is the problem then it is up to me I also feel that I should tell the other person as well No, and I will get answers like this Are. Whether I tell my family or they to the one who will tell me nothing happened Will go. why are you taking tension, don't do this take it, don't take it. They are very commonly found That happens to everyone. Don't worry. Now! Nothing has finished yet. don't do that a little It has happened. So I think all this is me Talking to myself, I already know this thing Nothing has happened. So I think and I I think, okay, how can I overcome this thing? I will do it and I move towards her. Bus That's it. I don't share it much Thing. Meaning, I will just work and see. Yes just get the job done or i'll kill myself I will distract you at that point of time Pay. I will visit my friend, I am going on a trip I will go or something like this will happen. After that I I forget that thing that yes it is going on Is. Work or whatever. I think that the Yes, its okay. Somewhere, someone of mine There will be a problem or I am not consistent with my work or if I am having trouble with other things I work on that thing and it gets right She goes. This is the thing with me. Right? So That's why I don't share it with anyone. This is a very bad thing for me. according to me Should be done. Yes to some extent. or and I think of a boy if you if you You are a man's man. Isn't it? as are your own nothing, brother we are with the boys, There should be two or four such boy friends. They I mean it seems like it's a joke to me Will blow it away. It's not like they'll blow it away. yes, that is in the back of my mind I will first help you and then make fun of you yes it rains a lot and it rains a lot What happened is that first I told everyone the solution and then I am again the same joke from all years yes and you know what i'm okay with that because The essence of friendship is that both I slapped him from the side, yes this is us ourselves let's do this I was a friend of mine and I I will not take the name, you can Google it so what happened to him that his distant had a little friend but his girlfriend's and his like she Got pregnant. one minute, 1 minute, hey, everybody People please reverse and see how brother said it Is. his girlfriend and her nervousness, I am yes so now he is telling me that It happened. Brother, we tore his night apart Fill. We told his brother that brother you become a father Will go. Now, how are you and your family now? We will see what happens and what does not happen. They He is saying this and we are telling him more and more Brother, this is definitely a period It is a sign. o sorry pregnant sign Is. I am saying periods. a because what It happens not during your pregnancy and Symptoms of periods when periods are late and there are symptoms of pregnancy Yes, they are very similar. Ok? To you So you must know it. Brother, what do you know? So they would be very similar Are. Yes. So now his girlfriend was Her periods were late. Now we all I told her that it is early pregnancy, oh brother He is having trouble with this for sure She will be pregnant, this will be that, her night We kept it like this for the next day's test if I wasted nothing then this would have happened These boys, the doctor helped them in that too Brother, you guys did not help us at all So and he gave him that and gave him trauma that Brother-in-law, this is that, this is but now he never makes this mistake won't zoom out to see if that helps Friends told me here that you made a mistake Now I realise, friend, I can't accept that The boy should not make such a mistake again brother tell me what will happen to it, make it look like this I definitely want to see the scene on his head Who is this bastard boy Brother, tell him this is a very real thing Tell me, I am not afraid of pregnancy but of STDs. so afraid This is a very real thing but then multiple You didn't have a partner, brother. Now let's talk about it. I understand what you are saying, I have no interest in this I don't want to make sexual commentary for once It is said that I got a call from a friend of mine I came and stayed in the US, he says brother I I'm sitting here in the lab and I'm scared. I feel like something has happened to me brother that 5 The seven minute phone conversation explained my meaning It disturbed me in my mind that the The risk of NS is over brother then now No one can become SD permanently There are some SDs which become latent They come back later but something like this those who remain are brothers aids weds It is a very risky matter brother, one should be afraid of it One must fear death and nothing else friend according to me i mean i am asking you I am here, maybe I have gained so much new knowledge yes but the partner is the same if So what is the risk, friend, look at the risk It is possible that this partner has never met someone before was with them and they were latent in it because Just like herpes, it is not visible then That's overall a little bit of attention that too There is a ghanorrhea in which I guess the female carries It just does not cause any side effects to females It does not happen but if boys do it then The condition becomes worse. I did not know that. it Peace and I new an AIDS. but there is gone React Media. and like wow, this is a Conversations to adult males should be having. so everybody else can learn bro because enough It's a risky thing. This house, this school thing do not do. These family members don't talk. So We should do this. Come to the podcast. Come to the podcast. We must speak Don't lose your senses in excitement. too long It's a journey, friends. Ok? Take some care. and resorting to plastic. how good We are influencers. give sex education have been. Brother is a positive influencer. This was our work. Why did we come to the internet Pay? Crazy. yes brother this with friends The thing is that I have two or three friends like this with whom I only have serious talks I do it. Those who don't know that at all. To abuse someone. You understand such boys Friends who are only serious talkers and Frankly, it's largely because of who I am I am from. I mean, when I have periods like this There is a friend of mine where The therapist is in the US. ever to me Psychologically it seems to me that it is not Know what to do. I was with him for two or three I talk to you on phone calls every day and you talk to me were with were were with were were with were with therapy does not. For them remembers different things and I listen Something. so i think it's a part share then friend, I want to do one more thing a little bit I just realized that you were talking about this I feel like sharing about if I talk more about this If she is travelling with me then I feel that's who I am, I am very careful about that I will become obsessive. Not obsessive means I don't want it to even come into my mind I run away from that thing, we are like this Maybe don't call me stupid, I am the same Call it a defense mechanism, call it anything. So I feel if I talk about a friend I will also talk to that thing, then that thing And this matter will keep revolving in my mind. So just leave it behind and move ahead. This is how I cope up. I don't know Is this my problem, mental or physical? should or should not I do that Address. I will tell you what is the answer? I have a nephew who has completed 12th It has just happened to him. Ok. His tomorrow to me A message came, this poor guy is gone. he said uncle I have had a breakup. my elder Dilvil is hurting. What shall I do? Real The thing is. Ok. I told him something what want to do it? Can't do anything. Now it is done brake up. Uncle is saying that he wants to cry so I He said, son, it is a canon event in everyone's life At a certain age, he comes and cries for a girl The man is saying uncle what should I do then I said just watch it till he is crying After that now transform yourself It's time to do this, we have to take this energy And going to the gym with this energy is like making a career Whatever you think is right is up to your parents he says he has to do that and then he remembers I said memories are just memories so you can't do anything and it actually happens Most of the injuries we suffer are our own By rechanneling the mindset to us, we had to make action it is no joke How many people started YouTube? Today Harsh is acting in different TV shows. So I can open the Amazon Mini TV. Oho Let me open mine. What happens? Chrome The one who stays there has a happy face on him. This way For some, brother, that is not a man's childhood It's the injury that's keeping him running even today. Otherwise Where does hard work come from? Ambition and Injury R Tide. And then if the matter is still pending after 2 years It did not go out of my mind. go to therapy again Talk to him later. Then remove it from your mind. My who thinks this is it. It is not necessary to talk to do. friend, it seems to me that our no ever middle class lower middle class No, these therapy talks are not there in homes with Has it ever happened? So we know when we found out This is when we had already become quite adults. So like our childhood was supposed to be shaped up No, that already happened. hmm anyone ever thought of that Things that should have been discussed with family members Never told me that anything like this happens. Even he might not know all this. yes them too Didn't know. yes they get all this right now I have found out these things about anxiety and depression I got to know about this after so much time. when someone When the actor did something then we got to see these things So many people on the term social media I found out. Nobody knew anything before that Was. This post is from 2010 Deepika Padukone Announcing She Has Depression Is Known To the people. even after that i still don't know Was. I am saying the same thing when an actor does something He does it, then after that people realize It happens. Good mental health is also something It happens to boys. This is also something that happens. Till then no one knew anything. So I feel like these things somewhere also that we tell our family members right now If we have kids, we will teach them, son If this thing is troubling you. From us Talk about it, do this, do that. our family members we If we were causing trouble we would get beaten up. if from them If I would have talked to you then we would have faced double trauma, yes double Trauma from inside and that trauma feels like trauma I didn't even have it at that time, so during my childhood Brother it was trauma, it felt like love, that love Now it seemed like if a child was crying If so, his family members slap him and make him cry Don't and he is already crying because of your beating yes that's not the solution yes then he would have killed me don't cry because you are crying now The child is thinking about what to do in this option left or option right then child He won't leave the matter and run away from anyone No. Yes right right right right right. So I feel like it was your childhood Shape up happens. you are the next one coming You are an adult, you do those things Yes you are. brother but I mean I had a very good Time talking to you. is there any question That's what you want to ask me. nothing in mind You might have left it. No friend, no, nothing. Yes I guess we said the right things. fun Came? Yes, yes. You see, this is therapy.
