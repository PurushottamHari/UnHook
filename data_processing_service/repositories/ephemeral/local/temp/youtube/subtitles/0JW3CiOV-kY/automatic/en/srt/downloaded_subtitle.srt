1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
Remember your childhood beatings? Yes dear. Who?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
Have you hit him? It was Mummy who killed him. me papa

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
never killed. Auntie has hit me. Only

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,400
Mummy has killed me. And with what did you hit him?

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
Friend, my father was a wrestler. They knew a

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,000
If it happened then he was a proper wrestler. Four

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
He is a national level wrestler and champion. Or not

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
So many photos were in my phone at that time.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
Whatever happens will happen to them. Yes. yes I my phone

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
It will be in. I will show you brother. i you

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
I will send it. The phone is on charging. But

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,840
proper bawd and so they knew that he was

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
I will leave it. If he leaves, we knew it, kids

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Will break. yes right it was like barvi

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
When I used to break down they used to think that I

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,880
If I hit them, they would break, so my mother used to hit me

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
It was just us and him and even I was not beaten that much

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399
The more my sister is beaten the better yes

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
So after seeing my sister I got a different drama

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
No, I should not make the mistake that my sister made

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,960
She was two years older than me, better than me

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,680
so she is beaten more and when she is

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
When I was born he felt very jealous

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,039
It was difficult in the beginning because the first one

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
Love had shifted to me and the kids

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
who does not understand that if someone comes then he

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
He tried to kill me many times

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
Is it true that in childhood it is not true

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Meaning sometimes I secretly say something to my

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
some killed him, some did that because he

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,720
I don't like this at all in the beginning

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
My family tells me that she is jealous

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
She is jealous, she is jealous, yes

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
If it happens to him then he is very much in that affair

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,520
She beats you up because you are hitting your younger brother

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
Now you are beaten on behalf of all elder brother and

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
sister i want to say this big brother sister

38
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
My brother still beats my sister

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
My family members haven't even scolded me properly

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,560
Hmm and mommy has hit it off a bit.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
Hmm. Brother, Papa did not kill me, only three in total

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,600
In bar life. And those slaps are numbered

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
Because after that I remember you every year

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
I hit him once. As long as I remember

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
Don't you remember I haven't grown up yet? one for you

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,960
I had hit the bar in Manali. On which issue

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
Did you hit him? That drama is different sister. also beaten

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,640
And also made me remember it. my father's

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Only those who used to stare at me,

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Looks like that was enough for me. at that time

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,399
So. I felt I needed a beating

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
Not there. the way they looked at it

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,880
So, I would have got four in one go like this. I

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
How can I dare to do that after that what they

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,880
He told me to do the same thing. Power

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
The look of the papas is that of Indian papas.

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,159
Brother, his was very dangerous. to me

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
Even now he became as cranky as he was in childhood

59
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
Those who used to comment on my writing

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
This was my very bad writing. Yes.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,759
So once I got it written by a friend. Now

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,679
This is my bad writing in six lines. Seventh

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
Such beautiful writing in the lines. Now my

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,080
Why is Papa watching this writing match?

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Not there? So that look which was there or that which

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,239
I had to scold him and then he would scold me

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,520
It would have been transferred to mom. is it your son?

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,720
Yes. You messed it up and it became an achievement

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,760
So, this is my boy. I have done this. So this

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
It used to happen. I am a friend of mine. he is not one

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
It was around this time last year. We people

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
Sitting on his roof. his no he is going

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
I had to study outside. So we our people like this

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
Having a little last day party warty.

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
By the way, Prakhar Bhai is saying, can I tell you one thing?

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
I said, speak. friend is saying this in childhood

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,400
When papa used to come home and start his car with the remote

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Used to lock it. That sound of center locking

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
It was there even today, it bursts even today

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I become thin after listening to this brother

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
I could recognize the sound of the scooter at that time

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
We didn't have that car so we had a scooter

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
The silencer is papa's voice according to the voice

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,879
I used to do this, he is my father, yes and

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
A man does not become straight on his own like this

86
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,800
Absolutely hello it becomes completely normal

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,360
It's like yes, something has come so many times

88
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I used to open the book and sit to read

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
I have done this acting of reading many times

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,120
It's the love of parents, my friend.

91
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,599
It's love my friend, yes it is love my friend

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
These are the things I remember later, friend. So

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,440
Now how do uncle and aunty take it? like all this

94
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
The success that you have? How are they about this?

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
Friend, he is very proud now. Meaning

96
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
I feel like I am not that proud

97
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,400
I am as many as my family members. Crazy Feel

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
Isn't it? And I mean he is my father, my friend

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,000
So they become very happy. That means someone

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,239
Even if I say randomly that you are Harsh's

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
Is it dad or someone has found out? him his own

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
I will give you the number on November 15. any problem

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
No. Whenever I feel happy, I will call you

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,200
I will take it. And they still do it like this. One

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
This time it happened like this and I was sleeping. and mine

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
I opened my eyes and I was in pain at that time.

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
I had just become famous. 17-18 thing

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
Is. I open my eyes like this

109
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,040

Meanwhile, hey friend, these are his boys. These

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
It comes. No brother, I won’t tell you today.

126
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,240
I could, brother. My dad is doing the same thing in between

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
Started. He started giving my number to someone. I

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
Papa said, there is only one method for these things. I

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
Your number is on your father's phone number, your number is Madhavi

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,000
I have saved it in the name of. so that they get

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
No. What do those people do? Papa's

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
I'll take the phone as well. once upon a time brother

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
Sir, please take the number. So Madhavi I

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,840
I did this character in my video. I so

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,080
It came to my mind at that time

136
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,840
till now the same is saved madhavi crazy yes but

137
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
I then did someone else's job and would someone think

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440
ho I don't know which fair they are running

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,160
Aunty knows you are talking to Madhavi

140
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,160
Neither does mommy know, look at the people outside

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
Make it, what do the outsiders think, but yes

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
Brother, this has to be done because father understands

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
Papa is not coming, here is Prakhar's number

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
Oh dad, I won't be able to say no to anyone

145
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
I got a call, someone asked for something

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
Friend, let us talk through our little system

147
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
If there is something to talk about then I will do it

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
I will take it but I have seen my father grow up

149
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
I enjoy it when they don't take me along

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,440
Everyone recognizes my son from different places.

151
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
He likes it very much when his feet are touched. They

152
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,000
I feel different and proud. my mom too

153
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,600
She does the same thing, come with me

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
When you go somewhere, Nana and others also go there.

155
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
So, they get a lot of happiness. Now at Nana’s

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
So am I what I am. but that when

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
When we go through the street, we get down

158
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,919
When everybody sees it they feel very proud

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,080
It happens. The crazy thing is that we are here

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
In Faridabad you can roam the streets of Pitampura

161
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,039
Boys sitting here, what all does not happen, brother.

162
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
Brother, what have I done brother?

163
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,039
Which I will tell you right now. people any

164
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
He will see my past as well, he will see a movie somewhere

165
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
No one can say whether that thing will be made or not

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
that this guy must be doing this thing now he is here

167
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
He is paying. That's why I want to know this

168
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,360
We do podcasts, man, I did all that

169
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,960
I have done some activities which meant that it was in my area

170
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,840
All the Beniwals of Pitampura live there

171
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,919
All of them were Jats etc., they were our uncle's relatives

172
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,440
They look like boys. Now on the side there

173
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,680
no there were a big amount of people who laboured

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,919
Was. It was the labour class who did daily labour

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,880
who are daily wage labourers and rickshaw pullers

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,600
the laborers were fine now

177
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,160
What were my family members like to give me the house on rent?

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,520
okay so ours was on the second floor

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
We had given the rest of the labour on rent

180
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,720
Someone is going to class and someone is going to work somewhere else

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
My family is employed somewhere now

182
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,600
I thought that my family would never do this

183
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,520
wanted me to go out and I my

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
The language should become that of the Jats

185
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
I should start speaking Haryanvi, not my mother

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,360
I liked it, it was okay in the beginning but now she

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,960
I feel very proud but in the beginning I

188
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
it was no no no they thought that this

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,039
They speak very nicely that if brother goes out

190
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,199
No one should consider them as ignorant, who

191
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,080
It was very wrong but at that time it was a stereotype

192
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,600
there was but yes so now they never asked me to leave the house

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,600
I am not allowed to go out, now I am in my entire house

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
I am roaming around, okay I am second and third

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
I am going to the floor where the labour

196
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,039
There are children, I am playing with them. Now

197
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
I am playing with them. moments with them

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
I am growing. I'm growing up in school

199
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,880
and I'm doing the same things as him

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
We do. I'll go to the person in front of me

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
Digging a hole in the garden and playing marbles

202
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,479
Am. Ok? and playing marbles there

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,479
Am. Now he used to run the tyre with the help of a stick.

204
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm running tires. the tire in the drain

205
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,840
I am driving and taking the tyre out of the drain.

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,240
And I'm running tires with them again. So

207
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,319
My mother did not feel that language was the only thing

208
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Then it would have been bad. What is happening now?

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,720
he is choking he is choking

210
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:32,720
The boy is choking and eating tuberose is good

211
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,720
It seems that I have done these things now

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
What kind of game was theirs on a stone?

213
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,039
I used to throw stones and the other stone would go far away

214
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
So the other one should take him there by placing him in the position

215
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,360
I used to play games, so I am better than this, my friend

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
let the language remain with them

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
it just happens if it happens according to you

218
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
And brother, I feel very proud right now

219
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
I promise that I know Haryanvi

220
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
Campus cast did it in full Haryanvi. Whole

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,720
Support came from the Jats. Haryanvi's support

222
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,479
Came. Now my mom says it's good

223
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
You know it. I said it's big here

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,440
They used to stop me. So, I used to do all this. These

225
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,440
So Haryanvi benefited you. Raw

226
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,919
What benefit did you get from playing life?

227
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
In? Brother, let me apply this on you. to me

228
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,240
That sport seemed proper. my my

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,240
no i

230
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
Brother you won't believe me after school I

231
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,879
He used to tell school children what marbles are

232
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,800
There are. They ask, brother with whom should we study?

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:25,120
I have been in school. you are saying see

234
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,120
Here, look at the marbles.

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,879
Did I show him marbles earlier? School

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,000
what do the children say

237
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,200
Are? Teaching school children about marbles

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,880
Tell me. what is that what would be their reaction

239
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
Isn't it? Which school was this? If the Maharaja

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,719
Model School, Proper English Medium School,

241
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,719
Good school. Yes. and there I put my marbles

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,880
I am taking it. As long as P bhai is jumping,

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,200
actually and I am telling you my

244
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,440
Papa had a very good name in the entire village.

245
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,080
He is still a very respectable man. Yes.

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,640
And they used to see that look this boy of Anand

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
He is playing marbles here at 3:00. so that

248
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,040
They used to look down upon me. means to me

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
what are you doing. I have wrestlers there.

250
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,480
I am playing marbles.

251
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,240
I am running tyres.

252
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,800
So I met someone in person for the first time.

253
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,800
The tyre goes away.

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,519
I am the first time tire

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,440
So friend, I used to do this. Now I now

256
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
Tell me if I tell you this thing then no one will

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
He will accept this thing. That's crazy bro. Isn't it?

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,760
What a crazy thing is this. Yes. then and and and

259
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,160
What is the matter? This is the only thing I remember

260
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,920
But all this happened in it after that, friend, remember

261
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,440
Let me do all this. when you grow up then

262
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,720
running around with friends from school

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,240
You might have started here. yes then when I

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
When I grew up a bit, I felt that now my friend

265
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
I need to upgrade. do not run tires

266
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
I have it. Now I have to ride a scooter.

267
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,240
I want a machine with tyres

268
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,720
You have a scooter. Yes. then after that

269
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I did not want to do it according to my own will

270
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,839
Get out of. Ok. now in the street

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Let go. Let me meet my cousin. from these

272
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,480
Let me meet you. Then the family members also stopped me from doing this

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,000
Didn't interrupt. He felt that he has grown a bit now.

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
What impact will it have now? to be as dirty as

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
was it became. He saw me driving a tyre

276
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
happened. What could be worse than this? Tires

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
Taking out photo. He saw it.

278
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
Yes. then after that again friend friend

279
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,720
made it because the schools in Delhi mean we

280
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,040
We were in Faridabad, ok, one turn for us

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Once in my total life I closed the school

282
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720
I went to visit Delhi and this didn't happen to me

283
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,399
I went to the dazzling wow big city these people are here

284
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
what do you do but I was thinking this

285
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,480
After school life is also big in Delhi

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
You must be entertaining brother, doing many things

287
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,160
to go here and there on scooters

288
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,880
To make friends he goes to school itself

289
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
We did that in school itself, that means me

290
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,720
There used to be cousins ​​etc. so what next?

291
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,160
this was my next step my friend

292
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
that my family members told me that even my cousin

293
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Only he can maintain friendship. So that means I didn’t say it

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
But that was it for them that I didn’t care much about.

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,480
I let him meet me. My dad is what I'm telling you

296
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,839
When I used to scold him, he used to say that in the street

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
don't hang out with the boy its his boy

298
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
Don't hang out together. This is him spoiled

299
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
It is spoiled. my tire doesn't work

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
at least. Look at me I'm driving a tyre

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
I. They say this about me.

302
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,399
You say that in your homes, friend

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,040
Look, his son drives tyres, friend. These

304
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,120
There is some standard, friend.

305
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,440
Don't hang out with him. he is not a good boy

306
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Is. So with all my might I am going to give up on these cousins

307
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
I used to hang out with. anymore or max mohit

308
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
with mohit who makes videos with me

309
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,000
If I hang out with her, what have we done?

310
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,600
We used to do this, finish our work at 7-8 pm

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
There used to be school etc. I also took tuition

312
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,839
After completing my studies, we used to go to Rohini

313
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,560
New momos were there to drive around

314
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,760
And there was a huge crowd for momos

315
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
beautiful there lovely

316
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,440
Girls used to come. We also used to go dressed up

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
And we also used to style it. That too us

318
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
I used to watch. We used to watch them too. it goes on

319
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,839
It was there at that time. Every day from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm

320
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,920
Yes from 6:00 to 8:00. After Tuition

321
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,839
There used to be a set time after tuition

322
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
yes this time we will go to kill the dog

323
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,079
When the momo vendor has new momos

324
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
What a madness it was Momo Bhai I came for the first time

325
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,200
When I ate the bar I wondered what I had eaten

326
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
Before I hit a six for the first time I said this

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
So very g yes I said g feed me that

328
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,360
it is better yes after that brother then I put the tyre

329
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
Extracted nickel

330
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,560
Then I went out on my tyre

331
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,360
I told this to my home, brother respect brother, this

332
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,360
Respect to reveal yes then

333
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,279
After that now slowly try again

334
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,600
If you ever feed me then it will be fun

335
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,000
I have eaten a lot and the way I felt at that time

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
I heard there was a soda in Rohini too for ₹5

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
I used to get soda of Rs. 1000, tried every flavour

338
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,040
yes it is the one which looks like a machine press the machine

339
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,920
They used to give this much glass, yes, the one for ₹5

340
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,880
We took out that soda which cost ₹5 and bought it in that.

341
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,720
that fruit beer fruit beer and I'm thinking

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,560
I was drinking alcohol and eating crackers

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,000
I used to imagine that I was a drunkard

344
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Papa, today I have become like you. Brother

345
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,399
Brother, you came out from very dark corners

346
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,680
yes.

347
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,760
oh this is right this one used to be a machine like this and

348
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,639
There were 12-13 flavours in it. yes this crepe

349
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,160
Lemon used to be this. All this used to happen. ₹5

350
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
All we got was a small glass. ₹10 big

351
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,839
Glass. This shop was in Rohini and here

352
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,920
So my decision was that I should drink a soda every day.

353
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,920
Me today. This would have become an overall

354
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
Post Tuition in Culture 10th 11th 12th

355
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,160
Now we will all have fun by going and fighting

356
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,880
we will hang out with each other and then those talks will become big

357
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,480
It gets crooked brother at that time, I mean then

358
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,120
I don't know when a man grows up

359
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,519
Those things just stay like that and are remembered

360
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,360
not even then that once upon a time at last

361
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,360
I don't know if he might have visited this place last time

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
It must be that today is the last one. I am actually that

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
I am able to visualize that shop because

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200
There was a shop behind the market where

365
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
I used to get this where I would say, yes friend

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,680
Sisterfucker, I forgot that I ever did this

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
This happened and that would have happened too, friend

368
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,680
They used to play a game with coins, these ones,

369
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Total fun in which different takes are included

370
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,200
There used to be no one there, there was no taker

371
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:37,040
Street Fighter Namco and that Contra

372
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,360
contra and that one mustafa mustafa means

373
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,440
That character's name was Cady the Dinosaur

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,800
It was a game of us, that meant she told a lot of people

375
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
He is known only by the name of Mustafa. So this is as much as

376
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
People of Pitampura are also watching, they should know

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
Which game am I talking about?

378
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
Do you remember the one in which you inserted that cassette

379
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,440
used to play video games in which olympics

380
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,079
There used to be a

381
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
There was a circus guy who jumped up and there was a guy in it

382
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,680
There was also a game after doing adventure. Mario

383
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,040
Just as it was. There was one on the island,

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Guy. No one remembers me like this

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,600
No. That was the time of video gaming. Yes.

386
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,800
What fun it is if space doesn't work then blow it with spit

387
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,959
He would hit me and then apply the same. This used to happen a lot.

388
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
And when the lights went out, that was it. Now nothing happens

389
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,959
Can. Now you have to wait for another while

390
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,240
It will have to be No game was saved. Yes.

391
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,279
This one, yes. It contains 256 games, 112 games

392
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,279
Talk to him 80,000 games in one go and repeat all

393
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,959
It used to happen. Yes, the first two were correct.

394
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,720
Because of that it was repeated more. My

395
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
I have a friend, he is wearing this one.

396
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
The machine that you insert a coin into

397
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
He has put all the money in his house. My

398
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,519
There is also a console nearby. He walks here. These

399
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,279
All games are played. PS PS3's. Yes. That PS3

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,279
Even games have been played inside it. already

401
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
It is loaded. Proper, that one with the joystick.

402
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,040
Crazy. Yes. Where is it in Bombay? No

403
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,320
No. No. This is our Gurgaon. ok ok

404
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
ok ok. Good. I have been in Gurgaon

405
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
He has built a glass house up there. His

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
I have done it inside only for gaming

407
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,240
I have made it. there action figures

408
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
My favourite characters are kept etc.

409
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,079
of. Yes. And there's our gaming. playstation

410
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
is putting. The console is placed underneath

411
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,120
The one. of these games and sitting there

412
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,880
There is a sofa. Not much. small to me

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,199
Seems like I know that anyway. sorry i did

414
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,920
I gave it to you. I told the boys to do something

415
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,839
do it. Watch what's best with Harsh Beniwal

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,519
What is the search term? You know

417
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
what comes? Girlfriend not girlfriend

418
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,199
also comes. I have asked that. Yes.

419
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,800
Height. height yes yes I told you about the height

420
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,199
Have you ever been in the market? How much are you selling?

421
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,480
Tall is that an issue? Overall? no to me

422
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,120
I have an issue brother, it has happened so much.

423
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,720
Issue? Yes. in school time yes that means

424
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
I think the people who say this right now

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,760
Speak less. Listening too much at school

426
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
I took it. that they used to bully at school

427
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,120
You must be on this matter. If we are bullied then we will bully too

428
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,199
Were. On top of that, people from the neighborhood bully me.

429
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,040
Were. Even relatives used to bully me. Bully too

430
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,680
Did he do that? Oh, let it stay just like that

431
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
Is it all gone? So I have heard this much

432
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
No. Now I feel like laughing and I

433
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Looks like you'd better bring the roast. I

434
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,160
Then I do it myself too. Yes. so that

435
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,160
Now that it's mine, it's gone

436
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Wala K. I felt bad about the height.

437
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,120
But you are a very good looking guy overall. Meaning

438
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,920
Someone is fine. At first I used to be very upset about the height

439
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,160
It was like, friend, he is short in height, he is short in height. But

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,079
After that, I realised that now

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,560
It is not in my hand, look. I

442
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,040
I hang as much as I can, I swing as much as I can

443
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,040
I did a lot, I did a lot of running. he go he

444
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,800
This is what I have got after doing everything. don't think about it

445
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,440
I would have done it.

446
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,920
If I didn't do it, I would have got the table placed below, friend.

447
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,519
So then I feel that now I have to

448
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
It doesn't matter now. yes friend, i mean

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,800
How much is buried in the mind of a man

450
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,399
Insecurity sometimes continues for a long time.

451
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,639
Isn't it? Yes, there is no use, my friend.

452
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,800
And if you are on camera, do the whole acting

453
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
you are doing promotion, then this

454
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,079
The camera itself is such an insecurity

455
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,680
shows himself that he

456
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,959
You have to remove the ghost from your mind.

457
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
YouTube comments show everything

458
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,959
Insecurity brother. Hmm. when to abuse

459
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
come to YouTube or Twitter, then everyone

460
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,480
It opens up in my mind at that time. To you

461
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
He has to leave it. so listen so much

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
Lee na, now I feel that no, this is

463
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,000
I am talking about very basic things. Then

464
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,720
What is the height? height yaar meri aar around 5 4

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,800
It became 55. It is 55. Yes, it seems to be 55 only. Yes

466
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,160
It will be 55. Yes that is correct. yes and what? Yes

467
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,799
I don't even measure.

468
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,559
It should be visible and should not appear small. so therefore

469
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,439
I think that leave it with time

470
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,679
I didn't say anything the last time,

471
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,439
Measurement. Now when I get it, right

472
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
Someone's brother, you are very young, my friend. I

473
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
I said, yes you are down to earth. all these things

474
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
Let's go. All these things happen. take let's go.

475
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's go. actually this is a good

476
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
Question. I want to ask you here

477
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
Because I have heard this too. Ok?

478
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Acting is not my profession. i meet a

479
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,919
Lots of actors, I meet lots of you. And

480
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
I have heard this thing some time or the other. And

481
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,120
I feel like this from my

482
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
Experience I host a podcast.

483
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,679
A Harsh Beniwal is going to get me so

484
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Many more viewers. so many more brands

485
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,640
work. so much more relevance than somebody who is

486
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
Purely an actor. And no shade. I am their

487
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
Nobody wants to do evil. I think

488
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,919
Acting is an art. and in doing that too

489
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,280
which requires holes to be made inside the brain

490
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,799
This is not a joke. but have you found that in

491
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,880
There is such an elitism in circuits that

492
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
Hey you are the YouTube guy and I am the acting guy

493
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
are going to. Is this real? yes definitely

494
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,080
remains. So it will get better in two-three years.

495
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,919
These people will go. Brother, look at this now

496
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,240
I am improving. I mean the thing with me is that I

497
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,760
if someone does this to me that you just

498
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
If he is a youtuber then I will work with him

499
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,679
does not. This has happened so many times that

500
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,799
Bollywood collabs have come and they have said

501
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,160
that you come and do it. I'll give you an hour

502
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,000
And you do that. I said ok money.

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
We ask why are actors paying money

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,760
No? I said actor roti in my house

505
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,880
He will give me a little. Yes, that is correct. I have the money

506
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Needed Yes. So if he had refused there now

507
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,559
ok brother don't do it. and frankly me

508
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,400
I don't think any actor thinks like this.

509
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,160
no yes the teams that are in between them

510
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
Brother, the kettle is hotter than the tea.

511
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
The kettle is hot. He is nobody, nothing to them

512
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,919
It wouldn't have happened that now my brother I had seen so many

513
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
Even when I met the actor, he used to say

514
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,280
hey brother what a great script you wrote

515
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,760
Of. Oh man, yes, he knows it too

516
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,240
He is an artist but these people around him

517
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,840
It happens that their father would feel bad

518
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,760
Baba will not give more than an hour brother

519
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
Baba, at least ask Baba once more Baba

520
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
After coming, I had to sit for two hours

521
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,640
We drink tea and talk about the world

522
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
they do it too they even give their phone numbers but

523
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,440
The team members around who carry all the paraphernalia

524
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Isn't it brother, all the collaborations with me

525
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,559
I did it, I took everyone's money, brother

526
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
If you also see me on Instagram

527
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,400
Although there is very little movie promotion

528
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
I took money from everyone who has an actor in them

529
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
it is there and I don't know what the problem is

530
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
There is one thing that even the people around are not in the actor

531
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,160
Like any other fellow creator, he is an actor

532
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
They get it and happily run away and make it

533
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
there are videos, it is not there, its use

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
No, that too on its own in a short time

535
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
will level out because look man

536
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
The only difference is that Harsh did not

537
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,799
I started acting from Delhi.

538
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
He has also done scripting in his YouTube channel

539
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,760
did the direction as well as set the slides

540
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,440
He did everything with his team and

541
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
Then he became so famous that now he is doing acting

542
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,280
doing. The second way is to go to Bombay

543
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,120
Go take acting classes, then you

544
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,880
Give auditions around the world and meet them

545
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,880
See who is auditioning from around the world.

546
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
My first experience of Bombay when I

547
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,200
I started podcasting, I was a friend of mine

548
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,360
Was staying at the house of. hmm a mail from that friend

549
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
An actor friend had come. Ok, good.

550
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,039
Yes, he had come like this and was sitting there. of the day

551
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,520
It is something, he is doing some preparation etc.

552
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,799
Will be. We are brothers, I swear on that guy's mother

553
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,280
I saw only sadness in his eyes. we are six five

554
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,760
It has been going on for a year. and I will tell its story

555
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,440
I have been. You can even slightly lose signal

556
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,640
Put it. Your home, family, friends,

557
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,160
Meet me somewhere among friends of friends

558
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,120
The man who had been to Bombay sometime or the other will go

559
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,960
To become an actor. Brother, very well decided topic

560
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,360
of. means this thing has started because

561
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,080
That's my character in Lafange, hum. Beans

562
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,240
That's it. that he went to Bombay? that he should become

563
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,919
He is an actor. He wants to be a superstar and he

564
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,000
He goes to Bombay and is struggling

565
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,600
And those seven-eight people were staying in one room.

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
Are. Seven to eight people are staying in one room

567
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,000
Are. Everyone wants to become an actor. she is complete

568
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,159
He is the one who is living the struggle. The actor who is a

569
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They belong to the actor. You should think so much Aaramnagar

570
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,840
who resides in or near the residential area

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,080
I shot with so much struggle brother. I

572
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,880
I looked and I actually found out

573
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,200
People live here. even anud which is mine

574
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,960
with this inside the show there is anud he

575
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
I told him that brother, me and Gagan, in fact Gagan

576
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,120
He is saying that he has done his journey like this

577
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
START. Think about it brother and some of that too

578
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
Brother, we can achieve a breakthrough. and then in that

579
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,240
We can achieve some more breakthrough through this.

580
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
There is a reason Shahrukh Khan is Shahrukh Khan,

581
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,440
Aamir Khan is Aamir Khan. Salman Khan Is

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Salman. There's a thousand feet of dirt beneath it.

583
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,880
a thousand feet and all these people below it

584
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,240
Those who are trying brother. Because it's me

585
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,080
I will remove him from acting. from me

586
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
The person I am getting married to is a painter.

587
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,159
This is his painting. I always give them this

588
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
I am saying that your game is an art one.

589
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
This is a game of gate keeping. I just I

590
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,360
Art, that's what I'm talking about. I of the painting

591
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,400
I am not talking about acting. if a gallery

592
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,880
The one says I bet on the cloud

593
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,559
If I want you to go ahead. Your Art

594
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
To find out whether someone is better or worse than you

595
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
There isn't any way to do it either. any objective

596
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,640
There is no way. Still in acting.

597
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,640
I am not saying this. But to a large extent it is a

598
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
The man has to be selected out of 1000. His

599
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
I don't know if that will work as well. it's a very

600
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
Probabilistic game. like UPSC

601
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
Preparations are made. preparing for IIT

602
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,240
Is. If it doesn't happen then people get carried away.

603
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,320
So if a man makes his own way

604
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Why is he weak? I am asking this

605
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,799
Am. Not at all. Yes. I am asking

606
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,520
I am on behalf of Apuva, ​​Poorav, Harsh, Ashish,

607
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,320
Bhuvan and whoever else went into acting, what about these

608
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
Is there anything missing brother? Harsh, Gujral, Anubhav Bassi in

609
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,039
What do people lack in these? He himself

610
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,919
Made a way for. Dude I feel like that

611
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,360
that I too have made a mistake

612
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,000
It seems to me that whoever comes

613
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,120
whoever is the creator, if he comes

614
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,640
very let them settle for very less we you them a

615
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,240
Give him some screen time

616
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,960
You will be happy that I too had become my

617
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,960
even he felt yes a lot yes so friend he

618
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,039
Now I guess the desperation that happens

619
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,039
Bhuvan hit the desperation mark very well

620
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,799
What offers might not have come to Bhuvan or Bhuvan

621
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,000
Why wouldn't you have come and become my friend

622
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,760
Bhuvan had brains, Bhuvan knew about it

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Age in Hero Ka Dost Hero Ka Dost Wale

624
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
role yes okay he knew what the vision was

625
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,039
He knew what he would do next, so he

626
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,520
I guessed that everyone should learn this thing from Bhuvan

627
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,200
We need these things from our creators

628
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,600
They settle down very quickly so if you

629
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
If you stop settling then you will get such roles

630
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
I will not be seen, you tell me I am not doing it

631
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
I can increase your appetite, yes you tell me

632
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,600
I am not doing this, you tell me that

633
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,880
Give me something equal to you, you say as if I have no

634
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,360
Am I done with four characters?

635
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,520
give me a character so I don't want to become that

636
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,000
friend if I come just for 5 minutes

637
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
You will do that, we all will do that together, then

638
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,840
You will be left with no option. To you

639
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,280
Viewership then you need their viewership

640
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
Needed You need their promotion. Free Key

641
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,679
You need marketing. But you give it to them

642
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,600
Do you want a 5 minute role? So there you

643
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,440
I understand a little bit what you are saying and

644
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Frankly I have never met Bhuvan.

645
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,799
I have only heard Bhuvan's words. End

646
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
I have heard this. but in goa fest

647
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,400
When we met there. Yes, I got it.

648
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
I met him then for 5-7 minutes. me too then

649
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
That was the first time we met you.

650
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,039
Maybe it's in the gym. you were at the gym

651
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,919
Then. I was in the gym at that time. yes when we

652
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:37,200
I met him but I have met Rohit a lot and

653
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,280
Bhai means Bhuvan's strength is very big

654
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Reason Rohit and his level headedness is you

655
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,200
Will you meet Rohit too? Yes, I am a very top man

656
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,039
yes friend for me my career journey in life

657
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
Rohit bhai, do I ever have any problem with you?

658
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,799
And they always have time and such a level

659
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,640
Heads give advice, not to me

660
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,120
I think I don't know Rohit Bhai needs

661
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,679
publicity or not but i want to let the

662
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,320
World No Bhuvan is a talent like no other

663
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,799
Rohit is a businessman support like no other

664
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,760
Ya bro hats off bhai Rohit bhai thank you

665
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,679
so much for what you are true yes absolutely and

666
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,159
Has this ever happened to you because these questions

667
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,159
So anyway people ask The Khan that

668
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,760
Was there ever any competition amongst you people?

669
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,200
There has never been a time between Ashish bhai and Bhuvan mam

670
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,159
There was competition my friend, competition means nothing

671
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,919
Don't we have anyone like that

672
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
What should I say friend, there is never such competition

673
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,480
Because I have seen them brother already

674
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,480
No, I consider him greater than me.

675
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
I talk to Bhuvan like a brother.

676
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
I would have done it with Ashish

677
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,120
By doing this, I started Bhuvan from myself

678
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
Since then he has given a status to friend and you

679
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,400
I never had any competition with my elder brother

680
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,320
It didn't happen because

681
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,480
A I don't know content, we both are very different

682
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,919
's blessing and I still used to be the same

683
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,080
There was no competition even with the content

684
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,480
Because competition is where

685
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,240
I may be equal to you but I am much better than Ashish

686
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,960
I am up let's

687
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,880
Go finish this matter brother, this is the punch line, I

688
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,559
wait kar tha ashish i have no opinion on you

689
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,000
Brother like I love you bro I have no one

690
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,000
but Harsh said I laughed

691
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,679
Let's go bro yes this is what I came to hear

692
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:17,360
I am yes and then tell me that it is only that friend who has no

693
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,880
There is no competition, but it does mean

694
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,840
No, I am not genuine to me

695
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,840
I don't feel any competition and all this

696
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,520
Our field means we know each other a lot

697
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,159
Our WhatsApp group is all four of mine

698
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,080
Carry Bhuvan Ashish we talk to each other

699
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,919
Are. I have never felt any competition till today.

700
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,520
I have some great work to do. tweeting this

701
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
Are. Let's post this. Does someone come to them?

702
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,360
I post it. I tweet.

703
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,960
And sometimes it becomes difficult to do it without even saying anything

704
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
We give it. Sometimes like I am very special

705
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,600
There is work. They don't know, they don't even know

706
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,039
Has arrived. Like I made Checkmate. So

707
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,240
I said brother I want this thing

708
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,919
Go ahead. without a word. I just shared

709
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,720
In Diya group. He put it in. So

710
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,080
I think that that thing is not very

711
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,440
People also make excuses that they don't have a friend

712
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,799
I am putting it. I ignore it because I

713
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,760
They know I won't ask again.

714
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,080
For that thing. daala bhuvan ashi all this

715
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,080
Dude, very ahead in liking and supporting

716
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,000
Are. So how can I compete with all this?

717
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,640
the right thing is not the right thing I understood and this

718
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,679
This solidarity generally involves comedians and rappers.

719
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,679
I have seen it in everything. a four walled

720
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,320
his brother also works with him

721
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,080
do. Yash will also work with him. this which

722
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,080
Our independent industry has emerged

723
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Generally, this solidarity is enough in this, isn't it?

724
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,640
It is right to help each other

725
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,760
of.

726
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,080
And if this person is good then he will move ahead

727
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,240
It will remain relevant till then. We

728
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,200
there are many people who are not good

729
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,520
He is not visible. Now what is the name like

730
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
I will google it. You can Google it.

731
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,159
No, you just tell me, we will do the BP. to me

732
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,880
I don't know, I have no idea

733
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,880
Who could those people be?

734
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,520
There is a lot. I am sure. I am sure. Brother

735
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,880
Anyway but on a very serious note supplement to

736
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
You might enjoy seeing it. Absolutely

737
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Brother. Because you've seen him since.

738
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,240
Yes, he talked about his younger brother, right?

739
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
Yes, I have seen her since she became mine

740
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,159
It was in the video, Junior had come. Hmm. And

741
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,080
The journey so far has been amazing, friend. this here

742
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,600
But that is why I called him this

743
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,760
He had kept the time stamp. Here

744
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,520
Have you seen Pe Pur talking about you? These

745
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
Isn't this the time? I saw the clip

746
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,760
Any. Now I don't know whether this is the same or not.

747
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes playing is the same. It must be the same. After that

748
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,919
But I will call Harsh bhai only as brother he

749
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,279
Is. Brother, that guy is my God Father. He

750
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
Gave me a chance.

751
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,840
He then called me for one shoot after another. there

752
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,200
It was also a small scene. The Woh Tha Parents

753
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,360
Teacher meeting. So the other cast there

754
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
He was supposed to come but he did not come. it was late and

755
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,520
They had the location for six to seven hours.

756
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,039
He said brother it will take time for that person to come

757
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,799
It seems. So your small scene was

758
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,799
No, you can remove that and do a bigger scene.

759
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,640
Complete. I said I will do it brother. to me

760
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,080
What's the problem? And that day too I

761
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,080
I had bunked the unit test and gone to school

762
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,320
In. I had a unit test. had not given

763
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
because I said a little bit today about a particular

764
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,320
The scene is available on Harsh Bhai's channel

765
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,799
I am getting a chance to be featured but that is my

766
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,240
got the whole thing in full flagey video

767
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,960
The video which was torn was wrongly torn to the people so much

768
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,039
I liked the chemistry so much that he is the father

769
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,799
She is a mother and this person looks like her son

770
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,120
Harsh bhai also liked the chemistry so much

771
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
I liked Ashish Chanchlani's first work very much

772
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,640
Once a text came there that brother this

773
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,159
Who is this boy, he did it very well

774
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I saw you for the first time in your video

775
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,240
wow this so I have to get hope from there

776
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,760
The beginning has begun. When Harsh bhai said all this

777
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,000
I told you this boy is gold, brother. we i

778
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,399
Very few young people have an attitude like this

779
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,279
I have seen it. we learned things very quickly

780
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,000
On the right edge. I understood it very quickly and very

781
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,000
Got things quickly. The mimicry of this

782
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There is strength in it where it is like someone else's

783
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
I got into the character. Brother this is our

784
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,520
If we used to do it together in the office, then he would have done this

785
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,960
Was. He used to mimic everyone. But to him this

786
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
I did not know how to make it

787
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,559
Not there. Now he has cracked it. Now

788
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,159
It does very well. When I've seen it

789
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,600
I asked how do you do it? I remember you

790
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,880
I don't remember whether it is correct or not. it is saying

791
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,320
Nothing, I just sit the night before.

792
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,080
Then I wonder how to do it. Meaning

793
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,640
It is very natural for this. If this

794
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,720
Once he gets the training, he will break it. and right now

795
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,799
Its new show is coming, Traitors. now then

796
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,240
He has caught the aura even on stage wage.

797
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,559
It's Aurora. Now no one can stop this. It has

798
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,760
You got it right. Right now this is a reality show

799
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,440
Maybe he has done more acting now

800
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
Maybe Jobs hasn't done that much. do one or two

801
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,159
Yes, he has conducted the hostel race. by having a love

802
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,919
One came, that too was from Allright, he is doing that.

803
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,159
But yes, this is also coming. but this is the same thing

804
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
that's sensible like I said

805
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,880
Something like this in the circle of desperation

806
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,679
don't do that small thing there if you understand

807
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,880
It is already understood that it will go. Butt a little more

808
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,960
If you understand better then it is good. Until then

809
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,640
Then he would still wear a T-shirt. Now it is this

810
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,159
Less than expensive clothes. It is not visible.

811
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
Yes, I am wearing glasses now. to me

812
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,760
Thin eyed eyes with perfect eyes

813
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,000
Wherever the star has been. butt i mean

814
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,840
I have always enjoyed in my journey. As

815
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,120
I find young people to mentor.

816
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,880
I get a chance to do it. then when he

817
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,640
We break our own, right bro you are like

818
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,120
It's a good job. I always saw that in you.

819
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,039
Or tell me about that scoundrel. What is

820
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,799
Scene? When to see it? Where to watch? What

821
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,279
Is it going to happen in that, friend? Why do you want to see it?

822
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,000
don't take this friend then that yes copyright

823
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,799
There will be a copyright scene, then the scoundrels will be copyrighted

824
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,799
We will get it removed, ok remove it

825
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,880

Let's go proper Delhi ke laundo wali

841

This story looks proper Delhi wale

842
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,240
The story of those three boys from North and North

843
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
The story of the boys from West Delhi is proper

844
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,679
Those are his lanes, proper Delhi

845
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:10,000
that is exactly what

846
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,000
Fukrey which one was that of Imran Khan

847
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,520
I am speaking of Imran Khan's Imran Khan

848
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,559
Maybe I am not saying the wrong name which is Aamir Khan

849
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,640
that he is the nephew of Imran Khan

850
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,679
Delhi Wali Delhi Valley Delhi Wali Yes

851
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,760
Top that vibe looks totally handy

852
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,279
It has been shot friend, that is why it is handled yes

853
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,039
It is completely handheld and shakiness will remain.

854
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,640
I asked Prem who is our director

855
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,960
with whom i did campus diaries

856
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Was. Same director. So I asked that

857
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,519
why did you shoot with a hand handle

858
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,480
Complete? Hmm. So I said that so that he can know the crying

859
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,159
It should look like this and you should look like this

860
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
When you look at the audience, you feel that you are there

861
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,399
be with them and you will find out that their

862
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,240
Life is so unstable at this time

863
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,440
Because the life of all three would be very unstable.

864
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,760
Is. Now this story is the same that three

865
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,039
Story of friends and nothing after college

866
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,919
It can't happen. The one who has the sky is Rohan

867
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,919
He is not able to get a good job. translations translation

868
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
who hasn't cleared his government papers

869
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,440
They are doing it and he is waiting. home exactly

870
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,960
There are a lot of problems going on in his house.

871
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,320
I am here, I want to become an actor. My house

872
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,279
People have made me sit at my shop

873
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,200
Papa did. I want to become an actor. and now

874
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,640
What happens is that everything is great. Everything is there.

875
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
He is also skilled. I also know how to do the work.

876
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,399
You can also work hard. But not of the universe

877
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,720
Because of this, some things are not in place

878
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,120
It is happening. Right yes its not going in the right place. So

879
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,559
That is the story. and every person who goes through

880
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,159
Already happened. a man has passed away from this life

881
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
That friend I am not getting money, friend there is no work

882
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,440
It's okay friend. having problems in relationships

883
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,679
That is the story of a rogue and how we then

884
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,000
what happens to that thing

885
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,559
What doesn't happen, how does a new relationship mean your

886
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,480
to come back closer to my family

887
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,559
going away is everything in it so nice

888
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,559
It means both sad and happy and it also means funny

889
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,600
And it is funny, yes it still looks funny

890
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,840
It's a drama, it's a complete drama, it's an end

891
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,519
I have never done a drama like this before

892
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,519
This is my first time I guessed it inside me

893
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,080
I myself saw the acting potential

894
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,720
and because till now I have only done funny things

895
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,480
mostly because if I also know history

896
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,480
Yours has been funny. or should I say campus also

897
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,640
I am almost in it for seven to eight episodes, it's funny

898
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
This is all mine. then at the end a half

899
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,399
A little bit happened in the episode in which

900
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,760
Just took that. There is proper drama in it.

901
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,760
Within this you find yourself with the potential to

902
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,000
I saw it my friend, [ __ ] I did the right thing

903
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,399
Is. I liked this and so did I.

904
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,240
To be honest, I worked for both of them.

905
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,679
I have seen it and I have seen it myself as well.

906
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,519
Infact they were also saying the same thing that brother we

907
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,519
Looks like this is our best work yet

908
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,840
Is. I am not saying this just because a new show is coming

909
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,000
There is nothing. But this is what I want

910
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,240
Just let the world see it. That’s it, nothing else. One

911
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,240
Episode. Watch one episode and then decide.

912
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,679
Like watch one episode. I am telling you

913
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes, you will not stop after that. I

914
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,799
Ah it's coming on the sixth, right? this is on the sixth

915
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,159
It is coming. when will we release this episode

916
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,519
Are you letting us know? No. so whenever

917
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,000
Episode is releasing Main To I Will

918
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,320
Upload a story. I will watch the first episode.

919
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,399
Because I genuinely came and if five are free

920
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,640
So you come to Delhi for the premiere. I be

921
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,320
If I am not able to meet him then… Exchange Number End

922
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,480
we will see life has been a little crazy

923
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,120
Lately. But for sure. I would be very

924
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,399
Happy. I actually know this thing

925
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
wanted to know. You were saying that I

926
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,159
Maybe I saw you crying also. and you on

927
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,520
Can you cry command? don't cry on command

928
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,960
I can but I am interested in this scene of hers.

929
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,079
I also took that time for myself

930
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,520
There was a scene inside it

931
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,040
that there is no money and my health is bad

932
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
My. There is no money. What should I do? home at home

933
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,879
I cannot ask for money from him because with everyone

934
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,720
It happens once in a while. You should have informed your family before coming.

935
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,639
I will uproot it and come back. Now with what face are you

936
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,800
Will you ask for money from home? We were there at that time

937
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,000
I used to sit there at that time and eat vada pav.

938
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,520
When I am eating while crying then there is this inside

939
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,520
So I took my time, give me 15 minutes

940
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,359
It takes me 15 minutes to remember everything

941
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,200
Tell me what other trauma has happened to me

942
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,040
What makes me feel bad in my life

943
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,040
What is not there, whether it is trauma or not

944
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,320
That is my fight with my family members

945
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,079
Even if I have a fight with my girlfriend, I

946
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
I remembered Trauma, I just wanted tears

947
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,720
I put that trauma into this scene

948
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,880
ok yes then now you will say cry i will not

949
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,880
I will be able to cry, I need 15-20 minutes for that

950
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,280
to get into the scene

951
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Let's wait.

952
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,400
yes brother it's a crazy thing that that man

953
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,079
In what way do you transfer your emotions from here to there?

954
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,760
I took a workshop for this lafange

955
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,280
For. Rachit Singh is someone I have never liked

956
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,800
I did not take the workshop. So he became my Guru

957
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,280
That friend in acting because he taught me

958
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,520
Teach me the thing you have been doing 10

959
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,680
By eliminating it for years. that's you doing it

960
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,440
Give it a break. Don't do the same thing. So

961
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,200
That was the first thing he taught me

962
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,440
How can I not do what I've been doing

963
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,040
Am. Hmm. After that he used 10 methods

964
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,359
tell me how can I do this thing

965
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,359
Should I approach? what what how any scene

966
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,040
I have to do it, how should I do it? He helped a lot

967
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,440
My friend, you got me into trouble. is

968
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,680
There is one advice you can think of that will help you

969
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,760
Have you ever met me, you are like me bro. my friend

970
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,480
Mummy had said one thing and I will tell you that

971
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,040
I have also realized many times that anything in life

972
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,800
Do it, keep your feet on the ground and your head in the sky.

973
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,320
I just gave this advice. So in my opinion this is

974
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
This line is very touching to me.

975
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,240
Keeps you grounded. And what did you learn from uncle?

976
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,359
I learned this from my uncle

977
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,280
How is a 60 ml pack made? best best

978
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,280
Someone will teach you education or else you should learn it yourself

979
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,720
It will have to be Oh no friend, I didn't do anything like that

980
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,160
Is. I, my friend, told my father that I am Papa

981
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,480
I am very close to my friend and I love him a lot

982
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,720
I do it. But we never sit and talk

983
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,800
Buddy. That is what it means, it never belonged to us.

984
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,800
Now I don't know he is not from there

985
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Did. I don't even remember my dad

986
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,320
I would have done the right thing. Butt love is complete.

987
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
It's not that I don't love her. But

988
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,000
That harshness comes. Address a hardness

989
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,680
no why is it what is it. I don't know

990
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,240
It is with everyone. what is it i will tell you a

991
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,640
There is something very wonderful about this. So now

992
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Our 100th episode had come out. even a week

993
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,320
Has not happened. Are? One week he is my father

994
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,920
was with. So when Ansh told me that my

995
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,680
So generally he does all these bookings. Ansh said

996
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,440
I told bhaiya to do one episode with papa

997
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,200
Is. Those same tears came to my eyes. I do not tell

998
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,040
Can. in his cabin I'm saying bro

999
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,880
Why are you getting this done? Because brother me and

1000
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,079
Papa is a lot of fun and on a light level

1001
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,720
Let's take life. Now we are great and good

1002
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,359
I am friends. So we too imagine in front of papa

1003
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,160
Sitting and having a serious conversation is heart-wrenching.

1004
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,839
This is generally the case with boys. but to me

1005
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
I did not expect this conversation to be so

1006
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,920
She will do well. These are the comments coming below it

1007
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Are. Prakhar, you did what I had been waiting for so long

1008
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,720
wanted to do. and the boys secretly

1009
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,640
want to do. I asked my dad this

1010
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,800
Are you happy with my work? I am very happy.

1011
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,560
Hmm. There is one such point. I said papa

1012
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,240
Everything I do is to show you

1013
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,680
Let me see where the boy has gone. They

1014
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,560
Tears came while speaking. So people shed those tears

1015
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,000
Also see that toughness brother, isn't it such a thing?

1016
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey Harsh brother, this has to be done. Father

1017
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,560
So silently, one day I too will become a father.

1018
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,440
And our position will also become the same. Complete

1019
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,200
We are outside, alienated from the family

1020
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,160
have been. And our children talk to us openly.

1021
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
Can't even do it. I am not saying that

1022
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, I would hug you every day if I could go out. one day

1023
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
so friend your father must be so proud of you

1024
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,920
Bro. brother boy has won the world

1025
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,920
Getting up from Pitampura. This is acceptable. Buddy

1026
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
It is made. It definitely makes sense. definitely made

1027
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,520
Is. But we sit and play Ludo at night

1028
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,000
All the family members sit down. but never all this

1029
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,440
I did not talk about it friend, it's a family

1030
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
How interesting for a psychologist

1031
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,200
It is a case study. Let's play Ludo. What

If we don't give. They are saying to me

1035
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,839
There was money. It cost ₹500. I am from papa

1036
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,280
I fight. It cost 500 rupees. Put the money in.

1037
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,960
Good. This is proper. everything would have been

1038
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,880
Is. Everybody has fun. But that which is there is one

1039
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,200
Papa friend I love you. I can't say I love you.

By the way, dad will see this. but papa thank you so

1046
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,160
Much. Whatever you did in life, I know that

1047
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,160
he has done so much for us and now he himself

1048
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm going to an age that sometime in a few years

1049
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,720
Even if I become a father, I know that I am a man

1050
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,960
How he does everything. I know your family

1051
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,040
how much have you done for me and we wish

1052
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,520
We are not that close I want us to sit together

1053
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,359
I don't say I love you to others but I know you

1054
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,200
I love you very much I love you very much

1055
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,560
I love you. You know I'm for you

1056
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,839
I will do anything. I know you are for me

1057
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,680
You will do anything. And I love you papa. Let's

1058
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,760
Go. Let's go. Did. This was the moment. Crazy

1059
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,359
Bro. Thank you so much for doing that. Is

1060
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,040
No? How heavy is coffee for boys

1061
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,800
Speak this in your heart. very much very much

1062
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,800
Much friend. I had tears here too

1063
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
While sitting. My grandfather read that episode

1064
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
heard. I also came back yesterday so I

1065
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,920
Grandfather called me to him. They say

1066
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,000
I heard that from you. we say my

1067
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,839
Tears came to my eyes. So this is what

1068
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,079
We have to do this, only me and my dad

1069
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,680
No papa, grandfather is also with him. we are

1070
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,280
How many people would have felt this? Me

1071
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,800
I can't accept it. I also think that tomorrow

1072
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,160
I will become a father. That's the same thing as mine

1073
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,359
The kids are not feeling it. This is very correct

1074
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,920
You said it. We are also going. We are also like this

1075
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,599
You will get alienated that brother this person stays at home quietly

1076
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,520
Bears the weight of. Someone has their problems

1077
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,040
I don't tell. Ok? When anger erupts

1078
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,400
When he takes it out, he is seen drinking alcohol

1079
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,000
When one is seen drinking alcohol, this is what remains

1080
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,760
No. or because his individuality and

1081
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,520
This is not a good thing in our culture.

1082
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,520
Parents keep themselves second.

1083
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,280
This does not happen abroad. The Reason There

1084
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,200
childhood trauma because parents

1085
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,040
He still remains selfish. compete with the child

1086
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,720
He does. How is my daughter more beautiful than me?

1087
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,720
How is my son more successful than me? Our

1088
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,480
Parent says my child should name me

1089
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,160
The child will go ahead of me, yes he will go ahead of me

1090
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,680
A child of my age should realise that I am a money maker

1091
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,760
I will not eat I will not eat food I will not eat money

1092
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,880
I will put this on my child, an Indian

1093
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Culture has a unique specialty and strength

1094
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,960
And in that affair, parents turn 50 one day

1095
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,119
they rise up and say our children

1096
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,839
20-20 years old turned 25-25 years old

1097
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,160
I stopped living my life at the age of 35

1098
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,320
I don't even remember who we are or what we

1099
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,240
Identity is very important for a child

1100
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,079
Bring success to your parents and give them their identity

1101
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,400
give it back so that you live now i am watching

1102
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,240
hmm hmm and that fuzz makes me think you and

1103
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,720
Whether I want it or not, we are in that f

1104
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,000

1107
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,520
aquarius is right and so we are right at the

1108
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,119
Brother, this is a beautiful thing

1109
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,839
Look, he is crying, he is sitting on the side and crying

1110
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,280

1111
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:00,640
Son, where do you go for a walk?

1116
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,079
It is because Bhabhi trusts you, now listen to that

1117
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,760
This is the main thing, in which generation are you living

Ladke kholi kholi I love Thailand bhaiya si I

I tell everyone that everything is done the same way

1120

1122
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,000
I can also swear that in Thailand

1123

I didn't even touch a girl

1124
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,319

1125
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,839
That it was applied on anyone. brother that's mine

1126
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,079
There is no interest at all. no no thailand

1127
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,000
It's very beautiful brother. Thailand is like this to me

1128
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,280
I feel like I am a part of this country.

1129
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,960
I don't know why I feel something is mine

1130
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
I have an old relationship with Thailand. I am there

1131
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,119
There must be some [ __ ] who must have died. which now

1132
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,599
I want to go back there in this life.

1133
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,200
Damn respect. But that Thailand is next.

1134
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,440
Level tourism place. Next Level Tourizer

1135
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,920
There is complete freedom. I will do whatever you want me to do

1136
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,560
Whenever I go with you I am here

1137
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,400
Do you go? Fugate. I went everywhere. I am brother

1138
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,319
Chagma is not such a beautiful place in Thailand.

1139
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,760
Are you gone? No, I have never gone. you must go

1140
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,359
There. A Chengmai is a very lovely place. I

1141
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,200
It is not there on the edge of Malaysia

1142
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,760
I don't know these edges in Thailand

1143
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,640
There are some places in Thailand. my reason is there

1144
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
What is there to know, there are Indians there

1145
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,680
It is very little, isn't it? so very few recognize me

1146
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,040
There are people there. Because now I'm Fukase

1147
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,680
If I go here then I will go there also

1148
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,680
I need to put something somewhere

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,920

It has been kept. And my shoes are on fire. this is shubham

Who was Shubham? Who planted it? In these three

1162
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,000
Someone is walking by and I am lying down like this.

1163
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,319
I said please take my photo

1164
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,079
Please? This video is being made in my phone.

1165
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,480
Friend, you have brought the phone. Bring my phone.

1166
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,520
Bring the phone, let's pull it and make it work. These

1167
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,440
This brother, I miss him

1168
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,079
I am in India. Because from the inside I

1169
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,599
I am the same. I am like this from inside. I have this

1170
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,119
I love doing everything. but don't do this

1171
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,319
Can. I can't do it here. Both

1172
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,640
Can't do it. Can't do this work. Yes

1173
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,880
Can't do it. Any one of us means brother

1174
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,440
I was at a party. quite a lot of our

1175
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,760
there were such types of people there and one brother said no

1176
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,000
I lit a cigarette brother, I saw from the side

1177
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,160
We took out our cameras to take his photo.

1178
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,319
Two men accompanying him seized his camera

1179
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,319
Hey give me the camera, I deleted it right there

1180
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,000
I have done it so many times friend, now if I

1181
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,520
I am with my girlfriend, any video

1182
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,079
I have snatched the camera so many times now brother

1183
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,240
Privacy is something, you can take it from me

1184
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,119
take the photo oh friend you told me

1185
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,480
You did not say anything, I said it now my friend

1186
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,720
The partner does not want anything nor does anyone want him

1187
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
Record it, that's right, and this is so bad.

1188
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,240
You are recording a girl without

1189
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,400
Without any permission. So brother, I am the camera

1190
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,319
I will break it, even if my sister is there

1191
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,000
You are my mother too. That is correct bro. So

1192
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,280
I did that thing a lot. Now after that

1193
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,040
I may or may not feel root for him. And me

1194
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,319
I also talk to him so that I can stick to my habit

1195
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,599
It is like this. I tell you brother look and listen. I

1196
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,040
I'm sorry. I took away your camera.

1197
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,640
I deleted it. But you can ask me and get it

1198
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,160
Video. If you want to take the photo then ask me.

1199
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,160
I don't have any problem. I love you alone too

1200
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,000
Should I see you? Make a video like mine

1201
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,000
Is. But if I am with a family or

1202
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,480
Don't make it when I'm with someone. Anyone

1203
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,160
Not being famous or not doing anything for anyone.

1204
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,319
Right. video or or

1205
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,839
Right now apart from my phone, that Prakhar's laptop

1206
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,240
In

1207
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,400
This is internet, this is somewhere in the internet now

1208
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,400
didn't go

1209
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,720
Volume

1210
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,960
Kerio audio output is not coming

1211
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,079
Shivam Malik was also there with him

1212
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,200
Malik, that brother doesn't make videos

1213
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,839
well i didn't see it coming

1214
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,280
friend some jaat would say take a photo

1215
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:59,599
The voice is coming again saying to the friend

1216
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,880
Call him a Jat, just call your friend a Jat

1217
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:07,560
He calls his friend a Jat

1218
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,560
No, this Jat himself says he is feeling sleepy

1219
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:13,760
yes i am saying take my photo

1220
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,079
brother wild brother wild wild this is it

1221
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,680
It doesn't disturb the boys' trip

1222
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,359
That's why I love going to Thailand.

1223
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,119
that's why Aarush Laila is so hit because when

1224
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,960
He never talks about all these things on his trip

1225
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,280
I will show you I cannot show it like this

1226
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,800
There are so many things that I feel Aarush

1227
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,040
only Laila does that, I said this is what we

1228
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,040
Everyone does it, but we don’t show it

1229
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,160
we people we people in front of the camera yes brother you

1230
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,319
everything goes well but this one

1231
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,480
Boy is such an important part of life

1232
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,960
Isn't it brother, this is the type of monkeyism that we

1233
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,800
You can't hide it brother, if you are someone's

1234
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,240
You will talk to him in front of him, no matter how tough the person is

1235
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,400
He will say yes, so did we too

1236
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,040
College, these are those things. Everyone did it.

1237
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,480
now now and this is the reason now what is it not

1238
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,400
I like group trips

1239
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,000
Should I go with seven or eight people?

1240
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,920
I too feel like going to Amsterdam, Spain someday

1241
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,839
Should I go there etc also? But there for all these years

1242
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,599
The budget is never burdensome. Right. Ok.

1243
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
I tell them, brother, come on, let's go

1244
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,480
Take. Half of my friends are friends, this time there is no budget

1245
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,480
Is. I said brother where can you go?

1246
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,560
Max. Yes. It is called Goa. I said I

1247
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,400
I am in Goa, friend, you let me stay there. Moving to Thailand

1248
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,119
Are. Thailand is the closest. And

1249
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,720
Thailand is the most that. not much money

1250
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
It will take place. Right right right right. Budget Friendly

1251
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,359
It is very budget friendly. Just Me Thailand

1252
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,720
Get out, this is it. So, did you go to Bali? Bali

1253
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,800
Am. Bali is great. went with girlfriend

1254
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,359
Was. Yes Bali is a bit of couple tourism

1255
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,680
Is. Very beautiful. like had emerged then there

1256
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,720
But I'm not crazy about all this greenery etc.

1257
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,560
Is? How beautiful is Cafes brother. Top.

1258
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,400
I went there in 2016. Even then very

1259
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,319
It was beautiful. I haven't gone since then. Thailand

1260
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,599
I went there for the first time just last month. Good

1261
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,280
Is this your first time going? First Thailand

1262
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,359
Went. So what did you go there for?

1263
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,800
Were? came back two days before Sancre

1264
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,680
Was. I went to book my wedding venue

1265
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,040
Was. Good. Oh wow! Nice dude. so then now

1266
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,240
No, the question is where should bachelors go

1267
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,800
Is? bachelors are talking among boys

1268
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,720
Where to go? and brother we have the same problem

1269
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,240
Europe has been evaluated. Nobody's budget,

1270
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,400
Some don't have visa, some have so much

1271
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,920
No time for a long flight. boys of give and take

1272
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,000
Brother, they are saying this three days before the wedding

1273
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,599
We will go to Thailand only. This is exactly what happens.

1274
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,359
The local man leaves and says, come on brother

1275
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,880
I will go to Thailand to see it. now I saw it

1276
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,640
will go. And I just saw Thailand

1277
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,400
No. I just hotel hotel hotel 2 days

1278
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,160
Back. So I just started watching TV in Thailand

1279
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,839
It has been taken environmentally. I haven't turned around yet

1280
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,880
yes brother. I just have to travel around

1281
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,880
And I think it's getting very crazy

1282
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,720
Is. Brother Chengmai, if you want a piece,

1283
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
I want a good place, it looks a little like this

1284
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,000
I mean it depends on what you

1285
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,160
I want to do it with friends, where and how

1286
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,520
I have to go. Chengmai is very calm. More

1287
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
There is nothing to do. very slow life

1288
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,119
It is there. There are a couple of clubs. if there

1289
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,040
Do you want a slow life or a little

1290
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
If you want to roam around and see a good place then you should go to Chengmai

1291
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,280
One must definitely go there for a day or two. And

1292
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,880
Rest of Phuket is basically party friendly.

1293
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,800
Phuket is all about partying

1294
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,960
This is my first time in Phuket etc.

1295
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,040
It was believed. This time I am in Pataya for the first time

1296
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,640
Whatever happens, it happens. yes there it is

1297
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,680
This time I went there for the first time. so there

1298
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,440
I had a lot of fun with it too, friend. Got it. And

1299
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,720
It's always fun to sing songs, friend. first time

1300
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,240
I have heard the praise of. Mine was that Mohit's

1301
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,680
And I was having it too much this time

1302
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,599
That brother, now there is a song, let's go. I do not know its

1303
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,440
When will I get a chance to go later? Sokaran will happen

1304
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,880
No. for people that do not know songsan

1305
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,319
It is Holi there. it's holi there

1306
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,440
Pay. But brother, ice water falls there

1307
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,960
Buddy. Dude she is only good for one day

1308
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,040
Is. Those guys would have been making it for three days

1309
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,119
Are. They hit with the water gun. This much

1310
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,880
cold water so cold water i said a

1311
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,079
The day looks good. The next day courage

1312
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,319
Didn't it happen that brother got ready and went out?

1313
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,240
Used to be. Someone please wet it. This is the thing.

1314
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,599
There you will keep on saying no no no so many times

1315
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,880
This human being makes me wet. So much

1316
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,119
I will make it nine. We look at this

1317
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,800
Why Harsh Beniwa Love Thailand. well its

1318
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,079
That is the whole tour as well. I've taken a vlog loop. Yes

1319
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,480
Yes yes, I made it completely. I had made it myself

1320
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,839
But I haven't put it in yet. Good. Good

1321
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,359
Is this something around Songrun?

1322
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,839
Yes, this is the song, that's what I would say

1323
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,440
I was thinking that this song is for you let's go after this

1324
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:44,880
I do not know what this

1325
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:49,119
let's go hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

1326
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,280
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Looks like Bhabhi has woken up

1327
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,359
my phone is on now ok i

1328
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,839
Harsh wanted to know whether you have any girlfriend

1329
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,520
What have you learnt in life from which one?

1330
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,599
from my girlfriend because I have a lot of

1331
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,480
I have had many relationships, not three or four

1332
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,480
If you have lived here then you must have learnt something from everyone

1333
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,920
What did you learn from the current one, friend? Current

1334
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,440
This is what I learned from Vali

1335
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:16,160
Giving mental peace to your partner is a lot

1336
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,720
It is important. yes any like you can

1337
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,480
If you are in a relationship, you can make the other person

1338
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,599
How much mental peace are you giving me. So it is very

1339
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,000
It is important. give a lot of peace

1340
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:28,240
It is important. So this is what I learned

1341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,760
How do you present your partner to the person in front of you?

1342
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,480
When they come back tired after work or any

1343
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,880
If there is a problem then how can you give him peace of mind?

1344
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,559
You can see the person in front of you. Brother respect me

1345
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,480
I didn't think you would answer this.

1346
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,920
You answered this directly, respect this.

1347
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,079
But this piece is it gives you that piece.

1348
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,000
You grind them. Friend he to me

1349
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,680
and then I'm learning that

1350
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,520
How can I give it to him also? because to me it

1351
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,800
I am used to trouble. because it hurt me

1352
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,839
I am not used to it, friend. Boys don't do all this

1353
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,480
No friend. It means that they themselves

1354
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:03,440
May I get mental peace. Then he himself is the one who

1355
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,800
The girl wants that, she doesn't do that. So

1356
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,359
I know I'm very into this thing

1357
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,160
I am bad. Yes. And she corrects me.

1358
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,920
Good. She explains. Yes. and I say

1359
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,760
Friend, yes, I am such a bad man. that I

1360
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,200
I am. Yes. that I don't realize

1361
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,119
Would. And I keep looking at him sometimes

1362
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,720
I am, friend. Girl Girl Goddess Goddess Mother

1363
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,040
Mother, what a dirty man I am that I

1364
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,319
If I am harassing a girl like that then that thing

1365
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,680
and in spite of that if you mean

1366
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,680
According to me, everyone is in a relationship

1367
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,720
Things are off course but I feel like this

1368
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,880
that I'm a bit of a bastard who

1369
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,800
You bother me too much but now I don't want to do this

1370
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,480
I have learned a lot from this thing and also an edge

1371
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,160
it has happened and with time when you are in relationship

1372
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,839
If it happens to you, then you realize that you are every

1373
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,359
Do you learn something from a relationship?

1374
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,720
something happened in the past or it happens to you that you

1375
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,240
don't repeat it here so I am trying that

1376
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,680
that I'll correct the mistakes that I made in the past

1377
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,839
I won’t do it here. I am right in that thing

1378
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,920
I am done. But now I need a circle of

1379
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,319
I found out about the mistakes I make

1380
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,359
I am improving now. well i am not i am

1381
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,680
I never knew I was on YouTube

1382
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,960
Not at all. when you guys are especially torn

1383
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,720
Your generation of creators I have seen on YouTube

1384
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,319
I started catching up last year.

1385
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,359
Before that I was something special on YouTube

1386
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,200
I did not see it. so to me i don't know if

1387
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,839
This is public knowledge. but i really want to

1388
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,280
No for somebody who has been there for 10 years. hmm 10

1389
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,040
It's been years. I've been in this game for 10 years.

1390
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,400
What has been your lowest point in life?

1391
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,599
And how were your parents around that time?

1392
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,680
Man, what a support system he had around him?

1393
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:33,200
yaar the lowest point is not a point like that

1394
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,960
Was. I mean this thing about social media, friend

1395
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,960
It goes up and down all the time. not like that

1396
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,880
that means my first 2 years ago

1397
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,480
It was the lowest point. It has happened to me that

1398
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,640
For some time I don't understand it

1399
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,800
What content should I create? So I to him too

1400
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,559
I can consider it the lowest. Never leave team members

1401
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,960
If I had gone, that would have been my lowest point

1402
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,400
Something in life or personal relationships

1403
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,839
I am struggling so that is also my work

1404
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,520
If it affects me then that too at the lowest point

1405
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,280
If it happens then it is not that I have only one

1406
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,400
It was the lowest point and it hit me a lot

1407
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,480
If I did it then things went up and down and

1408
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,400
It's the case with me that I don't share

1409
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,760
My family knows those things till today

1410
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,720
what is my lowest point

1411
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,480
Whatever I am feeling at that time, sleep

1412
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,640
how do you do it when your partner is around

1413
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,920
Anything like down days come I talk

1414
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,559
I want to do this for our fans

1415
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,319
Nor can this time be with us or with them

1416
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,000
It's good that it shouldn't happen to him. I would like to talk to them

1417
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,200
I am trying. what do you do with that? I

1418
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,440
Let me tell you the truth I

1419
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,640
I talk to myself and I ignore

1420
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,800
I will do it. this is very big with me

1421
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,880
There is a problem. I am unable to share. My

1422
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,319
It feels like this is my defense mechanism

1423
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,839
guess that I feel like this

1424
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,760
If I tell my friends, it might not be a joke

1425
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,040
Fly it. That's correct. Ok. and it might be

1426
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,559
Let's blow it away, right? Maybe he might understand it also. Now

1427
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,640
I talk seriously with my friends a lot.

1428
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,440
I can do less. this was our conversation

1429
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,119
Are. Get it done, do it all. to the bare minimum

1430
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,559
It also happened that I told him

1431
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,720
You have given me this feeling brother

1432
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,960
Is. I went and did it. Otherwise he

1433
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,400
Just say something jokingly and take it as a joke

1434
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,559
Let's go and talk. So I think that too

1435
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,640
There is a different therapy. That is also a different therapy.

1436
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,680
Boys themselves have 10 things in their mind

1437
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,319
It must be going on. He also doesn't understand it

1438
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,839
How did he talk? So me and my

1439
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,720
Friends, I never talk to serious people

1440
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,760
Do. I sometimes tell my partner

1441
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,520
I told him that if this is the problem then it is up to me

1442
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,760
I also feel that I should tell the other person as well

1443
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,040
No, and I will get answers like this

1444
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,480
Are. Whether I tell my family or they

1445
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,240
to the one who will tell me nothing happened

1446
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,800
Will go. why are you taking tension, don't do this

1447
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,880
take it, don't take it. They are very commonly found

1448
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,480
That happens to everyone. Don't worry. Now!

1449
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
Nothing has finished yet. don't do that a little

1450
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,520
It has happened. So I think all this is me

1451
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,400
Talking to myself, I already know this thing

1452
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,240
Nothing has happened. So I think and I

1453
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,079
I think, okay, how can I overcome this thing?

1454
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,839
I will do it and I move towards her. Bus

1455
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,240
That's it. I don't share it much

1456
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,599
Thing. Meaning, I will just work and see. Yes

1457
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,119
just get the job done or i'll kill myself

1458
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,280
I will distract you at that point of time

1459
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,960
Pay. I will visit my friend, I am going on a trip

1460
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,880
I will go or something like this will happen. After that I

1461
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,640
I forget that thing that yes it is going on

1462
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
Is. Work or whatever. I think that the

1463
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,800
Yes, its okay. Somewhere, someone of mine

1464
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,559
There will be a problem or I am not consistent with my work

1465
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,040
or if I am having trouble with other things

1466
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,240
I work on that thing and it gets right

1467
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:03,040
She goes. This is the thing with me. Right? So

1468
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,040
That's why I don't share it with anyone.

1469
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,440
This is a very bad thing for me. according to me

1470
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,760
Should be done. Yes to some extent. or and

1471
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,440
I think of a boy if you if you

1472
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,680
You are a man's man. Isn't it? as are your own

1473
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,760
nothing, brother we are with the boys,

1474
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,839
There should be two or four such boy friends. They

1475
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,200
I mean it seems like it's a joke to me

1476
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,720
Will blow it away. It's not like they'll blow it away.

1477
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,960
yes, that is in the back of my mind

1478
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,960
I will first help you and then make fun of you

1479
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,040
yes it rains a lot and it rains a lot

1480
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,280
What happened is that first I told everyone the solution and then

1481
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,440
I am again the same joke from all years yes

1482
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,920
and you know what i'm okay with that because

1483
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,400
The essence of friendship is that both

1484
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,760
I slapped him from the side, yes this is us ourselves

1485
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,640
let's do this I was a friend of mine and I

1486
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,079
I will not take the name, you can Google it

1487
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,319
so what happened to him that his distant

1488
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,520
had a little friend

1489
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:54,640
but his girlfriend's and his like she

1490
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,319
Got pregnant. one minute, 1 minute, hey, everybody

1491
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,880
People please reverse and see how brother said it

1492
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:03,440
Is. his girlfriend and her nervousness,

1493
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,839
I am yes so now he is telling me that

1494
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,640
It happened. Brother, we tore his night apart

1495
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:11,680
Fill. We told his brother that brother you become a father

1496
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,680
Will go. Now, how are you and your family now?

1497
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,760
We will see what happens and what does not happen. They

1498
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,359
He is saying this and we are telling him more and more

1499
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,200
Brother, this is definitely a period

1500
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,000
It is a sign. o sorry pregnant sign

1501
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,839
Is. I am saying periods. a because what

1502
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,760
It happens not during your pregnancy and

1503
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,040
Symptoms of periods when periods are late

1504
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,440
and there are symptoms of pregnancy

1505
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,240
Yes, they are very similar. Ok? To you

1506
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,960
So you must know it.

1507
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:39,920
Brother, what do you know? So they would be very similar

1508
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,079
Are. Yes. So now his girlfriend was

1509
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,240
Her periods were late. Now we all

1510
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,920
I told her that it is early pregnancy, oh brother

1511
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,520
He is having trouble with this for sure

1512
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,680
She will be pregnant, this will be that, her night

1513
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,920
We kept it like this for the next day's test

1514
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,760
if I wasted nothing then this would have happened

1515
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,280
These boys, the doctor helped them in that too

1516
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,200
Brother, you guys did not help us at all

1517
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,599
So and he gave him that and gave him trauma that

1518
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,079
Brother-in-law, this is that, this is but now he never makes this mistake

1519
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,319
won't zoom out to see if that helps

1520
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,079
Friends told me here that you made a mistake

1521
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,760
Now I realise, friend, I can't accept that

1522
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,040
The boy should not make such a mistake again

1523
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,960
brother tell me what will happen to it, make it look like this

1524
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,000
I definitely want to see the scene on his head

1525
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,480
Who is this bastard boy

1526
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,160
Brother, tell him this is a very real thing

1527
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,000
Tell me, I am not afraid of pregnancy but of STDs.

1528
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,839
so afraid

1529
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,040
This is a very real thing but then multiple

1530
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,480
You didn't have a partner, brother. Now let's talk about it.

1531
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,480
I understand what you are saying, I have no interest in this

1532
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,680
I don't want to make sexual commentary for once

1533
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,839
It is said that I got a call from a friend of mine

1534
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,520
I came and stayed in the US, he says brother I

1535
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,760
I'm sitting here in the lab and I'm scared.

1536
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,000
I feel like something has happened to me brother that 5

1537
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,799
The seven minute phone conversation explained my meaning

1538
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,200
It disturbed me in my mind that the

1539
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:47,359
The risk of NS is over brother then now

1540
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,200
No one can become SD permanently

1541
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,440
There are some SDs which become latent

1542
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,960
They come back later but something like this

1543
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,520
those who remain are brothers aids weds

1544
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,520
It is a very risky matter brother, one should be afraid of it

1545
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,359
One must fear death and nothing else

1546
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,720
friend according to me i mean i am asking you

1547
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:03,599
I am here, maybe I have gained so much new knowledge

1548
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,599
yes but the partner is the same if

1549
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,760
So what is the risk, friend, look at the risk

1550
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,520
It is possible that this partner has never met someone before

1551
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,520
was with them and they were latent in it because

1552
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,720
Just like herpes, it is not visible then

1553
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,000
That's overall a little bit of attention that too

1554
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,760
There is a ghanorrhea in which I guess the female carries

1555
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,839
It just does not cause any side effects to females

1556
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,960
It does not happen but if boys do it then

1557
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,680
The condition becomes worse. I did not know that. it

1558
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,920
Peace and I new an AIDS. but there is gone

1559
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,760
React Media. and like wow, this is a

1560
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,440
Conversations to adult males should be having.

1561
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,200
so everybody else can learn bro because enough

1562
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,839
It's a risky thing. This house, this school thing

1563
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,680
do not do. These family members don't talk. So

1564
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,960
We should do this. Come to the podcast.

1565
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,040
Come to the podcast. We must speak

1566
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,280
Don't lose your senses in excitement. too long

1567
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,359
It's a journey, friends. Ok? Take some care.

1568
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,760
and resorting to plastic. how good

1569
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,520
We are influencers. give sex education

1570
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,640
have been. Brother is a positive influencer.

1571
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,000
This was our work. Why did we come to the internet

1572
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,799
Pay? Crazy. yes brother this with friends

1573
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,280
The thing is that I have two or three friends like this

1574
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:03,599
with whom I only have serious talks

1575
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,839
I do it. Those who don't know that at all.

1576
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,720
To abuse someone. You understand such boys

1577
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:10,480
Friends who are only serious talkers and

1578
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,400
Frankly, it's largely because of who I am

1579
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,839
I am from. I mean, when I have periods like this

1580
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,000
There is a friend of mine where

1581
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,280
The therapist is in the US. ever to me

1582
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,319
Psychologically it seems to me that it is not

1583
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,599
Know what to do. I was with him for two or three

1584
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,079
I talk to you on phone calls every day and you talk to me

1585
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,480
were with were were with were were with were with therapy

1586
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,040
does not. For them

1587
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:28,640
remembers different things and I listen

1588
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,319
Something. so i think it's a part share then

1589
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,760
friend, I want to do one more thing a little bit

1590
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,200
I just realized that you were talking about this

1591
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,440
I feel like sharing about

1592
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,440
if I talk more about this

1593
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,680
If she is travelling with me then I feel

1594
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,520
that's who I am, I am very careful about that

1595
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,200
I will become obsessive. Not obsessive means

1596
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,680
I don't want it to even come into my mind

1597
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,920
I run away from that thing, we are like this

1598
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,280
Maybe don't call me stupid, I am the same

1599
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,160
Call it a defense mechanism, call it anything. So

1600
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,839
I feel if I talk about a friend

1601
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,599
I will also talk to that thing, then that thing

1602
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,319
And this matter will keep revolving in my mind.

1603
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,319
So just leave it behind and move ahead.

1604
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:02,319
This is how I cope up. I don't know

1605
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,440
Is this my problem, mental or physical?

1606
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,640
should or should not I do that

1607
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,040
Address. I will tell you what is the answer?

1608
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,480
I have a nephew who has completed 12th

1609
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,599
It has just happened to him. Ok. His tomorrow to me

1610
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,200
A message came, this poor guy is gone. he said uncle

1611
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,640
I have had a breakup. my elder

1612
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,240
Dilvil is hurting. What shall I do? Real

1613
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,520
The thing is. Ok. I told him something what

1614
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,880
want to do it? Can't do anything. Now it is done

1615
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,799
brake up. Uncle is saying that he wants to cry so I

1616
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,319
He said, son, it is a canon event in everyone's life

1617
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,160
At a certain age, he comes and cries for a girl

1618
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,480
The man is saying uncle what should I do then

1619
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,359
I said just watch it till he is crying

1620
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,359
After that now transform yourself

1621
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,079
It's time to do this, we have to take this energy

1622
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,760
And going to the gym with this energy is like making a career

1623
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,920
Whatever you think is right is up to your parents

1624
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,079
he says he has to do that and then he remembers

1625
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,240
I said memories are just memories so you

1626
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,000
can't do anything and it actually happens

1627
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,480
Most of the injuries we suffer are our own

1628
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,760
By rechanneling the mindset to us,

1629
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,280
we had to make action it is no joke

1630
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,200
How many people started YouTube?

1631
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,799
Today Harsh is acting in different TV shows.

1632
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,640
So I can open the Amazon Mini TV. Oho

1633
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,599
Let me open mine. What happens? Chrome

1634
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,319
The one who stays there has a happy face on him. This way

1635
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,079
For some, brother, that is not a man's childhood

1636
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,200
It's the injury that's keeping him running even today. Otherwise

1637
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,760
Where does hard work come from? Ambition and Injury

1638
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,440
R Tide. And then if the matter is still pending after 2 years

1639
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,599
It did not go out of my mind. go to therapy again

1640
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,960
Talk to him later. Then remove it from your mind. My

1641
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,720
who thinks this is it. It is not necessary to talk

1642
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,040
to do. friend, it seems to me that our

1643
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,640
no ever middle class lower middle class

1644
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,119
No, these therapy talks are not there in homes with

1645
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,040
Has it ever happened? So we know when we found out

1646
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,200
This is when we had already become quite adults.

1647
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,160
So like our childhood was supposed to be shaped up

1648
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,920
No, that already happened. hmm anyone ever thought of that

1649
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,359
Things that should have been discussed with family members

1650
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,880
Never told me that anything like this happens.

1651
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,839
Even he might not know all this. yes them too

1652
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,319
Didn't know. yes they get all this right now

1653
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:45,359
I have found out these things about anxiety and depression

1654
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,960
I got to know about this after so much time. when someone

1655
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,960
When the actor did something then we got to see these things

1656
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,319
So many people on the term social media

1657
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,480
I found out. Nobody knew anything before that

1658
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,240
Was. This post is from 2010 Deepika Padukone

1659
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,160
Announcing She Has Depression Is Known

1660
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,839
To the people. even after that i still don't know

1661
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,440
Was. I am saying the same thing when an actor does something

1662
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,960
He does it, then after that people realize

1663
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,720
It happens. Good mental health is also something

1664
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,559
It happens to boys. This is also something that happens.

1665
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,240
Till then no one knew anything. So

1666
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,920
I feel like these things somewhere

1667
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,359
also that we tell our family members right now

1668
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,880
If we have kids, we will teach them, son

1669
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,720
If this thing is troubling you. From us

1670
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,640
Talk about it, do this, do that. our family members we

1671
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,799
If we were causing trouble we would get beaten up. if from them

1672
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,799
If I would have talked to you then we would have faced double trauma, yes double

1673
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:21,119
Trauma from inside and that trauma feels like trauma

1674
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:24,480
I didn't even have it at that time, so during my childhood

1675
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:27,119
Brother it was trauma, it felt like love, that love

1676
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,040
Now it seemed like if a child was crying

1677
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,400
If so, his family members slap him and make him cry

1678
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,799
Don't and he is already crying because of your beating

1679
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,839
yes that's not the solution yes then he would have killed me

1680
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:41,280
don't cry because you are crying now

1681
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:44,000
The child is thinking about what to do in this

1682
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,760
option left or option right then child

1683
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,079
He won't leave the matter and run away from anyone

1684
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,000
No. Yes right right right right right. So

1685
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,480
I feel like it was your childhood

1686
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,319
Shape up happens. you are the next one coming

1687
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,359
You are an adult, you do those things

1688
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,880
Yes you are. brother but I mean I had a very good

1689
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,319
Time talking to you. is there any question

1690
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,480
That's what you want to ask me. nothing in mind

1691
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,400
You might have left it. No friend, no, nothing. Yes

1692
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,200
I guess we said the right things. fun

1693
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,440
Came? Yes, yes. You see, this is therapy.

1694
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,799
All this should be shared with friends.

1695
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,160
whenever I feel something I will be yours

1696
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,480
