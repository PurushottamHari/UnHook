00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
This video was actually supposed to be released last week

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,240
but due to some small problem it got

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,720
delayed.  But now this video

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,719
is ready.  And I think this is the perfect video to leave behind all the negativity that has come in life.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,639

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,559
And if

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
you see negativity in the comments too, then I

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,880
learnt something from Samay Rahna's stream that to

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,279
block negative comments from the timeline,

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,600
you should hard spam.  My

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
heart will be happy.  And regarding the ANI video.  Right

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,279
now, we have privatized it as per the

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,519
order of Delhi High Court.  After re-

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,760
editing it will become public.  Don't worry.  Let's

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,800
focus on this video.  And I

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,040
really hope you enjoy this video.  There is

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
a saying in our country that if one is born poor, he will

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,840
die poor.  But this saying does

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,480
not make so much sense.  So I had a pair of jeans

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,039
and I used to wear it every day to college.

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,520
And I think it had been about a month and a half since the beginning of

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
college.  Those jeans of mine were so worn out that

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,320
one day, while I was sitting on a bike with my friend,

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
they got torn.  And after that

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,440
I could not go to college for a week

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
because I did not have any clothes.  If

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,760
you are born in a poor family then there is only

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,119
3% chance that you will be able to reach the top 20% of the society.  I will

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,360
repeat it back.  There is only a 3% chance

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,600
that you will come out of the bottom 20%.  The

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,840
situation here was very pathetic.

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,560
When we came to Nyay,

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,479
we could not even find proper things to eat and drink.

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
Now I will not say that brother, if you

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,479
work hard then you will

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,200
definitely be able to change your life.  Because honestly

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,439
many things in life decide

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,479
how your life will be in the future.  There are

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
controllables and then there are

40
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,960
uncontrollables.  But I also want to say

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,320
that you have absolutely no control over these uncontrollables.

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,200
So why not just focus

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,000
on this.  And in this video I want to

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
share the story of two people who have done this.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Many times when we

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,439
stand here in the balcony at night with Jagriti, I see

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
or I speak to her that friend, I had never

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
even imagined in my life that

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
I would be able to live in such a place.  From where do they

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
see the Pakka building?  From where do

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,560
we see so many things?

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
This was my personal motivation behind this video

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,120
because many people say that brother, you

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,520
only make negative things.  Which is

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,640
true in some way because negativity is easy to

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
sell.  And I wanted to fix that in this

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,400
video.  I just hope that

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,040
through this video you get inspired from the

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
two stories that I am about to tell you so that at

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,160
those moments when you are doubting yourself,

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,040
you should not think that friend, I too

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,280
can change my life, from the very beginning, as much as

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,200
I have heard from my mother, her life has been

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,519
tough from the beginning, ever since she got married,

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,680
she belongs to Ranchi, so Ranchi

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,920
is now the capital of Jharkhand, at that time

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
Ranchi used to be a small town in Bihar, so she

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,040
came to Khusro after getting married from Ranchi,

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,440
my dad was never that financially stable.

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,680
Initially he

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,599
did some work in studios etc.  Then after that the

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,319
work of that studio stopped.  So my

73
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,480
grandfather had his own coffee shop.  So he

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,000
did some work there but his

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
major work was not getting settled.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,040
And because he had some problems from the beginning,

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,360

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,200
he used to drink alcohol, play cards, gamble etc.  So

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,400
my mom was very worried about all those issues related to it.

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
So because of that she also pushes

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
you to leave this place because if you do

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
not leave this place then you will not be able to get out of these things.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
So leaving those things behind,

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
we shifted to Korba.  I think I was

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,000
two or three years old back then.  This is 35

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
year old Dalpreet who lives in Gurgaon today.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,040
He was born in a small town of Jharkhand,

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,200
Khusro, and then

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,000
shifted to Korba, a city in Chhattisgarh, to

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
stay with his relatives, and it was

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
only after coming to Korba that Dalpreet's problems started.

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,879
His father had a business of slippers and shoes.

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,959
But that much money was not being earned from that.

94
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,280
Along with this, the condition of the house is also

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,440
not good because it is completely a

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
raw courtyard.  There are just two

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,720
rooms in between and a washroom there too.  At that time there were three of us and

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
I did not have a sister.

99
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,840
I remember one time, maybe the rain was pouring very

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
heavily and my father was not at home

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,040
and a snake appeared in the house.  And

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,319
even the latch of our house wasn’t working properly.  So my mom

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,280
tied that latch with her scarf and

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,799
held me tightly like that and slept all night.

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,799
So that the snake does not come back inside.

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
Dad’s drinking problem was getting worse.

107
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,560
I don't remember when I was small

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,120
we got very little time with our dads

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,080
especially because mostly he would either

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,479
not come home at night

111
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,479
or even if he came, we would

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
not have much conversation and many times it would

113
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,720
happen that when I would be waiting for the bus at the bus stand,

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,639
my dad would be going home in front of me

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
because he would not have come the whole night

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
and when I would come back home from school,

117
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,440
he would be sleeping, so when I was

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
going to pick up my bus at 6-7 in the morning

119
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
then my mom would give me a one or two rupee

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
coin saying that there is an STD PCOs near the bus stand.  I had to

121
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
call dad there and tell him

122
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,759
that he was not at home the whole night.  And these

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,840
problems of alcohol and money

124
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
also came into Dalpreet's life.  I still remember that

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
when we were in school, once a month

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,440
a list was circulated to

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,000
all the teachers regarding which children's fees had

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,320
not been paid.  So almost my name was

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,880
in that list every month.  So every month

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
I was made to stand and was told that Dilpreet,

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,199
your fees have not arrived.  Papa got

132
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,919
addicted to alcohol, due to which his school also got

133
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
affected and more than that at home, there is

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160
probably no festival in our family

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,600
that is celebrated without there being a fight, be it

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,479
Diwali or Holi, there was always chaos about why do you

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,039
drink alcohol, this or that. There came a point

138
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,520
when I was playing outside the house and

139
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,320
when I reached home in the evening, all the doors of my house were

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,919
locked, so I was knocking, Mummy

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,919
open the gate, Mummy open the gate, Mummy was not opening the gate,

142
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
my sister was very young at that time, I

143
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
think, if I was in class three-four, it

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
means my sister must have been three-four years old.

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,320
So when I opened the window I saw that

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,960
my mom had hung her scarf on the fan

147
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,560
and had made a noose out of it and a

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,680
chair was placed there and she was trying to climb on it.

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,440
And I screamed a lot from there.

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Mummy stop, Mummy stop, Mummy stop.

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,759
What is this you are doing?  What are you doing?

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,840
And my sister was very small, three-four years old.

153
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,400
And my mother told my sister to stand up and say that

154
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
first I will hang him and then I will

155
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,919
hang myself.  And she was in depression.  I don't know

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,199
how much he realized that she was doing this.

157
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,080

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
And I was shouting a lot and my mom,

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,479
my sister were saying from there, brother you go,

160
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,160
brother you go and some how, I don't know,

161
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,479
maybe I reached at that point of time,

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,080
I was shouting so much

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,160
at that point of time, I

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,759
knocked the door,

165
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,319
finally just before doing that, my mom

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,680
realized that suddenly I don't know what

167
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,199
happened to her, she saw me and she opened the

168
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,319
door,

169
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,600
I am probably the most grateful for the thing that if

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,240

171
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,479
I had not reached at that minute then today our

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
life would have been different.  So I have seen my mom

173
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,520
till that point of time also.  Just

174
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,280
because of these reasons which we saw in our childhood.

175
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,160
 

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
Thank you so much.   By the time he

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,199
reached eighth class, he had

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,599
seen so many things in life that one thing had got imprinted in his mind.

179
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,599
I wouldn't have thought that I had

180
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,599
matured so much in the seventh year.  But

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,280
I realised that if something is

182
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
not right in life then only through studies

183
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
something can be made right.  Education is the

184
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
only thing which you can do which was in my hands.

185
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,199
And apart from that, he couldn't do anything else.

186
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,160
So from 7th A, my

187
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,400
focus on studies increased a bit.  I remember that

188
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
I got good marks in 10th.  In 11th class,

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,360
Dalpreet asked his father to

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,599
send him to Bhilai where he

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
could start his IIT coaching.  On the other hand, Dalpreet

192
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,520
took admission in a school and

193
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,440
started living in the hostel.  So when the 11th class final came,

194
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
I was so disturbed that

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,800
I had got decent marks in 10th.  But

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,360
I got compartment in 11th.  That means

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,720
I got supplementary in one subject.  And when

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,240
I came back home, my mom

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,759
told me that my

200
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
father had sold my mom's mangalsutra because he was

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,680
unable to pay the fees, as he had paid the fees by taking

202
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
all the fees on loan, so finally to

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
pay off the loan, my mom had to

204
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
sell her necklace, then I decided

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
that I will come back, I will not continue my

206
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
studies in Ilai because my father was unable to

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
afford college, so let's say it was

208
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
a dream for Dalpreet because he

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,960
knew that he did not have the money for

210
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,080
college, but life had

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,919
some other plans for him.  By luck

212
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,880
you can know that in the same year a new

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,880
engineering college was opened in Korba itself and the

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
college fees of others in Bhilai etc. was

215
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,080
almost Rs. 1 to ₹ lakh per year.  Its total cost for

216
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
four years was ₹1 lakh.  So Dalpreet

217
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
went to the college and talked to the principal to

218
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
somehow get admission.  So finally the

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
principal made a few phone calls.

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
He checked whether the final list of the college has been

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
submitted?  And if that did not happen then he

222
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,640
said, ok, last minute we will add you

223
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
in the list but you will

224
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,360
have to make a demand draft of ₹2000 and give it right away.

225
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,800
We talked and went out.  Coming out, my

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
dad looks at me and asks,

227
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,360
from where should I get ₹00?  Papa did

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,279
not have any money.  But mummy actually had

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,760
some money left which she had

230
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,000
actually hidden for the wedding of Dalpreet's sister.

231
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,040
But he said, son,

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,680
take this money and go and study.  But just

233
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,240
a month after admission, Dalpreet had to face another problem.

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,200
So I had a pair of jeans

235
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,760
and I used to wear it every day to college

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
and I think it had been just one and a half months since I started

237
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,320
college.  Those jeans of mine were so worn out that

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,200
one day, while I was sitting on a bike with my friend,

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,640
they got torn and after that,

240
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I could not go to college for a week because

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,760
I did not have any clothes to wear.

242
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
And after that he took an important

243
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,760
decision.  When that incident happened then I

244
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,800
realised that this thing will never end like this.

245
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,519
And then I thought that I will

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,920
start teaching tuitions.  Now while Dalpreet was

247
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,160

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,279
solving his father's alcohol problem and financial problems at home,

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,480
our second character, 55-

250
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,800
year-old Anita Devi from Bihar was fighting her own battle.

251
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:15,320
My birthplace is Nirpur, a village which is

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,320
near Nalanda.

253
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:25,519
[MUSIC]

254
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,560
I was born in 1970.

255
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,680
Our father was a teacher.  His training was going on.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,880
So people went there to bring bubbles.

257
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Anita Devi had a fine childhood.   There were

258
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,079
some difficulties but his parents

259
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,040
always protected him from every problem.

260
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,519
But sometimes this protection

261
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,480
becomes too much.  To such an extent that he did

262
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,279
not get a chance to move forward.

263
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,360
This is a daughter in the name of a daughter.  I can't go anywhere.

264
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,920

265
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,760
Keep it limited to this.  Tie your feet and keep them in the legs.  This

266
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
 

267
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,200
was the situation.  So we should get good education which we did

268
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,839
not get.  She got married immediately after completing her graduation in Home Science.

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,720
But

270
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,440
after their marriage their life changed completely.

271
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,279
Before marriage, we were growing up in a good family.

272
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
But when I got

273
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,560
married in a farmer's family, I

274
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,120
felt that I wish I was brought up in a very good

275
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,120
home, but the

276
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,120
problems that I faced after coming here, were very

277
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,360
painful at that time.  Whenever I saw anything I

278
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,200
felt that it was strange.

279
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:41,600
Where did we come to?  Got stuck.  She had to face all kinds of problems in her in-laws' house.   What are

280
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,600

281
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,200
you remembering and feeling sad?

282
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
Anita ji, tell me about this, what are you thinking

283
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
and what are you remembering, what

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,360
I saw there, I could not find anything there, the

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,680

286
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,000
situation there was very pathetic,

287
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,839
when we came, we could

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
not even find proper things to eat and drink, there was a

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,200
lot of taunting in the family, we were

290
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,680
unable to tolerate it for every thing, we had to live with it

291
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,320
sip by sip

292
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,560
and we thought that what should we do now,

293
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,600
as if we are trapped in a trap,

294
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,720
how should we get

295
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,360
out of it, Anita Devi's husband used to

296
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,160
live in a big joint family of 15 people.  Where everyone was

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,839
involved in farming.  Now three people used to earn

298
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:51,680
but after the expenses of 15 people,

299
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,680
only ₹ 15,000 could be saved by the end of the month.

300
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,560
And meanwhile, a rider was eating them from inside.  She used to do

301
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,600
housework all day long

302
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,399
and the children had become a couple of years old.  So we

303
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,120
thought, what should we do?  It cost us ₹2

304
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,120
because the kids would ask us for money.  I will

305
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
not ask for money from the family.  And she

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
decided that right now I will try and

307
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,120
show you something.  For this we used to work hard and

308
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,519
sew at night.  He used to be asleep and when he got up, he used to

309
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,680
get very angry and say,

310
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,480
hey brother, you have nothing to do with life.

311
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,200
We thought that my child would ask us for money.  He will

312
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,680
not ask you.  If he

313
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
asks you once and asks us 10 times, then we will have to

314
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,200
work hard.  So we did the

315
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,040
sewing with the help of a lantern and a needle.

316
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
Now her husband supported her for this thing

317
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,480
but other family members

318
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,720
taunted her.  When people came to us for that also,

319
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
our mother-in-law used to speak a lot.

320
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,920
Hey, everyone would have come and taught me a few things.  Hey,

321
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,920
what will you teach us, we are not fools.

322
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,560
We are worried about how to run our household and family.

323
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,440
Now she would listen with one ear and let it

324
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,920
out from the other.  But one day this limit was crossed.

325
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
After some time, due to all these problems,

326
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,040
I got depressed.  I could

327
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,440
not sleep for 15 days and when I could not sleep, I

328
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,600
wondered what should I do now and whom should I tell. I used to

329
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,279

330
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,320
spend my time crying secretly.  Then I

331
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,720
felt that I quickly overpowered

332
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,120
him.  My sleep completely went away.

333
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,079
Even during her depression, only

334
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,800
one person supported Anita ji.  Then

335
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,120
one day, it seemed as if a volcano

336
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,519
erupted inside her husband.  In this sequence, one day I got angry.

337
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,320
We are talking a lot.  At

338
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,040
that time, we let go of the faith that we had within us. Whatever has to happen to you, I have

339
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,120

340
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,199
fulfilled my duty a lot but you did not

341
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
console me on that, so today I will tell you whatever is

342
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,160
in my mind. After which she

343
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,480
left the house with her husband and children

344
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,639
and she took her own house on rent,

345
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
even after this she did not get peace because

346
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,959
depression does not go away easily, so I

347
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,600
left the house thinking that I would not be able to live with them anymore,

348
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,839
I took a camp and

349
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
started living in it, but at that time I was totally

350
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,240
ruined that I was not able to sleep.  She used to

351
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,240
remain restless.  I also used to think that if

352
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
something happens to me in the future, my family will be

353
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
torn apart.  Every child will be ruined.

354
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,839
Anita ji continued fighting her depression for five to six months in the new house.

355
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,160
She

356
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,519
also went to her parents but nothing more

357
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,399
happened.  But one day things changed.  When

358
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,000
some women from Jeevika group of Bihar

359
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,320
came to Anita.  These Jeevika Didi are

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,279
the women in the villages of Bihar who, through a government

361
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,839
scheme, teach women

362
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,079
how they can stand on their own feet and

363
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,800
these women gave a suggestion to Anita ji.

364
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,839
So, when he used to get upset,

365
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,440
in the same sequence some sisters came to us and said

366
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,040
that let's go for a walk, if my mind gets refreshed from here then it's

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,600
okay, these women wanted to take him to Ranchi

368
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,320
where an agricultural

369
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,639
workshop was being held and his life was being developed in this workshop,

370
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
 

371
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,199
now at this time both the characters of our story are

372
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,560
using it in their life

373
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,120
and at this moment they decide that they will have to take

374
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,240
a leap of faith.  They will

375
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,639
have to take a leap.  And Dalpreet takes this leap

376
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
in his first year of college.   I

377
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,920
understood this thing that money

378
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,839
holds its value.  They say

379
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,279
that okay money can't buy everything.  But

380
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,959
you need money.

381
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,440
So when I was in the first year of college,

382
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,440
I started teaching tuitions and my

383
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
first tuition fee, I think, was ₹500.

384
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,360
Now gradually more

385
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,079
students come to Dalpreet and

386
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,720
gradually he starts earning more money.

387
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,720
A year later, when Dalpreet is in the second year,

388
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,839
he starts giving tuition to first year students of the college.

389
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759

390
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,920
So at that point of time he started

391
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
earning more than my father in the second year.

392
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
Now giving tuition will be a very small thing for you.

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,880
But not for Dalpreet.

394
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,839
Because his father was earning ₹5,000 per

395
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,560
month.  And with these tuitions, Dalpreet was

396
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,559
able to support himself and his family.

397
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,799
At that time when I was teaching tuitions, I

398
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,120
tried to save some money and get the

399
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,360
house repaired a bit.  So get the house

400
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,600
painted, get some furniture changed, etc.

401
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 

402
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,240
And friend, because of this money,

403
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,679
Dalpreet bought something for himself for the first time in his life.

404
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
He spent ₹4000 on shoes

405
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,039
and he bought makeup and clothes for his sister.

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,840
Which might be a very small thing for me or for you.

407
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,080
But

408
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,120
not for Dalpreet.  In college, Dalpreet

409
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,160
realized that he could earn ₹00 a month.

410
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,320
Earning ₹00 every month was like

411
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
a dream for his family.  So Dalpreet

412
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
started thinking what should be the next step

413
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,480
?  Some people suggested that I should take

414
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,480
competitive exams.  But Dalpreet did

415
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,679
not want to do this because government

416
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,760
jobs require both money and time for

417
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
coaching and even then success is

418
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,840
not guaranteed.  So Dalpreet decided

419
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
that he would do something different.  After

420
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
doing NPTI, there is a college called National Power Training

421
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,840
Institute, these people provide training for

422
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
thermal power plant and they also

423
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
provide MBA.  So they have a college in Nagpur

424
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
which provides training for thermal power plant.  I

425
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360

426
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,840
completed my engineering in 2012.  After that

427
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,559
I had a gap of one year.  Then in 2012 itself

428
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,640
I came to know about NPTI College.

429
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,000
Firstly, it

430
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,520
offered special courses and secondly the

431
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
placements there were good.  I just knew it.

432
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Apart from IMS, if there was any guarantee

433
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
of getting a job, it would be available in NPTI.

434
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
Because Dalpreet was tutoring school and

435
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,960
engineering college students.

436
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,440
He had the confidence

437
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,240
that he can definitely write a good exam

438
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,080
and he will pass the entrance exam of NPTI.

439
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,480
But the problem was not with his skills.  The

440
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
problem was of money because ₹ lakhs had to be paid for

441
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,960
preparation of the course.  So

442
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,720
Dalpreet went to the banks to

443
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,799
get a loan.  Those people who say that

444
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
our shoes got worn out by visiting banks so much, that had

445
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,200
happened to me, so I went to each and every bank that

446
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,960
I could see on the road, Bank

447
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Dena Bank, ICICI, Axis Bank of Boda,

448
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,400
I went to all the banks.  I was refused by all the banks.

449
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
All the banks

450
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,880
rejected his application because there was no

451
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,080
collateral.  So someone

452
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,880
told Dalpreet that maybe he would go to SBI

453
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
and say that he is desperate.  So who

454
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,000
knows he might take pity on him and give him an education loan.

455
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,720
Then I reached the bank manager.  I was

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
literally, I mean, I lay down in his cabin

457
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
and said that if you do

458
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,000
not give me the loan, I will not be able to study further.  The

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
responsibility for this will be on you.   The

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,559
SBI manager accepted his application

461
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,610
and then Dalpreet got admission

462
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,480

463
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:35,360
 

464
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,840
in MBA course [Music] of MPTI.  Dalpreet worked hard and his hard work paid off.

465
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,280
So when he

466
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,679
got a job in a startup Azure Power with a salary of Rs 27,000,

467
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,000
he felt that he had now

468
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,840
climbed the ladder of life.  Now this was

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,480
not a lot of money, but Dalpreet was

470
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,039
confident that he could gradually increase his income

471
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,280
level.  But he also came to know

472
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,120
that his potentials were not being utilized in this company.

473
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,600
He will have to make a change

474
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,799
in his career.  When I got that job, I still

475
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,480
remember that for the first 6 months I was

476
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,840
just doing photocopies in that job.

477
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,919
And I got really frustrated.  But during those six

478
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,919
months I was not doing anything of my own.

479
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,080
Like if any report comes then

480
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,400
I will do some analysis of it and

481
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,559
send it to my management.  So my

482
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
presentation skills were a little good.  He kept

483
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,679
sending such presentations to senior managers

484
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,080
but did not get any response.  So after 6 months,

485
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
Dalat quit his job.  The reason was

486
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,200
very simple.  He had a huge education loan on his head.

487
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,200
He was doing photocopying at his job.

488
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
This meant he was

489
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,240
n't going to make much money.  So if he has to repay the loan

490
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,600
he will have to take a new job.  So Dalpreet

491
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,120
submitted several applications

492
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:48,320
and got a job.  It had been

493
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,240
only two days since he started the new job when suddenly

494
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,640
Dalpreet received a call.

495
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,440
A call from HR at his old company.

496
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
HR told Dalpreet that their

497
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
CEO wants to talk to him.  I was a bit

498
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
scared at that time.  I said, friend, I

499
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,559
was a management trainee there.  I asked

500
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,799
what does the CEO there want to talk to me about.

501
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:12,240
So I said, okay, you let me talk to him.

502
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,919
Then I got connected and the IP there made

503
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
me talk on the phone.  He asked

504
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,240
why Dalpreet left his job?  I

505
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,159
said sir there was no work in your company.

506
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
So he says, friend, here I

507
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,760
get people to work and they leave me and go away.   If

508
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
your work is not done then come back.

509
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Dalpreet was very surprised.  But

510
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,919
he said, okay let's try.  He

511
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,799
went to his old HR and the HR

512
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,320
told him that this is a blank paper and he should

513
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,080
write the CTC he wants.  Now I know

514
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,080
this might sound like a film script to you

515
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,440
but this is not.  This is

516
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,880
actually Dalpreet's life.  Dalpreet said please

517
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,200
match my new CTC which is Rs 4 to 4.5

518
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,919
lakh.  I think after listening to Dalpreet's story,

519
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,640
I realised that he

520
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,640
could have written any number like 10-15 lakh.  But he himself is

521
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,880
CTC because if he works hard

522
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
then his CTC will increase automatically.  And

523
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
this was the logic.  Meaning, I would work there day and

524
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,480
night.  I used to

525
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
go to office around 10:00 in the morning and

526
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,919
come back around 2-3 in the night.  Till the last person is sitting in the office,

527
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,240
I am sitting.  I

528
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,559
started taking work from all of them.   There is something to

529
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
learn in the company.  In this manner.

530
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,200
And I think I got into the notice of the

531
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,760
management.  And within a year,

532
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,159
my increment was more than

533
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,159
300% of the increment.  And friend, there are

534
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,480
many moments in life which suddenly give you a lot of

535
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,880
self-confidence.  Like that

536
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,360
moment in my life was when I got my first job

537
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
after college with Poverty Action Lab,

538
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,000
whose application process is very

539
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,480
competitive.  And I was not sure whether

540
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,799
I would ever get such a job or not.  But I

541
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,919
got the job and then I worked in Bihar for

542
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,320
one year.  That moment happened with Dalpreet when

543
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,799
he got this CTC when his self-

544
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,360
confidence and belief in himself

545
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,320
reached its peak.  Dalpreet did

546
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,640
not come from any fancy college like IIT.

547
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
His engineering background was very normal.

548
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,000
So whatever he achieved, he

549
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,400
did it through his hard work, dedication and hustle.  But

550
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,960
for such turning points, your hard work is

551
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,520
important.  But you also need someone

552
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,600
who supports you.  Just like Darpat got support

553
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,400
from the SBI bank manager

554
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,600
who sanctioned her loan and the CEO

555
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,799
also helped her, Anita

556
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,679
Devi also

557
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:30,159
got similar support.  It is the year 2010 and Anita Devi is

558
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,120
going to Ranchi to attend an agricultural workshop.

559
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,840
This workshop was about a crop that

560
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,880
many Biharis were

561
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,880
not aware of at that time.  The mushroom that

562
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,600
lives in wheat straw sister.

563
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,080
Seeds are added to it.  It is then

564
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,159
packed in plastic.  Make holes.  Then

565
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,320
keep it for 18 days.  After that a

566
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,320
seed like Ujav remains in it.  It happens like this

567
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,240
in bags.  But Anita Devi had

568
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,400
some idea about it as

569
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,559
she had heard about it in her childhood.

570
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
So during this workshop Anita

571
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,159
Devi focused fully

572
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,240
[music]

573
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,120
that who knows she might get an opportunity from here

574
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,559
and we learnt everything there.

575
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,039
When she came home, after this workshop Anita

576
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,080
Devi went to her husband and she

577
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,880
demanded one thing, we ourselves

578
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,440
mentioned in passing that we have seen mushrooms and we will

579
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,520
send them but there was a problem,

580
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,600
you need an indoor space for mushrooms, but there was

581
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,679
no room in her house where she

582
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,840
could do mushroom farming.  So she

583
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,220
decided she would go to her mother-in-law's house

584
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,289
where there was an extra room

585
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,289
[music].  My

586
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,440
mother in law was there at that time and she would get very

587
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,679
angry and would stop me from doing anything, but after

588
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,559
listening to this she would ignore the matter and throw me out of the house.

589
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,799
Although she used to live in the market

590
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,960
and came here to work she thought that she would work only when there was space.

591
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,840
First we

592
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,910
will learn it and then we will move forward.

593
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,910
[Music]

594
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,240
Then he got another news that another

595
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,880
mushroom workshop was being organised not in Bihar

596
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
but in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand.  So

597
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
when the news about your training came up,

598
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,799
my morale got boosted.  This is the thing we are

599
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,120
looking for, how can we get the complete information.

600
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,240
Then I felt that this journey would be

601
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,880
good for me and I would learn something while going back.

602
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,360
After 15 days of training, there was

603
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,080
an excitement and energy in Anita ji's body that

604
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,039
now brother is going to change something.  Anita Devi's

605
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,039
husband also went with her and both of them

606
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,600
started mushroom farming.  The two

607
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,480
used whatever money they had left and

608
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,360
also took bank loans so that they could buy land

609
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,960
and build three rooms to grow mushrooms.

610
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,600
But suddenly he realised that nothing can be achieved with just

611
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,880
energy and knowledge.  Many

612
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,880
problems arise in such things.

613
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,440
A lot of problems arose in this too.  Bag of mushrooms

614
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,880
as soon as they put in time.  There was no experience.

615
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,919
Three to three bags of dodah would rot.  If it had rotted then

616
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,720
leave it brother, if it had rotted then check after that.

617
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,279
But she would make a mistake and learn from that mistake.  Then she would

618
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,520
make another mistake and learn from that mistake.  We kept

619
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,480
trying to see

620
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,559
how this would happen in which season and at what temperature.  We also

621
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,279
rotted a lot of spawn too.  A lot of

622
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,120
bags of mushrooms are loaded with copies.  We did not drive behind this car, just to

623
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,679
avoid feeling like this.

624
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,720
Yes, there is more work tomorrow.  You see, something has just

625
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,000
happened.  By doing this he improved farming so much.

626
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,080
Meaning, he did not let his courage lag behind.

627
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,799
He continued doing that work.  And

628
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,360
suddenly she was earning so much money that

629
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,000
three other members of her family were not earning.

630
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,080
Look at the combine and her passion, she was

631
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
not satisfied with this thing.  His ambition was

632
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,360
even greater.  Now I thought, oh my god, it's

633
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,919
₹500 for fasting.  Then we proceeded further and

634
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,320
gradually moved forward in this same sequence.

635
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,450
Seeing him many people started coming to him and saying

636
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,480
teach us also how to do this.

637
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:04,000
[Music]

638
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,080
He also received the Jagjivan Ram Abhinav Kisan Award in 2014.

639
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Due to which he got ₹ 1

640
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,320
lakh which he invested in his farm.

641
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,799
I will hit the bat.

642
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,240
Hey, I felt that there

643
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,919
is some potential in this work and it should be promoted.  As soon as we

644
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,060
got ₹1 lakh, we immediately set up a hub

645
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,240
and then it started mushrooming

646
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,240
[music].

647
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,880
Now his income increased further.  Slowly,

648
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,760
slowly it kept on generating and kept on increasing.

649
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,679
And suddenly, a woman who was unhappy, lost and

650
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,240
depressed became a successful

651
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,799
entrepreneur in her village.

652
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,480
Dalpreet grew from a frustrated employee to an

653
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,760
accomplished professional and Anita Devi

654
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,679
from a homemaker to a famous entrepreneur. But

655
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,480
the crazy thing about success and confidence is

656
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,120
that they compound, so

657
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,720
once you achieve success, it is not

658
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,720
that difficult to achieve exponential growth.

659
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,760
After spending several years at Azure Power,

660
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,840
Dalpreet started looking at bigger

661
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,880
opportunities. Today he works at Total Energy

662
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,520
and his monthly tax bill is

663
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,840
more than his father's annual income.

664
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,960
Another good thing is that Dalpreet's father has

665
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,360
now stopped drinking alcohol and

666
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,919
now runs a chemist shop in Korba.

667
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,000
Whereas Dalpreet lives in a posh locality of Gurgaon

668
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,000
with his wife.

669
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:34,679
Balcony The View From The Balcony.  It feels quite nice to

670
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,679
stand here and watch from here at times.   I

671
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,480
never thought that I would be able to live here.

672
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,159
Dalpreet says that when he was young

673
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,559
he did not want to bring his friends home

674
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,200
because the paint was peeling off the walls.

675
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,080

676
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,640
He would feel embarrassed if the furniture was broken.  And same Dalpreet is

677
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,760
now so happy because he can now buy this house.

678
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,399
And I think we are following Mohak

679
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,039
Mangal's channel for very long and I really

680
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,240
like associating with him.  I think if

681
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,279
it were not for Mohak's channel, I would

682
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,080
hardly have shared this story with anyone.  But

683
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,240
I am very grateful that

684
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,240
I am able to share such a story with such a genuine channel.

685
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Dalpreet also has a very impressive

686
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,919
sneaker collection which was once a

687
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,880
dream of his.  But apart from the sneakers,

688
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,120
Dalpreet has the memories he has

689
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,919
created.  That is what it is for.  I still

690
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,640
remember I bought my first car in 2018 and

691
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,080
when I was driving that first car, I was

692
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,679
literally crying at that moment because

693
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,760
I had never imagined that I would be

694
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
able to sit in the driving seat of a car.

695
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,159
But what Dalpreet learned was that through education and

696
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
hard work he could change his life.

697
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,480
He wants to teach the same thing to his sister also.

698
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,240
And at the same time my

699
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,000
sister also got admitted.  I paid his first

700
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,480
semester's fees from my tuition fees.

701
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,720
Then we arranged for his education loan also.

702
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,960
He also completed his entire studies through education

703
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,840
loan.  When he passed engineering,

704
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,279
my mom and dad said that we should get Shikh a job

705
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,360
in some bank here.   The

706
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,760
clerk will do the job of clerk comfortably here

707
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,200
and will stay with us.  I told you that

708
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,880
nothing is doing.  You will not keep the Sikh there.

709
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,640
You keep Shikha with me.  I

710
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,880

711
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,880
got him an internship in the company where I was working.  He

712
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,919
worked very hard for two-three months as an intern

713
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,279
and my company got him a job offer and

714
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,360
after that both of us

715
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,960
started earning good money.  Now two people in the family are

716
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,600
earning quite well.  Because of which he

717
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,600
took his family on a vacation.  I

718
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,760
remember that since my childhood I never went out for a walk.

719
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,440
After some time we

720
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,600
went to Nainital for a trip.

721
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,520
When we were sitting in Nainital, my

722
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,520
mom told me one thing, this is the

723
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,960
first day after your grandmother's death that I am

724
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,960
sitting comfortably and eating food.  Otherwise

725
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,200
nobody has served me food.  I always have to

726
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,360
serve everyone first.  Everybody has to be fed.

727
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,919
After that I sit and

728
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,279
eat by myself.  I think these are the small moments

729
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,679
which make you realize that you have earned something

730
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,520
in your life.  Anita Devi also

731
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,520
did something similar but in a very different industry.

732
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
 

733
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:12,480
[Music]

734
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,320
She and her husband started Madhopur

735
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,640
Farmers Producers Company Limited in 2016.

736
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,200
He

737
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,000
started his business with a packet of mushrooms for ₹150

738
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,520
and today this company has become one of the most successful

739
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,120
rural enterprises of Bihar.

740
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,360
[Music]

741
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,600
Slowly, as we started working again,

742
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
people from the district, from agriculture and science, started

743
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,480
coming to us.  We started looking at the college.

744
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,640
And seeing that, my work

745
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,760
gradually progressed with the advice and suggestions of those people.

746
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,960
So then we got an award.

747
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,720
From that we made another hall.

748
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,120
We started mushroom farming in that also.

749
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,200
Then gradually our income started increasing.

750
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,600
Then I thought, no, this is not enough.

751
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Make something else.  So then we

752
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,000
added another one.  That is why by connecting the right path we

753
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,720
reached here.  His company started out

754
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,360
selling very basic things like seeds,

755
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,440
fertilizers and pesticides.  But today,

756
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,240
along with training, it has become a market place

757
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,960
for many women in Nalanda.

758
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,159
20,000 packets are produced every season.

759
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,679
She manages a team of 12 people.  And today

760
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,679
3 to 4000 women farmers learn from her.

761
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,760
All of them worked in their homes but

762
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,840
we created a chain for them and through that

763
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,480
we used to buy their mushrooms in the initial stage.  We used to

764
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,039
market it

765
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,519
and whenever they had any problem regarding seeds,

766
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,840
we used to supply the seeds to them.  Now I

767
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,799
want to tell you what this means?  3 to

768
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,120
4000 women who had no income previously and were

769
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,200
completely dependent on their husbands or their

770
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,600
families.  Today he

771
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,159
is financially independent.  His village

772
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,200
Anantapur is now called the first mushroom village of Bihar.  The

773
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,440
credit for which goes to Anita Devi, the

774
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,440
Mushroom Lady of Bihar.

775
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,600
If we had not run after that roof today,

776
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,519
we would not have got the umbrella.  Where can one

777
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,240
see this concrete building?  Where did

778
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,159
we get to see all these things, we

779
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,720
ran after him and he ran after us

780
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,720
and you must also know that the main money

781
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,279
in farming comes from processing.  That is why Anita

782
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,679
Devi not only sells mushrooms but

783
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,000
also sells mushroom pickle.  It is sold at ONDC

784
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,159
and through various other exhibitions and

785
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,159
we market it

786
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,000
through people who come to us to

787
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,399
visit here.

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,200
Second is that

789
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,679
we have posted it on ONDC My Store.  Let us

790
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,320
give him the charge.

791
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,480
Our goods are sold through that.  So we have organised it in the same way as

792
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,360
many Rajgir festivals or any

793
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,240
fair are organised.  We display our products there also.

794
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,200
So

795
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,000
we sell it from three or four sectors.   The

796
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,720
total annual turnover of his company is Rs 1.2

797
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,720
crore.  He has received many national awards.

798
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,320
And Prime Minister Narendra Modi's

799
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,559
social media handle also shared his story.

800
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
The truly great thing about Anita

801
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,560
Devi is that she has created an impact not just in her own

802
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,320
life but

803
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,240
in the lives of thousands of women.  That too

804
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,240
in a state of India where so many

805
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,960
opportunities are not available.  And

806
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,320
hopefully through this video you will know

807
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,159

808
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,560

809
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,200

810
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,359
how Dalpreet and Anita Devi, both very different people, born in different states and whose situations were very different, changed their lives.  My only

811
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,159
hope is that hopefully this gives you

812
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,800
some inspiration.  Especially in those moments

813
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,159
when you are feeling down, a little depressed

814
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,599
or sad.  That's the best thing

815
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,639
about time is that time changes.  And if

816
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,800
you are going through bad times right now, that too will change.

817
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,800
