This video was actually supposed to be released last week but due to some small problem it got delayed.  But now this video is ready.  And I think this is the perfect video to leave behind all the negativity that has come in life. And if you see negativity in the comments too, then I learnt something from Samay Rahna's stream that to block negative comments from the timeline, you should hard spam.  My heart will be happy.  And regarding the ANI video.  Right now, we have privatized it as per the order of Delhi High Court.  After re- editing it will become public.  Don't worry.  Let's focus on this video.  And I really hope you enjoy this video.  There is a saying in our country that if one is born poor, he will die poor.  But this saying does not make so much sense.  So I had a pair of jeans and I used to wear it every day to college. And I think it had been about a month and a half since the beginning of college.  Those jeans of mine were so worn out that one day, while I was sitting on a bike with my friend, they got torn.  And after that I could not go to college for a week because I did not have any clothes.  If you are born in a poor family then there is only 3% chance that you will be able to reach the top 20% of the society.  I will repeat it back.  There is only a 3% chance that you will come out of the bottom 20%.  The situation here was very pathetic. When we came to Nyay, we could not even find proper things to eat and drink. Now I will not say that brother, if you work hard then you will definitely be able to change your life.  Because honestly many things in life decide how your life will be in the future.  There are controllables and then there are uncontrollables.  But I also want to say that you have absolutely no control over these uncontrollables. So why not just focus on this.  And in this video I want to share the story of two people who have done this. Many times when we stand here in the balcony at night with Jagriti, I see or I speak to her that friend, I had never even imagined in my life that I would be able to live in such a place.  From where do they see the Pakka building?  From where do we see so many things? This was my personal motivation behind this video because many people say that brother, you only make negative things.  Which is true in some way because negativity is easy to sell.  And I wanted to fix that in this video.  I just hope that through this video you get inspired from the two stories that I am about to tell you so that at those moments when you are doubting yourself, you should not think that friend, I too can change my life, from the very beginning, as much as I have heard from my mother, her life has been tough from the beginning, ever since she got married, she belongs to Ranchi, so Ranchi is now the capital of Jharkhand, at that time Ranchi used to be a small town in Bihar, so she came to Khusro after getting married from Ranchi, my dad was never that financially stable. Initially he did some work in studios etc.  Then after that the work of that studio stopped.  So my grandfather had his own coffee shop.  So he did some work there but his major work was not getting settled. And because he had some problems from the beginning, he used to drink alcohol, play cards, gamble etc.  So my mom was very worried about all those issues related to it. So because of that she also pushes you to leave this place because if you do not leave this place then you will not be able to get out of these things. So leaving those things behind, we shifted to Korba.  I think I was two or three years old back then.  This is 35 year old Dalpreet who lives in Gurgaon today. He was born in a small town of Jharkhand, Khusro, and then shifted to Korba, a city in Chhattisgarh, to stay with his relatives, and it was only after coming to Korba that Dalpreet's problems started. His father had a business of slippers and shoes. But that much money was not being earned from that. Along with this, the condition of the house is also not good because it is completely a raw courtyard.  There are just two rooms in between and a washroom there too.  At that time there were three of us and I did not have a sister. I remember one time, maybe the rain was pouring very heavily and my father was not at home and a snake appeared in the house.  And even the latch of our house wasn’t working properly.  So my mom tied that latch with her scarf and held me tightly like that and slept all night. So that the snake does not come back inside. Dad’s drinking problem was getting worse. I don't remember when I was small we got very little time with our dads especially because mostly he would either not come home at night or even if he came, we would not have much conversation and many times it would happen that when I would be waiting for the bus at the bus stand, my dad would be going home in front of me because he would not have come the whole night and when I would come back home from school, he would be sleeping, so when I was going to pick up my bus at 6-7 in the morning then my mom would give me a one or two rupee coin saying that there is an STD PCOs near the bus stand.  I had to call dad there and tell him that he was not at home the whole night.  And these problems of alcohol and money also came into Dalpreet's life.  I still remember that when we were in school, once a month a list was circulated to all the teachers regarding which children's fees had not been paid.  So almost my name was in that list every month.  So every month I was made to stand and was told that Dilpreet, your fees have not arrived.  Papa got addicted to alcohol, due to which his school also got affected and more than that at home, there is probably no festival in our family that is celebrated without there being a fight, be it Diwali or Holi, there was always chaos about why do you drink alcohol, this or that. There came a point when I was playing outside the house and when I reached home in the evening, all the doors of my house were locked, so I was knocking, Mummy open the gate, Mummy open the gate, Mummy was not opening the gate, my sister was very young at that time, I think, if I was in class three-four, it means my sister must have been three-four years old. So when I opened the window I saw that my mom had hung her scarf on the fan and had made a noose out of it and a chair was placed there and she was trying to climb on it. And I screamed a lot from there. Mummy stop, Mummy stop, Mummy stop. What is this you are doing?  What are you doing? And my sister was very small, three-four years old. And my mother told my sister to stand up and say that first I will hang him and then I will hang myself.  And she was in depression.  I don't know how much he realized that she was doing this. And I was shouting a lot and my mom, my sister were saying from there, brother you go, brother you go and some how, I don't know, maybe I reached at that point of time, I was shouting so much at that point of time, I knocked the door, finally just before doing that, my mom realized that suddenly I don't know what happened to her, she saw me and she opened the door, I am probably the most grateful for the thing that if I had not reached at that minute then today our life would have been different.  So I have seen my mom till that point of time also.  Just because of these reasons which we saw in our childhood. Thank you so much.   By the time he reached eighth class, he had seen so many things in life that one thing had got imprinted in his mind. I wouldn't have thought that I had matured so much in the seventh year.  But I realised that if something is not right in life then only through studies something can be made right.  Education is the only thing which you can do which was in my hands. And apart from that, he couldn't do anything else. So from 7th A, my focus on studies increased a bit.  I remember that I got good marks in 10th.  In 11th class, Dalpreet asked his father to send him to Bhilai where he could start his IIT coaching.  On the other hand, Dalpreet took admission in a school and started living in the hostel.  So when the 11th class final came, I was so disturbed that I had got decent marks in 10th.  But I got compartment in 11th.  That means I got supplementary in one subject.  And when I came back home, my mom told me that my father had sold my mom's mangalsutra because he was unable to pay the fees, as he had paid the fees by taking all the fees on loan, so finally to pay off the loan, my mom had to sell her necklace, then I decided that I will come back, I will not continue my studies in Ilai because my father was unable to afford college, so let's say it was a dream for Dalpreet because he knew that he did not have the money for college, but life had some other plans for him.  By luck you can know that in the same year a new engineering college was opened in Korba itself and the college fees of others in Bhilai etc. was almost Rs. 1 to ₹ lakh per year.  Its total cost for four years was ₹1 lakh.  So Dalpreet went to the college and talked to the principal to somehow get admission.  So finally the principal made a few phone calls. He checked whether the final list of the college has been submitted?  And if that did not happen then he said, ok, last minute we will add you in the list but you will have to make a demand draft of ₹2000 and give it right away. We talked and went out.  Coming out, my dad looks at me and asks, from where should I get ₹00?  Papa did not have any money.  But mummy actually had some money left which she had actually hidden for the wedding of Dalpreet's sister. But he said, son, take this money and go and study.  But just a month after admission, Dalpreet had to face another problem. So I had a pair of jeans and I used to wear it every day to college and I think it had been just one and a half months since I started college.  Those jeans of mine were so worn out that one day, while I was sitting on a bike with my friend, they got torn and after that, I could not go to college for a week because I did not have any clothes to wear. And after that he took an important decision.  When that incident happened then I realised that this thing will never end like this. And then I thought that I will start teaching tuitions.  Now while Dalpreet was solving his father's alcohol problem and financial problems at home, our second character, 55- year-old Anita Devi from Bihar was fighting her own battle. My birthplace is Nirpur, a village which is near Nalanda. [MUSIC] I was born in 1970. Our father was a teacher.  His training was going on. So people went there to bring bubbles. Anita Devi had a fine childhood.   There were some difficulties but his parents always protected him from every problem. But sometimes this protection becomes too much.  To such an extent that he did not get a chance to move forward. This is a daughter in the name of a daughter.  I can't go anywhere. Keep it limited to this.  Tie your feet and keep them in the legs.  This was the situation.  So we should get good education which we did not get.  She got married immediately after completing her graduation in Home Science. But after their marriage their life changed completely. Before marriage, we were growing up in a good family. But when I got married in a farmer's family, I felt that I wish I was brought up in a very good home, but the problems that I faced after coming here, were very painful at that time.  Whenever I saw anything I felt that it was strange. Where did we come to?  Got stuck.  She had to face all kinds of problems in her in-laws' house.   What are you remembering and feeling sad? Anita ji, tell me about this, what are you thinking and what are you remembering, what I saw there, I could not find anything there, the situation there was very pathetic, when we came, we could not even find proper things to eat and drink, there was a lot of taunting in the family, we were unable to tolerate it for every thing, we had to live with it sip by sip and we thought that what should we do now, as if we are trapped in a trap, how should we get out of it, Anita Devi's husband used to live in a big joint family of 15 people.  Where everyone was involved in farming.  Now three people used to earn but after the expenses of 15 people, only ₹ 15,000 could be saved by the end of the month. And meanwhile, a rider was eating them from inside.  She used to do housework all day long and the children had become a couple of years old.  So we thought, what should we do?  It cost us ₹2 because the kids would ask us for money.  I will not ask for money from the family.  And she decided that right now I will try and show you something.  For this we used to work hard and sew at night.  He used to be asleep and when he got up, he used to get very angry and say, hey brother, you have nothing to do with life. We thought that my child would ask us for money.  He will not ask you.  If he asks you once and asks us 10 times, then we will have to work hard.  So we did the sewing with the help of a lantern and a needle. Now her husband supported her for this thing but other family members taunted her.  When people came to us for that also, our mother-in-law used to speak a lot. Hey, everyone would have come and taught me a few things.  Hey, what will you teach us, we are not fools. We are worried about how to run our household and family. Now she would listen with one ear and let it out from the other.  But one day this limit was crossed. After some time, due to all these problems, I got depressed.  I could not sleep for 15 days and when I could not sleep, I wondered what should I do now and whom should I tell. I used to spend my time crying secretly.  Then I felt that I quickly overpowered him.  My sleep completely went away. Even during her depression, only one person supported Anita ji.  Then one day, it seemed as if a volcano erupted inside her husband.  In this sequence, one day I got angry. We are talking a lot.  At that time, we let go of the faith that we had within us. Whatever has to happen to you, I have fulfilled my duty a lot but you did not console me on that, so today I will tell you whatever is in my mind. After which she left the house with her husband and children and she took her own house on rent, even after this she did not get peace because depression does not go away easily, so I left the house thinking that I would not be able to live with them anymore, I took a camp and started living in it, but at that time I was totally ruined that I was not able to sleep.  She used to remain restless.  I also used to think that if something happens to me in the future, my family will be torn apart.  Every child will be ruined. Anita ji continued fighting her depression for five to six months in the new house. She also went to her parents but nothing more happened.  But one day things changed.  When some women from Jeevika group of Bihar came to Anita.  These Jeevika Didi are the women in the villages of Bihar who, through a government scheme, teach women how they can stand on their own feet and these women gave a suggestion to Anita ji. So, when he used to get upset, in the same sequence some sisters came to us and said that let's go for a walk, if my mind gets refreshed from here then it's okay, these women wanted to take him to Ranchi where an agricultural workshop was being held and his life was being developed in this workshop, now at this time both the characters of our story are using it in their life and at this moment they decide that they will have to take a leap of faith.  They will have to take a leap.  And Dalpreet takes this leap in his first year of college.   I understood this thing that money holds its value.  They say that okay money can't buy everything.  But you need money. So when I was in the first year of college, I started teaching tuitions and my first tuition fee, I think, was ₹500. Now gradually more students come to Dalpreet and gradually he starts earning more money. A year later, when Dalpreet is in the second year, he starts giving tuition to first year students of the college. So at that point of time he started earning more than my father in the second year. Now giving tuition will be a very small thing for you. But not for Dalpreet. Because his father was earning ₹5,000 per month.  And with these tuitions, Dalpreet was able to support himself and his family. At that time when I was teaching tuitions, I tried to save some money and get the house repaired a bit.  So get the house painted, get some furniture changed, etc. And friend, because of this money, Dalpreet bought something for himself for the first time in his life. He spent ₹4000 on shoes and he bought makeup and clothes for his sister. Which might be a very small thing for me or for you. But not for Dalpreet.  In college, Dalpreet realized that he could earn ₹00 a month. Earning ₹00 every month was like a dream for his family.  So Dalpreet started thinking what should be the next step ?  Some people suggested that I should take competitive exams.  But Dalpreet did not want to do this because government jobs require both money and time for coaching and even then success is not guaranteed.  So Dalpreet decided that he would do something different.  After doing NPTI, there is a college called National Power Training Institute, these people provide training for thermal power plant and they also provide MBA.  So they have a college in Nagpur which provides training for thermal power plant.  I completed my engineering in 2012.  After that I had a gap of one year.  Then in 2012 itself I came to know about NPTI College. Firstly, it offered special courses and secondly the placements there were good.  I just knew it. Apart from IMS, if there was any guarantee of getting a job, it would be available in NPTI. Because Dalpreet was tutoring school and engineering college students. He had the confidence that he can definitely write a good exam and he will pass the entrance exam of NPTI. But the problem was not with his skills.  The problem was of money because ₹ lakhs had to be paid for preparation of the course.  So Dalpreet went to the banks to get a loan.  Those people who say that our shoes got worn out by visiting banks so much, that had happened to me, so I went to each and every bank that I could see on the road, Bank Dena Bank, ICICI, Axis Bank of Boda, I went to all the banks.  I was refused by all the banks. All the banks rejected his application because there was no collateral.  So someone told Dalpreet that maybe he would go to SBI and say that he is desperate.  So who knows he might take pity on him and give him an education loan. Then I reached the bank manager.  I was literally, I mean, I lay down in his cabin and said that if you do not give me the loan, I will not be able to study further.  The responsibility for this will be on you.   The SBI manager accepted his application and then Dalpreet got admission in MBA course [Music] of MPTI.  Dalpreet worked hard and his hard work paid off. So when he got a job in a startup Azure Power with a salary of Rs 27,000, he felt that he had now climbed the ladder of life.  Now this was not a lot of money, but Dalpreet was confident that he could gradually increase his income level.  But he also came to know that his potentials were not being utilized in this company. He will have to make a change in his career.  When I got that job, I still remember that for the first 6 months I was just doing photocopies in that job. And I got really frustrated.  But during those six months I was not doing anything of my own. Like if any report comes then I will do some analysis of it and send it to my management.  So my presentation skills were a little good.  He kept sending such presentations to senior managers but did not get any response.  So after 6 months, Dalat quit his job.  The reason was very simple.  He had a huge education loan on his head. He was doing photocopying at his job. This meant he was n't going to make much money.  So if he has to repay the loan he will have to take a new job.  So Dalpreet submitted several applications and got a job.  It had been only two days since he started the new job when suddenly Dalpreet received a call. A call from HR at his old company. HR told Dalpreet that their CEO wants to talk to him.  I was a bit scared at that time.  I said, friend, I was a management trainee there.  I asked what does the CEO there want to talk to me about. So I said, okay, you let me talk to him. Then I got connected and the IP there made me talk on the phone.  He asked why Dalpreet left his job?  I said sir there was no work in your company. So he says, friend, here I get people to work and they leave me and go away.   If your work is not done then come back. Dalpreet was very surprised.  But he said, okay let's try.  He went to his old HR and the HR told him that this is a blank paper and he should write the CTC he wants.  Now I know this might sound like a film script to you but this is not.  This is actually Dalpreet's life.  Dalpreet said please match my new CTC which is Rs 4 to 4.5 lakh.  I think after listening to Dalpreet's story, I realised that he could have written any number like 10-15 lakh.  But he himself is CTC because if he works hard then his CTC will increase automatically.  And this was the logic.  Meaning, I would work there day and night.  I used to go to office around 10:00 in the morning and come back around 2-3 in the night.  Till the last person is sitting in the office, I am sitting.  I started taking work from all of them.   There is something to learn in the company.  In this manner. And I think I got into the notice of the management.  And within a year, my increment was more than 300% of the increment.  And friend, there are many moments in life which suddenly give you a lot of self-confidence.  Like that moment in my life was when I got my first job after college with Poverty Action Lab, whose application process is very competitive.  And I was not sure whether I would ever get such a job or not.  But I got the job and then I worked in Bihar for one year.  That moment happened with Dalpreet when he got this CTC when his self- confidence and belief in himself reached its peak.  Dalpreet did not come from any fancy college like IIT. His engineering background was very normal. So whatever he achieved, he did it through his hard work, dedication and hustle.  But for such turning points, your hard work is important.  But you also need someone who supports you.  Just like Darpat got support from the SBI bank manager who sanctioned her loan and the CEO also helped her, Anita Devi also got similar support.  It is the year 2010 and Anita Devi is going to Ranchi to attend an agricultural workshop. This workshop was about a crop that many Biharis were not aware of at that time.  The mushroom that lives in wheat straw sister. Seeds are added to it.  It is then packed in plastic.  Make holes.  Then keep it for 18 days.  After that a seed like Ujav remains in it.  It happens like this in bags.  But Anita Devi had some idea about it as she had heard about it in her childhood. So during this workshop Anita Devi focused fully [music] that who knows she might get an opportunity from here and we learnt everything there. When she came home, after this workshop Anita Devi went to her husband and she demanded one thing, we ourselves mentioned in passing that we have seen mushrooms and we will send them but there was a problem, you need an indoor space for mushrooms, but there was no room in her house where she could do mushroom farming.  So she decided she would go to her mother-in-law's house where there was an extra room [music].  My mother in law was there at that time and she would get very angry and would stop me from doing anything, but after listening to this she would ignore the matter and throw me out of the house. Although she used to live in the market and came here to work she thought that she would work only when there was space. First we will learn it and then we will move forward. [Music] Then he got another news that another mushroom workshop was being organised not in Bihar but in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand.  So when the news about your training came up, my morale got boosted.  This is the thing we are looking for, how can we get the complete information. Then I felt that this journey would be good for me and I would learn something while going back. After 15 days of training, there was an excitement and energy in Anita ji's body that now brother is going to change something.  Anita Devi's husband also went with her and both of them started mushroom farming.  The two used whatever money they had left and also took bank loans so that they could buy land and build three rooms to grow mushrooms. But suddenly he realised that nothing can be achieved with just energy and knowledge.  Many problems arise in such things. A lot of problems arose in this too.  Bag of mushrooms as soon as they put in time.  There was no experience. Three to three bags of dodah would rot.  If it had rotted then leave it brother, if it had rotted then check after that. But she would make a mistake and learn from that mistake.  Then she would make another mistake and learn from that mistake.  We kept trying to see how this would happen in which season and at what temperature.  We also rotted a lot of spawn too.  A lot of bags of mushrooms are loaded with copies.  We did not drive behind this car, just to avoid feeling like this. Yes, there is more work tomorrow.  You see, something has just happened.  By doing this he improved farming so much. Meaning, he did not let his courage lag behind. He continued doing that work.  And suddenly she was earning so much money that three other members of her family were not earning. Look at the combine and her passion, she was not satisfied with this thing.  His ambition was even greater.  Now I thought, oh my god, it's ₹500 for fasting.  Then we proceeded further and gradually moved forward in this same sequence. Seeing him many people started coming to him and saying teach us also how to do this. [Music] He also received the Jagjivan Ram Abhinav Kisan Award in 2014. Due to which he got ₹ 1 lakh which he invested in his farm. I will hit the bat. Hey, I felt that there is some potential in this work and it should be promoted.  As soon as we got ₹1 lakh, we immediately set up a hub and then it started mushrooming [music]. Now his income increased further.  Slowly, slowly it kept on generating and kept on increasing. And suddenly, a woman who was unhappy, lost and depressed became a successful entrepreneur in her village. Dalpreet grew from a frustrated employee to an accomplished professional and Anita Devi from a homemaker to a famous entrepreneur. But the crazy thing about success and confidence is that they compound, so once you achieve success, it is not that difficult to achieve exponential growth. After spending several years at Azure Power, Dalpreet started looking at bigger opportunities. Today he works at Total Energy and his monthly tax bill is more than his father's annual income. Another good thing is that Dalpreet's father has now stopped drinking alcohol and now runs a chemist shop in Korba. Whereas Dalpreet lives in a posh locality of Gurgaon with his wife. Balcony The View From The Balcony.  It feels quite nice to stand here and watch from here at times.   I never thought that I would be able to live here. Dalpreet says that when he was young he did not want to bring his friends home because the paint was peeling off the walls. He would feel embarrassed if the furniture was broken.  And same Dalpreet is now so happy because he can now buy this house. And I think we are following Mohak Mangal's channel for very long and I really like associating with him.  I think if it were not for Mohak's channel, I would hardly have shared this story with anyone.  But I am very grateful that I am able to share such a story with such a genuine channel. Dalpreet also has a very impressive sneaker collection which was once a dream of his.  But apart from the sneakers, Dalpreet has the memories he has created.  That is what it is for.  I still remember I bought my first car in 2018 and when I was driving that first car, I was literally crying at that moment because I had never imagined that I would be able to sit in the driving seat of a car. But what Dalpreet learned was that through education and hard work he could change his life. He wants to teach the same thing to his sister also. And at the same time my sister also got admitted.  I paid his first semester's fees from my tuition fees. Then we arranged for his education loan also. He also completed his entire studies through education loan.  When he passed engineering, my mom and dad said that we should get Shikh a job in some bank here.   The clerk will do the job of clerk comfortably here and will stay with us.  I told you that nothing is doing.  You will not keep the Sikh there. You keep Shikha with me.  I got him an internship in the company where I was working.  He worked very hard for two-three months as an intern and my company got him a job offer and after that both of us started earning good money.  Now two people in the family are earning quite well.  Because of which he took his family on a vacation.  I remember that since my childhood I never went out for a walk. After some time we went to Nainital for a trip. When we were sitting in Nainital, my mom told me one thing, this is the first day after your grandmother's death that I am sitting comfortably and eating food.  Otherwise nobody has served me food.  I always have to serve everyone first.  Everybody has to be fed. After that I sit and eat by myself.  I think these are the small moments which make you realize that you have earned something in your life.  Anita Devi also did something similar but in a very different industry. [Music] She and her husband started Madhopur Farmers Producers Company Limited in 2016. He started his business with a packet of mushrooms for ₹150 and today this company has become one of the most successful rural enterprises of Bihar. [Music] Slowly, as we started working again, people from the district, from agriculture and science, started coming to us.  We started looking at the college. And seeing that, my work gradually progressed with the advice and suggestions of those people. So then we got an award. From that we made another hall. We started mushroom farming in that also. Then gradually our income started increasing. Then I thought, no, this is not enough. Make something else.  So then we added another one.  That is why by connecting the right path we reached here.  His company started out selling very basic things like seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.  But today, along with training, it has become a market place for many women in Nalanda. 20,000 packets are produced every season. She manages a team of 12 people.  And today 3 to 4000 women farmers learn from her. All of them worked in their homes but we created a chain for them and through that we used to buy their mushrooms in the initial stage.  We used to market it and whenever they had any problem regarding seeds, we used to supply the seeds to them.  Now I want to tell you what this means?  3 to 4000 women who had no income previously and were completely dependent on their husbands or their families.  Today he is financially independent.  His village Anantapur is now called the first mushroom village of Bihar.  The credit for which goes to Anita Devi, the Mushroom Lady of Bihar. If we had not run after that roof today, we would not have got the umbrella.  Where can one see this concrete building?  Where did we get to see all these things, we ran after him and he ran after us and you must also know that the main money in farming comes from processing.  That is why Anita Devi not only sells mushrooms but also sells mushroom pickle.  It is sold at ONDC and through various other exhibitions and we market it through people who come to us to visit here. Second is that we have posted it on ONDC My Store.  Let us give him the charge. Our goods are sold through that.  So we have organised it in the same way as many Rajgir festivals or any fair are organised.  We display our products there also. So we sell it from three or four sectors.   The total annual turnover of his company is Rs 1.2 crore.  He has received many national awards. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi's social media handle also shared his story. The truly great thing about Anita Devi is that she has created an impact not just in her own life but in the lives of thousands of women.  That too in a state of India where so many opportunities are not available.  And hopefully through this video you will know how Dalpreet and Anita Devi, both very different people, born in different states and whose situations were very different, changed their lives.  My only hope is that hopefully this gives you some inspiration.  Especially in those moments when you are feeling down, a little depressed or sad.  That's the best thing about time is that time changes.  And if you are going through bad times right now, that too will change.
