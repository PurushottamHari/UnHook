And here Rahul Gandhi has once again made a big attack on the Election Commission of India. And it is said here that in a way, there was complete match fixing in the Maharashtra elections. You can see the news rigging charges after Maharashtra loss increased.  This has also been hit back by the Election Commission.  So let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening right now. Why did Rahul Gandhi raise the issue of Maharashtra elections again ?  What allegations were made?  And here in the article he has written, he has mentioned five things that through these five steps the entire election of Maharashtra was changed.  So let's get started.

First of all, let me tell you that currently, the political clash between Rahul Gandhi and the Election Commission of India is basically a major national controversy. And what is basically behind all this is that Rahul Gandhi has made serious charges against the Election Commission of India.  And it is said that match fixing was done to favour BJP. So keeping this in mind, the Election Commission of India also retaliated.  So I will tell you all that but before that you must remember that the Maharashtra Assembly Elections held in November last year were a very tough contest, that means before the results of the election came out, no one was able to understand which party could win and what would happen, so what is the case here is that there was an alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena and at the same time, you know, later on, NCP, Ajit Pawar's party also came and here there was a face to face confrontation with Maha Vikas Aghadi in which Congress again, which became Sharad Pawar's NCP and Shiv Sena of Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray, so if you see in the midst of all this, the kind of result that came out here had surprised everyone.  In fact, you can see that the total seats here are 288 and here the majority mark you obviously need is 145.  So when the election results came, you can see that BJP alone had almost a majority, though if you put BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP together, it would have been a lot of seats, but here BJP alone had got seats very close to the majority mark, around 132, and that is why the entire opposition party was in confusion as to how can this happen. On the other hand, the Congress, NCP, Sharad Pawar's party, Shiv Sena, Uddhav Bala Saheb's party got a big shock here because they had almost ensured that they were going to win the elections this time, so the result of the election that came was quite shocking for everyone, so here Rahul Gandhi has made an allegation.  He wrote an article here, basically in Indian Express, in which he titled it Match Fixing Maharashtra.  And here he has directly told about the match fixing that was done between BJP and Election Commission to rig the election and said that the entire election of Maharashtra was changed through five steps. Now let me tell you what this five step process is. First of all he said that the appointment process of the Election Commission of India, the three members in the Election Commission, their entire appointment process was tampered with.  You might remember that a decision had come from the Supreme Court because if you look from independence till now, the members in the Election Commission were basically directly selected by the government.  So there was no problem till now. But the matter actually went to the Supreme Court.  It was said that this is a constitutional body.  How can the government appoint someone, that too regarding things like elections.  So the Supreme Court's decision came and said that yes, this is correct.  So we are forming a three member committee here.  There will be a leader of the opposition, there will be a Prime Minister and there will be the Chief Justice of India. Ok?  So these three members will select who will be the member of the Election Commission. But the government brought amendments.  The government said that no, it is fine to have an opposition leader here but the Chief Justice of India should not be there and instead, some minister of the government will be there in it and regarding this, Rahul Gandhi's first allegation is that his own person has been appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner for the first time. Then in the second step it was said here by Rahul Gandhi that fake voters have been added in the elections that took place in Maharashtra. You must be aware that before every election, there is an electoral roll which is released by the Election Commission of India, in which are written the names of all the people who will vote and are eligible to vote.  So, fake voters have been included in this role in large numbers. In the third step, Rahul Gandhi said that an attempt was made to show the voter turnout artificially, i.e., in a wrong manner.   That means, suppose only 45% people voted in the election but it was deliberately increased to 60%.  Meaning, voter turnout was deliberately increased. Then bogus voting was done here.  Rahul Gandhi has said that in the fourth step, the BJP and the Election Commission together have conducted bogus voting multiple times through fake IDs, especially in the urban areas where the Congress was very strong, so that the Congress candidate could be defeated. At the same time, it has also been said in the fifth step that the CCTV footage and the EVM metadata have been tampered with in a wrong manner. Meaning, his data has been kept with held.   has been tampered with so that any irregularities cannot be traced.  So, through these five steps, the entire Maharashtra election was turned around by the BJP and the Election Commission of India and was made in favour of the ruling party.  So basically Rahul Gandhi's demand is that in his article, he said that first of all there should be full public disclosure of the voter roll.  It means that whatever consolidated voter roll was prepared should be revealed publicly and along with that the CCTV footage of the polling stations should be released and a detailed explanation was sought from the Election Commission of India as to how they have maintained transparency, this demand was made here by Rahul Gandhi. Now it is obvious that after seeing this the Election Commission also responded immediately.  The Election Commission of India strongly rejected the entire allegation made by Rahul Gandhi and said that this is a very upsetting and irresponsible statement by Rahul Gandhi and is, in some way, the biggest insult to the democratic institutions and the voters. This is what the Election Commission of India said here and they also said that the revision of the electoral roll was transparent.  Basically, Rahul Gandhi is claiming that if there are 5 lakh voters here in the Lok Sabha elections, then how did this number suddenly increase from 5 lakh to 7 lakh?  Meaning such allegations were made by Rahul Gandhi.  But here the Election Commission of India says that whatever electoral roll was prepared was done in a very transparent manner.  Meaning, involving 1 lakh booth level agents was done in front of the public.  The booth level agents go door to door and then make complete preparation there.  And keep in mind that all these booth level agents are through political parties.  I mean, whichever candidate is contesting from BJP or Shiv Sena, he posts his booth level agent there and everything is prepared in front of them. So this was what the Election Commission of India said.  Secondly, here he said that low number of appeals, when we were preparing the entire electoral roll here, then objections etc. would happen, suppose you have some problem, you feel that some rigging is taking place, then you will object at that time, but the Election Commission of India says that very few objections were received regarding minor things.  So this clearly shows that there has been no irregularity of any kind here. Then along with this, observers were present here and were strictly monitoring things.   It means that multiple rounds of polling took place, on the day when the elections were taking place and people were voting, at that time the monitoring was done in a proper independent manner in front of independent observers, how the entire election was conducted, so all these things of Rahul Gandhi were in a way rejected by the Election Commission of India and see, yesterday as soon as this thing comes from the Election Commission of India, immediately a statement from Rahul Gandhi also comes on Twitter, you can see that around 7:00 pm yesterday, he responded and said, look, Election Commission of India, you are a constitutional body.  This is not how your response should be.  Meaning, I am asking a very serious question.  So you should answer in a very serious manner. He said if you have nothing to hide then answer my questions which I have written in the article.  And prove it here that you should publish the entire consolidated digital machine readable voter roll.  Ah, the Lok Sabha elections as well as the Assembly elections that have been held in all the states including Maharashtra and Haryana. Because you know that Congress had lost in Haryana also.  Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi made a specific demand that the CCTV footage of Maharashtra polling booth after 5:00 PM should be released.  And he also said that the questions you are trying to invite will damage your credibility.  Meaning, if you tell the truth then you can save your credibility here.  But whatever it is, this issue has become quite political and now a counter has come from the BJP side as well and the BJP has accused Rahul Gandhi of undermining the democratic process of India.  There is a narrative of victimhood, after losing the election you play the victimhood role, saying that the election was rigged. That's what you're trying to create. And BJP also alleged that you are copying George Soros' playbook so that you can spread propaganda in any democracy. Apart from this, responses also came from senior figures of BJP. Amit Malaviya said that the claims made by Rahul Gandhi here are in a way trying to remove the faith of the public in the institution. JP Nadda, he mocked him here.  The five-step guide says that this is a kind of attempt to hatch a fake election conspiracy. Devendra Fadnavis, who is the CM of Maharashtra, called Rahul Gandhi's claim nonsense and said that this is a big insult to the voters. Look, overall this is the conclusion, what is its significance? What is its implication?  Basically, whether things went right or wrong, when you make an allegation, whether it is proven later on or not, it does n't matter.  But somewhere you will see a big crisis in the democratic trust. Meaning, a deeper issue here shows that the opposition parties are continuously raising questions about the election process. And because of this you will see the current crisis right now. Now it is possible that in the upcoming elections, the next Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2029.  In between there will be elections in many states.  So these things will come up again and again all the time.  It is possible that if the matter reaches the Supreme Court then the Supreme Court may say something like release the CCTV footage etc. And see, this also creates an international perception. I was telling you whether things are proven here or not.  But it will also be said internationally that look, the main opposition party is raising questions about your election process.  So a consensus needs to be reached somewhere.  And things should be taken forward in a balanced manner so that the democratic process of India remains safe in some way.  Repeated questions like this mean this should be ended once and for all. Doing this thing repeatedly like this seems to be a big setback to the democratic process.  So this was the complete video and before leaving, can you all ask an interesting question that how long is the tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner of India?  What is their term in office?  You all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.  If you are not there, no problem, you can get the correct answer from twitter.
