00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,000
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, once

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
again you will see the entire controversy regarding the election process in the country.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
And here Rahul Gandhi has once

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,039
again made a big attack on the Election Commission of India.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
And it is said here that in

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,519
a way, there was

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,920
complete match fixing in the Maharashtra elections.

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,119
You can see the news rigging charges

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
after Maharashtra loss increased.  This has

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,880
also been hit back by the Election Commission.  So let us

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,880
understand this in a little detail as to

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,879
what exactly is happening right now.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
Why did Rahul Gandhi raise the issue of Maharashtra elections again

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
?  What allegations were made?  And here in the

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
article he has written, he has

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
mentioned five things that through these five steps the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
entire

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
election of Maharashtra was changed.  So let's get

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
started.  But before that, let me tell you all that those

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Let's get started.  First of all, let

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
me tell you that currently, the

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,320
political clash between Rahul Gandhi and the Election

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Commission of India is basically

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,680
a major national controversy.

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,159
And what is basically behind all this is that

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
Rahul Gandhi has made serious charges

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,040
against the Election Commission of India.  And it is

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,759
said that match fixing was done to favour BJP.

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,520
So keeping

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,600
this in mind, the Election Commission of India

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
also retaliated.  So I will tell you all that

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,759
but before that you

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,079
must remember that the Maharashtra Assembly Elections held in November last year were

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,720
a

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,200
very tough contest, that means

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,280
before the results of the election came out, no one was able to understand

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
which party could win and

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,479
what would happen, so what is the case here is that there was an

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,280
alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena and at the same time,

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,680
you know, later on, NCP,

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,399
Ajit Pawar's party also came and

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
here there was a face to face confrontation with Maha Vikas

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,599
Aghadi in which Congress again, which

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,840
became Sharad Pawar's NCP and Shiv Sena of

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray, so

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,319
if you see in the midst of all this, the

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
kind of result that came out here had

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,200
surprised everyone.  In fact, you can see that the

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,959
total seats here are 288 and

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,680
here the majority mark you obviously need is

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,400
145.  So when the election results

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,280
came, you can see that BJP alone had

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,280
almost a majority,

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
though if you put BJP,

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
Shiv Sena and NCP together, it would have been

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
a lot of seats, but here

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,920
BJP alone had

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640
got seats very close to the majority mark, around 132,

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,040
and that is why the entire opposition

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,599
party was in confusion as to

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,239
how can this happen. On the

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,800
other hand, the Congress, NCP,

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,200
Sharad Pawar's party, Shiv Sena, Uddhav

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Bala Saheb's party got a big

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,440
shock here because they had almost

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
ensured that

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,800
they were going to win the elections this time, so the

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,959
result of the election that came was quite

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
shocking for everyone, so here Rahul

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
Gandhi has made an allegation.  He

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,360
wrote an article here, basically

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
in Indian Express, in which

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,519
he titled it Match Fixing

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,519
Maharashtra.  And here he has

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,080
directly told about the match fixing that was done between BJP and Election Commission to

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,440
rig the election

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,519
and said that the entire election of Maharashtra was changed through five steps.

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,680

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,519
Now let me tell you what this five step process is.

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
First of all

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,760
he said that the appointment

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
process of the Election Commission of India, the

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,519

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
three members in the Election Commission, their

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
entire appointment process was

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
tampered with.  You might remember that

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,080
a decision had come from the Supreme Court because

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
if you look from independence till now, the

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,720
members in the Election Commission were

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,319
basically directly

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
selected by the government.  So there was no problem till now.

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
But the matter actually

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
went to the Supreme Court.  It was said that this

108
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,959
is a constitutional body.  How

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,120
can the government appoint someone, that too

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
regarding things like elections.  So the Supreme Court's decision

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
came and said that yes, this is correct.  So we are

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
forming a three member committee here.  There will be a

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,919
leader of the opposition, there

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
will be a Prime Minister and there will be the Chief Justice of India.

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,880
Ok?  So these three members will select

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,120
who will be the member of the Election Commission.

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,840
But the government brought amendments.  The government

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
said that no, it is fine to have an opposition leader here

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,360
but the Chief Justice of India

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,680
should not be there and instead,

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
some minister of the government will be there in it and

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,479
regarding this, Rahul Gandhi's first allegation is

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,880
that his own person has been

124
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner for the first time.

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,479
Then in the second step it was said here

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,800
by Rahul Gandhi that

127
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
fake voters have been added in the elections that took place in Maharashtra.

128
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
You must be aware that before every election, there is

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,800
an electoral roll which is

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,360
released by the Election Commission of India, in which are

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
written the names of all the people who will vote and are

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
eligible to vote.  So,

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,479
fake voters have been included in this role

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,600
in large numbers.

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,600
In the third step, Rahul Gandhi said that an

137
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,919

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
attempt was made to show the voter turnout artificially, i.e., in a wrong manner.   That

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,680
means, suppose only 45%

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
people voted in the election but it was

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
deliberately increased to 60%.  Meaning,

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,080
voter turnout was deliberately increased.

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,639
Then bogus voting was done here.  Rahul

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,520
Gandhi has said that in the fourth step, the

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,400
BJP and the Election Commission together have conducted bogus voting multiple

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,800
times through fake IDs,

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,680
especially

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,080
in the urban areas where the Congress was very strong,

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
so that the Congress candidate could be defeated. At the same time,

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,759
it has also been said in the fifth step that the

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,960
CCTV footage and the EVM

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
metadata have been tampered with in a wrong manner.

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,280
Meaning, his data has been kept with held.   has been

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,160
tampered with so that any

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,360
irregularities

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,759
cannot be traced.  So, through these five steps, the

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
entire Maharashtra election was

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,400

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
turned around by the BJP and the Election Commission of India and was made

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,440
in favour of the ruling party.  So basically Rahul Gandhi's

162
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,000
demand is that in his article,

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
he said that

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,280
first of all there should be full public disclosure

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
of the voter roll.  It means that whatever consolidated

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
voter roll was prepared should be

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
revealed publicly and along with that the

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,600
CCTV footage of the polling stations should be

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
released and a detailed

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,000
explanation was sought from the Election Commission of

171
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
India as to how they have

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
maintained transparency, this demand was made here by Rahul Gandhi.

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,919
Now it is obvious that after

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,160
seeing this the Election Commission also

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,479
responded immediately.  The Election Commission of India

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
strongly

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,280
rejected the entire allegation made by Rahul Gandhi and said

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
that this is a very upsetting and irresponsible

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
statement by Rahul Gandhi and is, in some

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
way, the

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
biggest insult to the democratic institutions and the voters.

182
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
This is what the Election Commission of India

183
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
said here and they also said that the

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
revision of the electoral roll was

185
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,440
transparent.  Basically, Rahul Gandhi is

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
claiming that

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,440
if there are 5 lakh voters here in the Lok Sabha elections, then

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,919

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,520
how did this number suddenly increase from 5 lakh to 7 lakh?  Meaning such allegations were

190
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
made by Rahul Gandhi.  But here the

191
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
Election Commission of India says that

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
whatever electoral roll was prepared was

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,400
done in a very transparent manner.  Meaning,

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
involving 1 lakh booth level

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,440
agents was done in front of the public.  The booth level agents go

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,440
door to door and then make complete

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
preparation there.  And keep in mind that

199
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,840
all these booth level agents are

200
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
through political parties.  I mean,

201
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160
whichever candidate is contesting from BJP or Shiv Sena,

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,319
he

203
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,720
posts his booth level agent there

204
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
and everything is prepared in front of them.

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
So this was what the Election

206
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,560
Commission of India said.  Secondly, here

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,120
he said that low number of appeals, when we were

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,199
preparing the entire electoral roll here, then

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
objections etc. would happen,

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
suppose you have some problem, you

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
feel that some rigging is taking place, then you

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
will object at that time, but the Election Commission of

213
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,599
India says that very few objections were received

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,360
regarding minor things.  So this clearly

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,759
shows that there has been no irregularity of any kind here.

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,919
Then along with this,

217
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
observers were present here and were

218
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,479
strictly monitoring things.   It

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,719
means that multiple rounds of polling took place, on the

220
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,360
day when the elections were taking place and people were voting, at

221
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
that time the monitoring was done in a proper independent

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,519
manner in front of independent observers,

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
how the entire election was conducted,

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
so all these things of

226
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
Rahul Gandhi were in a way rejected

227
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
by the Election Commission of India and see, yesterday as soon as

228
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
this thing comes from the Election Commission of India,

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
immediately a statement from Rahul Gandhi also comes

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
on Twitter, you can see that

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
around 7:00 pm yesterday, he

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
responded and said, look,

233
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
Election Commission of India, you are a

234
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,160
constitutional body.  This is not how your

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
response should be.  Meaning, I am

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
asking a very serious question.  So

237
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,080
you should answer in a very serious manner.

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,560
He said if you have nothing to hide then

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,720
answer my questions which

240
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,680
I have written in the article.  And prove it here that

241
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399

242
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,040

243
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,279
you should publish the entire consolidated digital machine readable voter roll.  Ah, the

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,640
Lok Sabha elections as well as the Assembly elections that have been

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,640

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
held in all the states including Maharashtra and Haryana.

247
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Because you know that Congress had lost in Haryana also.  Apart from this,

248
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,120
Rahul Gandhi made a specific demand

250
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,200
that the

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,839
CCTV footage of Maharashtra polling

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,399
booth after 5:00 PM should be released.  And he

253
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,480
also said that the questions you are trying to invite will

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,360

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,000
damage your credibility.  Meaning, if you

256
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,080
tell the truth then you

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
can save your credibility here.  But whatever it is,

258
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
this issue has become quite political and

259
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
now a counter has come from the BJP side as well

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
and the BJP has accused

261
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Rahul Gandhi of

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
undermining the democratic process of India.  There is

263
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
a narrative of victimhood,

264
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,600
after losing the election you

265
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,839
play the victimhood role, saying that the election was rigged.

266
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
That's what you're trying to create.

267
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,560
And BJP also alleged that

268
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,640

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
you are copying George Soros' playbook so that

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
you can spread propaganda in any democracy.

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,200
Apart from this,

272
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,519
responses also came from senior figures of BJP.

273
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
Amit Malaviya said that the

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
claims made by Rahul Gandhi here are in

275
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
a way trying to remove the faith of the public

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,680
in the institution.

277
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,480
JP Nadda, he mocked him here.  The

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,120
five-step guide says that this is a

279
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,279
kind of attempt to hatch a fake election conspiracy.

280
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,880
Devendra Fadnavis, who

281
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
is the CM of Maharashtra,

282
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
called Rahul Gandhi's claim nonsense and

283
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,040
said that this is a big insult to the voters.

284
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
Look, overall this

285
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,519
is the conclusion, what is its significance?

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,440
What is its implication?  Basically, whether things went

287
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
right or wrong, when you

288
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,959
make an allegation, whether it is proven later on or not, it does

289
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,680
n't matter.  But somewhere

290
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,600

291
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,880
you will see a big crisis in the democratic trust.

292
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,000
Meaning, a deeper issue here shows

293
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,240
that the opposition parties are continuously

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,480
raising questions about the election process.

295
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
And because of this you will see the current crisis right now.

296
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Now it is possible

297
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
that in the upcoming elections, the

298
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
next Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2029.  In between there will

299
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
be elections in many states.  So

300
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
these things will come up again and again all the time.  It is

301
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
possible that if the matter reaches the Supreme Court then the

302
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
Supreme Court may say something like

303
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,560
release the CCTV footage etc.

304
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,240
And see, this also creates an international perception.

305
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,720
I was telling you whether

306
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,959
things are proven here or not.  But

307
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,680
it will also be said internationally that look, the

308
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,600
main opposition party is

309
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,959
raising questions about your election process.  So

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,959
a consensus needs to be reached somewhere.  And

311
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,480
things should be taken forward in a balanced manner

312
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,640
so that the

313
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
democratic process of India

314
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
remains safe in some way.  Repeated questions like this

315
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
mean this should be ended once and for all.

316
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Doing this thing repeatedly like this

317
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959

318
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,639
seems to be a big setback to the democratic process.  So this

319
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,240
was the complete video and before leaving, can you all

320
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,480
ask an interesting question that

321
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
how long is the tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner of India?  What is their term in

323
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
office?  You all know its right answer.  You

324
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
will find it on my Instagram.  If you are not there, no

326
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
problem, you can get the correct answer from twitter.
