1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello Friends.  Friends, just a while

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,840
ago the news came that the western part of Iran is

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
completely burning.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
Literally.  The reason for this is that if you look at this map

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
of Iran, then Iran had deployed its entire

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
air defense system strength

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,879
on the western side.  Because

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
from the eastern side there is no major threat to it.

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,200
So it is obvious here that

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
Israel could have attacked Iran at any time.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,680
So their entire air defense

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,239
system which they had installed here was

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,879
completely destroyed by Israel.  You

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,440
can see this news Israel Completes Wide

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,360
Spread Operation Against Air Defenses in

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,799
Western Iran.  So there is a

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
need to understand this in a little detail because

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,000
keep in mind that Israel says that it is

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,400
just the beginning.  Meaning that this is just the beginning

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
and Israel has a big

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
plan here to destroy all the nuclear

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
sites of Iran.  Because this is a

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,280
long-running war.  You need to understand carefully

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
because Iran will also retaliate now.

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,119
Israel will conduct its entire operations here.  Let's

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,640
see what happens regarding this.

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,479
But we will understand this in detail.

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
Let's move on.  Look, first of all

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
if we see what exactly has happened here.

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
We are talking about Western Iran.

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
And if you look at Western Iran,

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,079
if you look at this map, you will

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,640
see many provinces.  But

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,840
especially this province, if you look at

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,600
Kerman Shah, just next to it

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,079
you will see Hamdan here.  And this is

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,880
Tehran.  So the western part of Tehran,

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,880
this entire area had an

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
air defense system

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,320
installed by Iran.  And it is being told

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,759
that

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,799
Operation Rising

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,119
Line was launched this morning by Israel as part of its massive coordinated air offensives.  Under that, the

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,440
entire Iranian air defense system

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,599
installed here was destroyed.

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Completely destroyed it.  And there is a

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
need to understand carefully what is Israel's objective

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
?  What does Israel say?

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,760
What will Israel basically do from here?

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,120
Because this air defense system is over.

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,680
So now, Israel can easily strike deep inside Iran

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
through its missiles on the various nuclear

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,400
sites there, whether we talk about Irshan or

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
Nathanash, or

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Tehran.

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,560

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
And this is

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
somehow a big plan of Israel that

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
first they had to destroy the air defense system

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
and now they are going to launch a big strike

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
on Iran.  Apart from this,

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,080

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,239
they also

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
wanted to destroy Iran's early warning and interception capabilities.  And they wanted to

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
prepare for future operations on

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,200
nuclear enrichment facilities, missile

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,280
bases and command centres.  So I hope you can understand

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
how important these air defence systems are.  For example,

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
you might have seen that during Operation Sindoor,

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
India destroyed the

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
air defence system in Lahore, Pakistan.

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,159
So that in itself is a big thing

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
because without an air defence system,

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,640
neither will you be able to carry out a proper air strike

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
nor will you be able to stop the air

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
strike coming on you from the enemy country.

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
So the question here now is,

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,599
what basically has Israel

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,680
targeted?  If you look here, it is being

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,319
said that there are more than two dozen

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,799
radar systems inside Western Iran.

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,080
Apart from this, there are air defence batteries, for

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
example, the S300

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
air defence system supplied by Russia.  In addition Iran has

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,920
its own domestically developed Bavar 373

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,720
system.  Israel has scored a big hit on all of them.

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
Along with this, multiple missile

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,599
guidance stations

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
and military air bases in western Iran were

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
also disabled and damaged.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,319
Apart from this, Iran has its communication

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,200
infrastructure through which Iran was

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,519
able to integrate its air defence.

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,159
Missiles that could have been launched here were also

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
jammed and destroyed by Israel.  So

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,720
now look carefully at this attack,

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,720
this attack was not such a simple and

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
small attack.  For this you

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,600
needed huge power.  There was a

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
need for huge support and you see, Israel

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,360

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
deployed around 200 of its fighter jets here and with the help of long range

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,199
missiles and also electronic warfare

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,560
system, Israel

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,960
tried to damage many bases of Iran and

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
then through the fighter jets,

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
200 fighter jets and long range

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
missiles, in

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,880
a way destroyed the entire western part of Iran.

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
So that's why I am saying it is

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,199
burning right now which is the western

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
part of Iran.  Well, in view of this,

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
what response did Iran give?  Look,

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
no one has been able to give a big response yet.  There were some reports

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,680
that Iran had also launched around 100 drones here in the morning.

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,520
And which drones?  Like

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,400
Iran's 136 suicide drone that was martyred.

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,479
Abbil Five Reconnaissance and Strike Drone.

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,720

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
They have launched this attack here on Israel.  Where else have you

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,720
done it?  As you may have noticed, there

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
is Haifa here in the northern part of Israel.  Ok

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,759
?  which is the city.  Apart from this, Telvi happened

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
here.  And at the same time,

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,800
if you see the Negev Desert,

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
you can see many Israeli bases.

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,039
This is the bottom part.  So it is being

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,600
specifically said that the drones that Iran

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,000
launched, were launched in large numbers in the southern part.

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,919

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Israel has not suffered any major loss as most of them have been

146
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
intercepted because the

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
central command of Jordan, Iraq and US, which is behind this, had

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,440
already intercepted many drones

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,680
and

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,520
whenever these Syrian drones were passing through Syria,

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
they were destroyed there itself.  But

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,600
obviously many drones had

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,759
reached Israel as well, due to which some

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,240
minor damage might have occurred here.  Well,

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,639
what was the official reaction from Iran?  Iran

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,440
's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamayni has

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,000
said that there will be severe punishment.

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,960
Meaning they said that this is a huge

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,960
aggression against us and because of this we have put

160
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
all our Revolutionary Guard Corps and

161
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,120
missile forces on high alert.  The

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Foreign Minister of Iran has

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,840

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,479

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,960
called all the envoys of China, Russia and European Union, basically the high commissioners, and has

166
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,840
asked for diplomatic backing.  It is said that look,

167
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Israel has been the aggressor here.  Israel started all these

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
things.  And look

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,639
what Israel has to say?  Israel says that

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,680
very soon, within a few days,

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,759
Iran was going to make nuclear weapons.  That

172
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
means he was trying to make a nuclear bomb.

173
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,080

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
He would have prepared around 15 nuclear weapons.  So,

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,400
we came to know about this

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
through intelligence sources and that is why we wanted to see

177
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,319
that there are many sites here,

178
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
especially you can see that

179
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,960
multiple strikes have been carried out inside Tehran.  In fact,

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
if you look,

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,039
you can directly see that this type of

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,759
air strike was carried out on many buildings of Iran, due to which

183
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,560
many of their scientists and

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,759
chiefs of IRGC were killed here.  Then

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,400
apart from this Naataz happened, Ishaan happened.  There are many

186
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,520
places where multiple air strikes were carried out

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,160
under Operation Rising Line

188
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,120
and that is why Iran and Israel

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
say that our attempt was to stop Israel from

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,280

191
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,199
trying to make nuclear bombs here and enriching uranium,

192
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280

193
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,080
but on the other hand Iran says that

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,240
this is an attack on sovietness.  This

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
is an act of war and we will

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,720
also take this matter to the United Nations Security Council.

197
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
Well whatever it is, now the question is

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
what is its impact?  Look, there will already be

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,240
a lot of economic impact

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,160
but let me tell you, just

201
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
yesterday you must have seen that a very sad incident took place

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
in India, an Air India plane

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,960
crashed in Ahmedabad.  What happens is

204
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,440
that this morning suddenly the news comes that

205
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,560
another Air India plane was

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,960
actually going from Mumbai to London and it

207
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,440
returned mid-way.  That means

208
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,759
after flying for 2-3 hours the plane had to

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,440
return.  So suddenly I couldn't understand

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
why this could have exactly happened?

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Why did this happen?  But then it came to light that the

212
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
air spaces there had been closed

213
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,919
and because of the way missiles etc. were launched, the

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,759
danger had increased and

215
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,759
because of this the flight had to return.

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,840
But apart from this, many more,

217
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,160
as you can see,

218
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,240
many flights like Emirates, Lufthansa, Air India have been

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,320
cancelled here.  Many have had to be

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,560
diverted.  Because Iran, Iraq

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
and Jordan closed their airspace.

222
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
And here, efforts are being made to take the flights

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,240
which are going from Asia to Europe to

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,080

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
here via the Caucasus area and the Arabian Sea route.

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,519
Okay, now the last

227
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,000
question is what is its broader implication

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
?  The first thing is that there is a

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,640
danger of a very big war here because

230
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
due to this regional war, Iran's back

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,360
proxies, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
can all jump into the war now and

233
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,920
apart from this, missile strikes can

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,560
come on Israel from Hezbollah.  The Heitz in the Gulf

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
can carry out anti-ship attacks.  Apart from this,

236
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
another

237
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
implication here is that

238
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
discussions were going on regarding the Iran nuclear deal.

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,040
Donald Trump had also written some letters

240
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,959
to Iran and explained that look, we are

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
offering you these things and a

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,720
deal may be reached somewhere.  But the way the situation has become now,

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,839
it does not seem that any kind

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
of deal will be possible and at the same time the

245
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,120
way IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was

246
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,160
keeping a watch

247
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,880
inside Iran so that

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,279
Iran is not able to make the weapons of nuclear upgrade.  So, that too will be

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,440
abandoned by cooperation somewhere or the other.

250
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,519
Apart from this, you also have to understand that Israel has

251
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
shown its ability here that it

252
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,680
can strike deep inside Iran

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,160
and apart from this, you will get to see

254
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,959
a new phase

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,720
of modern Middle Eastern warfare like electronic warfare drones, air power signals.

256
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
So let's see

257
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
where things go from here.  What

258
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
kind of response does Iran give here?  Then

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,240
what does Israel do?  There is a lot to see.

260
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
This is just getting started,

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
friends.  And before I leave, an interesting question for all of you.  Can

262

which of these countries are members of both OPEC and OPEC

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Plus?  And

265
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
you all know the right answer to this.  You

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
