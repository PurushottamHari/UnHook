The reason for this is that if you look at this map of Iran, then Iran had deployed its entire air defense system strength on the western side.  Because from the eastern side there is no major threat to it. So it is obvious here that Israel could have attacked Iran at any time. So their entire air defense system which they had installed here was completely destroyed by Israel.  You can see this news Israel Completes Wide Spread Operation Against Air Defenses in Western Iran.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail because keep in mind that Israel says that it is just the beginning.  Meaning that this is just the beginning and Israel has a big plan here to destroy all the nuclear sites of Iran.  Because this is a long-running war.  You need to understand carefully because Iran will also retaliate now. Israel will conduct its entire operations here.  Let's see what happens regarding this. But we will understand this in detail. Let's move on.  Look, first of all if we see what exactly has happened here. We are talking about Western Iran. And if you look at Western Iran, if you look at this map, you will see many provinces.  But especially this province, if you look at Kerman Shah, just next to it you will see Hamdan here.  And this is Tehran.  So the western part of Tehran, this entire area had an air defense system installed by Iran.  And it is being told that Operation Rising Line was launched this morning by Israel as part of its massive coordinated air offensives.  Under that, the entire Iranian air defense system installed here was destroyed. Completely destroyed it.  And there is a need to understand carefully what is Israel's objective ?  What does Israel say? What will Israel basically do from here? Because this air defense system is over. So now, Israel can easily strike deep inside Iran through its missiles on the various nuclear sites there, whether we talk about Irshan or Nathanash, or Tehran. And this is somehow a big plan of Israel that first they had to destroy the air defense system and now they are going to launch a big strike on Iran.  Apart from this, they also wanted to destroy Iran's early warning and interception capabilities.  And they wanted to prepare for future operations on nuclear enrichment facilities, missile bases and command centres.  So I hope you can understand how important these air defence systems are.  For example, you might have seen that during Operation Sindoor, India destroyed the air defence system in Lahore, Pakistan. So that in itself is a big thing because without an air defence system, neither will you be able to carry out a proper air strike nor will you be able to stop the air strike coming on you from the enemy country. So the question here now is, what basically has Israel targeted?  If you look here, it is being said that there are more than two dozen radar systems inside Western Iran. Apart from this, there are air defence batteries, for example, the S300 air defence system supplied by Russia.  In addition Iran has its own domestically developed Bavar 373 system.  Israel has scored a big hit on all of them. Along with this, multiple missile guidance stations and military air bases in western Iran were also disabled and damaged. Apart from this, Iran has its communication infrastructure through which Iran was able to integrate its air defence. Missiles that could have been launched here were also jammed and destroyed by Israel.  So now look carefully at this attack, this attack was not such a simple and small attack.  For this you needed huge power.  There was a need for huge support and you see, Israel deployed around 200 of its fighter jets here and with the help of long range missiles and also electronic warfare system, Israel tried to damage many bases of Iran and then through the fighter jets, 200 fighter jets and long range missiles, in a way destroyed the entire western part of Iran. So that's why I am saying it is burning right now which is the western part of Iran.  Well, in view of this, what response did Iran give?  Look, no one has been able to give a big response yet.  There were some reports that Iran had also launched around 100 drones here in the morning. And which drones?  Like Iran's 136 suicide drone that was martyred. Abbil Five Reconnaissance and Strike Drone. They have launched this attack here on Israel.  Where else have you done it?  As you may have noticed, there is Haifa here in the northern part of Israel.  Ok ?  which is the city.  Apart from this, Telvi happened here.  And at the same time, if you see the Negev Desert, you can see many Israeli bases. This is the bottom part.  So it is being specifically said that the drones that Iran launched, were launched in large numbers in the southern part. Israel has not suffered any major loss as most of them have been intercepted because the central command of Jordan, Iraq and US, which is behind this, had already intercepted many drones and whenever these Syrian drones were passing through Syria, they were destroyed there itself.  But obviously many drones had reached Israel as well, due to which some minor damage might have occurred here.  Well, what was the official reaction from Iran?  Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamayni has said that there will be severe punishment. Meaning they said that this is a huge aggression against us and because of this we have put all our Revolutionary Guard Corps and missile forces on high alert.  The Foreign Minister of Iran has called all the envoys of China, Russia and European Union, basically the high commissioners, and has asked for diplomatic backing.  It is said that look, Israel has been the aggressor here.  Israel started all these things.  And look what Israel has to say?  Israel says that very soon, within a few days, Iran was going to make nuclear weapons.  That means he was trying to make a nuclear bomb. He would have prepared around 15 nuclear weapons.  So, we came to know about this through intelligence sources and that is why we wanted to see that there are many sites here, especially you can see that multiple strikes have been carried out inside Tehran.  In fact, if you look, you can directly see that this type of air strike was carried out on many buildings of Iran, due to which many of their scientists and chiefs of IRGC were killed here.  Then apart from this Naataz happened, Ishaan happened.  There are many places where multiple air strikes were carried out under Operation Rising Line and that is why Iran and Israel say that our attempt was to stop Israel from trying to make nuclear bombs here and enriching uranium, but on the other hand Iran says that this is an attack on sovietness.  This is an act of war and we will also take this matter to the United Nations Security Council. Well whatever it is, now the question is what is its impact?  Look, there will already be a lot of economic impact but let me tell you, just yesterday you must have seen that a very sad incident took place in India, an Air India plane crashed in Ahmedabad.  What happens is that this morning suddenly the news comes that another Air India plane was actually going from Mumbai to London and it returned mid-way.  That means after flying for 2-3 hours the plane had to return.  So suddenly I couldn't understand why this could have exactly happened? Why did this happen?  But then it came to light that the air spaces there had been closed and because of the way missiles etc. were launched, the danger had increased and because of this the flight had to return. But apart from this, many more, as you can see, many flights like Emirates, Lufthansa, Air India have been cancelled here.  Many have had to be diverted.  Because Iran, Iraq and Jordan closed their airspace. And here, efforts are being made to take the flights which are going from Asia to Europe to here via the Caucasus area and the Arabian Sea route. Okay, now the last question is what is its broader implication ?  The first thing is that there is a danger of a very big war here because due to this regional war, Iran's back proxies, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen can all jump into the war now and apart from this, missile strikes can come on Israel from Hezbollah.  The Heitz in the Gulf can carry out anti-ship attacks.  Apart from this, another implication here is that discussions were going on regarding the Iran nuclear deal. Donald Trump had also written some letters to Iran and explained that look, we are offering you these things and a deal may be reached somewhere.  But the way the situation has become now, it does not seem that any kind of deal will be possible and at the same time the way IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was keeping a watch inside Iran so that Iran is not able to make the weapons of nuclear upgrade.  So, that too will be abandoned by cooperation somewhere or the other. Apart from this, you also have to understand that Israel has shown its ability here that it can strike deep inside Iran and apart from this, you will get to see a new phase of modern Middle Eastern warfare like electronic warfare drones, air power signals. So let's see where things go from here.  What kind of response does Iran give here?  Then what does Israel do?  There is a lot to see. This is just getting started, friends.
