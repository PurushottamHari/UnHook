00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,799
[Music]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,040
The dessert names may be gone, but the

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,840
Android updates, well, they keep coming.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,639
I've been running the Android 16 beta on

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,679
my Pixel 9 Pro for the past couple days

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
now. Now, if you've been paying

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,119
attention to these updates over the

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
years to Android, you've noticed the

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
trend now is less and less like major

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,840
overhauls and more, you know, little

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,359
subtle tweaks and refinements, little

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
things here and there. And this latest

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,359
update is almost almost purely

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,400
aesthetic, especially in this first

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,920
beta. Matter of fact, there aren't

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,360
really any any big new

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,960
capabilities in this build of Android

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
16. It's more just that it's it's just

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
it's built different. It it just acts a

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
little different. It looks a little

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,800
different. It feels a little different.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
And I like it. You know, they started

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,879
down this path a few years ago with

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,559
material design and then material u and

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,840
then now of course Google has to name

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
everything. So, this latest version is

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
called Material 3 Expressive, but it

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
actually makes sense because everything

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
here is a little brighter, a little more

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,440
playful, and just a little bit more

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,799
expressive. Kind of like real physical

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
objects. So, let's just jump right in.

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm going to give you a tour of this

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
fresh coat of paint that you'll probably

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,240
only ever get on your phone if you also

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
have a Google Pixel. Uh, either way,

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,240
these are my top five favorite new

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,479
things in Android 16. So, number five is

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
lock screen customization. You know,

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
they they say we unlock our phones a h

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
100 times a day, so we might as well

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119
like what we see when we get there. And

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,360
Android 16 has a slightly different lock

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,119
screen picker than 15. You still get

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,880
there the same way by long pressing lock

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
screen and then hitting customize down

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,960
there. But then in here, it's just a

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,119
little more neatly organized. First of

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,600
all, I like this animation here to

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,520
reveal the wallpaper selector. That's

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,360
nice. They didn't have to do that. But

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
from there, then there's the new clock

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
customization. And with this one, all

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
the way on the left here, you have this

55
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,439
slider to pretty drastically change the

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
font thickness from this bold one all

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,880
the way to razor thin if you're into

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
that. But then also, you choose for your

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
notifications on the lock screen if you

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
want them to either be the full list

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,079
with everything or a compact view. The

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,759
compact view is just going to show the

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,759
little icons underneath the time, but

64
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
the full view just shows every single

65
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,040
thing from every notification. And then

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
you can still of course change your

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,959
shortcuts for the left side and the

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
right side. Just everything here. It's

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
not like new capabilities. It's just

70
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,160
more neatly organized to help you dial

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
in the perfect lock screen for you. So,

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
that's a nice little update there. So,

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
then number four, recent apps. Now,

74
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
normally the multitasking menu of recent

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
apps on your phone is not the most

76
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
exciting thing in the world, but I'm

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
putting this as my number four here for

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,720
two main reasons. Actually, I'm going to

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
throw in three. The first is that they

80
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
added this drop-down to every app. And

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
if you click that, it gives you more

82
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,160
actions for things you might want to do.

83
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
And split screen is in there. So before

84
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
you, you know, you had to know to hit

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
the app icon at the top and then find

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
that. I think most people didn't know

87
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,640
about that hidden UI. So exposing this

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,920
to the not so hidden is good. And then

89
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,319
two is the physics. And this one's more

90
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
subtle, but part of a bigger theme with

91
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,560
Android 16 here, which is playful and

92
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,599
reactive physics that makes these

93
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
windows and pieces of UI feel like

94
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
physical objects. So you can see when

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm dragging the window around, the ones

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
next to it also move a little bit. And

97
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
then when you finally release it, then

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
the neighboring windows bounce in.

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
Again, it's subtle, but it's all good

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,560
stuff. And also, shout out to 95 Google.

101
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
They made a video showing the same beta,

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
but on a Pixel Pro Fold. And there's

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
even more fun animations with the dock

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
at the bottom and free form floating

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,280
windows as well. It kind of makes me

106
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
want to daily drive a Pixel 9 Pro Fold

107
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
again. It's all good stuff. But then

108
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
number three, I just decided to throw in

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
at the end is just the you can't feel

110
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,799
it, but the haptics as you're scrolling

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
through these is obviously you can't

112
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,120
like tell through the screen, but it's

113
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,760
like a like a every every one has a

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,959
little hitch point. It's kind of nice. I

115
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,720
like it. But anyway, okay, number three,

116
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,080
customizing the launcher. Now, again,

117
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
it's going to be subtle with this one,

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
so I'm going to hit you with a side by

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
side to hopefully, you know, better show

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
you the difference between 15 and 16.

121
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
But right off the bat, the non-

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
removable at a glance widget, which is

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,480
still non- removable, uh, but it's at

124
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
least a little bit smaller now in that

125
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
top left corner. It's a little bit of a

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,720
slimmer, trimmer font, and also made

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,920
room for an entire new row of icons on

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,919
the home screen. So, there's new grid

129
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,880
sizes available as well. But then

130
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,320
wallpaper customization. So, hey, if you

131
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
know me, you know I like wallpapers. No,

132
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
no shame to that. So, select a new

133
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
wallpaper in Android 16. And at the

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
bottom, you'll see an effect button that

135
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,840
shows up. And if you hit that, it brings

136
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
up this whole customizer just to add

137
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,320
effects to your background. So the shape

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,320
one is pretty straightforward. It

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,040
basically creates a window into your

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,720
background image behind a solid color

141
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
which is picked from the colors in your

142
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
picture. So it kind of matches and you

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
can flip through all these shapes and

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
colors and just kind of mess around and

145
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
it's kind of cool. It creates a unique

146
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,360
look with the cutout. But then there's

147
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,160
also weather, which literally adds live

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
weather effects over your wallpaper. So

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
if I hit fog and then hit next and

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,479
select everything, basically the next

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
time I unlock my phone, there's a bunch

152
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,800
of fog that appears floating across my

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
lock screen and then I unlock and it's

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,840
still there and it takes a few seconds

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,600
and then kind of burns away. The the fog

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,919
parts away. It's kind of random, but all

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,160
right. There's also rain, which as you

158
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,080
can see just rains full screen like that

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
weather app in iOS used to do, or maybe

160
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,880
it still does. Uh, there's also snow,

161
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,199
which has given me PTSD of this past

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,800
winter, but you can do that. And there's

163
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
even sun, which warms up and glows with

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
some moving lens flare across the home

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,000
screen. And this this slider at the

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,320
bottom, you can drag it all the way left

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,880
or right to add more or less of this

168
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,400
effect. And apparently you could even

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
mirror the weather at your current

170
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,240
location if you wanted to. Anyway, last

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
but not least is cinematic. So the first

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
time you try this, you actually have to

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
download a cinematic model from the

174
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,280
internet. But once you check that box on

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
a wallpaper, it just adds some subtle 3D

176
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
motion to your photo. So on like a more

177
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,319
abstract wallpaper, it doesn't do much.

178
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,560
But if you have a picture of a kid, a

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
person, or a pet, then it kind of does

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
this thing where it tries to separate it

181
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
from the background. You know, like the

182
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,680
classic freshman year Adobe After

183
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
Effects project where you make a video

184
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,479
out of a photo. Anyway, I assume AI is

185
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,240
doing this, but yeah, it's fine. It kind

186
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,160
of brings it to life a little bit. But

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,240
that brings me to number two, new

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,639
physics. And it kind of sounds cheesy at

189
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
first, but it kind of this is this is

190
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
more in the expressive thing. Like it it

191
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
actually feels like they consciously

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,759
went through Android and tried to make

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,520
sure more things feel like physical

194
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
objects. So, lots of menus that were

195
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
previously flat are now, it seems, more

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
intentionally separated. So, you can

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
tell that they're all touch targets and

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
separate items. The multitasking

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,600
windows, like I mentioned earlier, they

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
have a little bit of bounce to them and

201
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,440
they engage slightly with the windows

202
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,759
around them, like they have gravity. And

203
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,600
even in notifications, I think this is

204
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,039
where it's the most obvious, like when

205
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,319
you go to swipe to dismiss a

206
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,599
notification, you can feel that it's

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,680
it's not just removing that one

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,960
notification and sliding it out. you're

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,400
like unsticking it from the

210
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,160
notifications around it. And the the

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
haptics that go along with all of this

212
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,479
that you feel is a nice bonus, too. So,

213
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
it really feels like you can tell the

214
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,639
exact point that it breaks the like

215
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,039
rubber band physics and lets you pull

216
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,039
the notification out from the rest and

217
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
swipe it away. It's really well done. I

218
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,520
think it's the best expression of this

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,199
Material 3 style in this whole phone.

220
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
It's completely unnecessary. It doesn't

221
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,280
add It's not a feature that adds

222
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
functionality. It's just it's just feels

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,240
nice. But anyway, this brings me to my

224
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,560
number one favorite new thing in this

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Android 16 beta, and I I think it's

226
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
probably everyone's favorite number one

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,720
thing, which is the quick settings. The

228
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,960
quick settings and notification panel.

229
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
So, I've always been a fan of Android

230
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,840
over iOS specifically because of these

231
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
quick settings, and this update levels

232
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,479
it up again. First of all, on the

233
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
surface, you can see when you pull down,

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
the background is this glassy

235
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,199
transparent overlay instead of solid

236
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,319
like Android 15 was. I kind of love it.

237
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,919
And then there's a big new brightness

238
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,639
slider at the top. And then these

239
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,879
buttons up here are fun. They kind of

240
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,319
they slightly change shape actually from

241
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,759
round to more boxy when they're toggled.

242
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,000
Honestly, not really sure why it does

243
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
that, but it does. And then when you hit

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,840
that edit button, this is where you can

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
jump in and go crazy. So any one of

246
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
these toggles can be shrunken down into

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
half size and then you can rearrange

248
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,279
them and move them around however you

249
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
want and do your own thing. So you can

250
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,200
combine some bigger targets like

251
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
flashlight with some smaller ones that

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,000
you maybe don't use as often. And I'm

253
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
just loving the customization here. And

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
it's funny if you ever slip up and do

255
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
anything you regret or move something

256
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,399
and you don't like it anymore, you can

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
just hit that big undo button in the

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
corner. Very nice. And I'm dead serious.

259
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,760
Like this is one of my favorite things

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
about Android is the quick settings and

261
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
notifications. And this update is it

262
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
feels like someone really thought a lot

263
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,440
about it and considered it. Especially

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
even like this is a subtle thing, but

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
the Bluetooth button here. If you touch

266
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
the larger whole button, it brings up

267
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,720
the Bluetooth menu. But if you just hit

268
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,880
the little logo on the side, that's just

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
a toggle to turn Bluetooth on and off.

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
And once you know that, once you get

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
used to it, that's smart. Like that's

272
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,760
nice. I want I want to have my phone

273
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
dialed in exactly how I want and that's

274
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,240
convenient. So that is my top five. But

275
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
you know what? As a bonus, since this

276
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,760
really is a fresh coat of paint, here

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,640
are all the other little interesting

278
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
things that I noticed are overhauled in

279
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,120
this Android 16 beta. The bottom buttons

280
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
in notifications are bigger. Like the

281
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
clear all button is huge. And then they

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
also added a notification history button

283
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,720
to the left. That's nice. And

284
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
notification settings stays to the

285
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
right. The status bar icons are also

286
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,279
slightly redesigned, including slipping

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,200
the battery indicator to sideways. So,

288
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
it used to be vertical, but this one is

289
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,440
a little bigger and they put the numbers

290
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,200
inside the battery icon and so I think

291
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
it's a little bit more readable. Other

292
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,440
phones do this already, but now it's in

293
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,360
stock Android, too. The app drawer is

294
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
technically a slightly transparent

295
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
overlay as well now instead of an opaque

296
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,720
full screen app drawer. So, interesting

297
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
because we know Apple's going to start

298
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
doing this glassy stuff, too. And then

299
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,320
the whole settings app is aesthetically

300
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,240
updated, but also very much reorganized,

301
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
especially inside of each section, which

302
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
is mostly for the better and very much

303
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
appreciated. And then the new volume

304
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
slider matches the new brightness

305
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,440
slider. So it's the same size as before,

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
but it just has this very clear bar now

307
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,680
at the top where the current volume

308
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
level is. And that's the same throughout

309
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
everything when you jump in that full

310
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,600
volume pane, which now that I'm thinking

311
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,560
about it, I feel like, shouldn't this

312
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
also be glassy instead of opaque as

313
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
well? I don't know, maybe in the next

314
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
beta. But yeah, speaking of the next

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,839
beta, I expect there to be more coming.

316
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
This is beta 1. I was excited to get my

317
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,800
hands on it. It just came out a couple

318
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,279
days ago, but there are more in the way

319
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,480
of actual features as well in Android

320
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,640
16. Things like uh glancible, like

321
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
ongoing notifications. So, very similar

322
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
to what iOS launched for ongoing

323
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
activities. Android is going to have a

324
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,360
version of that too here. And also a new

325
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Find Hub, which is very similar to the

326
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,839
Find My app on the iPhone. It's going to

327
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,320
combine all your contacts and items that

328
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
you keep track of the location of in one

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
single place. But yeah, as of right now,

330
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
I've been totally fine and pretty stable

331
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
testing this beta 1 other than Android

332
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
Auto not working. Uh, but yeah, I'm

333
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
looking forward to more. But this is my

334
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
top five. And make sure you share this

335
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,880
with other people who want to see the

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,480
top five in Android 16 as well. And get

337
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
subscribed for more stuff coming. Thanks

338
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,120
for watching. Catch you in the next one.

339
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Peace.
