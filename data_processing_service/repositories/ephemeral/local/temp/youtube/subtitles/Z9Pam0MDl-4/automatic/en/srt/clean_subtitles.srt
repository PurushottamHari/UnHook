So that's why today's 25 Mid 30s now with these guys. game So this is what we are going to say, what do we need five people for? Can it be done by two people? maybe new work I would need one or two guys for this. so this is There is a problem. That is the question. to myself How does it protect? who will say that brother Is your brother sitting here or how will he remove it? Friend, don't forget all this. they will start with Delusion and ends up with elimination. End Elimination is very painful. dellu is not the From Only. A job crisis has begun In the USA. next year after this job crisis Effects will be visible in India. and because of this We've got a much more brutal, straight Forward and guidance oriented, career Today's teams have created an oriented podcast For. Take a notebook and pen with you throughout this Podcasts need to be consumed. Because This is the podcast you need for the whole job market in India. those who said no That jobs will be lost because of AI The face has arrived now friends. now it's about Leveling up. So this is the leveling up mentality with us today in the studio with your Mukul has made a game plan for his career Rustagi who was an alumnus of IIT Roorkee Is. And he is the cofounder of Class Plus. If You Don’t Follow the Indian Startup Space I would like to tell you that class plus na one Of the Few Profitable Edtech Startups Are. Because of this I felt that Mukul bhai was right He is a candidate. You'll love Brutal Genuine To give educational advice. Arts, Before choosing science or commerce, choose this one Watch the podcast. Own career stream Before selecting, watch this podcast Watch and plan your next 10 years For this, take help of this podcast. Friends, we have covered a lot of career angles. It is covered in this. but in the end i am not a basic The logic is that friend, if you have taken care of yourself Added a tech angle to your business, Business will get a lot of benefits In this era of A.I. of this podcast Before beginning I would like to tell you that the This is basic logic if you know coding then you have already started your career very You are making the people coming more secure for decades because that's what coding is all about Skills not in some skills related to AI It will change but it doesn't have to be good at coding. keeping this perspective in mind Class Plus has started the Polaris School of Technology which is a new It is an edge and modern tech school. a four year old Residential Computer Science Program Which is focused on AI and ML. Polaras School of Technology is made for today's youth To prepare for the coming future. Details are given below. but for now You already knew the end of the podcast Technology is the main area for Improvement. before that whatever you need to know are you as a teenager or a college student You will know about Enjoy TRS through this podcast Featuring Mukul Rustagi [music] Mukul bhai share the truth before saying hi hello I would like to do this with the audience. it is said That there are 14% people who did not get a job last year Removed from Those in the US Who Believe That they were fired only because of AI Went. It is also being said that only the last Around 7 lakh people have been infected this year Are. People have been fired from USA jobs In the market. And you told me one more thing Tell me that to the audience. I Think Fang Companies that are considered to be the most elite jobs Don't go into the world. Any engineer I dream that my friend should go and meet me It happens? Feng Basically Facebook. Now Mang It is called Facebook is now meta. So Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix this type of The companies which are there, these are basically called Banking companies. and the most respectable most There are aspirational jobs. As far as I have read, There have been two rounds of layouts in the past In three years in these companies. in 2025-25 already i think 100 k type to 1 lakh The engineers have already moved out. Who It matches your facts exactly. Or Only 35% of the codes are being automated. So new work There is so much new work left to do. New work is Ltd. and its a ceiling. And this we I saw it two years ago when the tech crash happened When NSD fell in the US then it happened with great fanfare He was laid off but then people felt that Dude, this is a unfair reaction that the company To save cost she is doing it on her own has to show profitability so that its share Price increased but there is some other game going on The game is going on that what do we need five People can be done by two people and the remaining three How much new work people will do, maybe new If you need one or two people for the work then this So there is a problem and here we are just coders Not talking about everybody job is in danger aa this is not the case in hindi Conversations are very important because I agree please correct me if you Désirée. I believe that the things that It happens in USA, one year later in India It starts happening. A generally media wise this is it It happens. But I believe that every This is what will happen in the industry. so the coming one Today from the perspective of Age in the year 2026 There will be a lot of things especially For students. But those who are young They are professionals and they have a lot to learn You will read it through today's podcast. We have so much I have created all education based podcasts. Where we talked about upskilling Is. This is how it works for AI I do preparations etc. but honestly The job crisis which is going on in the world now. this is a very cataclysmic working situation For professionals. Game in that chaos right now How to make a plan? what should be the strategy Needed? I hope that by the end of this podcast Let the audience know that. you say something Would you like it? No, I think it is very important too Is. Because the career that is in the mind of 90% of the youth There is a definition of it, it is this. They They think that I can get a job in this Let me go, let an appraisal be made, let a title be made After that, life is set. Life Set It does not happen. so career is a 20 years Sprint. There isn't even a sprint. Marathon It is actually. and unlike a lot of others Professions. Ah if you talk about cricket will you talk about bollywood or will you be late Will you talk about the artist? this is not the case with all these Career is finite. mean 10 15 mean It will last for 20 years. butt which is a normal what do you call a person who is He earns his living on a daily basis The career spans for 40 years. we then and now they He will think that I am here only for my career I will do the same thing about it that I had first thought about I will get a job. now it will be like this again That each job will last for 40 years. which we Everyone's parents have done it. but then on that There is no infinite growth. because There is capitalism, there is inflation, your Technology is changing. so i think The first thing is that whoever is listening no he should realise that a Professional career is the longest sport That any human plays in life and its At least a 30-40 year sport. unlace that Uncle, do you do something that friend 10 After a year you don't need to work fell. but for that then you have to Disproportionate risk will have to be taken. His and we will talk to you about that risk How do you take it also? Ok? so for teenagers Let's set a game plan for that. But that Before we talk about the game plan You were born in 91. I was born in 93. Our All the friends who have just gone to the US For Masters then Job after Masters Do it and earn a lot of money. a lot of them now People have had LEOs. and all of these They are smart people, capable professionals. What were their mistakes? Explain this. friend so Let me tell you why these people used to go out? So everybody wants that after 5-6 years My quality of life is very strong yes. Now quality of life has become a big generic word. goes. But quality of life is a function How is your locality, friend? Your How are the surroundings? How is your income? The company you are working in How are the prospects? If you need some If you want to move your career then the job economy there How is it? How much financial stability Is? Now what would have happened in the 90s with all this Was? In the 90s it was said that IITs are a Ticket to Ticket to US. after that you are somewhere Also go and apply to a US university Do it friend, look at one thing about Indians That is very true. Indians are best for sure Only at hard working. Ok? you look Not even today's US's most tech Senior executives of companies Or who are the chairmen or CEOs? Is? They are Indians. And that is important because going to that point means going to that level of In the hierarchy, your intelligence or Your spark or creativity doesn’t matter I would do it. it is a lot about how much you Be diligent. how many parents are they The hard work is done. Again she comes to that place is that 16 hours or 18 hours out of 24 If the world's two if he wants he is among the people of geography If it is China or India, we would do the same thing All those who are your friends are mine Friends, all these people have studied well it is there and basically somehow after being rubbed a lot Have reached US. Ok? and that is When they thought that they have done it. they thought that Now I have come here. now my life It is settled. There is great technology here. There is great exposure here. Great here There are opportunities. But what is happening now? With the advent of AI or technology Involvement a lot of roles in He had gone to work and he himself is getting changed. So it's like yaar sport hi change ho Has gone. So if cricket is more important than Test cricket Has he moved to IPL or moved to 2020 If you have done it then whether you are playing Test cricket No matter how good a player you are, when you win the IPL If it works then your bid will not be placed at the top. We vice versa is also not true. then you I have to choose which sport I play Am. Am I playing test cricket or I am playing. You can decide that today too. yes. but as I told you earlier if Think about it, which one can survive alone for 10 years If you want to play sports then you can see it very easily It will be thought that in 10 years people will know about T20 I have to play only this. and i think that is what is happening that even in the US that Is it a sport of technology or other career These are sports, they are very fast We are evolving. And talent grows that fast It cannot evolve from it. end as a result Basically, It is demand and supply ultimately. Change You have to either do your job or your Changing your orders across careers and locations They fall. Then it is happening. I also have enough I have many friends who have gone to the US. don't come wanted. Now I have to come. We are another There is a trend in our age group that very Everyone is going back to college. there There is an education wave again. and this wave too will come to India. Now absolutely. Firstly, its I would like to talk about it. The second question is that right now an Indian student What should be the mentality? to the US should target as a possible destination Or should we target Dubai or India? Should I stay and build something? so now friend Let's start with the second question. so you do whatever in life you want to be As long as you're in the top 1% of that sport If you can come then it doesn't matter that Which geography are you in? I am saying yes, you play the tabla. Doesn't matter In life. But if you are in the top 1% of the world Even if you become a tabla artist, you will Make a great career for yourself. you don't Do painting. Doesn't matter. Butt you Be among the top 1% of painters in the world. You do a podcast. But you are in the top 1% of the world Come on over to the podcast. Your podcast will play. Right? so i think it is less about that There is no difference between geography and graphy Would have fallen. The point is that you don't have to play a sport I have to choose. Look at the history of the Olympics If you see me then it will hardly be like this There will be athletes who have multiple Have won medals in sports. Power Of Focus. It is called power law. So the power law Basically it says the 80-20 rule is what I feel to me every The child should study in class 6th that brother 80% of the good opportunities are in the The world will come to the top 20% of the people. Any You will see in any company, there also it is 80-20 Let's go and see who are the top 20% people 80% are doing creativity or advancement There are. So I think it is about geography The factor is low. The point is that you are for yourself No, what career are you choosing? This makes your The first question that will come up is that what you You are saying people are going back to college Or doing upskilling, certifications We are doing it, we are doing boot camp. what is that are you doing it? He does this but they don't understand it It seemed that the sport we had chosen He is not in the top 20%. so that is why they are reinventing themselves that So that whatever sport I am playing in life Can I qualify for 20% of that? I may or may not be able to do it. So before your career Clarity has come in 10 years. End Based on technological advancement this address It turns out that okay, now the job is gone But maybe this could become a new job. to me It seems half the people haven't even got clarity Is. He has just understood the reality. Because clarity comes when you choose brother i will do that work which is next I can do it for 20 years. But whenever you You will think that I should do a boot camp or should I do a degree so that my next 5 The job should be secured for the whole year. then so friend That will be solved in just five years, right? then 5 years Later you will go and reinvent yourself again. You must have also started this when What did you think when you started out? How many broadcasts will I do? My The ultimate target was that I should go to three gyms Had to start. So fitness content I was starting it. Didn't even think about that Was. Exactly. So again you are layering this. It's a layer decision. you did something Because you need to use it to do something else Was. But I am pretty sure. you did this You would not have thought that friend, let me go for fitness I start the content and my tomorrow reel If it goes viral, you will get views in 5 minutes Then it will feel good. but if you don't have a goal Long Enough. then when you get that instant Instant Gratification and a Societal Validation than what you do what you do next then you are lost and I will tell you that is what happens to the majority of the I am a student, I cracked IIT myself I cleared IIT in 2009 and I have no shame in saying that I was totally lost in my first year because friend it was like that friend for two years I only had one dream that it was I want to do IT I want to do IT I want to do IIT have to do it have to do it have to do it now when When I went there the first year, I Thought what to do now? I didn't even know I had reached my destination. now next What is the plan? So the whole game is that friend As many children as you can talk to today You will do it, his goal is very short-lived. And that is where most colleges also fail in the country to take them ki bhai next 10 What the ears look like. this doesn't last me for 10 years I used to feel that way when I was in college myself That friend, it's okay, at least you are getting your education degree yes but i don't think i need anything practical I am getting to learn it. then youtube's There was no culture either. So I have an actual career Got guidance after doing an internship I did an internship at Ernston Young and I asked the people there what to do friend Needed? If I want to start my own business is it worth spending time in earning young My relatives were saying yes in EY Work and you will learn the business. People at EY You were saying no, actually do business then You will learn the business. Butt from a 2025 lens A I personally feel that as guys in there early 30s it is our duty to For teenagers To college students A little bit game plan oriented Make a strategy. So now I would like to audience members take notes with notebook pens Take it. kids who are just going to college Are. friend so the first decision which is taken by the child He takes it, he takes it at the age of 16. Before that, let us see which school he studies in. what are all those parents doing We are giving it. and our parents come from a Very limited points. they did not have a lot of generations who can tell them what we need today The duty has to be fulfilled. Ok? they have as much There was no risk appetite either. and risk Appetite is a direct function of the Implied security you have. As much as yours It is a survival sort, the more you punt on growth You can take it. Because no one is out of the game did not want to. We mean them only Defensive batting was taught. that their The whole generation got involved in this thing, friend Let's survive. so that's our next generation which is basically the middle order Equivalent ones that basically outperform Will do it. Children's education is absolutely top notch It will be. That is what led to the middle class of all the parents of this generation in India This generation has educated us so well that Every person has a stable job. But if you say that if you rank India by the The number of millions they have and the billionaires they Have that not happened. Because people don't own I kept solving zero to one. and one to 10 It never happened. So for a 16 year old kid From my perspective, I think the first mentality should be this You should listen to your parents Naa, filter it down a little bit. Absolutely A little bit of a filter down. Parents some-what You are saying the right things. some things wrong They are also saying it. because he is of his generation I am giving you advice from this perspective. Absolutely. I think every child should know no Go to college, first of all Parents should be thanked. So when you If you say one thing then there is pride in you too it will come friend now I have an opportunity Because of my parents. and the next From day one you can multiply that opportunity by 10X would you rather think about doing this You will think that friend, this is definitely an opportunity. What should a 16 year old write in that notebook? To the child? first you should write it down that friend i know that after 10 years i will What to do or not to do. And know it There's no shame in not knowing how to do it Came. I understood it only after I reached my third year. I came to know that I have to do numbers, do trading Are. And then I went into trading a lot. I enjoyed it for 2 years. but then understand I came to know that there is a lot of work involved in business because what did I have in life that Do I want autonomy or independence? I have to create something. I have to create No, I don't want to do management. So five point A 16 year old kid should first of all So, I should write in my life whether I I know it or I don't know it. if he knows it then So brother, he will take choices accordingly Which stream should I choose? Then The second level will be which college should I go to Should I go? Third will be what type of people I am with May I meet you? Infact Ranveer if people are getting the right If I want to understand the meaning of education then If you want to solve your education then you Decide what type of people you like I have to meet him. We want to play guitar because you Nor can a guitarist teach. So The first rule is do what you know what you want to Do's and Don'ts. That's the first honest question. And most of all I think 99% actually It won't take place. You know, this is the game here. His ego won't allow him to do this to admit that they don't know What do they have to do? Because the parents I have told you that you have to do IIT Is. So they think that we are here only for this Are made. Otherwise he was our brother. They 15 lakh package for software engineering Took it. This is what we have to do. give here Bhaiya's advice is that ideally you should Know what you want to. 100% because you Don't know what will happen because of AI. What all will not happen. You don't even know that Whatever your career, it is what you are. You Start playing test test matches. 15 years After that the format will not remain. What should I do? We can no longer say this; we add confusion to the 16 years old. to unconfuse the 16 years Old. Basically your own personality Should there be clarity or should we explore? The world needs to try different Internships. I think this is 100% me that friend Everyone has to go and work in the industry Needed For us and him you will be 22-23 years old You should not wait. We are the kids It feels like, friend, I am just 17. If I go into the industry, I will be a small We will see. What should I do? Because A little image had also been created that friend Organize a party for the intern He does. He brings the coffee. friend not all this Is. Ultimately the sooner you become an industry I will take you there. Ok? a little bit You will face a few setbacks on the first day It will also feel very out of place. you this It will also seem that you don't know anything. but the The journey of finding and the journey of getting Knowledge starts from the first step of Realizing that you don't know. and that is Still good. us and and even if you haven't Do you know what will happen if you learn it? you have life's The most important thing will be understood Which is called clarity. You are four painters If you stay in the middle, you will understand that Do I want to do painting in life or not? Have to do it. hum which is our first step to figure it out and that's what I feel The Journey of Finding What You Want to Doo. It is not a linear journey. that journey it comes from a lot of stages where You realize what you don't want to do. Hmm. Hmm. So step one is cancelled out. Step one is preparation for JEE No? One principle is taught in JE Selection by elimination. that MCQs The questions have come. There are four options. Me I don't know the answer but I am going to try out each option one by one. I keep cutting. then one or two in the last Options will remain. I am the best possible friend in that That should be done in life. it seems to me Everyone should prepare for JE. Not Because he wants to go to JE, IT I have to go. friend the kind of framework that teaches you the way your life should be moldering, that perseverance, That rigger is very valuable. I Think about these fat pay packages that you get or When someone says that friend I should go to IIT I want to hire, they are actually hiring because OF JE, NOT IIT. 100% that the kid I have cracked JEE. not not the education in Those four years. You tell me friend we are We run the company. you tell me that Dude, this one is an IIT graduate. It has He is late graduate from IIT Delhi or this is an IIT this is a kid Whose all India rank was 500. Butt her after that he did not do anything with lets or this Didn't he go to IIT or did he do something on his own? I was doing anything in life. i will take it From an employer. both on my mind That the respect and weightage will be the same. J There is probably a sign of wear that These can be used for rubbing. 100% 100% because The employer wants that my friend The guy should come and work for 15-16 hours. We who are these The pre-AI version was the AI ​​of today has made the same change. So you saw There must be many corporates who do you penalize people on timing or Then basically they say that you will have six days I have to come, I have to come in five days. So people are artists No, we did not hire anyone. Hire a Work Horse First used to do it. Now the smart entrepreneurs who Those smart companies are artists We are hiring. They hire creative people I am wondering who the brother is that friend who has been there for 10 hours what is the work friend it means it will be done in 10 days Don't do the thing in 2 days. not because Friend, I have more work to get done. because brother again If he has 8 hours left then he will also Will you think what else I can do? Am. Now when he thinks about it, his life too It will be better. His horizon will also increase and The company will also move forward. hard work these days I will not save your job. Your efficiency will save the job. Efficiency will save, Creativity will save us, productivity will will save. These are the things we will save one more time Practical layer on this. 2025 and 26 From context, I think the skill is to Be Learn is Understanding AI Literacy and AI Agents. Because of these two factors I think someone Human efficiency can increase a lot Is. At the workplace. Absolutely very much my friend You mentioned the address point. It seems everybody Which tools should you use in life? So Are you talking about AI, ultimately GPT or something else? Also tell me what is it? These are the tools. when you you use tools that is basically the The biggest let out of your creativity that Brother I am using GPT in English or I am using GPT for learning to make such an app for people Who can teach them English. Both Things are very different. Right? Ultimately both people do their work. have been. But some people do they better in right. And the Beautiful Part About Technology as a tool is that it does not discriminate And different technology is the greatest Leveller leveller in life. and that is why when When these parents say that friend we You will not give mobile phones to children, friend You are clipping their wings. Whichever parent Will not give all these tools to children. They Parents can do bad things to their children have been. that's good so coming back to the Notebook and Formula. The first is mentality Bring clarity on cancellation. selection by Elimination. secondly if possible then do an internship because From that you will learn about your strengths and What are your weaknesses and what do you want to do? Yes, in life. Third Point AI Tools Use it more to increase your AI literacy And your efficiency will increase in your workplace In. You can still do this as a teenager. Tell me this simple playbook. Ok. Elimination, Industry learning and bringing the tool into life and then you keep doing this loop again and again and like with in a few iterations you Turns out we are real superstars okay. Fourth I would like to add a point and please disagree With me if you don't think it's valid. But End Media in the world of content creation there's a ground rule in the world of Create more than you consume. As much as yours Your output must be more than your input Needed and i feel that age 16 is a good age To Experiment With Personal Content Creation. because that's because of the feedback loop How your audience is reacting to you With the content. He teaches you a lot Retention can be about sales About marketing. a and generally that How is the world changing? what are the trends Are they there? You will learn all this. so thats just a fourth bonus point i would want to Add. 100% friend, I mean fundamentally I agree that this physics in school, They teach chemistry and maths three or four times things that I feel and Ranveer you Tell me that if you make a curriculum for the country then What all would you add? like it seems to me Everyone should be taught sales. make whatever you want Take it in the world. Like, people call that Steve Joss Was the Greatest Entrepreneur Because he made a sexy phone called iPhone which Removed the keyboard and the apps arrived. no, he Was the greatest marketer, of all times. You can go to any college, any You can also study and do any project Ultimately when you are in the final round of the interview I sit there and you are doing sales, which one? You know on time who the product is The products themselves are the second thing is What type of people do you deal with in people management? when are you talking to like zenzus is very It feels cool to go and meet any founder yo satish we love the company bro you are rocking let's work together dude that Isn't how you necessarily work through. Correct Is? You will have to learn his IQ. You have to learn empathy. To you You will have to understand the opportunity. I am not anyone Talk to a very senior technical person Had been. I went to the US. They were from Google They. Ok. I asked him I said Why did Sundar Pichai become the CEO that I meant So, I have read that IIT He was from Kharagpur and he was a product manager Were. They say that there are thousands smarter than him There are engineers in Google. But it used to be that whenever Google searches Europe's Google There is some war going on with Indonesia, friend. Now there are many cross border teams There will be conflicts. Ok? their culture His point of view itself said that friend If Sundar Pichai enters a room After that, the fight that is there ultimately It will be solved. and says that Skills for a Non-Founder to Have Because The founder, by his position and authority, These can align. but an executive for then he has to take the bid for everybody and still take them all along and Convinced. Ok? That is basically why Sundar Pichai says Become the sea of ​​Google and if that isn't People Management Ranveer then People Management What is? so i think something else This should be taught. The third thing if I which makes me feel that friend, in life every The child should learn. big in india there is this thing which is called Financial Management. The parents say Friend, money should not be given to children like that. You won't believe how many people you consider your own Don't know how to manage personal finances. Buddy You won't believe Ranveer our company The average age in our company is 28-29 years Is. 60-70% of people do not know that Brother which investment positions and how Let's calculate. what tax There are implications but nothing comes out. so i Think Apart from the Beautiful Framework that you give I think these three things if every Any child will learn it, look at you How much more will that add to your resume? I don't know. but in your life No matter how many moons will appear, they will not be four. They There will be only 16. hum hum ok so just started as a 17 year old Play lightly with money, lightly it will pay off for the rest of your life okay We have reached the mark of Age 18. Age 18 because before we talk about Career selection starts here I would like to highlight one subject The name of the subject is Failure O Specially JE Rejection because of which people thought that friend My career is over. Not True At All. What would you like to say about JEE rejection? about? tell me this first. it seems to me If you are rejected then I will give you three I will break it into parts. Basically 10 lakhs People give JE every year. You give them three Break it into parts. The first 10,000 children Who got selected in JE. From lats Then comes your Rs 10,000 to Rs 5,000 kids or kids with 1 lakh and then come Rank from 1 Lakh to 10 Lakh. these three There are types of children. those to whom it happened So it's done. very good thing. about them I will talk about it later. Ok? Now Those which are between 10,000 and 1 lakh, these are the most There is a possibility that friend, they will stay for 2 months The preparation fell short. Ok? or let's say that The day didn't last, friend. means the greatest Players get out for a duck in like the Biggest Matches. Ok? It doesn't work. So, these are those kids. these people What do you learn? These people don't rig my life Opportunity Cost and the Value of Emotional Intelligence is learned. It doesn't matter no The paper did not come out, it does not matter. you don't They work for 12-15 hours with passion and obsession You have learnt to do it. do whatever you want tomorrow You know that 10,000 hour rule. So 10,000 hour rule would be explained to the audience friend you can do any work in life Do 10,000 hours, then you mean 1% of it I will come into the world. we come again Friend, 1 lakh to 10 lakh. For these Rejection is a blessing. because you don't I have found out that friend what are you not Interested in? either what are you not Interested in what you are not capable of off and what is the sport that is not mentioned For you for whatever reason. These are three children. Ok? so i Think about these kids earning Rs 10,000 to 1 lakh. Well, maybe he should give it one more attempt I will give. Ok? Generally these people go to good colleges Let's choose them and try one or two. We do. These are the rest of the kids from 1 to 10 Don't they go to some random college In. Ok? After that no friend Ranveer The whole factor of their life is complete Career in Treasury is defined as that 4 years what do I do? And I think the first the thing that people should be okay is that if they I have got rejected from IIT over a 20 year ago Year career thing it is one batch. We you My friend Sachin also won six World Cups in his life Have played. You will also get that many opportunities. Butt guys what We do? People get so frustrated. 17 He is a one year old child right? What did you tell him? goes? If there is no IIT then we will get auto He thinks this is my first and final It's a match. I wonder if it is still said Because I remember our time a lot It was said that if you get admission in IIT If you don't get it then your career is over. but i hope That teenagers today are more informed. I I really hope so many questions This is for all 12th standard students in hearts and and I am also talking About non engineer ok a 12th pass Which stream should I choose after this How do you decide friend, look at the two types These are the people who need clarity in life Or those who don't have clarity. Ok Look at those who have clarity, my friend I want to choose arts I want to choose commerce If they want to do science, they should do what There is no clarity. Ok? those who have life there is no clarity then they can solve it Probability. then life is a function and How you balance your life is a function of Clarity and Probability. if you achieve both then you are absolutely destined for Greatness. but yaar clarity or your path is based on one of the probability Should go. Don't go between the two Needed what has happened in India now Look at those who don't have clarity. which is Majority of the kids. then the index let's look at the probability of getting a Job. Last 30-40 years and next 50 years also It will work that technology is the biggest The sport that you have. now in that sport If 10 lakh engineers are produced every year If there is possibility then your probability is quite high it's better than picking up a dying Sport where there are only 000 professions There is need. That is why our parents are very You did the right thing 15 years ago If you don't understand something, friend, you should take science because by doing science you You will do engineering. if you do engineering You will get an engineering degree. over there You need some structuring and all you will have an analytical mind and then Yours is in Quant or Technology One or the other job will be confirmed in me or TVF BA Biceps me job mil jayega That is absolutely correct because even in the media best professionals are engineers but then That's why our parents used to do this, friend Go into any analytical field. that friend once if your maths is good Your structuring is right in your life you can do segregation You can do compartmentalization can you process it analytically Relate Numbers You Can Think Into Frameworks You can solve equations in life everything This is an equation ultimately so friend you go ahead If you go for engineering then I think that That it will not be very relevant even in the next 50 years The thing is that job creation is technology it will be in me only means a field bigger than that right now basically if it has not yet come to humanity don't know what to do or So take engineering or something science related stream yes how to do that i I will tell you then you should take engineering I had taken it in such a way that even I did not know what to do now after that comes your The biggest turning point in life Engineering takes four years. if you If you do anything for four years, you will really do it Great at that. So that is what I say, I did the same thing when I went to ID. I tried to join a lot of clubs I had tried. I also attended Cinematics Club I joined. I also have an audio club I joined. I also like lighting whiting Had to understand. So I said play all the games Let's see. let us try all the Sports and then maybe we'll figure it out. and you have to go with probability and hope in that that's your probability of Picking up the right sports for you is directly proportional to the number of The sports you play. hmm you also mean if you did fitness fitness i am pretty Sure you have done something in engineering you might have started it or your content If you have affinity towards that side then maybe you will find that quite interesting or meaning how do i say You might find it interesting that brother this is this This is a great thing. At least you can choose your interest You are identifying it, right? one a lot Basic human logic is that any activity If your energy levels are high after doing That means that activity is for you. Dopamine right? We Ultimately Find Out What gives you dopamine in life? And the one who doesn't know should first go to Google What is dopamine? now after that What will happen? Maybe 3 years in college I don't understand you what to do Is. So again your clarity is not there. Now Who will you solve for? When Clarity If you are not able to find a solution in life then whom should you solve it for? want to do it? Probability. of Probability I have to solve this problem. and one of the probability What event is coming up? next year you You are about to graduate. Now you will find your job It is of this. then you can reverse engineer it In which type of market do you take jobs? Are. I am currently doing analytics, coding Whatever it is, prepare for this job I will take it. Again you have the probability I have maximized it. Then you got the job. Now You know I will do this for two-three years. Give. Optimize for Clarity Again do it. Somewhere or the other my friend is hitting his hands and legs, closed The switch will be pressed somewhere in the room. They The day you press the switch your light comes on and no meaning in your life since day it is the The Most Radiant Moment That Will Ever Come In Your life. Ok? to summarize this full Student Face of Life. because after that We will talk about the current job market. do. But this student is in the face of life Just those age 16, 17, 18 frameworks for you have to run it again and again in my life and Knowing how to handle failure Is. A but additionally a 2025 perspective I would like to give an input that wherever You get stuck in this whole process. use gpt. GPT costs $30 these are the months i think are the best ever Investment for everybody. I am a I would like to suggest this to the audience. Wherever you are stuck, tell GBT that I'm as dash I think my career is going To be in this dash industry. Current I Want to learn this dash skill. there for can you give me a very detailed Game plan to move further? and can you Suggest further questions that I can ask you to gain more clarity on where i want to take my career also please know that these are my goals in life i want a family at this age i want to be living here at this age i want this kind of a salary at age 35 just about yourself Tell me to fill in the data and then let GPT open Coach You Through the Process in an Infact and Easy Way two you just tell gpt that friend you Become my mentor, therapist, counselor, guru and keep asking me questions and whatever I I am going to answer you on the basis of that Formulate it brother what do I mean Kinds of things do I need to do. So First Ask GPT to Decide What You Are want to do and then basically once gpt has reduced then you ask them that friend now You tell me that you have reached your destination. So Use it to find your destination first. Then when you have found your destination then look for the way I can use it. and if you are satisfied If you are not deep with GPT answers then Turn on research and use GPT. a little It will take time but you will get a good outcome. Now in the second half of this podcast we will discuss Will tell about current job scenario honestly also from a 30 something perspective on what happens to our friends Is it happening? because during college It used to be that the people who were smart, who People are hard working, they will be fine through you Life. That has not happened. because of the Unpredictability of technology. do you think that this second half has started Should we do it with AI? Because we have Have created a few podcasts on AI. So far The audience should understand what the tools are? A I would like to ask a question about agents. What are AI agents? because when People are saying that jobs are being lost because of AI Will go away. actually specifically they are Talking About AI Agents. or you quickly Can you explain what the tools and agents are What is the difference? Ok? dude to tools What essentially happens is that you give him an input You will give it and the tool will give you an output. The donation depends on you that you how are you processing the output, where You are doing leverage. do you even discar it And do you even write it. But Agent Is Basically where you downloaded a tool and Flawed responsibility has been given. As You call a call center. Your Do you have a credit card? you picked up Basically toll free to credit card team I called on the number and typed two-three times there. that these are your problems. But let's take your My friend, I have small problems No, I am unable to find the card number or my When will be the expiry date? meri yaar credit Do I need to increase my credit card limit or not? I did not get my points. One type of queries It can only happen. this you are basically Agent software can be outsourced yes. Which is basically called AI agent. So That is what agents do for agents are a proxy of you who are doing the task that R Repetitive and Redundant and Repetitive and boring in and they have to be done in a The prescribed format is provided by your agent We will be okay so I would like to say two things First of all, all the founders and business owners All the AIs I got started thinking agent-oriented are figuring out what we are doing about our company How to increase your productivity the most Productivity from Likely AI Agents But at the same time, AI agents will increase The down side is that people lose their jobs Will go away. So this AI will replace jobs It's down to AI agents. AI agents or So you can either buy it in house You can design and build many People are doing it. There are different purposes. But effectively three four people job together You can go into oblivion because of an AI agent From. A because that is more productive Work there with more efficiency Will get it. So friend, three things happen Too. Agents who define the tools of AI She does. One comes your productivity Because humans have a capacity. Like they can't operate at the same potential for a Long period of time. that productivity With time productivity with time is a Declining curve. Right? so a so ai That's not an issue with the tools. give can Operate at the same productivity for a long time Time. Secondarily Ah Productivity Increasing in an in a tool. that's far easier Than a human. we mean those two You can iterate it in three weeks Date Plus AI Also Keeps Learning From data. Ok? So his productivity She also remains constant with time Productivity also increases. End In thirdly most cases it is also cheaper Then a human's cost. So I believe that I am sure friend, whatever job you do, you should do it for yourself. You do three types of work in your job. Or So you do creative work. you are Thinking something which has never been done. Ok? or do you do mechanical work that You keep doing it, you have to come every day and do the same thing. Have to call 5 customers daily. everyday to them This thing has to be done. and the third is basically Optimizing is the same work my friend I will do it but I will pay lesser cost or lesser I will do it in less time in resources. These The second and third ones are in danger Is. We will do the rest of your creative work If your job is saved then you will do only those things It will save money. everything else then it is a matter of When not an if. We are the ones who made the two spheres take them and fill them in gpt and Ask this by turning on deep research from GPT itself. What AI Tools and Agents Are Currently available because of which all these works May be. Ask Exactly and Directly How can we do it better, faster and at a cheaper rate Cost. We are the best in the world They are professionals and this is what they are doing. But now There are two ways of looking at this problem. A 22 year old student is facing the same problem Get actually excited after seeing the statement You must be thinking that wow what a professional life is full of AI agents I will only have to do Creative work. But people of our age do this Looking at the problem statement, you are thinking that They would think, [ __ ], I will lose my job. Or how do I improve? and at this I would also like to mention this as the point of the podcast I would like that in the wake of job crisis in America At the same time, another trend has started People of our age and older than us Going back to college. learn things back have been. Going back to higher education Are. After doing masters, guys come back Why are you going? people go back so when they realise that what has bought them so far will not take them further Ahead. Look friend, I have two ways of education Can be seen from. Let's do this a little more Let's widen it and this is for everyone I will provide a framework that is applicable. Or So education is your investment. Investment is what you earn from today Better career whichever career you are in How to be three times better than your job Do you want to go? Five times in the next 10 years how will you go? that is basically yours Investment Education. and then there is a insurance education which says that friend who I am also working today because this work Key Expectation Expected Proficiency If it keeps increasing then that bus will keep me Inflationary is to keep yourself updated so that's my job is saved we are the same that is Basically a defense versus attack approach Is. And I know these two types very much. It is visible more. in our company too It is visible. It is seen everywhere. Ok. A 22 What to do now from the perspective of year olds Needed? Masters degree immediately after college or continuously online You should upskill yourself through education To. I'm telling you not to go anywhere Needed First of all, go into the industry, friend. You basically go and work there. To all First you should go there my friend you get a little confidence that now you Be in the industry. now you will learn a new thing had been. You get some networking done Is. We are your little professional upskilling She goes. Because look at your industry Fitment will happen only then what has been torn To you is actually what the industry is Needs. And generally 99% of the world programs include diametrically opposite There is an angle. I mean these 180° opposite things They happen. and unfortunately because they are Not the same. that is the only Alternatives to Learn What You Need to Know Is by going in companies. Ok? One more thing I would like to say from a modern perspective that people are losing their jobs. at the I remember the same time when we graduated Abundance Mindset Scarcity There was a lot of talk about mindset. I Feel that that's true even now. Still Abundance There must be a mindset. Basically Scarcity Mindset means always thinking that friend How will you explain it? Worst case. Yes. Buddy It's a simple thing. Scarcity is a Mindset That friend the ball is coming. I am the defense I will do it because if I go to hit a shot I will be out. Abundance is the mindset that Brother, the ball is coming, let it get out, it will be out But if I don't hit a six then how will I score runs? It will be made and if I get out on zero then Whether I play 10 balls or 15 balls I score a run If it is zero then save your wicket and score runs There are basically two things which you can avoid in absence of From Mindset or Scarcity Mindset You can directly correlate it somewhere Have that belief somewhere that yes it can happen with me It will go only. I will be able to do it myself belief and a little bit of big thinking but the same The question is that those who are 22 years old now he is 23 years old maybe they are also Living in a Little Bit of Fear About This Job crisis which is now going to hit India next year It is of this. How do you protect yourself? That is the question. Look what happened before today Was? Your degree would get you a job. degree She didn't save the job. Hmm. it seems to me Forget about saving for 2 or 3 years from today. Your degree will also get you a job. we we at n Intrinsic level. the faster the world races is basically on as many companies as Is there pressure of growth or is there an opportunity, Companies will only hire you for your attitude And the magnitude of your skills. which is assessment of how much practice you have done You have context, how much pedigree and how much have you performed? You Look, I'm telling you, 5 years from now of one of India's unicorns inside The CMO will be a 25 year old person We are him and he is a 25 year old guy Or is he a prisoner? Do you know what he might have done? I will predict it for you Am. He created his own channel will be. He went to the market Experience different dropshipping types so that they can be sourced, sold He must be coming. They understand creativity very much She must be coming in. Ok? He has a small would have run a production unit that they You must understand what lens is and where it is When all this lighting comes then you will know more why is that necessary? because when he gets this Everything must be known only then no agency would come to them I can't make it. I told you this Gave an example. The point of the game is this That is the creation of the whole thing. anything you want Create it. Create your own product Create a channel, create fitness. Own Create spirituality. some dis create Do it, create a revenue model, business Create or create some new product do it, create some agents, anything Create it. which is the power of creation, that's what you basically need to know ahead of time and It will make you stronger than your age. and i think The Only Way to Have a Sure Shot The probability of winning in life is two Start very early. You have to beat time. and when you say how to be time because the so there is at least a thousand such people There will be those who are running with you in the same race It is at the same speed. So if you have You won't have a headstart or you'll end up somewhere Don't sprint and you'll fall behind You will stay, friend. So now you will say that friend They are scaring me that I won't get a job It will take. If you don't do anything today then yes I think I will be afraid today It is necessary. That discipline is due to fear He will come among the people. and discipline is needed in Order to Protect Jobs. of that notebook Let's talk a little bit about it. We have 16 The guidelines for 22 were given roughly. a spoke About the skills there to focus on. Ok? This is in the age bracket of 22 to 25 where Energy levels have improved a lot. I say this I would like to start creating. Absolutely START CREATING. i think that if You have to work on these skills of creativity So create content quickly with quantity, Release it and let people know that you have done something Thought, did, released, audience said something He said, then you could have slightly changed the direction yes. And the faster you do this, the further away you will get Your career will go away. that's been the case for the the last five years at least in the world of business and definitely in the world of Content Creation. So for this, just three simple Everyone has to follow the steps. First Build, secondly learn and thirdly iterate. Victory That's what you said friend lots of build do it. If you want to build less, do less. More If you want to build, build more. After that Learn it. Learn how to create your feedback loop From. how will the feedback loop come about that whatever your There is a potential customer. now if you are late If you create content, you will have users. If If you work in a job then your customer Most likely your team or your Boss or your actual paying customers Are. Ok? Then go and talk to them, Learn it. It means you can make biryani what are you selling but to everyone in your neighborhood I want to eat laddus, friend. means if you want No matter how good biryani you make, it makes a difference It doesn’t matter. Ok? this is not by the way this Our education system does not teach this. Our The education system teaches that this is the goal There is a point. how fast can you run In this. Hmm. hey, but that round point probably The change has happened. when you take a penalty in football, you never think that Do you think which side will I score the goal? Or You keep looking at the goalkeeper, don't you? This is the last scene, friend, either she will die here, or She will die here. And that's how you have to decide That brother at what point do you move. Basically, In every job from 2025 to at least 2030 We all have to understand that a human's mind How it is changing. for example joe short Content Captures Our Attention Span Do it. Another change of this type is coming. Now Because of the AI ​​wave. the next one or two years Everyone in chat will use GPT. Behavioral patterns will change. Whatsoever way The way people consume energy will also change. I feel like looking at him, friend, look at him again No, there are two kinds of learning. Ok? One is horizontal education. Ok? where you're more like a generalist and everything that my friend doesn't know about aerospace I also know a little about it. to me I also know a little about botanicals. I also know a little about zoology Do you know. I also want to know about the travel I know a little. and then there is something Called Vertical Education. which is like yaar I don't know the rest. to me Only zoology comes. Ok? but then Very well understood in zoology So friend, how do species originate? How does their evolution take place? and and Like different biogenetic stuff in that. A This is the difference between a BTech and a PhD. One normal people like us who have gone through one I have completed my degree. They are generalists. Infact majority of the jobs in India today There are only generalists in the date of . that they A little bit of Excel comes in, a little bit of a little Some marketing might be coming, some customers Success must be coming, a little monetization He must be coming. and then basically you come Deep Hard Core Experts. Ok? to whom Just like computer science is known to everyone It comes. Machine Learning and AI Is Just a Very Small Part of Computer Science. But what happened in the last 5 years Computer Science Engineers are highly respected It used to happen. Now because that is general knowledge Or is it a general capability that has become a commodity? Has been. The same will happen with GBT. so which Those are generic horizontal information So let it become accessible. They Commoditize It will be done. But when you want to go deep in someone Then you basically call experts in the thing Do you trust me? for example example you Your General If you are suffering from cough and cold You can put your general symptoms on GBD brother what type of things will you give me Should be done. But if you have any questions about your surgery If you want to get it done then basically you can do it on a robot You will not believe it because it is highly Critical. It's that why we like PhDs and doctors are so much more valuable and they Will become even more valuable. so what first This has been happening for the past three-four years, Na Jenji's Basically this was the approach that friend we Let's try everything. in our CV There should also be marketing strength. There should also be strength in coding. The product should also have strength. So We know everything. But those who are of old age Old Edge is the master of all jack of none You can see that more after AI It will become relevant. because now people are saying is that friend what you mean is 10% Marketing comes, 10% customer support comes We will get it done through AI anyway. We need someone who knows 90% depth The aim is to make a product. who gets 90% To register a marketing campaign. So Suddenly you will see that specialized work Force will become the norm in any Industry. hmm because if you have to give your money to somebody you'd rather want them to do one task very very good rather than 10 task is slightly good and when you are a specialist You actually become AI agents You can work better with the program is absolutely AI agent will increase your Probability and Reduce Your Time Span To become a specialist and two types of There will be a journalist who will say yaar let's use this technology and avail it to basically become a specialist and do very well In their life. and the second one who will say that brother your brother is sitting here how can this happen Will you remove it? they will start with delusion and And up with elimination and elimination is Very painful. so it's better to prevent that elimination by getting rid of that Delusion Today. Delulu is not the only one Cellulu. So either look at AI as an enemy Or look at AI as a friend. Absolutely. Let's go back to the notebook. Ok? So up to the guidelines of a 22 year old We had arrived. Where We Directed People To Get inu code and content which is also available under Naval Ravikant They say. Interesting. A Target Becoming a Specialist for 24. Now two years of the job have ended. Now! Ask yourself what am I for Should I become a specialist? A Second Point AI Learn about agents and AI agents Work together and advance your career Increase it. Do not reject the use of AI Agents out of human ego. Correct? This only There are two points. and spend a lot of time in That one single opportunity. whatever you are Doing. Now it doesn't mean anything, earlier people used to think so that friend you are putting in all efforts, any effort Are you making a product or creating anything? I am doing it in life. So friend two or three Let's try it after a year. end if even then If it didn't happen then it didn't happen. i think now the The world will move forwards to a space where Pay to create something substantial. Do-Ti There won't be a year's effort. Meaning, you have your If you want to become a specialist in your job too then You won't be able to make it in 2 years. You have no five Will have to do it for a year. That will double your effort It will take place. but the reward you get is because this is Still not the whole 5x game basically Life is all about risk reward ratio. the denominator of us comes down to how much you You are taking a risk. it comes on the numerator that How much reward are you getting? these rewards The higher your risk in life, That's basically the probability of your life And the growth that will happen will be sorted. Hmm okay i don't think we need to talk about the 30 plus age group because actually This should be the strategy that we have presented It's curry. Oh Ah this is my favorite. My Some people think that by 35 you should be in a place where you can choose Weather to work for money or not. we are the people If you say no then it is a big misconception Is. People say that I have to retire. So Do you know the definition of retirement in India? What is said that friend we will not work tomorrow do. Retirement is not the ultimate goal. Optionality is the goal. that you can choose weather You need to work and wether you want to work. The more optionality you create the sooner you will start doing what you Want to do rather than what you have to do. The Moment You Figure Out What You Want to Do then you will start that is the only way you can spend a really long time doing it and i don't know if you have noticed this or A huge risk is going on in Not India Are mid-40 people losing their jobs? the fastest and they are not getting Replacement works because they cost 15-20 The work that was done that year, that stack, that utility That profession itself has been eliminated. and that Ranveer is very scary because he is in his mid 40s I don't have a family, those families are Very critical time for the education of those children it occurs. it is a single biggest differentiator of a phase where which decides The Orbits of the Generation. and at that point Basically huge losses are being incurred. But those people what will you do? I have no idea. give will have to reinvent and either they do some gig or Give it up, then I will not talk to such people have spoken. What do those people do then? They say look friend, now there are only 3-4 years left Are. Our children are 14-15 years old. Any In any case, we basically do something about our 3-4 years I will choose the career part so that my kids Can go to college successfully. And once he Once we reach college, it is our duty It happens. We will see, it means nothing What should I do? but at least kids Education should be sorted. but if means That's a scary thing, man. that is where I want to like an India is a service based economy. Always remember that. Unlikely US which is a manufacturing economy. India is a service based economy. So mid 40s so that's why today's 25 year olds This should be remembered from now onwards. Think about it if If this is happening in 40 years then give it time move forward in their career it is not 20 Years Away With these it will be in the mid 30s. Hum hum yaar I have read one thing related to AI I know that the better your prompt There will be engineering skills. a just as much You will be able to use AI well. own In job, in own business etc. So Work on prompt engineering skills. Prep engineering means basically brain engineering Clarity. Be a clear thinker. this is a core Skill is going to be developed in the coming time. So Probably people who have lost their jobs and are in their mid-40s. Playing with Prompt Engineering in Get started. Absolutely. now that should be the first Step. It is a new piano. New piano. GPD is a new piano. and the new Guitar. Whatever you find sexier? or or So start creating content. Anything Create sir, create anything in life Do it friend. Hmm. Ok. There is one last section. It is important to talk about this section Is. This is a question of my own as well. I I have noticed that if someone needs to know coding The skill comes. Even in today's day where coding is Be gradually replaced through AI Used to be. Still, there is a need for coders. In all tech companies. There are two angles. Firstly, the remaining 65% code Yes, he is human dependent. let's know you drops to 40 30 there still be some Element of human input. but i feel that If you learn coding once, you can Transition to other tech careers more easily. Correct? So this is a very good safeguard Can. But coding takes a little time too Learn. but do you think it's still a high Value skills? I think I don't think Coding is a high value skill. I think It's the Highest Value Skill in Life Today In the Modern World. look absolutely friend which is basically the highest order skill today That's coding. Because you can do whatever you want do some part of your work in life Will definitely require coding. End What is coding? Coding is not a syntax Is. Just like English is a language, Spanish is a There is language. Coding is the language of computers. So Now you have to do some work today If you want to do better on a date than with other people then you You will do it only with the help of computer but How do you talk to a computer? only to you You will have to learn the computer language. that is The Most Elemental Reason on Why Everybody Should learn coding. So if you like coding If you want to learn then either you should You may spend a year learning on YouTube but then you It will take 510 years. The other way is that you Learn from someone who knows how to code himself You do it. Now who is he? it is happening Your software developer. so ideally if you If you want to learn coding then you need a software You have to learn from the developer, right? now it has arrived there The problem is that the majority of India The faculty who is teaching you in the institutions Has he ever done coding? And that's the problem. If you need a specialized Vertical knowledge is required then you should only go in an institution where you will find specialized skills are taught and they Who will teach the skills? live professionals are already working in the industry who Live industry mentors say. So if If you want to learn coding then you should do something like this I want to go to a tech school where the faculty is who still code day and night and today There is a lot of coding to do. because if If they used to code even 5 years ago, then maybe they code And the syntax itself has changed. Cricket It has changed sir. So when the sport is changing If yes then you need to know the currently most relevant The most skilled players in the sport You have to go and learn to play from them. So if If you want to learn coding then you can go live Industry Software Engineers and Those are very powerful because those people Let's code. The same recruit as of today are also doing. Whatever is new in your company Fresh talent comes and we train them too Are. So what's better than that? i have come basically you will end up studying from the Same people who you will be working with after Three four years. hmm ok mukul bhai very much Pacey was an effective and practical podcast These. I think from teenagers to those who People are in their late 20s, at least for them this is the end. There is a to end podcast. when it comes to Career guidance. any signing of notes because we have scared people a lot but Also gave guidance at the same time. No we haven't I have also told you some surefire ways not to be afraid Is. It is necessary to be afraid, but being afraid is not enough. So We have developed some frameworks to overcome fear.
