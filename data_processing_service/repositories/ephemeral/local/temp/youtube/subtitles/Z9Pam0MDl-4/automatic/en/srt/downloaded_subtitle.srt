Sector.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
Everyone's job is in danger. right now that chaos

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
What should be the strategy? 12th class

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Which stream should I choose after that? No

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,080
There was no shame in knowing it. and I

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
will tell you that is what happens to

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Majority of the students who cracked

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
IIT. If you don't understand something then

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,960
you you will do these by doing this. some one job

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,440
It will be confirmed. or job in tvf bf

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,160
I will get it.

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,200
The first thing that people should be okay with is that

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,879
If they have got rejected it is one match.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,079
Friend, Sachin has also played six World Cups.

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,160
You will also get that many opportunities. lots of

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
People have been laid off. their mistakes

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
what was it? With the advent of AI, a lot of

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,239
Those roles, they are changing. and I

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
Don't Know If You've Noticed These Mid 40 People

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,479
Are they losing their jobs? So that's why today's 25

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,320
Mid 30s now with these guys. game

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,240
So this is what we are going to say, what do we need five people for?

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,680
Can it be done by two people? maybe new work

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
I would need one or two guys for this. so this is

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,240
There is a problem. That is the question. to myself

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
How does it protect? who will say that brother

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,159
Is your brother sitting here or how will he remove it?

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
Friend, don't forget all this. they will start with

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,720
Delusion and ends up with elimination. End

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,759
Elimination is very painful. dellu is not the

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,759
From Only.

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
A job crisis has begun

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,119
In the USA. next year after this job crisis

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,280
Effects will be visible in India. and because of this

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,759
We've got a much more brutal, straight

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
Forward and guidance oriented, career

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,079
Today's teams have created an oriented podcast

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,040
For. Take a notebook and pen with you throughout this

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,680
Podcasts need to be consumed. Because

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
This is the podcast you need for the whole job

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,399
market in India. those who said no

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
That jobs will be lost because of AI

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
The face has arrived now friends. now it's about

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Leveling up. So this is the leveling up mentality

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
with us today in the studio with your

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,759
Mukul has made a game plan for his career

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,560
Rustagi who was an alumnus of IIT Roorkee

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,040
Is. And he is the cofounder of Class Plus.

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520

I would like to tell you that class plus na one

58

Of the Few Profitable Edtech Startups

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,720
Are. Because of this I felt that Mukul bhai was right

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
He is a candidate. You'll love Brutal Genuine

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,720
Friends, we have covered a lot of career angles.

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,959
It is covered in this. but in the end i am not a basic

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
The logic is that friend, if you have taken care of yourself

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
Added a tech angle to your business,

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
Business will get a lot of benefits

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,840
In this era of A.I. of this podcast

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
Before beginning I would like to tell you that the

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
This is basic logic if you know coding

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,120
then you have already started your career very

76
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,440
You are making the people coming more secure

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,400
for decades because that's what coding is all about

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Skills not in some skills related to AI

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,519
It will change but it doesn't have to be good at coding.

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
keeping this perspective in mind

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,400
Class Plus has started the Polaris School

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,519

Details are given below. but for now

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,360
You already knew the end of the podcast

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,000
Technology is the main area for

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,239
Improvement. before that whatever you need to know

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,920

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,680
Featuring Mukul Rustagi

95
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:08,860
[music]

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,720
Mukul bhai share the truth before saying hi hello

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,720
I would like to do this with the audience. it is said

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,040
That there are 14% people who did not get a job last year

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
Removed from Those in the US Who Believe

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,160
That they were fired only because of AI

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,840
Went. It is also being said that only the last

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,759
Around 7 lakh people have been infected this year

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,240
Are. People have been fired from USA jobs

104
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,040
In the market. And you told me one more thing

105
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Tell me that to the audience. I Think Fang

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Companies that are considered to be the most elite jobs

107
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
Don't go into the world. Any engineer

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
I dream that my friend should go and meet me

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,240
It happens? Feng Basically Facebook. Now Mang

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
It is called Facebook is now meta. So

111
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix this type of

112
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,639
The companies which are there, these are basically called

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Banking companies. and the most respectable most

114
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,880
There are aspirational jobs. As far as I have read,

115
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
There have been two rounds of layouts in the past

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
In three years in these companies. in 2025-25

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
already i think 100 k type to 1 lakh

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
The engineers have already moved out. Who

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
It matches your facts exactly. Or

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Only 35% of the codes are being automated. So new work

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
There is so much new work left to do. New work is

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Ltd. and its a ceiling. And this we

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,720
I saw it two years ago when the tech crash happened

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
When NSD fell in the US then it happened with great fanfare

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
He was laid off but then people felt that

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Dude, this is a unfair reaction that the company

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,919
To save cost she is doing it on her own

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
has to show profitability so that its share

129
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,039
Price increased but there is some other game going on

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
The game is going on that what do we need five

131
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,280
People can be done by two people and the remaining three

132
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
How much new work people will do, maybe new

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,600
If you need one or two people for the work then this

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,680
So there is a problem and here we are just coders

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,759
Not talking about everybody

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,400
job is in danger aa this is not the case in hindi

137
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,080
Conversations are very important because

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
I agree please correct me if you

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,919
Désirée. I believe that the things that

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
It happens in USA, one year later in India

141
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,520
It starts happening. A generally media wise this is it

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,400
It happens. But I believe that every

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,639
This is what will happen in the industry. so the coming one

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,120
Today from the perspective of Age in the year 2026

145
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,039
There will be a lot of things especially

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
For students. But those who are young

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,919
They are professionals and they have a lot to learn

148
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
You will read it through today's podcast. We have so much

149
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,240
I have created all education based podcasts.

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Where we talked about upskilling

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,720
Is. This is how it works for AI

152
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,680
I do preparations etc. but honestly

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
The job crisis which is going on in the world now.

154
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
this is a very cataclysmic working situation

155
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,120
For professionals. Game in that chaos right now

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,280
How to make a plan? what should be the strategy

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
Needed? I hope that by the end of this podcast

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,199
Let the audience know that. you say something

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
Would you like it? No, I think it is very important too

160
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,039
Is. Because the career that is in the mind of 90% of the youth

161
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
There is a definition of it, it is this. They

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,160
They think that I can get a job in this

163
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
Let me go, let an appraisal be made, let a title be made

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,600
After that, life is set. Life Set

165
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,360
It does not happen. so career is a 20 years

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,280
Sprint. There isn't even a sprint. Marathon

167
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,039
It is actually. and unlike a lot of others

168
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,919
Professions. Ah if you talk about cricket

169
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,919
will you talk about bollywood or will you be late

170
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,080
Will you talk about the artist? this is not the case with all these

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,199
Career is finite. mean 10 15 mean

172
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,919
It will last for 20 years. butt which is a normal

173
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,919
what do you call a person who is

174
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,560
He earns his living on a daily basis

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,240
The career spans for 40 years. we then and now they

176
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,840
He will think that I am here only for my career

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
I will do the same thing about it that I had first thought about

178
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
I will get a job. now it will be like this again

179
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,919
That each job will last for 40 years. which we

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
Everyone's parents have done it. but then on that

181
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,000
There is no infinite growth. because

182
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,080
There is capitalism, there is inflation, your

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
Technology is changing. so i think

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
The first thing is that whoever is listening

185
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,599
no he should realise that a

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,599
Professional career is the longest sport

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,240
That any human plays in life and its

188
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,840
At least a 30-40 year sport. unlace that

189
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
Uncle, do you do something that friend 10

190
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
After a year you don't need to work

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,880
fell. but for that then you have to

192
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
Disproportionate risk will have to be taken. His

193
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,680
and we will talk to you about that risk

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,240
How do you take it also? Ok? so for teenagers

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,039
Let's set a game plan for that. But that

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,560
Before we talk about the game plan

197
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,520
You were born in 91. I was born in 93. Our

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,440
All the friends who have just gone to the US

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,720
For Masters then Job after Masters

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,199
Do it and earn a lot of money. a lot of them now

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,560
People have had LEOs. and all of these

202
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,080
They are smart people, capable professionals.

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,000
What were their mistakes? Explain this. friend so

204
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,800
Let me tell you why these people used to go out?

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
So everybody wants that after 5-6 years

206
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
My quality of life is very strong

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
yes. Now quality of life has become a big generic word.

208
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,240
goes. But quality of life is a function

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,560
How is your locality, friend? Your

210
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
How are the surroundings? How is your income?

211
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,240
The company you are working in

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
How are the prospects? If you need some

213
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
If you want to move your career then the job economy there

214
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
How is it? How much financial stability

215
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,959
Is? Now what would have happened in the 90s with all this

216
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Was? In the 90s it was said that IITs are a

217
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,480
Ticket to Ticket to US. after that you are somewhere

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
Also go and apply to a US university

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
Do it friend, look at one thing about Indians

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,040
That is very true. Indians are best for sure

221
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
Only at hard working. Ok? you look

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
Not even today's US's most tech

223
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,320
Senior executives of companies

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,480
Or who are the chairmen or CEOs?

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
Is? They are Indians. And that is important because

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,640
going to that point means going to that level of

227
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
In the hierarchy, your intelligence or

228
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,920
Your spark or creativity doesn’t matter

229
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
I would do it. it is a lot about how much you

230
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
Be diligent. how many parents are they

231
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
The hard work is done. Again she comes to that place

232
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
is that 16 hours or 18 hours out of 24

233
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,720
If the world's two

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
if he wants he is among the people of geography

235
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,160
If it is China or India, we would do the same thing

236
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,600
All those who are your friends are mine

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
Friends, all these people have studied well

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
it is there and basically somehow after being rubbed a lot

239
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,160
Have reached US. Ok? and that is

240
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
When they thought that they have done it. they thought that

241
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,399
Now I have come here. now my life

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,320
It is settled. There is great technology here.

243
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,279
There is great exposure here. Great here

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,279
There are opportunities. But what is happening now?

245
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,680
With the advent of AI or technology

246
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,399
Involvement a lot of roles in

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
He had gone to work and he himself is getting changed.

248
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,839
So it's like yaar sport hi change ho

249
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Has gone. So if cricket is more important than Test cricket

250
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
Has he moved to IPL or moved to 2020

251
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,399
If you have done it then whether you are playing Test cricket

252
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,560
No matter how good a player you are, when you win the IPL

253
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,279
If it works then your bid will not be placed at the top.

254
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,480
We vice versa is also not true. then you

255
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,160
I have to choose which sport I play

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Am. Am I playing test cricket or

257
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
I am playing. You can decide that today too.

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
yes. but as I told you earlier if

259
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,440
Think about it, which one can survive alone for 10 years

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,160
If you want to play sports then you can see it very easily

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
It will be thought that in 10 years people will know about T20

262
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,279
I have to play only this. and i think that is what is

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,959
happening that even in the US that

264
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,600
Is it a sport of technology or other career

265
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,440
These are sports, they are very fast

266
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
We are evolving. And talent grows that fast

267
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
It cannot evolve from it. end as a result

268
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
Basically,

269
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
It is demand and supply ultimately. Change

270
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
You have to either do your job or your

271
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,519
Changing your orders across careers and locations

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
They fall. Then it is happening. I also have enough

273
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,120
I have many friends who have gone to the US. don't come

274
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,880
wanted. Now I have to come. We are another

275
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,079
There is a trend in our age group that very

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,959
Everyone is going back to college. there

277
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,839
There is an education wave again. and this wave too

278
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,720
will come to India. Now absolutely. Firstly, its

279
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
I would like to talk about it. The second question is

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360
that right now an Indian student

281
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
What should be the mentality? to the US

282
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,560
should target as a possible destination

283
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,120
Or should we target Dubai or India?

284
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,720
Should I stay and build something? so now friend

285
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
Let's start with the second question.

286
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,160
so you do whatever in life you want to be

287
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
As long as you're in the top 1% of that sport

288
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,760
If you can come then it doesn't matter that

289
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Which geography are you in? I am saying

290
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
yes, you play the tabla. Doesn't matter

291
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,279
In life. But if you are in the top 1% of the world

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
Even if you become a tabla artist, you will

293
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,800
Make a great career for yourself. you don't

294
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
Do painting. Doesn't matter. Butt you

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,959
Be among the top 1% of painters in the world.

296
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,720
You do a podcast. But you are in the top 1% of the world

297
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,399
Come on over to the podcast. Your podcast will play.

298
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
Right? so i think it is less about that

299
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
There is no difference between geography and graphy

300
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
Would have fallen. The point is that you don't have to play a sport

301
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,600
I have to choose. Look at the history of the Olympics

302
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
If you see me then it will hardly be like this

303
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,880
There will be athletes who have multiple

304
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Have won medals in sports. Power Of

305
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,760
Focus. It is called power law. So the power law

306
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Basically it says the 80-20 rule

307
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
is what I feel to me every

308
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,760
The child should study in class 6th

309
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,800
that brother 80% of the good opportunities are in the

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,399
The world will come to the top 20% of the people. Any 

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,120
You will see in any company, there also it is 80-20

312
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's go and see who are the top 20% people

313
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
80% are doing creativity or advancement

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
There are. So I think it is about geography

315
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,920
The factor is low. The point is that you are for yourself

316
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
No, what career are you choosing? This makes your

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,880
The first question that will come up is that what you

318
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,120
You are saying people are going back to college

319
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,519
Or doing upskilling, certifications

320
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
We are doing it, we are doing boot camp. what is that

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
are you doing it? He does this but they don't understand it

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,760
It seemed that the sport we had chosen

323
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
He is not in the top 20%. so that is

324
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
why they are reinventing themselves that

325
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,760
So that whatever sport I am playing in life

326
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
Can I qualify for 20% of that?

327
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
I may or may not be able to do it. So before your career

328
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
Clarity has come in 10 years. End

329
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,560
Based on technological advancement this address

330
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,560
It turns out that okay, now the job is gone

331
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
But maybe this could become a new job. to me

332
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,279
It seems half the people haven't even got clarity

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,959
Is. He has just understood the reality.

334
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
Because clarity comes when you choose

335
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
brother i will do that work which is next

336
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I can do it for 20 years. But whenever you

337
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,040
You will think that I should do a boot camp

338
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,519
or should I do a degree so that my next 5

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,040
The job should be secured for the whole year. then so friend

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
That will be solved in just five years, right? then 5 years

341
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,399
Later you will go and reinvent yourself again.

342
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
You must have also started this when

343
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,279
What did you think when you started out?

344
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
How many broadcasts will I do? My

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
The ultimate target was that I should go to three gyms

346
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
Had to start. So fitness content

347
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
I was starting it. Didn't even think about that

348
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,000
Was. Exactly. So again you are layering this.

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,079
It's a layer decision. you did something

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Because you need to use it to do something else

351
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,120
Was. But I am pretty sure. you did this

352
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
You would not have thought that friend, let me go for fitness

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
I start the content and my tomorrow reel

354
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
If it goes viral, you will get views in 5 minutes

355
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,600
Then it will feel good. but if you don't have a goal

356
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
Long Enough. then when you get that instant

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
Instant Gratification and a Societal

358
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,079
Validation than what you do what you do

359
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,279
next then you are lost and I will tell

360
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,959
you that is what happens to the majority of the

361
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,120
I am a student, I cracked IIT myself

362
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,639
I cleared IIT in 2009 and

363
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,079
I have no shame in saying that

364
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
I was totally lost in my first year

365
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,519
because friend it was like that friend for two years

366
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,880
I only had one dream that it was

367
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
I want to do IT I want to do IT I want to do IIT

368
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,440
have to do it have to do it have to do it now when

369
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,560
When I went there the first year, I

370
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,360
Thought what to do now?

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,360
I didn't even know I had reached my destination. now next

372
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
What is the plan? So the whole game is that friend

373
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
As many children as you can talk to today

374
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,519
You will do it, his goal is very short-lived.

375
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,399
And that is where most colleges also fail

376
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,600
in the country to take them ki bhai next 10

377
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,760
What the ears look like. this doesn't last me for 10 years

378
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,639
I used to feel that way when I was in college myself

379
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,320
That friend, it's okay, at least you are getting your education degree

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,040
yes but i don't think i need anything practical

381
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,680
I am getting to learn it. then youtube's

382
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,160
There was no culture either. So I have an actual career

383
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,399
Got guidance after doing an internship

384
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I did an internship at Ernston Young and

385
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
I asked the people there what to do friend

386
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Needed? If I want to start my own business

387
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,399
is it worth spending time in earning young

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,639
My relatives were saying yes in EY

389
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,959
Work and you will learn the business. People at EY

390
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,880
You were saying no, actually do business then

391
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:04,959
You will learn the business. Butt from a 2025 lens

392
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,839
A I personally feel that as guys in there

393
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,839
early 30s it is our duty to

394
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,440
For teenagers To college students

395
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,160
A little bit game plan oriented

396
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,519
Make a strategy. So now I would like to

397
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,160
audience members take notes with notebook pens

398
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,560
Take it. kids who are just going to college

399
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,560
Are. friend so the first decision which is taken by the child

400
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,079
He takes it, he takes it at the age of 16.

401
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
Before that, let us see which school he studies in.

402
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
what are all those parents doing

403
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,279
We are giving it. and our parents come from a

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,920
Very limited points. they did not have a lot

405
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,160
of generations who can tell them what we need today

406
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,760
The duty has to be fulfilled. Ok? they have as much

407
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,880
There was no risk appetite either. and risk

408
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,199
Appetite is a direct function of the

409
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,920
Implied security you have. As much as yours

410
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,000
It is a survival sort, the more you punt on growth

411
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
You can take it. Because no one is out of the game

412
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
did not want to. We mean them only

413
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,759
Defensive batting was taught. that their

414
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
The whole generation got involved in this thing, friend

415
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,360
Let's survive. so that's our next

416
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
generation which is basically the middle order

417
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
Equivalent ones that basically outperform

418
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
Will do it. Children's education is absolutely top notch

419
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,759
It will be. That is what led to the middle class

420
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,440
of all the parents of this generation in India

421
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,079
This generation has educated us so well that

422
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,639
Every person has a stable job. But

423
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,639
if you say that if you rank India by the

424
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,199
The number of millions they have and the billionaires they

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
Have that not happened. Because people don't own

426
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,079
I kept solving zero to one. and one to 10

427
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,399
It never happened. So for a 16 year old kid

428
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:32,240
From my perspective, I think the first mentality should be this

429
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,279
You should listen to your parents

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,279
Naa, filter it down a little bit. Absolutely

431
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,040
A little bit of a filter down. Parents some-what

432
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
You are saying the right things. some things wrong

433
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,160
They are also saying it. because he is of his generation

434
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
I am giving you advice from this perspective.

435
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,120
Absolutely. I think every child should know no

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
Go to college, first of all

437
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
Parents should be thanked. So when you

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
If you say one thing then there is pride in you too

439
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
it will come friend now I have an opportunity

440
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Because of my parents. and the next

441
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
From day one you can multiply that opportunity by 10X

442
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
would you rather think about doing this

443
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
You will think that friend, this is definitely an opportunity.

444
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,440
What should a 16 year old write in that notebook?

445
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
To the child? first you should write it down

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,839
that friend i know that after 10 years i will

447
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,160
What to do or not to do. And know it

448
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
There's no shame in not knowing how to do it

449
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
Came. I understood it only after I reached my third year.

450
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
I came to know that I have to do numbers, do trading

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,600
Are. And then I went into trading a lot.

452
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,439
I enjoyed it for 2 years. but then understand

453
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
I came to know that there is a lot of work involved in business

454
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
because what did I have in life that

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,199
Do I want autonomy or independence?

456
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
I have to create something. I have to create

457
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
No, I don't want to do management. So five point

458
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,240
A 16 year old kid should first of all

459
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,679
So, I should write in my life whether I

460
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,440
I know it or I don't know it. if he knows it then

461
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,200
So brother, he will take choices accordingly

462
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
Which stream should I choose? Then

463
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,559
The second level will be which college should I go to

464
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
Should I go? Third will be what type of people I am with

465
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,280
May I meet you? Infact Ranveer if people are getting the right

466
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,039
If I want to understand the meaning of education then

467
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
If you want to solve your education then you

468
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,679
Decide what type of people you like

469
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,480
I have to meet him. We want to play guitar because you

470
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,960
Nor can a guitarist teach. So

471
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,960
The first rule is do what you know what you want to

472
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
Do's and Don'ts. That's the first honest question.

473
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,799
And most of all I think 99% actually

474
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,640
It won't take place. You know, this is the game here.

475
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
His ego won't allow him to do this

476
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
to admit that they don't know

477
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,520
What do they have to do? Because the parents

478
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,200
I have told you that you have to do IIT

479
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
Is. So they think that we are here only for this

480
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
Are made. Otherwise he was our brother. They

481
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,039
15 lakh package for software engineering

482
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,760
Took it. This is what we have to do. give here

483
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,320
Bhaiya's advice is that ideally you should

484
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,320
Know what you want to. 100% because you

485
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,240
Don't know what will happen because of AI.

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
What all will not happen. You don't even know that

487
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
Whatever your career, it is what you are. You

488
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
Start playing test test matches. 15 years

489
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,240
After that the format will not remain. What should I do?

490
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,200
We can no longer say this; we add confusion to the

491
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,000
16 years old. to unconfuse the 16 years

492
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Old. Basically your own personality

493
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,360
Should there be clarity or should we explore?

494
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,919
The world needs to try different

495
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
Internships. I think this is 100% me

496
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
that friend

497
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,559
Everyone has to go and work in the industry

498
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,960
Needed For us and him you will be 22-23 years old

499
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,840
You should not wait. We are the kids

500
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
It feels like, friend, I am just 17.

501
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,440
If I go into the industry, I will be a small

502
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
We will see. What should I do? Because

503
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,240
A little image had also been created that friend

504
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
Organize a party for the intern

505
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,400
He does. He brings the coffee. friend not all this

506
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,760
Is. Ultimately the sooner you become an industry

507
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
I will take you there. Ok? a little bit

508
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,080
You will face a few setbacks on the first day

509
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,320
It will also feel very out of place. you this

510
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,160
It will also seem that you don't know anything. but the

511
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,480
The journey of finding and the journey of getting

512
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,720
Knowledge starts from the first step of

513
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
Realizing that you don't know. and that is

514
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,440
Still good. us and and even if you haven't

515
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,679
Do you know what will happen if you learn it? you have life's

516
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,240
The most important thing will be understood

517
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
Which is called clarity. You are four painters

518
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,080
If you stay in the middle, you will understand that

519
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,559
Do I want to do painting in life or not?

520
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,559
Have to do it. hum which is our first step to

521
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,480
figure it out and that's what I feel

522
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,360
The Journey of Finding What You Want to

523
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Doo. It is not a linear journey. that journey

524
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,760
it comes from a lot of stages where

525
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,000
You realize what you don't want to do.

526
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,840
Hmm. Hmm. So step one is cancelled out.

527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
Step one is preparation for JEE

528
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
No? One principle is taught in JE

529
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
Selection by elimination. that MCQs

530
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
The questions have come. There are four options. Me

531
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,320
I don't know the answer but I am going to try out each option one by one.

532
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
I keep cutting. then one or two in the last

533
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
Options will remain. I am the best possible friend in that

534
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520
That should be done in life. it seems to me

535
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
Everyone should prepare for JE. Not

536
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,120
Because he wants to go to JE, IT

537
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
I have to go. friend the kind of framework that

538
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,160
teaches you the way your life should be

539
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
moldering, that perseverance,

540
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,640
That rigger is very valuable. I

541
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Think about these fat pay packages that you get or

542
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,559
When someone says that friend I should go to IIT

543
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
I want to hire, they are actually hiring because

544
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,440
OF JE, NOT IIT. 100% that the kid

545
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,000
I have cracked JEE. not not the education in

546
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,679
Those four years. You tell me friend we are

547
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
We run the company. you tell me that

548
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,200
Dude, this one is an IIT graduate. It has

549
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,080
He is late graduate from IIT Delhi

550
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,799
or this is an IIT this is a kid

551
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,960
Whose all India rank was 500. Butt her

552
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,440
after that he did not do anything with lets or this

553
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Didn't he go to IIT or did he do something on his own?

554
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,880
I was doing anything in life. i will take it

555
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,320
From an employer. both on my mind

556
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,640
That the respect and weightage will be the same. J

557
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,720
There is probably a sign of wear that

558
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,000
These can be used for rubbing. 100% 100% because

559
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,080
The employer wants that my friend

560
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,919
The guy should come and work for 15-16 hours. We who are these

561
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
The pre-AI version was the AI ​​of today

562
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,960
has made the same change. So you saw

563
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
There must be many corporates who

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,799
do you penalize people on timing or

565
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,559
Then basically they say that you will have six days

566
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,559
I have to come, I have to come in five days. So people are artists

567
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,120
No, we did not hire anyone. Hire a Work Horse First

568
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,880
used to do it. Now the smart entrepreneurs who

569
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,240
Those smart companies are artists

570
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,600
We are hiring. They hire creative people

571
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,520
I am wondering who the brother is that friend who has been there for 10 hours

572
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,120
what is the work friend it means it will be done in 10 days

573
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,600
Don't do the thing in 2 days. not because

574
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,280
Friend, I have more work to get done. because brother again

575
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,720
If he has 8 hours left then he will also

576
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
Will you think what else I can do?

577
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,559
Am. Now when he thinks about it, his life too

578
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,120
It will be better. His horizon will also increase and

579
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,679
The company will also move forward. hard work these days

580
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,760
I will not save your job. Your efficiency

581
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,480
will save the job. Efficiency will save,

582
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,440
Creativity will save us, productivity will

583
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,880
will save. These are the things we will save one more time

584
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Practical layer on this. 2025 and 26

585
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,320
From context, I think the skill is to

586
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
Be Learn is Understanding AI Literacy and

587
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,960
AI Agents.

588
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,960
Because of these two factors I think someone

589
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,720
Human efficiency can increase a lot

590
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,799
Is. At the workplace. Absolutely very much my friend

591
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,600
You mentioned the address point. It seems everybody

592
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,520
Which tools should you use in life? So

593
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,520
Are you talking about AI, ultimately GPT or something else?

594
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,080
Also tell me what is it? These are the tools. when you

595
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,679
you use tools that is basically the

596
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,480
The biggest let out of your creativity that

597
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
Brother I am using GPT in English

598
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
or I am using GPT for learning

599
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,559
to make such an app for people

600
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
Who can teach them English. Both

601
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,080
Things are very different. Right?

602
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
Ultimately both people do their work.

603
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
have been. But some people do they better in right.

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
And the Beautiful Part About Technology

605
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,720
as a tool is that it does not discriminate

606
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,039
And different technology is the greatest

607
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Leveller leveller in life. and that is why when

608
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
When these parents say that friend we

609
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,000
You will not give mobile phones to children, friend

610
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,760
You are clipping their wings. Whichever parent

611
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,200
Will not give all these tools to children. They

612
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
Parents can do bad things to their children

613
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,559
have been. that's good so coming back to the

614
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Notebook and Formula. The first is mentality

615
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,320
Bring clarity on cancellation. selection by

616
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,200
Elimination.

617
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,200
secondly if possible then do an internship because

618
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,039
From that you will learn about your strengths and

619
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,200
What are your weaknesses and what do you want to do?

620
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,799
Yes, in life. Third Point AI Tools

621
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,039
Use it more to increase your AI literacy

622
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,760
And your efficiency will increase in your workplace

623
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,600
In. You can still do this as a teenager.

624
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
Tell me this simple playbook. Ok.

625
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,960
Elimination,

626
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,000
Industry learning and bringing the tool into life

627
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,240
and then you keep doing this loop again and

628
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
again and like with in a few iterations you

629
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
Turns out we are real superstars okay. Fourth

630
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I would like to add a point and please disagree

631
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
With me if you don't think it's valid. But

632
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,919
End Media in the world of content creation

633
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
there's a ground rule in the world of

634
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,880
Create more than you consume. As much as yours

635
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,919
Your output must be more than your input

636
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,679
Needed and i feel that age 16 is a good age

637
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
To Experiment With Personal Content

638
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,159
Creation. because that's because of the feedback loop

639
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,039
How your audience is reacting to you

640
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,279
With the content. He teaches you a lot

641
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,080
Retention can be about sales

642
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,919
About marketing. a and generally that

643
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,000
How is the world changing? what are the trends

644
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,679
Are they there? You will learn all this. so thats

645
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
just a fourth bonus point i would want to

646
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,520
Add. 100% friend, I mean fundamentally

647
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,520
I agree that this physics in school,

648
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,720
They teach chemistry and maths three or four times

649
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
things that I feel and Ranveer you

650
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
Tell me that if you make a curriculum for the country then

651
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,320
What all would you add? like it seems to me

652
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,320
Everyone should be taught sales. make whatever you want

653
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
Take it in the world. Like, people call that Steve

654
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,640
Joss Was the Greatest Entrepreneur Because

655
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,840
he made a sexy phone called iPhone which

656
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,200
Removed the keyboard and the apps arrived. no, he

657
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,480
Was the greatest marketer, of all times.

658
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,200
You can go to any college, any

659
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,200
You can also study and do any project

660
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
Ultimately when you are in the final round of the interview

661
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,120
I sit there and you are doing sales, which one?

662
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
You know on time who the product is

663
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,240
The products themselves are the second thing is

664
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,240
What type of people do you deal with in people management?

665
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
when are you talking to like zenzus is very

666
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
It feels cool to go and meet any founder

667
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,240
yo satish we love the company bro

668
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,520
you are rocking let's work together dude that

669
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,440
Isn't how you necessarily work through. Correct

670
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
Is? You will have to learn his IQ.

671
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
You have to learn empathy. To you

672
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,360
You will have to understand the opportunity. I am not anyone

673
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,200
Talk to a very senior technical person

674
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,960
Had been. I went to the US. They were from Google

675
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,360
They. Ok. I asked him I said

676
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,720
Why did Sundar Pichai become the CEO that I meant

677
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,240
So, I have read that IIT

678
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
He was from Kharagpur and he was a product manager

679
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,679
Were. They say that there are thousands smarter than him

680
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,480
There are engineers in Google. But it used to be

681
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,559
that whenever Google searches Europe's Google

682
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
There is some war going on with Indonesia, friend.

683
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
Now there are many cross border teams

684
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
There will be conflicts. Ok? their culture

685
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,480
His point of view itself said that friend

686
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,960
If Sundar Pichai enters a room

687
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,039
After that, the fight that is there ultimately

688
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,120
It will be solved. and says that

689
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,960
Skills for a Non-Founder to Have Because

690
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
The founder, by his position and authority,

691
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,559
These can align. but an executive

692
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,279
for then he has to take the bid for

693
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,799
everybody and still take them all along and

694
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,120
Convinced. Ok?

695
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,360
That is basically why Sundar Pichai says

696
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,200
Become the sea of ​​Google and if that isn't

697
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,880
People Management Ranveer then People Management

698
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,679
What is? so i think something else

699
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,279
This should be taught. The third thing if I

700
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,679
which makes me feel that friend, in life every

701
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,679
The child should learn. big in india

702
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,760
there is this thing which is called

703
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,440
Financial Management. The parents say

704
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,200
Friend, money should not be given to children like that.

705
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,960
You won't believe how many people you consider your own

706
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,799
Don't know how to manage personal finances. Buddy

707
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,039
You won't believe Ranveer our company

708
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,760
The average age in our company is 28-29 years

709
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,480
Is. 60-70% of people do not know that

710
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,080
Brother which investment positions and how

711
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Let's calculate. what tax

712
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
There are implications but nothing comes out. so i

713
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Think Apart from the Beautiful Framework

714
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,919
that you give I think these three things if every

715
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,600
Any child will learn it, look at you

716
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,159
How much more will that add to your resume?

717
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,080
I don't know. but in your life

718
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,679
No matter how many moons will appear, they will not be four. They

719
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,000
There will be only 16.

720
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,960
hum hum ok so just started as a 17 year old

721
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,840
Play lightly with money, lightly

722
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,080
it will pay off for the rest of your life okay

723
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,919
We have reached the mark of Age 18. Age 18

724
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,880
because before we talk about

725
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,799
Career selection starts here

726
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,919
I would like to highlight one subject

727
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,360
The name of the subject is Failure O Specially JE

728
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,679
Rejection because of which people thought that friend

729
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,960
My career is over. Not True At

730
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,360
All. What would you like to say about JEE rejection?

731
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,080
about? tell me this first. it seems to me

732
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,000
If you are rejected then I will give you three

733
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,919
I will break it into parts. Basically 10 lakhs

734
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,799
People give JE every year. You give them three

735
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
Break it into parts. The first 10,000 children

736
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,960
Who got selected in JE. From lats

737
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,440
Then comes your Rs 10,000 to Rs 5,000

738
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,919
kids or kids with 1 lakh and then come

739
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,000
Rank from 1 Lakh to 10 Lakh. these three

740
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
There are types of children. those to whom it happened

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,799
So it's done. very good thing. about them

742
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,880
I will talk about it later. Ok? Now

743
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,399
Those which are between 10,000 and 1 lakh, these are the most

744
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,120
There is a possibility that friend, they will stay for 2 months

745
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,480
The preparation fell short. Ok? or let's say that

746
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,039
The day didn't last, friend. means the greatest

747
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,799
Players get out for a duck in like the

748
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,799
Biggest Matches. Ok? It doesn't work.

749
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,600
So, these are those kids. these people

750
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,480
What do you learn? These people don't rig my life

751
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,399
Opportunity Cost and the Value of Emotional

752
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,760
Intelligence is learned. It doesn't matter no

753
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,440
The paper did not come out, it does not matter. you don't

754
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,080
They work for 12-15 hours with passion and obsession

755
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,559
You have learnt to do it. do whatever you want tomorrow

756
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,240
You know that 10,000 hour rule. So

757
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,919
10,000 hour rule would be explained to the audience

758
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
friend you can do any work in life

759
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,159
Do 10,000 hours, then you mean 1% of it

760
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,679
I will come into the world. we come again

761
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,000
Friend, 1 lakh to 10 lakh. For these

762
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,399
Rejection is a blessing. because you don't

763
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,799
I have found out that friend what are you not

764
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,200
Interested in? either what are you not

765
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,559
Interested in what you are not capable of

766
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,039
off and what is the sport that is not mentioned

767
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,200
For you for whatever reason.

768
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,880
These are three children. Ok? so i

769
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Think about these kids earning Rs 10,000 to 1 lakh.

770
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,520
Well, maybe he should give it one more attempt

771
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,120
I will give. Ok? Generally these people go to good colleges

772
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,039
Let's choose them and try one or two.

773
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,720
We do. These are the rest of the kids from 1 to 10

774
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,600
Don't they go to some random college

775
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,520
In. Ok? After that no friend Ranveer

776
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,840
The whole factor of their life is complete

777
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,880
Career in Treasury is defined as that 4 years

778
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,080
what do I do? And I think the first

779
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,080
the thing that people should be okay is that if they

780
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,679
I have got rejected from IIT over a 20 year ago

781
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,480
Year career thing it is one batch. We you

782
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,480
My friend Sachin also won six World Cups in his life

783
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,520
Have played.

784
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,440
You will also get that many opportunities. Butt guys what

785
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,120
We do? People get so frustrated. 17

786
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,919
He is a one year old child right? What did you tell him?

787
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,440
goes? If there is no IIT then we will get auto

788
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
He thinks this is my first and final

789
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,200
It's a match. I wonder if it is still said

790
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
Because I remember our time a lot

791
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,760
It was said that if you get admission in IIT

792
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,159
If you don't get it then your career is over. but i hope

793
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,799
That teenagers today are more informed. I

794
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,960
I really hope so many questions

795
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,200
This is for all 12th standard students

796
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,799
in hearts and and I am also talking

797
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,600
About non engineer ok a 12th pass

798
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,320
Which stream should I choose after this

799
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,080
How do you decide friend, look at the two types

800
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
These are the people who need clarity in life

801
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,559
Or those who don't have clarity. Ok

802
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,080
Look at those who have clarity, my friend

803
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,440
I want to choose arts I want to choose commerce

804
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,080
If they want to do science, they should do what

805
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,000
There is no clarity. Ok? those who have life

806
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,399
there is no clarity then they can solve it

807
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Probability. then life is a function and

808
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,159
How you balance your life is a function of

809
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,240
Clarity and Probability. if you achieve

810
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,760
both then you are absolutely destined for

811
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,600
Greatness. but yaar clarity or

812
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,799
your path is based on one of the probability

813
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
Should go. Don't go between the two

814
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,159
Needed what has happened in India now

815
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,480
Look at those who don't have clarity. which is

816
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,640
Majority of the kids. then the index

817
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,200
let's look at the probability of getting a

818
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,440
Job. Last 30-40 years and next 50 years also

819
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,840
It will work that technology is the biggest

820
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,000
The sport that you have. now in that sport

821
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,080
If 10 lakh engineers are produced every year

822
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,240
If there is possibility then your probability is quite high

823
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,760
it's better than picking up a dying

824
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,679
Sport where there are only 000 professions

825
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,080
There is need. That is why our parents are very

826
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,679
You did the right thing 15 years ago

827
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,120
If you don't understand something, friend,

828
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
you should take science because by doing science you

829
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
You will do engineering. if you do engineering

830
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,360
You will get an engineering degree. over there

831
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,039
You need some structuring and all

832
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
you will have an analytical mind and then

833
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,360
Yours is in Quant or Technology

834
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,840
One or the other job will be confirmed in me or

835
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,120
TVF BA Biceps me job mil jayega

836
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,360
That is absolutely correct because even in the media

837
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,039
best professionals are engineers but then

838
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,880
That's why our parents used to do this, friend

839
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,399
Go into any analytical field.

840
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
that friend once if your maths is good

841
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,919
Your structuring is right in your life

842
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,600
you can do segregation

843
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
You can do compartmentalization

844
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,559
can you process it analytically

845
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,200
Relate Numbers You Can Think Into Frameworks

846
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,200
You can solve equations in life everything

847
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
This is an equation ultimately so friend you go ahead

848
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,440
If you go for engineering then I think that

849
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,240
That it will not be very relevant even in the next 50 years

850
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,640
The thing is that job creation is technology

851
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,720
it will be in me only means a field bigger than that right now

852
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
basically if it has not yet come to humanity

853
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
don't know what to do or

854
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,720
So take engineering or something science related

855
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
stream yes how to do that i

856
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,120
I will tell you then you should take engineering

857
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
I had taken it in such a way that even I did not know

858
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
what to do now after that comes your

859
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,600
The biggest turning point in life

860
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Engineering takes four years. if you

861
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,440
If you do anything for four years, you will really do it

862
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,880
Great at that. So that is what I say,

863
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,039
I did the same thing when I went to ID.

864
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,799
I tried to join a lot of clubs

865
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,919
I had tried. I also attended Cinematics Club

866
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,120
I joined. I also have an audio club

867
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,039
I joined. I also like lighting whiting

868
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,880
Had to understand. So I said play all the games

869
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,960
Let's see. let us try all the

870
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
Sports and then maybe we'll figure it out.

871
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
and you have to go with probability and

872
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,000
hope in that that's your probability of

873
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,080
Picking up the right sports for you is

874
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,120
directly proportional to the number of

875
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,480
The sports you play. hmm you also mean if

876
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,760
you did fitness fitness i am pretty

877
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,760
Sure you have done something in engineering

878
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,640
you might have started it or your content

879
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,559
If you have affinity towards that side then maybe you will find that

880
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,559
quite interesting or meaning how do i say

881
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,000
You might find it interesting that brother this is this

882
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,519
This is a great thing. At least you can choose your interest

883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You are identifying it, right? one a lot

884
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,159
Basic human logic is that any activity

885
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
If your energy levels are high after doing

886
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,120
That means that activity is for you.

887
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,640
Dopamine right? We Ultimately Find Out

888
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,000
What gives you dopamine in life?

889
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
And the one who doesn't know should first go to Google

890
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,360
What is dopamine? now after that

891
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,159
What will happen? Maybe 3 years in college

892
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,720
I don't understand you what to do

893
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,240
Is. So again your clarity is not there. Now

894
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,360
Who will you solve for? When Clarity

895
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,720
If you are not able to find a solution in life then whom should you solve it for?

896
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,480
want to do it? Probability. of Probability

897
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
I have to solve this problem. and one of the probability

898
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,840
What event is coming up? next year you

899
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
You are about to graduate. Now you will find your job

900
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
It is of this. then you can reverse engineer it

901
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,720
In which type of market do you take jobs?

902
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
Are. I am currently doing analytics, coding

903
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
Whatever it is, prepare for this job

904
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,360
I will take it. Again you have the probability

905
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,279
I have maximized it. Then you got the job. Now

906
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,200
You know I will do this for two-three years.

907
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,919
Give. Optimize for Clarity Again

908
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,559
do it. Somewhere or the other my friend is hitting his hands and legs, closed

909
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,039
The switch will be pressed somewhere in the room. They

910
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,440
The day you press the switch your light comes on and

911
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,440
no meaning in your life since day it is the

912
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,919
The Most Radiant Moment That Will Ever Come In

913
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,159
Your life. Ok? to summarize this full

914
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,159
Student Face of Life. because after that

915
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,520
We will talk about the current job market.

916
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,639
do. But this student is in the face of life

917
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Just those age 16, 17, 18 frameworks for you

918
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,879
have to run it again and again in my life and

919
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Knowing how to handle failure

920
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,240
Is. A but additionally a 2025 perspective

921
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,720
I would like to give an input that wherever

922
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,040
You get stuck in this whole process.

923
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,320
use gpt. GPT costs $30

924
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,399
these are the months i think are the best ever

925
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,760
Investment for everybody. I am a

926
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,480
I would like to suggest this to the audience.

927
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,960
Wherever you are stuck, tell GBT that

928
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,879
I'm as dash I think my career is going

929
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:57,040
To be in this dash industry. Current I

930
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,680
Want to learn this dash skill.

931
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,720
there for can you give me a very detailed

932
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,079
Game plan to move further? and can you

933
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,440
Suggest further questions that I can ask you

934
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,160
to gain more clarity on

935
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,119
where i want to take my career also

936
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,280
please know that these are my goals in life i

937
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,040
want a family at this age i want to be

938
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,920
living here at this age i want this kind

939
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,640
of a salary at age 35 just about yourself

940
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,880
Tell me to fill in the data and then let GPT open

941
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,960
Coach You Through the Process in an Infact and Easy Way

942
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,320
two you just tell gpt that friend you

943
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,359
Become my mentor, therapist, counselor, guru

944
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,760
and keep asking me questions and whatever I

945
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,480
I am going to answer you on the basis of that

946
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,400
Formulate it brother what do I mean

947
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Kinds of things do I need to do. So

948
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,480
First Ask GPT to Decide What You Are

949
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,480
want to do and then basically once gpt

950
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,079
has reduced then you ask them that friend now

951
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,240
You tell me that you have reached your destination. So

952
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,320
Use it to find your destination first.

953
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,839
Then when you have found your destination then look for the way

954
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,440
I can use it. and if you are satisfied

955
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,240
If you are not deep with GPT answers then

956
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,320
Turn on research and use GPT. a little

957
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,079
It will take time but you will get a good outcome.

958
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,720
Now in the second half of this podcast we will discuss

959
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,640
Will tell about current job scenario

960
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,880
honestly also from a 30 something

961
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,720
perspective on what happens to our friends

962
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,640
Is it happening? because during college

963
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
It used to be that the people who were smart, who

964
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,680
People are hard working, they will be fine through you

965
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,800
Life. That has not happened. because of the

966
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,280
Unpredictability of technology.

967
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,440
do you think that this second half has started

968
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,520
Should we do it with AI? Because we have

969
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,800
Have created a few podcasts on AI. So far

970
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:40,000
The audience should understand what the tools are? A

971
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I would like to ask a question about agents.

972
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,640
What are AI agents? because when

973
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,040
People are saying that jobs are being lost because of AI

974
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,240
Will go away. actually specifically they are

975
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,079
Talking About AI Agents. or you quickly

976
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,599
Can you explain what the tools and agents are

977
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,760
What is the difference? Ok? dude to tools

978
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,079
What essentially happens is that you give him an input

979
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,000
You will give it and the tool will give you an output.

980
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,160
The donation depends on you that you

981
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,640
how are you processing the output, where

982
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,359
You are doing leverage. do you even discar it

983
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,680
And do you even write it. But Agent Is

984
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,599
Basically where you downloaded a tool and

985
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,520
Flawed responsibility has been given. As

986
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,200
You call a call center. Your

987
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,200
Do you have a credit card? you picked up

988
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,359
Basically toll free to credit card team

989
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,119
I called on the number and typed two-three times there.

990
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,400
that these are your problems. But let's take your

991
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,760
My friend, I have small problems

992
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
No, I am unable to find the card number or my

993
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,560
When will be the expiry date? meri yaar credit

994
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,720
Do I need to increase my credit card limit or not?

995
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,160
I did not get my points. One type of queries

996
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,200
It can only happen. this you are basically

997
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,599
Agent software can be outsourced

998
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,839
yes. Which is basically called AI agent. So

999
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,800
That is what agents do for agents are a

1000
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,440
proxy of you who are doing the task that

1001
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,320
R Repetitive and Redundant and Repetitive

1002
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,480
and boring in and they have to be done in a

1003
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,359
The prescribed format is provided by your agent

1004
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,800
We will be okay so I would like to say two things

1005
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:02,480
First of all, all the founders and business owners

1006
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,440
All the AIs I got started thinking agent-oriented

1007
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,240
are figuring out what we are doing about our company

1008
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,000
How to increase your productivity the most

1009
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,320
Productivity from Likely AI Agents

1010
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But at the same time, AI agents will increase

1011
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,160
The down side is that people lose their jobs

1012
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,960
Will go away. So this AI will replace jobs

1013
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,760
It's down to AI agents. AI agents or

1014
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,160
So you can either buy it in house

1015
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,400
You can design and build many

1016
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,079
People are doing it. There are different purposes.

1017
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,160
But effectively three four people job together

1018
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,280
You can go into oblivion because of an AI agent

1019
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,200
From. A because that is more productive

1020
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,599
Work there with more efficiency

1021
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,240
Will get it. So friend, three things happen

1022
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,320
Too. Agents who define the tools of AI

1023
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,640
She does. One comes your productivity

1024
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Because humans have a capacity. Like

1025
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,960
they can't operate at the same potential for a

1026
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,839
Long period of time. that productivity

1027
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,359
With time productivity with time is a

1028
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,720
Declining curve. Right? so a so ai

1029
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,040
That's not an issue with the tools. give can

1030
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,839
Operate at the same productivity for a long time

1031
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,680
Time. Secondarily Ah Productivity

1032
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,640
Increasing in an in a tool. that's far easier

1033
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,640
Than a human. we mean those two

1034
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,480
You can iterate it in three weeks

1035
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,280
Date Plus AI Also Keeps Learning From

1036
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
data. Ok? So his productivity

1037
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,800
She also remains constant with time

1038
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,440
Productivity also increases. End

1039
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,079
In thirdly most cases it is also cheaper

1040
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,240
Then a human's cost. So I believe that

1041
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,720
I am sure friend, whatever job you do, you should do it for yourself.

1042
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,640
You do three types of work in your job. Or

1043
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,880
So you do creative work. you are

1044
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,280
Thinking something which has never been done.

1045
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Ok? or do you do mechanical work that

1046
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,560
You keep doing it, you have to come every day and do the same thing.

1047
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,640
Have to call 5 customers daily. everyday to them

1048
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,079
This thing has to be done. and the third is basically

1049
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Optimizing is the same work my friend

1050
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,920
I will do it but I will pay lesser cost or lesser

1051
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,800
I will do it in less time in resources. These

1052
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,040
The second and third ones are in danger

1053
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,599
Is. We will do the rest of your creative work

1054
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,560
If your job is saved then you will do only those things

1055
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,880
It will save money. everything else then it is a matter of

1056
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,760
When not an if. We are the ones who made the two spheres

1057
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,800
take them and fill them in gpt and

1058
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,119
Ask this by turning on deep research from GPT itself.

1059
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,040
What AI Tools and Agents Are

1060
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,880
Currently available because of which all these works

1061
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,760
May be. Ask Exactly and Directly How

1062
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,440
can we do it better, faster and at a cheaper rate

1063
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,160
Cost. We are the best in the world

1064
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,480
They are professionals and this is what they are doing. But now

1065
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,079
There are two ways of looking at this problem.

1066
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,079
A 22 year old student is facing the same problem

1067
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,200
Get actually excited after seeing the statement

1068
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,440
You must be thinking that wow what a professional life is full

1069
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,640
of AI agents I will only have to do

1070
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,320
Creative work. But people of our age do this

1071
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,880
Looking at the problem statement, you are thinking that

1072
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,920
They would think, [ __ ], I will lose my job.

1073
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,520
Or how do I improve? and at this

1074
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,320
I would also like to mention this as the point of the podcast

1075
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,280
I would like that in the wake of job crisis in America

1076
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,480
At the same time, another trend has started

1077
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,800
People of our age and older than us

1078
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,680
Going back to college. learn things back

1079
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,319
have been. Going back to higher education

1080
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,160
Are. After doing masters, guys come back

1081
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,680
Why are you going? people go back so

1082
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,240
when they realise that what

1083
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,200
has bought them so far will not take them further

1084
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,800
Ahead. Look friend, I have two ways of education

1085
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,960
Can be seen from. Let's do this a little more

1086
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,119
Let's widen it and this is for everyone

1087
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,079
I will provide a framework that is applicable. Or

1088
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,480
So education is your investment.

1089
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,720
Investment is what you earn from today

1090
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,960
Better career whichever career you are in

1091
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,480
How to be three times better than your job

1092
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,240
Do you want to go? Five times in the next 10 years

1093
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,160
how will you go? that is basically yours

1094
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,319
Investment Education. and then there is a

1095
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,720
insurance education which says that friend who

1096
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,800
I am also working today because this work

1097
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,000
Key Expectation Expected Proficiency

1098
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,640
If it keeps increasing then that bus will keep me

1099
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,880
Inflationary is to keep yourself updated

1100
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,520
so that's my job is saved we are the same that is

1101
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,760
Basically a defense versus attack approach

1102
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,960
Is. And I know these two types very much.

1103
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,599
It is visible more. in our company too

1104
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,160
It is visible. It is seen everywhere. Ok. A 22

1105
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,079
What to do now from the perspective of year olds

1106
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,200
Needed? Masters degree immediately after college

1107
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,359
or continuously online

1108
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,800
You should upskill yourself through education

1109
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,319
To. I'm telling you not to go anywhere

1110
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,079
Needed First of all, go into the industry, friend.

1111
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,400
You basically go and work there. To all

1112
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,920
First you should go there my friend

1113
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,280
you get a little confidence that now you

1114
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,800
Be in the industry. now you will learn a new thing

1115
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,599
had been. You get some networking done

1116
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,280
Is. We are your little professional upskilling

1117
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,599
She goes. Because look at your industry

1118
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,359
Fitment will happen only then what has been torn

1119
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,839
To you is actually what the industry is

1120
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,280
Needs. And generally 99% of the world

1121
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,359
programs include diametrically opposite

1122
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,599
There is an angle. I mean these 180° opposite things

1123
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,800
They happen. and unfortunately because they are

1124
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,160
Not the same. that is the only

1125
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,960
Alternatives to Learn What You Need to Know

1126
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,280
Is by going in companies. Ok? One more thing

1127
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,480
I would like to say from a modern perspective

1128
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,240
that people are losing their jobs. at the

1129
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,720
I remember the same time when we graduated

1130
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,640
Abundance Mindset Scarcity

1131
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,640
There was a lot of talk about mindset. I

1132
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,119
Feel that that's true even now. Still Abundance

1133
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,839
There must be a mindset. Basically Scarcity

1134
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,240
Mindset means always thinking that friend

1135
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,839
How will you explain it? Worst case. Yes. Buddy

1136
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,040
It's a simple thing. Scarcity is a Mindset

1137
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,319
That friend the ball is coming. I am the defense

1138
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
I will do it because if I go to hit a shot

1139
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,160
I will be out. Abundance is the mindset that

1140
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,160
Brother, the ball is coming, let it get out, it will be out

1141
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,000
But if I don't hit a six then how will I score runs?

1142
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,400
It will be made and if I get out on zero then

1143
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,680
Whether I play 10 balls or 15 balls I score a run

1144
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,440
If it is zero then save your wicket and score runs

1145
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,880
There are basically two things which you can avoid in absence of

1146
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,400
From Mindset or Scarcity Mindset

1147
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,240
You can directly correlate it somewhere

1148
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,079
Have that belief somewhere that yes it can happen with me

1149
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,119
It will go only. I will be able to do it myself

1150
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:48,160
belief and a little bit of big thinking but the same

1151
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,480
The question is that those who are 22 years old now

1152
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,800
he is 23 years old maybe they are also

1153
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,200
Living in a Little Bit of Fear About This

1154
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Job crisis which is now going to hit India next year

1155
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,680
It is of this. How do you protect yourself?

1156
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,480
That is the question. Look what happened before today

1157
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Was? Your degree would get you a job. degree

1158
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,800
She didn't save the job. Hmm. it seems to me

1159
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,640
Forget about saving for 2 or 3 years from today.

1160
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Your degree will also get you a job. we we at n

1161
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,800
Intrinsic level. the faster the world races

1162
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,359
is basically on as many companies as

1163
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,200
Is there pressure of growth or is there an opportunity,

1164
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,240
Companies will only hire you for your attitude

1165
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,800
And the magnitude of your skills. which is

1166
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,960
assessment of how much practice you have done

1167
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,720
You have context, how much pedigree

1168
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,880
and how much have you performed? You

1169
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,200
Look, I'm telling you, 5 years from now

1170
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,800
of one of India's unicorns inside

1171
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,040
The CMO will be a 25 year old person

1172
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,800
We are him and he is a 25 year old guy

1173
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,560
Or is he a prisoner? Do you know what he might have done?

1174
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,560
I will predict it for you

1175
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,640
Am. He created his own channel

1176
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,040
will be. He went to the market

1177
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,280
Experience different dropshipping types

1178
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,760
so that they can be sourced, sold

1179
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,760
He must be coming. They understand creativity very much

1180
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
She must be coming in. Ok? He has a small

1181
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,960
would have run a production unit that they

1182
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,599
You must understand what lens is and where it is

1183
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,119
When all this lighting comes then you will know more

1184
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,960
why is that necessary? because when he gets this

1185
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,200
Everything must be known only then no agency would come to them

1186
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,760
I can't make it. I told you this

1187
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Gave an example. The point of the game is this

1188
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,240
That is the creation of the whole thing. anything you want

1189
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,720
Create it. Create your own product

1190
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,000
Create a channel, create fitness. Own

1191
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,640
Create spirituality. some dis create

1192
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,040
Do it, create a revenue model, business

1193
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,000
Create or create some new product

1194
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,760
do it, create some agents, anything

1195
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,119
Create it. which is the power of creation,

1196
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,359
that's what you basically need to know ahead of time and

1197
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,839
It will make you stronger than your age. and i think

1198
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,920
The Only Way to Have a Sure Shot

1199
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,119
The probability of winning in life is two

1200
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,119
Start very early. You have to beat time.

1201
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,079
and when you say how to be time because the

1202
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,520
so there is at least a thousand such people

1203
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,119
There will be those who are running with you in the same race

1204
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,880
It is at the same speed. So if you have

1205
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,200
You won't have a headstart or you'll end up somewhere

1206
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,280
Don't sprint and you'll fall behind

1207
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,359
You will stay, friend. So now you will say that friend

1208
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,359
They are scaring me that I won't get a job

1209
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,480
It will take.

1210
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:20,560
If you don't do anything today then yes I think I will be afraid today

1211
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,280
It is necessary. That discipline is due to fear

1212
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,680
He will come among the people. and discipline is needed in

1213
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,319
Order to Protect Jobs. of that notebook

1214
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,720
Let's talk a little bit about it. We have 16

1215
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:36,400
The guidelines for 22 were given roughly. a spoke

1216
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,680
About the skills there to focus on. Ok?

1217
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,800
This is in the age bracket of 22 to 25 where

1218
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,040
Energy levels have improved a lot. I say this

1219
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,720
I would like to start creating. Absolutely

1220
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,920
START CREATING. i think that if

1221
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,640
You have to work on these skills of creativity

1222
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,400
So create content quickly with quantity,

1223
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,200
Release it and let people know that you have done something

1224
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,119
Thought, did, released, audience said something

1225
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,839
He said, then you could have slightly changed the direction

1226
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,319
yes. And the faster you do this, the further away you will get

1227
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,920
Your career will go away. that's been the case for the

1228
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,839
the last five years at least in the world of

1229
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,000
business and definitely in the world of

1230
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,960
Content Creation. So for this, just three simple

1231
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,400
Everyone has to follow the steps. First

1232
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,400
Build, secondly learn and thirdly iterate. Victory

1233
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,160
That's what you said friend lots of build

1234
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,920
do it. If you want to build less, do less. More

1235
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,160
If you want to build, build more. After that

1236
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,000
Learn it. Learn how to create your feedback loop

1237
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,079
From. how will the feedback loop come about that whatever your

1238
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
There is a potential customer. now if you are late

1239
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,920
If you create content, you will have users. If

1240
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,760
If you work in a job then your customer

1241
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,520
Most likely your team or your

1242
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,599
Boss or your actual paying customers

1243
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,440
Are. Ok? Then go and talk to them,

1244
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,440
Learn it. It means you can make biryani

1245
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,520
what are you selling but to everyone in your neighborhood

1246
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,880
I want to eat laddus, friend. means if you want

1247
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,960
No matter how good biryani you make, it makes a difference

1248
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
It doesn’t matter. Ok? this is not by the way this

1249
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,640
Our education system does not teach this. Our

1250
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,480
The education system teaches that this is the goal

1251
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,560
There is a point. how fast can you run

1252
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,040
In this. Hmm. hey, but that round point probably

1253
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,520
The change has happened. when you take a penalty

1254
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,520
in football, you never think that

1255
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Do you think which side will I score the goal? Or

1256
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,079
You keep looking at the goalkeeper, don't you?

1257
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,839
This is the last scene, friend, either she will die here, or

1258
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,560
She will die here. And that's how you have to decide

1259
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:20,000
That brother at what point do you move. Basically,

1260
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:23,280
In every job from 2025 to at least 2030

1261
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,240
We all have to understand that a human's mind

1262
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,240
How it is changing. for example joe short

1263
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:32,400
Content Captures Our Attention Span

1264
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,720
Do it. Another change of this type is coming. Now

1265
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Because of the AI ​​wave. the next one or two years

1266
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,599
Everyone in chat will use GPT.

1267
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,760
Behavioral patterns will change. Whatsoever way

1268
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,680
The way people consume energy will also change.

1269
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,000
I feel like looking at him, friend, look at him again

1270
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,240
No, there are two kinds of learning. Ok?

1271
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,559
One is horizontal education. Ok?

1272
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,800
where you're more like a generalist and

1273
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,319
everything that my friend doesn't know about aerospace

1274
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,079
I also know a little about it. to me

1275
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,440
I also know a little about botanicals.

1276
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,720
I also know a little about zoology

1277
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,640
Do you know. I also want to know about the travel

1278
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,119
I know a little. and then there is something

1279
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,240
Called Vertical Education. which is like yaar

1280
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,400
I don't know the rest. to me

1281
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,839
Only zoology comes. Ok? but then

1282
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Very well understood in zoology

1283
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,040
So friend, how do species originate?

1284
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,720
How does their evolution take place? and and

1285
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,960
Like different biogenetic stuff in that. A

1286
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,359
This is the difference between a BTech and a PhD. One

1287
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,119
normal people like us who have gone through one

1288
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,520
I have completed my degree. They are generalists.

1289
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,359
Infact majority of the jobs in India today

1290
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,520
There are only generalists in the date of . that they

1291
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,119
A little bit of Excel comes in, a little bit of a little

1292
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,040
Some marketing might be coming, some customers

1293
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,040
Success must be coming, a little monetization

1294
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,520
He must be coming. and then basically you come

1295
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,599
Deep Hard Core Experts. Ok? to whom

1296
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,160
Just like computer science is known to everyone

1297
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,160
It comes. Machine Learning and AI Is Just a

1298
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,680
Very Small Part of Computer Science. But

1299
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,119
what happened in the last 5 years

1300
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,920
Computer Science Engineers are highly respected

1301
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,240
It used to happen. Now because that is general knowledge

1302
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,240
Or is it a general capability that has become a commodity?

1303
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,280
Has been. The same will happen with GBT. so which

1304
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,359
Those are generic horizontal information

1305
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,079
So let it become accessible. They Commoditize

1306
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,800
It will be done. But when you want to go deep in someone

1307
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,880
Then you basically call experts in the thing

1308
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,880
Do you trust me? for example example you

1309
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,400
Your General If you are suffering from cough and cold

1310
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,240
You can put your general symptoms on GBD

1311
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,480
brother what type of things will you give me

1312
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,480
Should be done. But if you have any questions about your surgery

1313
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,400
If you want to get it done then basically you can do it on a robot

1314
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,800
You will not believe it because it is highly

1315
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,960
Critical. It's that why we like PhDs

1316
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,520
and doctors are so much more valuable and they

1317
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,319
Will become even more valuable. so what first

1318
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,160
This has been happening for the past three-four years, Na Jenji's

1319
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,760
Basically this was the approach that friend we

1320
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,520
Let's try everything. in our CV

1321
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,720
There should also be marketing strength.

1322
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,000
There should also be strength in coding.

1323
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,720
The product should also have strength. So

1324
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,960
We know everything. But those who are of old age

1325
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,559
Old Edge is the master of all jack of none

1326
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,319
You can see that more after AI

1327
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,160
It will become relevant. because now people are saying

1328
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,920
is that friend what you mean is 10%

1329
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Marketing comes, 10% customer support comes

1330
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,720
We will get it done through AI anyway.

1331
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,040
We need someone who knows 90% depth

1332
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,880
The aim is to make a product. who gets 90%

1333
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,079
To register a marketing campaign. So

1334
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,079
Suddenly you will see that specialized work

1335
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,440
Force will become the norm in any

1336
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,640
Industry. hmm because if you have to give

1337
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,319
your money to somebody you'd rather want them to

1338
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,280
do one task very very good rather than 10

1339
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,520
task is slightly good and when you are a specialist

1340
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,160
You actually become AI agents

1341
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,160
You can work better with the program

1342
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:27,760
is absolutely AI agent will increase your

1343
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,599
Probability and Reduce Your Time Span

1344
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,599
To become a specialist and two types of

1345
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,200
There will be a journalist who will say yaar let's

1346
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,119
use this technology and avail it to

1347
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,359
basically become a specialist and do very well

1348
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,200
In their life. and the second one who will say

1349
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,599
that brother your brother is sitting here how can this happen

1350
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,839
Will you remove it? they will start with delusion and

1351
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,559
And up with elimination and elimination is

1352
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,280
Very painful. so it's better to prevent

1353
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,839
that elimination by getting rid of that

1354
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Delusion Today. Delulu is not the only one

1355
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:59,359
Cellulu. So either look at AI as an enemy

1356
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,160
Or look at AI as a friend.

1357
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,800
Absolutely. Let's go back to the notebook.

1358
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,599
Ok? So up to the guidelines of a 22 year old

1359
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,640
We had arrived. Where We Directed People To

1360
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,680
Get inu code and content which is also available under Naval Ravikant

1361
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:18,240
They say. Interesting.

1362
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,720
A Target Becoming a Specialist for 24.

1363
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,720
Now two years of the job have ended. Now!

1364
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,480
Ask yourself what am I for

1365
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:30,160
Should I become a specialist? A Second Point AI

1366
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:33,040
Learn about agents and AI agents

1367
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,760
Work together and advance your career

1368
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,920
Increase it. Do not reject the use of AI

1369
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,079
Agents out of human ego. Correct? This only

1370
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,880
There are two points. and spend a lot of time in

1371
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,880
That one single opportunity. whatever you are

1372
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,240
Doing. Now it doesn't mean anything, earlier people used to think so

1373
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,680
that friend you are putting in all efforts, any effort

1374
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,440
Are you making a product or creating anything?

1375
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,280
I am doing it in life. So friend two or three

1376
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,240
Let's try it after a year. end if even then

1377
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,640
If it didn't happen then it didn't happen. i think now the

1378
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,880
The world will move forwards to a space where

1379
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,480
Pay to create something substantial. Do-Ti

1380
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,920
There won't be a year's effort. Meaning, you have your

1381
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,520
If you want to become a specialist in your job too then

1382
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,599
You won't be able to make it in 2 years. You have no five

1383
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,319
Will have to do it for a year. That will double your effort

1384
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,960
It will take place. but the reward you get is because this is

1385
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,800
Still not the whole 5x game basically

1386
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,559
Life is all about risk reward ratio.

1387
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,240
the denominator of us comes down to how much you

1388
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,119
You are taking a risk. it comes on the numerator that

1389
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,280
How much reward are you getting? these rewards

1390
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,800
The higher your risk in life,

1391
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,920
That's basically the probability of your life

1392
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:33,520
And the growth that will happen will be sorted. Hmm

1393
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,000
okay i don't think we need to talk about the

1394
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,960
30 plus age group because actually

1395
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,319
This should be the strategy that we have presented

1396
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,200
It's curry. Oh Ah this is my favorite. My

1397
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,839
Some people think that by 35

1398
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,200
you should be in a place where you can choose

1399
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,800
Weather to work for money or not. we are the people

1400
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,400
If you say no then it is a big misconception

1401
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,079
Is. People say that I have to retire. So

1402
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,160
Do you know the definition of retirement in India?

1403
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,760
What is said that friend we will not work tomorrow

1404
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,280
do. Retirement is not the ultimate goal.

1405
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,400
Optionality is the goal. that you can choose weather

1406
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,359
You need to work and wether you want to work.

1407
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,440
The more optionality you create

1408
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,240
the sooner you will start doing what you

1409
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,400
Want to do rather than what you have to do.

1410
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,040
The Moment You Figure Out What You Want to Do

1411
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,559
then you will start that is the only way you

1412
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,240
can spend a really long time doing it

1413
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,760
and i don't know if you have noticed this or

1414
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,240
A huge risk is going on in Not India

1415
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,400
Are mid-40 people losing their jobs?

1416
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,800
the fastest and they are not getting

1417
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,200
Replacement works because they cost 15-20

1418
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,880
The work that was done that year, that stack, that utility

1419
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,359
That profession itself has been eliminated. and that

1420
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,839
Ranveer is very scary because he is in his mid 40s

1421
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,440
I don't have a family, those families are

1422
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,440
Very critical time for the education of those children

1423
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,680
it occurs. it is a single biggest

1424
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,720
differentiator of a phase where which decides

1425
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,520
The Orbits of the Generation. and at that point

1426
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,079
Basically huge losses are being incurred. But those people

1427
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,040
what will you do? I have no idea. give will

1428
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,119
have to reinvent and either they do some gig or

1429
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,400
Give it up, then I will not talk to such people

1430
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,760
have spoken. What do those people do then?

1431
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,599
They say look friend, now there are only 3-4 years left

1432
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,599
Are. Our children are 14-15 years old. Any 

1433
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,680
In any case, we basically do something about our 3-4 years

1434
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,480
I will choose the career part so that my kids

1435
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,160
Can go to college successfully. And once he

1436
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,160
Once we reach college, it is our duty

1437
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,839
It happens. We will see, it means nothing

1438
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,200
What should I do? but at least kids

1439
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:25,280
Education should be sorted. but if means

1440
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,319
That's a scary thing, man. that is where

1441
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,319
I want to like an India is a service

1442
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,240
based economy. Always remember that. Unlikely

1443
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:35,280
US which is a manufacturing economy.

1444
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,800
India is a service based economy.

1445
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,400
So mid 40s so that's why today's 25 year olds

1446
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,520
This should be remembered from now onwards. Think about it if

1447
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,599
If this is happening in 40 years then give it time

1448
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,079
move forward in their career it is not 20

1449
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:54,079
Years Away With these it will be in the mid 30s.

1450
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:56,240
Hum hum yaar I have read one thing related to AI

1451
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,520
I know that the better your prompt

1452
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,760
There will be engineering skills. a just as much

1453
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,559
You will be able to use AI well. own

1454
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,319
In job, in own business etc. So

1455
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,119
Work on prompt engineering skills.

1456
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:12,480
Prep engineering means basically brain engineering

1457
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,760
Clarity. Be a clear thinker. this is a core

1458
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,400
Skill is going to be developed in the coming time. So

1459
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,160
Probably people who have lost their jobs and are in their mid-40s.

1460
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,319
Playing with Prompt Engineering in

1461
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,640
Get started. Absolutely. now that should be the first

1462
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,960
Step. It is a new piano. New piano.

1463
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,400
GPD is a new piano. and the new

1464
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,720
Guitar. Whatever you find sexier? or or

1465
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,720
So start creating content. Anything

1466
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,559
Create sir, create anything in life

1467
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:41,040
Do it friend. Hmm. Ok. There is one last section.

1468
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,599
It is important to talk about this section

1469
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,480
Is. This is a question of my own as well. I

1470
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,640
I have noticed that if someone needs to know coding

1471
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,119
The skill comes.

1472
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,760
Even in today's day where coding is

1473
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,880
Be gradually replaced through AI

1474
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,520
Used to be. Still, there is a need for coders.

1475
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,400
In all tech companies.

1476
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,640
There are two angles. Firstly, the remaining 65% code

1477
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,480
Yes, he is human dependent. let's know you

1478
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,920
drops to 40 30 there still be some

1479
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,000
Element of human input. but i feel that

1480
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,119
If you learn coding once, you can

1481
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,240
Transition to other tech careers more easily.

1482
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,880
Correct? So this is a very good safeguard

1483
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,280
Can. But coding takes a little time too

1484
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,359
Learn. but do you think it's still a high

1485
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,040
Value skills? I think I don't think

1486
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,440
Coding is a high value skill. I think

1487
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,640
It's the Highest Value Skill in Life Today

1488
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,079
In the Modern World. look absolutely friend

1489
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:38,240
which is basically the highest order skill today

1490
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:42,079
That's coding. Because you can do whatever you want

1491
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,400
do some part of your work in life

1492
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,319
Will definitely require coding. End

1493
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,640
What is coding? Coding is not a syntax

1494
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,119
Is. Just like English is a language, Spanish is a

1495
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,040
There is language. Coding is the language of computers. So

1496
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,280
Now you have to do some work today

1497
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,119
If you want to do better on a date than with other people then you

1498
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,280
You will do it only with the help of computer but

1499
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,280
How do you talk to a computer? only to you

1500
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,400
You will have to learn the computer language. that is

1501
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,079
The Most Elemental Reason on Why Everybody

1502
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Should learn coding. So if you like coding

1503
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,640
If you want to learn then either you should

1504
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,119
You may spend a year learning on YouTube but then you

1505
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,440
It will take 510 years. The other way is that you

1506
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,839
Learn from someone who knows how to code himself

1507
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,240
You do it. Now who is he? it is happening

1508
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,760
Your software developer. so ideally if you

1509
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,920
If you want to learn coding then you need a software

1510
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,440
You have to learn from the developer, right? now it has arrived there

1511
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,319
The problem is that the majority of India

1512
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:32,079
The faculty who is teaching you in the institutions

1513
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:35,520
Has he ever done coding?

1514
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,240
And that's the problem. If you need a specialized

1515
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,799
Vertical knowledge is required then you should only go

1516
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,359
in an institution where you will find

1517
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,119
specialized skills are taught and they

1518
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:49,359
Who will teach the skills? live professionals

1519
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,280
are already working in the industry who

1520
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,280
Live industry mentors say. So if

1521
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,839
If you want to learn coding then you should do something like this

1522
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,839
I want to go to a tech school where the faculty is

1523
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,680
who still code day and night and today

1524
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:02,480
There is a lot of coding to do. because if

1525
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,559
If they used to code even 5 years ago, then maybe they code

1526
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,960
And the syntax itself has changed. Cricket

1527
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,599
It has changed sir. So when the sport is changing

1528
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,040
If yes then you need to know the currently most relevant

1529
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,200
The most skilled players in the sport

1530
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,119
You have to go and learn to play from them. So if

1531
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,200
If you want to learn coding then you can go live

1532
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,720
Industry Software Engineers and Those

1533
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,880
are very powerful because those people

1534
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,359
Let's code. The same recruit as of today

1535
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,040
are also doing. Whatever is new in your company

1536
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,520
Fresh talent comes and we train them too

1537
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,839
Are. So what's better than that? i have come

1538
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,960
basically you will end up studying from the

1539
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,640
Same people who you will be working with after

1540
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,280
Three four years. hmm ok mukul bhai very much

1541
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:45,920
Pacey was an effective and practical podcast

1542
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:49,119
These. I think from teenagers to those who

1543
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,720
People are in their late 20s, at least for them this is the end.

1544
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,200
There is a to end podcast. when it comes to

1545
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,040
Career guidance. any signing of notes

1546
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,280
because we have scared people a lot but

1547
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,240
Also gave guidance at the same time. No we haven't

1548
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,880
I have also told you some surefire ways not to be afraid

1549
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,400
Is. It is necessary to be afraid, but being afraid is not enough.

1550
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,920
So

1551
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,160
We have developed some frameworks to overcome fear.

1552
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,319
Tell me. It is a very simple thing that friend, your

1553
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,480
Bring clarity in your life. Ok? I

1554
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:15,599
think the easiest way for someone to build a

1555
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,680
career tomorrow is that yaar build your career

1556
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,440
Around Software Engineering. i think it

1557
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,480
it will be the most relevant skill for the

1558
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,799
The Next 50 Years. So if you have a high

1559
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,880
equally high a with probability

1560
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,720
I want a career with clarity. Ok? Or

1561
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,799
If you want a career with equally high rewards

1562
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,359
I Think Coding Can Be a Great Thing

1563
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:38,160
Thing. If you don't like it then give it

1564
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,160
keep on basically finding what really

1565
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,520
Interest you. It's basically fine for him. You

1566
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,720
Keep achieving your short term goals. whether

1567
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,280
Nothing in college, just a temporary job

1568
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,280
I should, whatever it is. But Keep Finding

1569
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,040
Your interest areas. Interest Areas

1570
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,040
How will you come? The more you create, the more

1571
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,680
You will try as much as you can experiment

1572
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,880
You will, but I ideally buy 25 for you

1573
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,520
There should be clarity about what I need in life

1574
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,640
What is the plan. and then you basically am for

1575
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,119
The best outcome. and i think just keep on

1576
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,040
Doing That Build, Learn, Iterate Wala Fly

1577
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,520
The wheel has to be kept turning again and again. and i think

1578
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,839
Learn the skills of tomorrow. and i think

1579
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,240
Computer science and coding is the most

1580
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:15,359
Relevant skills that one should learn today.

1581
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,760
Ok. Thank you brother. all the best for

1582
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:22,160
Everything in the near future. i think you are

1583
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,440
One of the Only Profitable ATEC Founders in

1584
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,599
Our Country. That's enough friend. infact very

1585
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,440
All education companies are profitable. Butt Eye

1586
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,040
Think that profitability is very important

1587
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,119
He is seen as a success milestone.

1588
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,359
But if you think carefully then running a business

1589
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,880
The definition of it is the same. and the company's name

1590
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,799
Making profit is very important. because that

1591
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,559
They reinvest the profit and provide it to the consumers

1592
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,400
We can make better products for them. That same

1593
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,760
He basically cares more about his team than profit

1594
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,079
Keep in mind to motivate them more and help them

1595
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,480
It can give more growth in their career.

1596
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,720
And it's not about us. I think my team is

1597
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,799
Very exceptional, very hard working.

1598
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,400
His effort and sacrifice were also the same. I

1599
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,480
Think Founders Are Over Glamorized In

1600
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,720
India. it is actually like behind

1601
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,000
every great captain there is a great team

1602
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,920
Who wins the tournament. the captains are just

1603
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,119
Just for the presentation ceremony. A

1604
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,119
I think we have given a 100% solution

1605
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,440

In the end, brother told me that technology is everything

1611
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,760

Are you doing this or are you acting? every

1613
