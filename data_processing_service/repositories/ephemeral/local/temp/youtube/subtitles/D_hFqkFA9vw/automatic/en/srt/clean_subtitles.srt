Hello Friends.  Friends, the kind of indications that are coming out, which I will discuss in the video, it seems that a very big war is about to happen.  The question here is, to what extent is this going to be limited? Meaning, will this be limited only to Iran and Israel? Look at the way things are unfolding, the build up that is happening.   It seems that this is definitely going to convert into a regional war. In which you can see multiple countries of the Middle East fighting here. But will it go further than that ?  Whatever the rest of the super powers, whether it is Russia or Europe or China, will also be included in this, we will see later, but here you can see that the supreme leader of Iran has clearly said that the enemy is being punished right now, so basically what it is is that Iran has done retaliation on a very large scale, I will tell you further in the video what happens, it has even fired the Ghost missile and obviously Israel has also retaliated, we will discuss all that in detail in the video that what exactly is happening right now, let us move ahead, but before that friends, let me tell you all that from today, the UPSC batch of 2026, our GS Foundation Pratigya batch, has started.

You please tell me this.  So you will get the maximum discount. Let's get started. First of all, if we look at the historical context here.  Look, since 1979, that is, before 1979 you all know that the dynasty that existed in Iran used to rule but the Islamic revolution happened and since then Iran's relations with the US had deteriorated a lot and you can see many important events like the US Embassy hostage crisis happened after 1979, in the Iran-Iraq war, the US supported Iraq, after that sanctions and Jespua happened, the deal was cracked in 2015, the US withdrew Jespua in 2018 because Donald Trump did not want it and then later on Qasim Soleimani was assassinated which was a big setback for Iran and ultimately if you see now, Donald Trump is repeatedly saying that we will impose sanctions on them.  He has been doing these things for a long time. Apart from this, IRGC which is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is declared a terrorist organization. And you're continuing to see military build-up throughout the region, in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, everywhere. And now you all know exactly that three nuclear facilities have been bombed.  Especially the Fado nuclear facility, considering this, this entire matter has now crossed the red line as Iran says. Here the US Intelligence says that more than 60% enrichment had been done and that is why we did not want Iran to be able to make nuclear weapons.  But look, this morning itself I made a video in which I told you that based on the reports, some reports are also coming that Iran had already transferred about 400 kg of uranium. He was removed from the Fado nuclear plant. So this is also an indication that perhaps America might have thought that its entire mission was successful.  This probably did not happen in actuality because Iran still has large amounts of uranium enrichment which is more than 60%. Well, considering all these things, now the wait was to see what Iran was going to do.  Now you can see from Iran's side, their supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said here that look, the enemy has made a big mistake, committed a big crime and it must be punished.  He should be punished for this, and he is getting this punishment right now.  It is being punished right now.  He said this clearly here.  Now look they say anime.  What does anime mean?  Not just America, along with America, Israel, apart from this, all the Gulf countries that provide base to the US military, whether it is Qatar or any other country, they will also be punished here, they are talking about the enemy because that is what I am telling you that you can witness a big war here very soon and in fact it has been clearly said by Iran that any country that supports America, meaning if we are being attacked and any country is supporting it from behind, then that too is our enemy.  So apart from this there is UK and France here. Many countries can join this.  Then apart from this what the Supreme Leader said was a grave big mistake.  So this is basically saying that this is not a minor incident.  This is not a small incident that America has done at this time.  Attempts have been made to destroy our most important strategic assets, the nuclear sites. And somewhere it is that America feels that we do not have the capability.  We will fall from here.  So all this is not going to happen. We will retaliate on a massive scale and they must be punished.  Meaning he is talking about punishment of the enemy.  So, in a way, he is not the only one threatening. That is not rhetoric.  This means that he has clearly stated that he will attack forcefully on a very large scale. How can an attack occur now?  Look, there are two-three things.  One is what will the short term response be?  Medium term and long term. If we talk about short term then proxy negotiation is taking place here.  The rest of the proxies including Hezbollah can all be included. Cyber ​​attacks can be carried out on a large scale. Coordinated hacks could be carried out on American assets and Western countries. Missile drone strikes, these things keep happening.  It is still going on.  But looking at this you will see that America has also come on red alert.  America has issued a warning to all its citizens. World wide caution has been issued. Global Adult has issued an alert that all American citizens should be careful. Wherever you are, you can be attacked.  So you can understand to what extent this matter has progressed.  Then if we talk about medium term escalation, you are already hearing that there is talk of disrupting the Strait of Hormos.  There is talk of blocking him.  This can cause a very big problem, regarding which I made a detailed video this morning.  Then along with this, direct retaliation can be done on Israel, which is already going on right now. Apart from this, proxy, as I mentioned, can be involved on a larger scale. But in extreme cases, as here, there is a huge fear, an atmosphere of panic as to whether this will convert into World War 3. I told you yesterday also that look, a world war does not happen like this by making an announcement that the world war has started from today. These things build up slowly. We have seen this before, World War One happened, World War Two happened.  Earlier, these were, in a way, European wars.  But gradually countries started joining in and suddenly it became known that yes, almost the entire world has joined in it.  So you will get to see such things.  Let's assume that Iran attacks US Navy vessels in the Gulf States.  Ok?  So because of this the matter can become quite serious. Then the US will also respond.  There will be massive retaliation.  Then Israel can also launch a privilege campaign here.  In Lebanon, in Syria, in Iran.  NATO and Russia may also be involved.  So this can lead to a war on a large scale.  Now look here, if you see, just after the statement of the Supreme Leader, in fact, the Military Central Command of Iran issued a video message and here they said that Trump is a gambler. And you may start this war but we will be the once to end it.  If you look, here he said, Mr. Trump the Gambler.  Meaning, Iran is calling Trump a gambler. Because if you look, what has Trump been saying over and over again ?  Trump was saying that we do not want war.  We do not want to send our troops to the Middle East. Why do we unnecessarily get involved in that? But actually, Trump did just the opposite of what he had been saying. Now whatever may be the reason, what actually happens here is that Trump is being called a gambler because Trump might be feeling that Iran is weak. We will finish him off.  So Iran says no, you have made a big gamble. You may start this war.  You may have started this war but we will end it. So again this becomes a big warning and that is why if you see, the Ghost missile here, Ghost missile means an invisible missile of Iran whose name is Khyber Shaken.  Khyber Shaken is a missile which again evades many radars and hits the enemy targets. If you see this, Khyber Shaken means breaker of news.  That means, you will get to see the 7th century battle that took place between the Muslim forces and the Jaris Fortress.  Meaning, it symbolises it.  And if you see this again, what kind of missile is this? You will see this medium range ballistic missile whose range is 1450 km. is around.  This is solid fuel.  Meaning it has the capability to be launched immediately. Mobility means here road mobile means transport, you can do it easily and can launch it from anywhere.  War Head is in it and that is the most important thing.  That is maneuverable reentry vehicle.  Meaning, when it is launched, the way it is launched, it is launched at supersonic speed and its direction can be changed in the air itself. And that is one of the biggest things because the radar here, whether it is the Air Defense System, Arrow 3 of Israel or the Iron Dome, is being discussed a lot these days.  So by avoiding all this, it can directly hit the assets and in this you will also see materials, composite body and such like. Meaning it absorbs the radar signals.  It does not allow it to go back and that is why it is considered very dangerous. This missile, let me tell you, is Iran's third generation missile, which was developed by Iran itself and was first shown in February 2022 and it was made by the aerospace division of IRGC and actually if you see, after launching these missiles, the news was confirmed that large scale blasts were heard in Jerusalem and the Iranian missiles were continuously seen flying in the Israeli territory. Here in fact it is also being claimed that some things have been hit at the airport in Tel Avi, which is a major international hub. Apart from this, the biological research centre which has been accused of being a military biolab has also been hit.  Northern Haifa is done.  Many air bases have also been hit.  The confirmed damage is basically to many civilian buildings and infrastructure inside Israel.  There has been a hit there and based on early reports, many individuals have been injured there. This is being told.  So you will see that now Iran has also started retotaling on a very large scale. But it is obvious that Israel will also not lag behind.  And if you see, Israel has again launched a huge attack on Iran today.  And it is being said that six airports of Iran have been destroyed.  Meaning, it has been done in such a way that he will not be able to operate from there. Apart from this, 15 military aircraft have been damaged. If you look at Iran, you will see these six targets here.  These six airports were bombed by Israel and there were about 15 such military aircraft which were destroyed.  It was blasted.  So the overall meaning of continuously saying this is that things are gradually escalating further.  Now actually we have to wait and see when and where Iran attacks America's assets.  Because from now on, if these things happen, then you can understand that Donald Trump has said that we will retaliate it on a bigger and bigger scale.  The supreme leader Khamayni is also in danger of assassination.  There's a lot going on. I will let you know whatever update comes.  But before I go, a very interesting question.
