00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
Hello Friends.  Friends, the kind of

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,000
indications that are coming out, which I

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,080
will discuss in the video, it seems that a very

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,639
big war is about to happen.  The question here is,

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,120
to what extent is this going to be limited?

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
Meaning, will this be limited only to Iran and Israel?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,039
Look at the way things are

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
unfolding, the build up that is happening.   It

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,960
seems that this is definitely going to convert into a regional war.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,439
In which you can see multiple

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,680
countries of the Middle East fighting here.

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,680

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,679
But will it go further than that

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,760
?  Whatever the rest of the super powers, whether it is

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,680
Russia or Europe or China, will

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
also be included in this,

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,920
we will see later, but here you

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
can see that the supreme leader of Iran has

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,800
clearly said that the enemy is being

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
punished right now, so basically what it is is that

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Iran has done retaliation on a very large scale,

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
I will tell you

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
further in the video what happens, it has even fired the Ghost missile

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
and obviously Israel has also

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,879
retaliated, we will discuss all that in detail

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
in the video that

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,160
what exactly is happening right now, let us

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,120
move ahead, but before that friends, let me

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,760
tell you all that from today, the UPSC

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,760
batch of 2026, our GS Foundation Pratigya batch, has

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,520
started.  Its special thing is

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
that complete preparation is done for the prelims mains interview.

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,920
Also,

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
if you crack the prelims,

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
your entire fee is also refunded.

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
Apart from this, there are tests every month

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,640
in which the top ranker is

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,280
given a cash reward of â‚¹ 1,000.   Not

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,000
only this, if you buy the batch today then a

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,479
seven day refund policy has also been introduced here.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
If for any reason you want to back out or do

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,560
not want to continue the batch,

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
your full fee will be refunded.  This

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
is a huge opportunity.  You can do one thing.

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,720
My personal team is here.  This

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,560
is the phone number.  You can simply call on this number and

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
you will get whatever information you need or if you have any

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
doubts.  And all you have to do is

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
use the code Ankit Live.  You please tell

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
me this.  So you will get the maximum discount.

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
Let's get started.

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
First of all, if we

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
look at the historical context here.  Look, since 1979, that is,

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
before 1979 you all know that the

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,240
dynasty that existed in Iran used to rule

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,479
but the Islamic revolution happened and since

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,719
then Iran's relations

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
with the US had deteriorated a lot and

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,119
you can see many important events

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,400
like the US Embassy hostage crisis happened after

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,319
1979, in the Iran-Iraq war, the US

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
supported Iraq, after that

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,599
sanctions and Jespua happened, the deal was cracked in 2015, the

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,440
US withdrew Jespua

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
in 2018 because Donald Trump did

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
not want it and then later on Qasim

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,160
Soleimani was assassinated

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
which was a big setback for Iran and

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,560
ultimately if you see now,

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
Donald Trump is repeatedly saying

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,720
that we will impose sanctions on them.  He has been

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
doing these things for a long time.

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Apart from this, IRGC which is the Islamic

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Revolutionary Guard Corps is

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
declared a terrorist organization.

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,200
And you're continuing to see military build-up throughout the region, in Iraq,

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, everywhere.

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
And now

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,280
you all know exactly that three

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
nuclear facilities have been

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
bombed.  Especially the Fado

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,080
nuclear facility, considering this,

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,319
this entire matter has now crossed the red line

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
as Iran says.

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,360
Here the US Intelligence says

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,440
that more than 60% enrichment had been done

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
and that is why we did not want Iran to be able to

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
make nuclear weapons.  But look, this

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
morning itself I made a video in which I

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,200
told you that based on the reports,

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,080
some reports are also coming that Iran had

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,319
already transferred about 400 kg of uranium.

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,319

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,640
He was removed from the Fado nuclear plant.

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,879
So this is also an indication that

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
perhaps America might have thought that its

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
entire mission was successful.  This

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,680
probably did not happen in actuality because Iran

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,080
still has large amounts of uranium enrichment which is more than 60%.

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, considering all these things,

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
now the wait was to see

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
what Iran was going to do.  Now you can see from Iran's side,

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
their supreme leader

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,000
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said here that

106
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,200
look, the enemy has made a big

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,920
mistake, committed a big crime and it must be

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,319
punished.  He should be punished for this, and

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,360
he is getting this punishment right now.  It is

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,120
being punished right now.  He

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
said this clearly here.  Now look they say

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
anime.  What does anime mean?  Not just

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,879
America, along with America, Israel,

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
apart from this, all the Gulf countries that

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,040
provide base to the US military,

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,280
whether it is Qatar or any other country,

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
they will also be punished here, they are

118
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,960
talking about the enemy because that is what I am telling you

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
that you can witness a big war here very

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
soon and in fact it has been

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,160
clearly said by Iran that

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,800
any country that supports America, meaning

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
if we are being attacked and

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
any country is supporting it from behind, then

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
that too is our enemy.  So

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
apart from this there is UK and France here.

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,479
Many countries can join this.  Then

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,199
apart from this what the Supreme Leader said was a

129
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,120
grave big mistake.  So this is basically saying

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
that this is not a minor incident.  This is

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
not a small incident that America has

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
done at this time.  Attempts have been made to destroy our most important

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
strategic assets, the nuclear sites.

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,759
And

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
somewhere it is that America feels that

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
we do not have the capability.  We will fall

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
from here.  So all this is not going to happen.

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,160
We will retaliate on a massive scale

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and they must be punished.  Meaning he is talking about

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
punishment of the enemy.  So, in

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
a way, he is not the only one threatening.

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,520
That is not rhetoric.  This means that he has

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,840

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,600
clearly stated that he will attack forcefully on a very large scale.

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
How can an attack occur now?  Look, there are two-three

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
things.  One is what will the short term response

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
be?  Medium term and long term.

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,520
If we talk about short term then

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,919
proxy negotiation is taking place here.  The rest of the proxies

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,160
including Hezbollah can all be included.

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
Cyber â€‹â€‹attacks can be carried out on a large scale.

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000

153
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Coordinated hacks could be carried out on American assets and Western countries.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
Missile drone strikes, these things keep

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
happening.  It is still going on.  But

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,560
looking at this you will see that America has also

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,680
come on red alert.  America has

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,000
issued a warning to all its citizens.

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,639
World wide caution has been issued.

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,039
Global Adult has issued an alert that

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,759
all American citizens should be careful.

162
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,759
Wherever you are, you

163
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
can be attacked.  So you can understand to

164
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,880
what extent this matter has progressed.  Then if we

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
talk about medium term escalation,

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,280
you are already hearing that there is talk of disrupting the Strait of

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
Hormos.  There

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
is talk of blocking him.  This can cause a very big problem,

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
regarding which I

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
made a detailed video this morning.  Then along with this,

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
direct retaliation can be done on

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
Israel, which is already going on right now.

174
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Apart from this, proxy, as I

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,039
mentioned, can be involved on a larger scale.

176
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,039
But in extreme cases, as

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
here, there is a huge fear, an atmosphere of panic as to

178
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,199
whether this will convert into World War 3.

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,440
I told you yesterday also

180
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,120
that look, a world war does

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,120
not happen like this by making an announcement

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
that the world war has started from today.

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
These things build up slowly.

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,199
We have seen this before, World War

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,199
One happened, World War Two happened.  Earlier, these

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,840
were, in a way, European wars.  But

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
gradually countries started joining in and suddenly it became

188
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,240
known that yes, almost the entire world has

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
joined in it.  So

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,120
you will get to see such things.  Let's assume that

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,440
Iran attacks US Navy vessels in the Gulf

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
States.  Ok?  So

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,919
because of this the matter can become quite serious.

194
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Then the US will also respond.  There

195
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,319
will be massive retaliation.  Then Israel

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
can also launch a privilege campaign here.  In Lebanon,

197
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,479
in Syria, in Iran.  NATO and Russia

198
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
may also be involved.  So this

199
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,520
can lead to a war on a large scale.  Now look

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
here,

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,240
if you see, just after the statement of the Supreme Leader, in fact, the

202
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,319

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,560
Military Central Command of Iran

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
issued a video message and here they

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,160
said that Trump is a gambler.

206
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,240
And you may start this war but we will be the

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,039
once to end it.  If you look, here

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,120
he said, Mr. Trump the Gambler.  Meaning,

209
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,720
Iran is calling Trump a gambler.

210
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,960
Because if you look, what has Trump been saying over and over again

211
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
?  Trump was saying that

212
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
we do not want war.  We do

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
not want to send our troops to the Middle East.

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
Why do we unnecessarily get involved in that?

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But actually, Trump did

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,639
just the opposite of what he had been saying.

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
Now whatever may be the reason,

218
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
what actually happens here is that Trump is being

219
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,240
called a gambler because

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Trump might be feeling that Iran is weak.

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
We will finish him off.  So Iran says

222
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
no, you have made a big gamble.

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,520
You may start this war.  You may have started this war

224
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
but we will end it.

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
So again this becomes a big warning

226
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,639
and that is why if you see, the

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,199
Ghost missile here, Ghost missile

228
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,720
means an invisible missile of Iran

229
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,759
whose name is Khyber Shaken.  Khyber

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,240
Shaken is a missile which again evades many radars

231
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
and hits the enemy targets.

232
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
If you see this, Khyber Shaken

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,039
means breaker of news.  That means,

234
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,919

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,080

236
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,800
you will get to see the 7th century battle that took place between the Muslim forces and the Jaris Fortress.  Meaning, it

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
symbolises it.  And if you see this again,

238
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,640
what kind of missile is this?

239
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
You will see this medium range ballistic missile

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
whose range is 1450 km.

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,920
is around.  This is solid fuel.  Meaning it

242
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,320
has the capability to be launched immediately.

243
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,160
Mobility means here road mobile means

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
transport, you can do it easily and can

245
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
launch it from anywhere.  War Head is

246
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,440
in it and that is the most important thing.  That

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
is maneuverable reentry vehicle.  Meaning, when it is

248
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
launched, the way it is launched, it is

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,519
launched at supersonic speed

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
and its direction can be changed in the air itself.

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,600
And that is one of the

252
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
biggest things because the radar here,

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,800
whether it is the Air Defense System, Arrow

254
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
3 of Israel or the Iron Dome, is being

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
discussed a lot these days.  So by

256
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,200
avoiding all this, it can directly hit the

257
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,120
assets and in this

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
you will also see materials, composite body and such like.

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,519
Meaning it absorbs the radar signals.  It does

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
not

261
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,680
allow it to go back and that is why it is considered very dangerous.

262
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
This missile, let me tell you, is

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,800
Iran's third generation missile, which was

264
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,160
developed by Iran itself and was first

265
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,560
shown in February 2022 and

266
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,880
it was made by the aerospace division of IRGC

267
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
and actually if you

268
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,320
see, after launching these missiles, the news was

269
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,720
confirmed that

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,200
large scale blasts were heard in Jerusalem and the

271
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Iranian missiles were continuously

272
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
seen flying in the Israeli territory.

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
Here in fact it is also being

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,959
claimed that some things have been hit at the airport in Tel Avi,

275
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,200
which is a major international hub.

276
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,279

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
Apart from this, the biological research centre

278
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,279
which has been accused of being a military biolab has

279
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
also been hit.  Northern

280
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,839
Haifa is done.  Many air bases have also been hit.  The

281
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,079
confirmed damage is basically to many

282
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,160
civilian buildings and

283
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,480
infrastructure inside Israel.  There has been a

284
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,640
hit there and based on early reports,

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
many individuals have been injured there.

286
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,519
This is being told.  So you will

287
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,240
see that now Iran has

288
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,760
also started retotaling on a very large scale.

289
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
But it

290
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,720
is obvious that Israel will also not lag behind.  And if

291
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,200
you see, Israel has

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,120
again launched a huge attack on Iran today.  And it is being

293
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,680
said that six

294
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,760
airports of Iran have been destroyed.  Meaning, it has been done in such a way

295
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,399
that he will not be able to operate from there.

296
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,320
Apart from this, 15 military

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
aircraft have been damaged.

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,160
If you look at Iran, you will see these six targets

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,720
here.  These six

300
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,720
airports were bombed

301
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,519
by Israel and there were about 15 such

302
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,160
military aircraft which were destroyed.  It was

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,040
blasted.  So the

304
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,200
overall meaning of continuously saying this is that things are gradually

305
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,519
escalating further.  Now

306
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,800
actually we have to wait and see

307
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,120
when and where Iran attacks America's

308
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,360
assets.  Because from now on,

309
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
if these things happen, then you can understand that Donald

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
Trump has said that we

311
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,519
will retaliate it on a bigger and bigger scale.  The

312
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
supreme leader Khamayni is also in danger of

313
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,200
assassination.  There's a lot going on.

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
I will let you know whatever update comes.  But

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
before I go, a very interesting question.   The

316
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,959
Persian Gulf is in the news a lot these

317
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,680
days.  Can you tell which countries

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200

319
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
share their coastline with the Persian Gulf?  You have to tell and

320
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
you all know the right answer to this.  You will

321
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,760
