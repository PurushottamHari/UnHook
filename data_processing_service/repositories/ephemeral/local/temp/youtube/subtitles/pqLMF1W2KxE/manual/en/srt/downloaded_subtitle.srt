1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
The hands that fired the guns in the Pahalgam attack are still

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,720
alive to this day.  The person who had

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,720
 

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,679
come to attack Pahalgam

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,120

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,120
turned out to be the SSG Para Commando of the Pakistani Army and this is how this thing came to light.

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,279
At the end of the attack, he took

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
selfies with the dead bodies and

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,039
went to the person who had recorded the video and asked him to talk about Palestine.

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,039
And as soon as he spoke

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,239
this thing came up.  They changed the location of their plan to attack the hotel to

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,640

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,040
Pahalgam.  Otherwise, the third terrorist who was the earlier

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,040
target,

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,360
entered Pakistan through the Attari border on a legal student visa.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,440
Why did the demand for buying satellite images of the Pahalgam area before the attack suddenly double?

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,520
This is not normal.  When

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,840
these OGWs were caught and

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
questioned in a police style, they told

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,560
line by line that as soon as the attack took place, US's

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,240
Max Technology

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,320
immediately broke its partnership with Pakistan's company BSI.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,880
This wasn't just any random firing.   By

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,200
choking the ground from three sides, the crowd was

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
gathered towards the Maggi stall saying,

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,900
you have so much guts that now you will

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,159
raise the domicile issue in Kashmir.

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,320
[Music]

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,640
Look, before we move ahead, let's talk about

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
India's increasing problems with increasing heat -

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,759
temperature and pollution.  India's

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,920
geographical location is such where the weather

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,320
remains hot and humid and due to global warming the

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
average temperature has increased by 1 degree in the last 30 years.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Dust, mud, heat,

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,439
all this remains for 10 months out of 12.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
40% plus people in India have oily skin

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,079
and hence due to dirt, pollution and excess

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,240
sebum production, acne problems are increasing in oily skin.

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
See, the sebaceous glands in oily skin

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,640

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
produce more sebum.  And when this sebum

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
mixes with dirt and dead skin, the pores get blocked

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
and that leads to pimples.  So

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,720
for this today I would like to tell you

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,520
about Derma Touch Salicylic 2% Face Wash.   It contains

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
BHA which controls oil and

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
cures acne and Zinc PCF which

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
keeps the skin hydrated.  You will start seeing results in six to eight weeks.

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
Formulated with powerful actives, this face wash is

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,480
fragrance free and suitable for all skin types.

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
So it is

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
well suited for sensitive skin also.  Doctor recommended Indian

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,840
pharmacy brand dermach makes solid

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,400
products.  The starting price of this 4 plus rated face wash is

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,360
just â‚¹149.  It is

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,440
available on their website dermach.com and

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
on all platforms like amazon, Flipkart, blink and also at your nearest pharmacy

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,599
store.  So let's come back to the topic.

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
See, this is Jammu and Kashmir and

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
within Jammu and Kashmir, there is Anantnag

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
district, within which falls

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,599
Pahalgam.  And when you are 5 Km from Pahalgam.  If you

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
climb up, there

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,519
is a 800 meter long plain here, Baisar, which is

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,400
also called Mini Switzerland of India.

74
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,319
And this is the place where the

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
terrorists attacked in a planned manner on April 22

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,400
and this incident is

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,879
not like a terrorist came and just

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,800
picked up a gun and started shooting.  This time a

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,879
huge planning has been done in which multiple

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,360
groups have attacked using well coordinated strategies

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
and technologies like Ultrasats.

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Now how was this attack carried

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
out?  How was the planning done?  Where did it happen?   If it

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
happened in Pakistan, then did multiple

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,720
proofs emerge?  I will tell you each and every thing

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
in this video and to

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
understand all these things we will have to go back a bit.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
So look, I just

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,879
showed you the Baisaran area.  There is

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
a village on this side whose name is Gur.  This village

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,680
officially

92
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,080
falls in Bijhara block of Anantnag district and in a house of this village,

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
Adil Hussain Thokar, the

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
first terrorist of Pahalgam attack, was born.  Just

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
a few days ago his house was blown up,

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
but when he was born in the year 1992, no

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
one had even imagined

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,799
that in the future he would carry out an attack like Pahalgam

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,170
due to which a war like situation would arise between the two countries.

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,640

101
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,360
[MUSIC]

102
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Network Successful Security.  Now when Adil was

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
growing up here, he first

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,319
took admission in Shah Hamdan Public School.  Then he completed his

105
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,200

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,239
12th class from Government Higher Secondary School, Beech Behara and by the year 2018, he

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,959

108
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,919
completed his MA from Rahmat Alam College, Anantnag and started teaching.

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
So till the year 2018, when he was in college,

110
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,600

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
his name did not come up in any anti-India activity.  But there was just one thing

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
that everyone noticed at that time, that

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
whenever a terrorist was killed in that area, he would

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
definitely go to his funeral.

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,320
Its name had

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
not been heard before in any other activity.  But

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,759
in April 2018 it started its real game.  On

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,759
29th of April 2018, what does this Adil

119
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
Thokar do?  He tells his family

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
that he has an exam and

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
for that he will have to go to Batgaon in Kashmir

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and after giving the exam he will return home. The

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
family agrees to this and

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
sends him but two to three days pass

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,919
but Adil does not

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
return home, instead he disappears. The family members

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,600
call him back to back but he does

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,560
not talk to them. Then, fed up and tired, on the second

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,120
of May 2018, Adil Thokar's mother

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,880
Shahzada Bano goes to the police station and

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,039
registers a missing complaint.  Now, the

132
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
missing report was registered but

133
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,479
in reality, Adil had already made all the

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,199
planning.  Without telling anyone, he had

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,039

136
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,479

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,160
applied for a student visa for

138
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,919
higher studies in Pakistan in the same month i.e. April 2018.  And in a very short time,

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
i.e. in the same month, the Pakistan

140
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,759
authority grants student visa to Adil Thokar.

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,759
And

142
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
on the basis of this visa, Adil, on the pretext of having an exam at home,

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,280

144
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,080

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,919
reaches Pakistan in May 2018 via the Attari-Wagah border with a valid passport and valid student visa.  This

146
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
is his pic from that time.  Now he had

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,520
reached Pakistan but he did

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,520
not want to go to Pakistan for studies.

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
After reaching Pakistan, the first thing he does is switch off his phone.

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280

151
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
He completely cuts off contact with his family and the people around him.

152
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
And the same day

153
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
Lashkar meets the leadership of Taba.  Lashkar-e-

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,600
Taba is the same militant organization that

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360

156
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,240
carried out the Mumbai and Parliament attacks.  Now after reaching Pakistan, there is a

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
LED camp in Sawai Nala, Muzaffarabad

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
which is 30km from LOC.  It falls inside

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
POK.  Its training

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
starts here.  Daura e Sufa, Daura e Aam,

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Daura Ekhas, all these, its training starts.  Out

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,880
of the nine strikes that were carried out in Operation Sindoor, the first

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,639
strike was carried out here.  Now Adil's

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,039
training continues here.  It is prepared to

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,520
attack further.   On the

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,360
other hand, the next month after this came,

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,440
i.e. on 28th June 2018,

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,600
a problem arose for Pakistan.  FATF

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,759
Financial Action Task Four.  This is an

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
international body which monitors terror funding across the world.

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,840
So

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680

174
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
considering the activities of Pakistan, FATF put it in its grey list.

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
Before blacklisting, it is

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,039
put in grey list.  A chance is given to

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
improve.  Now this

178
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,720
was a huge problem for Pakistan because

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
due to this, the loans etc. that Pakistan gets from the IMF, World Bank

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
etc. would be stopped.

181
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
This would also have raised a survival issue for Pakistan.

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,840
So

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,840
after putting it in the grey list, FATF

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
gave guidelines to Pakistan that you should stop funding of

185
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
organisations like Lashkar-e-Taba operating in your country and

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,240
take action against them.  So to

187
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
show the world the FATF guidelines,

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
Pakistan took small actions.

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,440
They started submitting reports

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,000
that they have stopped funding and their

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,919
leaders of LET etc. were also

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479
put in jail.  Now, after few months, on

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,240
14th of February 2019, Pulwama is carried out in India.

194
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,160

195
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Everyone in India was very angry

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
and immediately after the attack, India had

197
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,160
all the proofs like

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,080
how Rs 10.43 lakh was

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
transferred from Pakistan to the account of Umar, the attacker.  By collecting all these proofs,

200
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,319
a dossier was prepared and

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,360

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,440
sent to FATF member countries like US, France, UK.  From 17 to 22 February, a

203
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
meeting of FATF was held in Paris

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
and a final warning was given to Pakistan

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
that if anything like this happens again, it will be blacklisted.

206
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,759
So now after this, the

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,599

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
activities of Lashkar Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed inside Pakistan

209
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,240
slowed down and there was peace in Pakistan as well

210
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,759
and then after 5 months, on the Fifth of August

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,400
2019, India removed Article 370 from Kashmir.

212
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,319
Article 37 Now after this thing happened,

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,199
Pakistan was trapped from all sides.

214
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
Here Article 370 had been removed.

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
Pakistan could not take military action.  Lashkar

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, all these proxies were under the

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,800
radar of FTF.  So,

218
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,960
to deal with this thing, multiple meetings are held in

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Muridka, Pakistan where LeT has its head quarters.

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,479

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
Its solution is found and then

222
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,400
after some time a new plan is made

223
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,400
so that the fight in Kashmir

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,640
can be continued.  Pakistan

225
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,399
creates terrorist outfit under a new name.  The

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,800
Resistance Front TRF.   The

227
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
plan here was to change your name,

228
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,719
change your face and keep all your work the same

229
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
old.  Like normally you must have seen

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
that if a company whose name gets tarnished due to some fraud then

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
it opens a company under a new name and starts doing the same work.

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,880
So the same thing was done here as well.

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,839
So Article 370 is removed in August 2019

235
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,839
and after 2 months i.e. in October 2019,

236
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,399
The Resistance Front TRF is set up

237
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
and this same TRF later carries

238
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,959
out the Pahalgam attack.  This

239
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,760
TRF was created in such a way that it

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,519
gave the illusion of a clean local Kashmiri group.

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,519
These people remained from all over the world in which the

242
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,760
name of Pakistan was not mentioned anywhere.  And the

243
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,160

244
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,640
responsibility of running the entire system and operation within this TRF was in the hands of the same

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
old terrorists who were from Lashkar Taba Jaish Mohammad.

246
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
Only the name was

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,680
changed.  After the formation of TRF, hiring was

248
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
a big issue.  So for this,

249
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
in the initial phase, he started hiring some people from Tehreek Millat

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,279
Islamia, Ghaznavi Hind, Hizbul Mujahideen

251
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,800
and Lashkar-e-Taba.

252
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,200
And among

253
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,360
all the hiring that has been done,

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,600
one hiring is very important.

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,480
You must remember his name because

256
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,480
he is the actual mastermind of the Pahalgam attack.  His

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,480
name is Hashim

258
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,360
Musa.  This Hashim Musa is

259
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
an SSG Para Commando of Pakistan Army.  So the

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,480
Pakistan Army

261
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,480
terminated its service and gave it on loan to Lashkar

262
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Taiba.  Gave it to LET on loan.

263
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
This means that now it will

264
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,959
execute all the operations of LET.

265
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,200
And see, this is

266
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,120
not a conspiracy theory.

267
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,839
This thing has clearly come to light in the initial investigation conducted by the NIA.

268
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
As many OGW statements have come,

269
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
India Today, Times of India, The New

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,360
Indian Express has been covering this thing from day one.

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
And in this, what is being said is that

272
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
NIA belongs to India.  These news agencies are

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,839
also from India.  So see, the crime has

274
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
happened inside India.  Investigation is

275
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
going on inside India.  So there will be no report from Tokyo.

276
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
And all these things that I am telling you

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,959
cannot be hidden.  In all the previous

278
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,760
attacks whether it was Pulwama, 2611,

279
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,519
Kasab who was caught, whatever proofs came,

280
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
whatever was said by NIA in the initial stage,

281
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,800
all those things were later proved and the

282
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,640
international community also accepted those proofs.

283
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,399
And before this,

284
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,640
how was the Pahalgam attack planned?

285
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,880
How did these people enter?  How was the coordination done?   Let me

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,720
tell you about it.  Before that, it is

287
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,040
very important to understand that India is

288
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,640
not the only country which

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
says all these things about Pakistan.

290
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,560
Organizations outside India whose

291
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,279
reports are accepted by people all over the world.  The

292
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,079
United Nations, International Wash Dogs,

293
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,839
Independent Intelligence firms have all said this

294
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,720
in their reports that Pakistan has

295
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,880

296
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
created a proxy battle field in areas like Kashmir by using terror outfits.

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
And the most dangerous part in this is

298
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,959
that the Pakistan Army and ISI do

299
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,839
not consider it terrorism.  Rather it

300
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,839
follows a calculated military doctrine.

301
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
Like in Afghanistan, the US CIA

302
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,680

303
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
ousted the Soviet Union by fighting a proxy war through local Mujahideen.  So they

304
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
believe that they will

305
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
take Kashmir from India just like this without fighting a war.  The report of the European

306
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,760
Foundation for South Asia Studies

307
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,720
says that the Pakistan

308
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Army and its intelligence agency ISI have

309
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,600
an unholy alliance with terror groups.

310
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,519
They have given $25 to $250 million

311
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
to terrorist groups.  Some of their salaries are

312
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440

313
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
given in the form of training, operational costs as required.

314
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
I have placed the link to this entire report in the description.

315
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
Apart from this, the US State

316
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,120
Department said that Pakistan's

317
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,959
ISI is still giving shelter to terrorist groups

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,880
which are focusing on India.

319
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,880
Congressional Research Service CRS.

320
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,639
Its report number

321
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,200
R41832 said on record that

322
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,279
Pakistan's ISI is linked with anti-India militant

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,360
organisations and is

324
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,200
secretly providing

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
financial assistance, training and

326
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,240
strategic guidance to organisations like Lashkar-e-Taba.

327
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
I have also

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,200
included this report in the description.  When you read beyond page number 23 to 24

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
you will know what praises have been

330
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,959
sung for Pakistan.  The

331
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
CRS report which was published in the US Parliament, US Congress

332
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,600
, also said

333
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,760
that there are 15 terrorist groups inside Pakistan.

334
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
Which have been divided into five categories.  The

335
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,959
dedicated task of one of the groups is to

336
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,200
spread terrorism in Kashmir.

337
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,480
These are all their names and you will find the link for this

338
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
in the description as well.  All these

339
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
reports are from outside India and if

340
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,839
you do not believe them then

341
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,440
former President of Pakistan Musharraf

342
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
accepted in an interview to CN that yes, we do

343
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
provide training to fight in Kashmir.

344
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,760
These are our heroes.

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,279
Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, while giving an interview to Dawn,

346
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
accepted that non-state

347
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,839
actors like Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out the

348
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
Mumbai attack using Pakistani soil.

349
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,079
Rest, you must have seen these famous photographs recently.  The

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,200

351
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,480
entire Pakistani leadership is standing with UN designated terrorist Hafiz Abdul Rauf.

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,480

353
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,959
And I am telling this in short.   There are

354
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639

355
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
so many reports from the US Department of Defense Pentagon FADF.  The whole

356
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,720
night will pass and

357
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
in those reports only the connection with Pakistan and its

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
terrorists will be

359
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
told and all these are

360
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
reports from outside India.  So

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
whatever story I am telling you next,

362
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,440
you cannot reject it just by saying that hey,

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,200
this is an Indian YouTuber.  There

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
are reports from India.  India has NIA.  By

365
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,959
saying all these things you cannot remove Pakistan's link with

366
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
terrorism.  Let's

367
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,480
come back to our story.  So see,

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,440
till now Hashim Musa, who was a para commando of Pakistan Army, had

369
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,360
left the army and

370
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
started working with the operatives of LeT.

371
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,680
Adil Thokar, who had reached Pakistan from Kashmir, was

372
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
undergoing training there.

373
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,839
That means the two terrorists who were there on the day of Pahalgam attack were

374
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,959

375
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,880
working inside Pakistan.  And the third thing, TRF had

376
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,959
already been formed.  And

377
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,199
after the formation of TRF, the second thing they had to do was to

378
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,680
appoint a head of TRF and the head had to be someone

379
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,639
on whom they had trust for a long time, who was

380
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,600
skilled and local to Kashmir

381
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,680
so that their narrative of the war could be

382
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
executed in the same manner and

383
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,760
by having a local head, he would have local hiring and good knowledge of that area,

384
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
so it is a huge

385
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,600
advantage.  So for this they

386
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,079
selected Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, a

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,800
resident of Kaima village, Rampura, Kulgam district of Kashmir.

388
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,519
He was a very old and

389
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,680
trusted terrorist of LeT.  It was

390
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,680
involved in spreading terrorism with LeT since 1996.

391
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,000
So for this reason, Mohammad Abbas Shaikh was

392
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
made the head of TRF.  He is

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
also called the founder of TRF.  But

394
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,920
actually the founders of TRF were

395
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
sitting in Pakistan.

396
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,880
Along with TRF head Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, there lived another LET

397
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,040
trustee man named Sheikh

398
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
Sajjad Gul.  The planning of the Pahalgam attack

399
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,959
, the location that was set, the

400
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
shift from the hotel to Pahalgam, all the planning was done by

401
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
him.  He will come forward soon.  He

402
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
lived in Nawa Bazaar of Srinagar in Kashmir.

403
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,240
He had completed his MBA and had been

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
caught with IT extortion once before in Delhi.

405
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,160
Was involved in many attacks.  His brother was also

406
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,800
earlier a doctor in Maharaja Har Singh Hospital.

407
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Currently he handles funding in Gulf countries.

408
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,000
So after doing all these things,

409
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,800
now from here Mohammad Abbas Sheikh and Sheikh

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
Sajjad Gul handle the entire network of TRF in Kashmir.

411
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,639
And then after this, the

412
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560

413
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,720
responsibility of TRF's OGW network in Kashmir was

414
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,639
given to Farooq Ahmed.  Farooq Ahmed was a very

415
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,360
important man.  Till 2016, it was

416
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,360

417
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
in Narikot village, Kalaroos block, Kupwara district of Kashmir.  But

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,519
since 2016, he was handling the OGW network of Kashmir while staying in Muzaffarabad, PoK.

419
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,920

420
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,680
And the terrorists who were sent inside Kashmir by crossing the LoC were

421
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,600

422
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
also done by this Farooqui.  In fact, at

423
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,440
the time of Pahalgam attack, it was he who had made all the

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,360
terrorists who had come from Pakistan

425
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
cross the LOC.  And all the

426
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,160
OGWs who were involved in the Pahalgam attack and were

427
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,160
doing recce before planning it,

428
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,680
all of them were in contact with him.  See

429
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
OGW, I have told this in the old video.  Let me

430
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,560
tell you once again.

431
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,480
OGW Over Ground Worker.

432
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,720
People in Kashmir who hate India

433
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,120
but don't want to risk their lives by taking up arms

434
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,360
become OGWs.

435
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,440
They run their household comfortably like ordinary people.

436
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,759
Some drive auto, some

437
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,600
manage shops.  But

438
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,839
they help those who are terrorists.  They do all the work like providing them food,

439
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
shelter, army information,

440
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,759
sharing details of the area etc.

441
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
OGWs play a very important role in Kashmir.

442
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
Without OGW, this

443
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,759
terrorist organization became LET

444
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
, became Jaish-e-Mohammed.  It becomes very difficult for them to do all their work

445
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,920

446
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,800
inside Kashmir.  Now after this, when all these things are setup,

447
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,800
Farooq Ahmed

448
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,639

449
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
starts infiltrating terrorists from Pakistan

450
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,519
into Kashmir by making them cross the LOC.  in order to attack.

451
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,920
All the terrorists who were entering from the LoC were entering from the areas of Samba,

452
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,360
Katua, Rajouri and Punj.

453
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,360
And these had a set

454
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,079
pattern.

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
After entering the Kashmir border, OGWs used to receive them.   They used to

456
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
help them and

457
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
after reaching the border, instead of taking the direct Jammu route and

458
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,640
reaching Anantnag, they used to reach the

459
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Kistwar area which you can see from here through the

460
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
route because there are

461
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,319
very dense forests and natural

462
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,640
caves here.  The average elevation is more

463
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,319
than 2000 metres above sea level.  So it is

464
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,559
very easy to escape.  It is very difficult to catch them here.

465
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,799
22 April 2025, the

466
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,480
day this attack took place.  Till date,

467
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,400
our forces are

468
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,559
searching and killing them in the Sunday area.  The fighting is still

469
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,959
going on in this area.  So see, by the year

470
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,880
2022, they had established their entire network

471
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
inside Kashmir.

472
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,960
TRF rebranded its model of terrorism.

473
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
Create online portals.

474
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,559

475
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
He used Telegram social media a lot.  A

476
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
Telegram channel was also created by the name of Tj RF in which

477
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,440

478
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,360
Kashmiris were made to join by sharing propaganda videos etc.  And then in

479
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
the meantime they started attacking inside Kashmir.

480
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
They

481
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
started targeting those who were non-local.  He killed him in

482
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
Har Singh High Street Market

483
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,080
area, 100 meters from Lal Chowk.  This

484
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,720
was the first attack of TRF inside Kashmir.  After this

485
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,520
he killed Ajay Pandita ji and

486
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,760
killed Akash Mehra.  Laborers who had come from every corner of India were

487
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,679
attacked.  Basically,

488
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
you can understand his model in this way that he was

489
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,559
working like a contract killer.

490
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,640
They were going and killing all the non-locals.

491
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,400
But the real shock they

492
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,799
faced came on 23 August.  Because on this

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,120
day, in Alochi Bagh of Srinagar, the

494
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,039
head of TRF, Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, who is also

495
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
called the founder of TRF.  He was

496
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,320
playing a cricket match with local people.  The

497
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
Jammu & Kashmir Police got to know about it

498
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
and they reached there and killed him.  The

499
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,640
day he was killed, in the same week, the

500
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
second hand command of TRF, as I had

501
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,520
also told you, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, was

502
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,440
made the head.  Here the head of TRF is killed.  On the

503
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
other hand, the situation in Kashmir was also

504
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
changing very rapidly.  For example, in 2018,

505
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,600
1,458 cases of stone platting were reported.

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,720
Whereas in 2020, it had come down to 255 and then

507
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,480
further reduced.  Further, in 2023 and 2024, the

508
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,840
official data of stone

509
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,840
pelting became zero.  Cases of 228 terrorists were registered in 2018.  On

510
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,760
the other hand, if we

511
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,880
talk about 2023, then TRF was able to carry out only 44 attacks.

512
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Where 8.5 lakh tourists came in 2018.

513
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,919
This number increased to 31 lakh in 2023

514
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,280
and the next year 43 lakh tourists came.

515
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,320
Whereas in 2019, an investment of Rs 296.64 crore was made.

516
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,080

517
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,919
In 2022, an investment of Rs 153 crore was made in Kashmir.

518
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,160
A lot of money was being injected.

519
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
And the domicile laws had also come into force.

520
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,120
Due to which people from outside Kashmir

521
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,440
could also get domicile certificate made.  And the

522
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
main target of TRF was that

523
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
this growing trade and the

524
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
money that is coming to Kashmiris due to increase in tourists should be

525
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,600
stopped by attacking.  Due to this,

526
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,919
they attacked some non-locals and people who were issued

527
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,080
domicile

528
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,640
but the number of tourists was not decreasing.   The

529
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,640
hotels were full.  There were pony riders, auto

530
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
drivers, everyone was busy.

531
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
You must also listen to the interviews of local Kashmiris on YouTube

532
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
in which they openly say

533
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
that there was so much work that they did not have even a day's

534
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,760
rest.  A lot of money was coming in and a lot of

535
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
tourists were also coming.  So

536
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,480
things were changing so fast in Kashmir, to

537
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,720
deal with this, now the real game starts from here.

538
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,000

539
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,360

540
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
I told you about Hashim Musa in September 2023 that it was

541
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,960
revealed in the initial investigation that he

542
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,240

543
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,760
was an SSG Para Commando of the Pakistan Army.  So along with Musa and Ali Bhai,

544
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,520
not much details have come about Ali Bhai.

545
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,840
It is not known whether he was

546
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,760
in the Para Commando or not.  But these

547
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,799
Ali Bhai and Musa, both were

548
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,480
Pakistani citizens.  So

549
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,559
in September 2023, they were infiltrated into Kashmir through both Kathua and Sama sector routes.

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,440

551
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,200
After reaching Kashmir, with the help of OGW, these

552
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,200
Khari Mahaurs live in a safe house in Basantgarh.

553
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
This Moses had been

554
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
given very good combat training.  It

555
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,280

556
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,360
could survive in the snow in the forest for many days.  So the plan was that in

557
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,440
future any attacks would happen in Kashmir, Musa would

558
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,320
lead them along with Ali Bhai and

559
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,320
Farooq's 15 to 20 OGWs would help him.

560
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,960
So what it means is that the two main terrorists of the

561
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,480
Pahalgam attack that was to happen later had

562
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,559

563
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,640
reached Kashmir in September 2023.  After reaching Kashmir,

564
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,600
they execute their small operations.

565
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,520
And then in October 2024,

566
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,080
in the Pahalgam attack, he was the third terrorist who

567
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,240
fired guns.  Adil Thokar, about whom I told you in the beginning, had

568
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,960

569
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,360
gone to Pakistan on a student visa.  After completing his training, he also

570
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679

571
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,240
enters Kashmir through this sector which was the Punj Rajouri area.   There was another

572
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,000
terrorist who did a favor and

573
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,760
came to Kashmir at the same time.  But there is no

574
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
confirmed report whether this is the same

575
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Ehsan who was there on the day of the Pahalgam attack.

576
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,760
Now after reaching Kashmir, these people

577
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,240
attack non-locals for some time.

578
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,679
Especially those laborers who were

579
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,559
involved in infrastructure and development projects.

580
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,559
Like

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,440
they killed six labourers and a doctor at the G More Tunnel project in Gagangir.

582
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,360
Then attacks were carried out in Dera's street DK J.  So in

583
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,520
this way, every now and then these people were

584
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,480
sitting there and attacking inside Kashmir.

585
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,200
Now it was 2 months after this, i.e. in December 2024,

586
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,600
i.e. 3-4

587
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,080
months before the Pahalgam attack.  At this time, there was

588
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,880
a terrorist with him in Dachigam, Srinagar,

589
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Junaid Ahmed Bhatt.  The forces surround him and

590
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,720
kill him in an operation.  And after his death, when

591
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,559
his body is checked,

592
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,240
a mobile phone is found near him.  Through which, the

593
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,840
instructions etc. that were coming from his Pakistan connections,

594
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,400
encrypted messages

595
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,400
etc., all of them are caught and

596
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,000
an image is found from his mobile.

597
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
You might have seen this image recently also.

598
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,200
This image went viral after the Pahalgam attack.

599
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,039
This image was

600
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
found from Junaid's mobile in December 2024.  But at that

601
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,760
time the Farses could not recognize that

602
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,360
Moses was also in it.  But when the Pahalgam attack

603
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
happened and later when the tourists

604
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,919
gave descriptions etc. and after the attack more

605
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,799
sketches were made, then this photo came out and through the

606
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,720
information of the OGWs who were caught,

607
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,200
it was found out that the person on the

608
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,799
right of this photo is Musa and the person

609
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,559
you are seeing next to him is Junaid

610
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,240
who was killed.  Now see, after this, when

611
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,720
all these people reached Kashmir,

612
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,120

613
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
reports also came about the arrangement of weapons.

614
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,799
American M4 rifles were used in the Pahalgam attack and these

615
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,360
M4 rifles were more advanced than AK-47.  These

616
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,360
include night vision devices, cameras, etc.

617
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,520
When

618
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,000
cartridges were recovered from the crime scene after the Pahalgam attack,

619
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840
ballistic analysis of those cartridges was done.

620
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,120
It came to light that

621
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,240
guns like M4 carbines and AK-47 were used.

622
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,840
And

623
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,640
things have also come out about these American M4 rifles that when the

624
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
USA left Afghanistan, it had left behind weapons worth about $7

625
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,640
billion

626
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,280
in Afghanistan.  And these weapons,

627
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
including American F4 rifles,

628
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
all these weapons reached the black market from there.

629
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,400
And according to intelligence reports, the

630
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,120
chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed, Mufti Abdul

631
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,120
Rauf Asghar, was

632
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,159
given the task of arms, procurement and logistics.  He

633
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,159
smuggled these M4 rifles through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

634
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,159
region to Jaish-Mohammed's

635
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,640
headquarters, Markaz Camp, and

636
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
then from there, using drones, these

637
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
weapons were dumped in Kashmir. This

638
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,960
process of bringing weapons to Kashmir had been

639
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,880
going on for many years.  Now

640
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
see, after this a very unusual

641
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,919
activity took place and because of the style in which Pahalgam was

642
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,720
attacked, the curiosity of this incident

643
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,679
increased further.  What actually happened was that

644
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,480
some time ago in August 2024,

645
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,440
UN designated terrorist and

646
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,000
head of Lashkar-e-Taba Saifullah Kasuri

647
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,400
met Hamas leader Khalid Mashal in Doha, Qatar and at that time,

648
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
Pakistan's Pakistan Central Muslim

649
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,720
League (PMML) had also uploaded videos of this meeting.  At

650
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
that time no

651
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,080
one paid much attention to this thing.

652
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,640
But the real alarm bell rings on the

653
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,440
Fifth of February 2025.  What happens on this day is

654
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,760
that

655
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,159
Hamas leaders come to Shaheed Sabir Stadium in Rawalkot, Pakistan.  This was the

656
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,559
first time in history that Hamas

657
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,320
leadership entered PoK and

658
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960

659
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,840
held a conference after reaching there.  The official name of this conference was

660
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Kashmir Solidarity and Hamas Operation Al

661
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,080
Aqsa Flood

662
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,240
Conference.  And he held many

663
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,720
rallies here.  A lot of venom was spewed against India

664
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,640
and from here it started to seem that now

665
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,200
these people are going to do something in Kashmir and the

666
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
Pahalgam attack also

667
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,600
happened in Hamas style and after this meeting,

668
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,919
reports started coming that

669
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,000
after coming here, Hamas discussed the tactics of carrying out attacks inside Kashmir,

670
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,159

671
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
methods of encrypted communication and civilian targeting etc.

672
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,080
Now see, on the Fifth of

673
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,120
February, the Hamas leadership reached PoK and

674
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,520
a week later, another unusual thing happens there.  There is

675
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,600
a famous satellite company in the US called

676
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
Max Technologies.  So what

677
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,400
happens is that suddenly the

678
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,200

679
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,360
demand for high resolution images of the Pahalgam area of â€‹â€‹Kashmir with this company

680
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,600
doubles.  Now Pahalgam is a tourist area.  There is no

681
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,440
battle field for the

682
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,520
demand to increase in this manner.  This was not normal.

683
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,760
Please pause this image and look at it once.  The highest number of orders for high resolution images were received

684
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,600
on February 12, 15, 18, 21 and 22 this year 2025.

685
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,440

686
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,679
These are those images.  Look, this

687
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,360
US satellite company Max

688
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,080
Technology provides high resolution satellite

689
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,080
images whose size is 30 cm.  to 15

690
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,320
cm.  Happens till.  They sell them to

691
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,159
approved government and defense agencies around the world.

692
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,559
Like in India, ISRO and

693
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,720
Ministry of Defense are its customers.  These

694
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
high resolution satellite images are

695
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
not normal.  With this, even the

696
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
smallest things on the ground can be seen.  Through these high

697
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
resolution images,

698
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,360
planning of attack, target verification etc.

699
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
all these things happen.  This image acts as a tactical

700
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,840
weapon in the battlefield.  For

701
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,600
this reason, they share their images only

702
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,919
with approved government agencies.  If

703
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,679

704
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,200
any private or random entity comes, we do not give him high resolution images.  They

705
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
give low grade images.

706
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,279
She is of no use.  Now the question

707
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,440
arises that

708
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,600
why is the demand for images of areas like Pahalgam so huge?  And

709
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
access to these images is not that easy.

710
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,360
So when investigation was done about this,

711
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,640
a new game came to light.  What happened was that

712
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,960
in June 2024, a Pakistani company

713
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,720
Business System Intelligence Private Limited

714
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,039
PSI entered into a partnership with the US satellite company

715
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,840
Max Technologies by agreeing to all its

716
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,080
terms and conditions.  Now, because of the

717
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,120
partnership, the Pakistani company

718
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,919
BSI got the advantage that it also got the rights to sell those high

719
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,559
resolution images which cannot be accessed easily.  This

720
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,120

721
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,799
means that this company

722
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,400
also got access which till now was

723
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240

724
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,799
exclusive to approved government agencies.  If this Pakistani company

725
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,720
BSI wants, it can give its Pakistani clients to

726
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,480
them also.  And who knows,

727
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,720
that Pakistani client might even be a terrorist

728
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,799
organisation.  And the chances of this happening are

729
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,039
very high.  I am saying this

730
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,320
because the founder of this company,

731
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,320
Obaidullah Syed, also turned out to be a fraud.  What it was doing was that it was

732
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,320

733
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,159

734
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,159

735
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,559

736
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,720

737
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:40,640

738
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,640
illegally exporting high performance computing equipment and advanced software used for sensitive tasks like nuclear research and missile development to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), without privy to the US.   The

739
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,559
US caught him red-handed and then the

740
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,080
US District Court for the Northern

741
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:51,120
District of Illinois

742
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,120
convicted him under 18 USC 371.  Now see,

743
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,080
in the first week of February 2025, Hamas holds a meeting

744
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,480
in PoK.  In the same month, the

745
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,440
demand for the image of the Pahalgam area doubles

746
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,080
and then 10 to 15 days later,

747
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
in March 2025, an announcement is made.   The

748
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,720
announcement was that PM Narendra Modi will

749
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,279

750
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,279
visit Kashmir next month i.e. on 19th of April 2025.  To inaugurate Vande Bharat.

751
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,679
Now, when this announcement was made, at that

752
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,240
time Musa, Ali Bhai,

753
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,960
Adil Thokar and others who had come from Pakistan and were in their group, were

754
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,760
inside Kashmir.  In the month in which this

755
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,080
announcement was made, i.e. March 2025, during this

756
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,279
entire month neither any orders for satellite images

757
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,039
came nor did Musa Ali Bhai do

758
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,600
any activity

759
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,360
inside Kashmir.  It is believed that

760
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,159
this planning would have been done in this month itself.

761
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,159
In the forests of Kishtwar, the head of TRF, Sheikh Sajjad Gul,

762
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,640
Musa Ali Bhai and Adil Thokar

763
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,399
might have done the planning in the month of March itself.

764
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,399
But the most

765
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,039
surprising thing in this was that all these people who were

766
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,799
communicating, whether among themselves or

767
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,480
inside Pakistan, no

768
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,240
one came to know about this communication

769
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
and why it was not known,

770
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
that is also discussed.  See,

771
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,880
earlier this Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar Taiba and

772
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,399
all the terrorists who were there, during the 26/11

773
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
Mumbai attack, you must have

774
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,159
heard the conversation at that time, you have even read it on YouTube,

775
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,760
these

776
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,840
people were communicating with each other through Thuraya satellite phone, all of that was

777
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
caught, but this time they were given the

778
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,679
Ultra sets that are used by Pakistan Military and

779
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
sent to Kashmir,

780
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
Huai is a Chinese company which is

781
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,320
band in India, it had launched some special

782
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,000
smartphones, med 60 pro60

783
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,399
series and 11 Ultra, what they did in this was that

784
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,559
they put internal satellite antenna and specialized

785
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,559
chip in these phones.  The purpose of this was

786
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,200
that if the user has an emergency and there is

787
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,440
no internet, he can connect these phones to China's

788
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,279
Tiantong One satellite

789
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,679
network which is managed by China Telecom.  By

790
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,760
connecting to it, voice text

791
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,320
and video chat can be done without

792
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,399
internet.  Basically a normal phone gets

793
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,480
converted into a satellite phone.  And

794
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,960
these Ultra sets were brought into use

795
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
after upgrading them.  These ultrasets were being used in the entire planning of Pahalgam and

796
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,200
even on the day of the attack.

797
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,600
They were

798
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,760
not being caught because when

799
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
terrorists like Musa and Ali Bhai were sitting in Kashmir and

800
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,440
communicating with each other, what actually was happening was

801
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,760
that the military grade

802
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,159
encrypted radio signals used the Chinese satellite to bypass the Indian

803
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,559
cellular and satellite surveillance system

804
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,640

805
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,640
and then through it the

806
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,640
signals went to the server in Pakistan.

807
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Due to which their communication could not be traced.

808
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,320
And hence it is believed that the

809
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
entire month of March and the entire

810
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,399
planning that was done could not be captured.

811
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
Their communications could not be captured.

812
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,799

813
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,799
Coordination was done sitting in Karachi, Pakistan and Muzaffarabad, POK

814
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,520
using these Ultra sets.  Where

815
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,760
every step was explained as to when, where and

816
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,000
how to complete the task.  These

817
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,640
ultra sets were recovered only once

818
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,960
in 2023 in an encounter in Surankot, from

819
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,039
a terrorist.  An

820
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,799
attempt was made to crack it.  In fact this

821
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,399
ultraset was also sent to western countries.

822
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,640
But it could not be cracked.

823
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,240
This was a big reason why their

824
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
communication could not be traced.

825
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,080
So Ultrasats were

826
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,480
used for communication and to find routes in the forests of Kashmir.

827
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Earlier,

828
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,720
a lot of help was taken from the OGWs.

829
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,039
But this time less help was taken from oGW.  That was

830
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,799
done because they

831
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,039
also used new methods for navigation.  He

832
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,840
used an app called Alpine

833
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,159
Quest.

834
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,760
Which is used by trackers for offline navigation.

835
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
When there is no internet, we

836
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,520

837
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,760
use this to navigate in the mountains like Google Maps.  So

838
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,919
in this offline version of Alpine Quest

839
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,559
they used high resolution satellite images.

840
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,600
Because of which this Musa Ali

841
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,840
Bhai works without internet service and without the

842
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,159
help of OGW like Google Map.  In that

843
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,159
way, we were roaming in the forests of Kistwar using this Alpine Quest app.

844
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,240

845
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,559
Now after this, planning starts in the first week of April as to

846
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,600
how to

847
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,919

848
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
impact the trade of the tourists coming to Kashmir

849
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,000
so that the entire system which is changing

850
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,760
very fast in Kashmir can be disrupted.

851
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,919
So, in the first week of April,

852
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,559
they decided that the

853
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,200
luxury hotels near the Zabran Valley of Kashmir,

854
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,679
especially those which house foreign tourists, would be

855
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,679
attacked.  Basically they

856
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,159
wanted to impact the trade of Kashmir.  In a way,

857
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,279
this was a trade war against Kashmiris.

858
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,960
One more thing has been said in this that perhaps this

859
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,880
could also be the reason because PM Narendra

860
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,600
Modi was also to come to Kashmir at that time for

861
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,360
inauguration.  So at the same time, the

862
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,760

863
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,679

864
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,000

865
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,960
chances of high value targets like PM's delegates etc. coming to luxury hotels to be there will also increase.  Because of that, the

866
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,279
coverage of the attack will spread even more.

867
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,519
For this reason, these people had fixed a plan to attack the tourists who would be inside the hotel at this time.

868
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,039

869
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,039

870
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,320
Now after the target is fixed, let us

871
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,960
start this Reiki on the Fourth of April 2025.

872
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,279
Adil goes to OGW with Thokar to do Reiki.  The

873
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,519
Pakistani brothers Musa and Ali did

874
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,519
not go for Reiki.  When the Reiki was done, the

875
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,519
OGW would go and share the footage etc. with them

876
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,360
and then a plan would be made and

877
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,279
Reiki would be done on a daily basis.  Now when this

878
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,320
Reiki was happening, in the meantime, on the ninth of

879
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:03,519
April, there was a local resident named Rashpal.

880
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,600
Two to three terrorists enter his house with M4 rifles.

881
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,440
Now who were these terrorists?

882
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,519
This could not be confirmed.  But one thing was

883
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,600
confirmed that this was neither Musa nor Ali Bhai.

884
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,559
Now after entering Rajpal's house,

885
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,880
they ask for food, travel bag and umbrella.

886
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,640
Then he

887
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,399
asked for the phone from Rajpal.  Make a WhatsApp call from his phone.  They

888
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,799
go somewhere and talk in Urdu

889
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,960
and then break the SIM card and return Rashpal's

890
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,799
phone.  And

891
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
after that, when these people were going, they

892
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,600

893
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,279
asked Rashpal about the directions of all the areas around the region and

894
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,039
after asking everything, they left.  And the

895
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,360
next morning, i.e. on 10th of April,

896
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
Rashpal would go to the police and

897
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,679
tell them everything.  And along with this, at this time,

898
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,840
other small intelligence was also

899
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,440
coming to the agencies that terrorists were going to attack the hotel.

900
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,360
So, due to all these things, the

901
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,039
Jammu & Kashmir Police and the

902
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,600
paramilitary force together started a joint operation in Dachigam

903
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,159
Nishant and the nearby luxury hotels and

904
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,559

905
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
increased security.  The forces had started surveillance at all the

906
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,480
exit and entry points of the hotel.

907
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,960
Guest

908
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,440
verification had started.  The quick reaction

909
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,440
team was kept on standby.

910
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
Now at this time one more thing comes out

911
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,359
that the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to

912
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,760
Kashmir

913
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,919
for inauguration is cancelled

914
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,679
and the reason given is that the weather in Kashmir is

915
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,200
bad.  Because of this, this visit will be

916
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,359
cancelled and will be done through video conferencing.

917
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,639
Now, after some time,

918
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,879
this hotel was the place where Musa Ali Bhai and

919
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,200
all of them had fixed their target that they would

920
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,280
attack the tourists of the hotel.  These people

921
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,359
cancel these plans.  Now, there is no clarity about whether this plan was

922
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,119
cancelled due to security reasons or

923
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,040

924
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,359
because of the cancellation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit.

925
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,839
But the target of the hotel which was

926
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,839
fixed first is

927
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,079
cancelled.  Now for this these

928
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,240
people started Reiki again and

929
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,839
after doing Reiki, four locations were finalized in which the

930
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,680
first was Aru Valley.  The second was Betaab

931
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,359
Valley.  Thirdly, he selected the local amusement

932
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,160
parks

933
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,800
and the fourth was Baisaran Valley.  All the locations were such that

934
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,119
tourists could be attracted there so that the

935
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,040
growing economy

936
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,880
could be impacted by the tourists coming here.  Now in the

937
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,440
next step, out of the four locations that were selected,

938
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,359

939
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,200
they removed and

940
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,440
cancelled the location of the amusement park and the reason behind this was

941
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,280
that the Pahalgam Police

942
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,720
Station was just 500 meters away from this location.   That

943
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,640
means the police could have reached within a minute or two

944
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,880
and

945
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,720
they also dropped the Aru Valley location from their plan.  The

946
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,720
reason was that there was a

947
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,880
network problem here.  Secondly, the

948
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,680
connection with the road was very strong.  So it was

949
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
very easy for the forces to come and for the people to run away.

950
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,000
And there was the same issue in Betaab Valley also.

951
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,480
Security forces were nearby and the

952
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,240
terrorists had

953
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,079
very limited options for escape after the attack.

954
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,680
And then after calculating all these things

955
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
he finally selected

956
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Baisaran Valley of Pahalgam.  The reason was that there was

957
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,440

958
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,200
no security presence here.  Secondly, the tourist footfall

959
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,520
here was comparatively higher than others.  The

960
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
car could not reach.  One

961
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,119
could reach there only by trekking or by horse.  It

962
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,280

963
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,079
took 30 to 40 minutes for the security forces to arrive.  The nearest base of CRPF's

964
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,040
Delta Company 116 Battalion was

965
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,760
4 to 5 km away.  It was on.  This map has

966
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,680
dense forests all around it, so it

967
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,760
was very easy to attack and escape into the forests and there were

968
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,000
no CCTV cameras.  So from here

969
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
they

970
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
fixed the location as Byasaran Valley of Pahalgam

971
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,599
and started preparations for it.  And

972
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,920
when this happens, the next day

973
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,599
news comes that the US Vice President is

974
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,839
coming to India and because of this news,

975
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,160
it was decided that the attack will be carried out when the US Vice

976
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,079
President is in India

977
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,560
so that the

978
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,640
news gets made all over the world.  Therefore the date of 22nd April was fixed.

979
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,119
Now as soon as the date was fixed, the

980
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,680
remaining terrorists were already

981
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,160
around the Baisaran area.  But on 21 April,

982
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,720
Musa and Ali Bhai, who were hiding in the jungle for so many days,

983
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,520
get the green signal

984
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,760
and both of them leave the forest of Kokernag on the same date, i.e. on the night of 21st April. The

985
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,079

986
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,800
route they take towards Baisaran Valley is

987
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,880
Kishtwar Daksham Larnu Chatpal Aishmukam.

988
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,040

989
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,520
For going towards 22 Run, in some reports you will

990
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,040
also find the Avantipura Taral Siriguwar Pahalgaon route mentioned

991
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,640
but in most reports

992
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,320
only the Kishtwar route is mentioned, so I

993
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,720
took that one. Now these people walk from here

994
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
and after walking continuously for 21 to 22 hours,

995
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,800
they had trained in such a way that

996
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,680
they walk continuously and after walking continuously for 21 to 22 hours, they

997
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,480

998
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,040
come and sit in the forests around Baisaran and wait to

999
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,119
attack.  Adil Thokar

1000
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,720
was there in the area near Shri Gubara, so he was

1001
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,359
already there.  So what I mean to say is

1002
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,760
that now all the terrorists had

1003
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,079
come and sat in the forests around Baisaran Valley

1004
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,800
and were waiting in ambush. Now see,

1005
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,839
Pahalgam is here and it is

1006
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,000
5 to 6 km from here.  If

1007
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,920
you trek up through the rough unpaved road, it takes around 1 hour

1008
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,760
and after trekking you

1009
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,880
reach this gate and as soon as

1010
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,599
you enter through this gate, you can see a

1011
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,599
green field of 800 meters long and 600 meters wide.

1012
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,359
This plain is Baisaran Valley.  And the

1013
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,960
terrorists were hiding and waiting in the surrounding forests.

1014
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,640
So there is one entry-

1015
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,640
exit gate from here and another entry-

1016
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,880
exit gate of this ground from here.  This entire

1017
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,400
area was given by the Pahalgam Development Authority

1018
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,079
to a man from Bridge Bahra through

1019
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,079
tender for 3 years for Rs. 3 crores.  So

1020
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,000
he introduced the ticketing system inside this area.

1021
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,000
Started zip lining

1022
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,680
and also secured the area by putting fencing around it.

1023
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,720
So it means that there are

1024
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,119
two entry and exit gates in this entire area.  There

1025
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,839
is fencing all around.

1026
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,599
And security is

1027
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,240
provided here during the Amarnath Yatra.  The rest of the time,

1028
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,320
security is provided only when the tour operators or

1029
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,079
hoteliers inform the authorities

1030
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,560
that there are more tourists.

1031
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,839
Now after this the

1032
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,079
day of 2nd of April 2025 starts.  The

1033
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,560
entry to Baisaran Valley opens at 9:00 AM and

1034
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,720
tourists from Pahalgam start reaching

1035
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,720
Baisaran Valley from their respective locations

1036
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,720
and from the

1037
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,960
main gate of Baisaran Valley, they buy tickets and

1038
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,000
start entering Baisaran Valley

1039
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,920
and gradually 1000 tickets were sold.

1040
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,839
Meaning that there had been a footfall of 1000 people

1041
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,640
in this area.  And now after this, it was

1042
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,520
1:30 in the afternoon and till then there were about

1043
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,520
400 tourists left inside this location.

1044
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,440
All the rest had gone back.

1045
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,920
No one had any idea

1046
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,440
what was going to happen next.  Now, after 15 minutes,

1047
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,320
i.e. at 1:45, the first terrorist, most

1048
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,400
probably Adil Thokar, enters.

1049
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,440
Look, whatever I will tell you here,

1050
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,680
in this entire scene it will be difficult to say whether

1051
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,520
Musa went from this side or Adil went from this side.

1052
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,440
Because it could not be confirmed

1053
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,760
from where Adil entered and from where Musa

1054
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,920
entered.  Only this much has been confirmed that Musa,

1055
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,079
Ali Bhai and Adil were there who

1056
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,640
fired the guns.  And some terrorists were there as a

1057
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,160
backup in the forest.  There were some

1058
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
who did not have guns in their hands but were

1059
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,960
mixed in the crowd.  Therefore, it was difficult to

1060
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
say how many terrorists were actually there at that time,

1061
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,160
but it was confirmed that Ali Bhai, Musa and Adil

1062
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Thokar were there who

1063
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,119
picked up guns and killed people.  So this is how

1064
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,520
a terrorist wearing a Kashmiri pheran

1065
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,520
enters the ground from this side.  She had hidden it

1066
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,920
etc. inside the Kashmiri pheran

1067
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,400
she was wearing.  So he comfortably

1068
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,800
enters among the public and

1069
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
starts moving towards this entry-exit gate.

1070
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,119
As soon as he reaches the entry-exit gate,

1071
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,200
he takes out his gun and starts firing in the air.  It does

1072
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,800

1073
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,119
not use it on any person.  He continuously fires in the air

1074
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,680
and

1075
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,680
tries to lead the crowd towards the main entry-exit gate.

1076
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,760
Now as the crowd

1077
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,480
starts gathering towards the main entry exit gate.

1078
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,359
So from the same side, from the forest side, which was over the fence,

1079
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,079
two terrorists jumped from there and

1080
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,000

1081
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,000
stood there wearing military track suits etc. and most likely, they were

1082
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,599
Musa and Ali brothers.  The public was thinking

1083
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,760
that they were security personnel.  So see,

1084
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,760
some terrorists came and fired randomly and

1085
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,839
killed people.  It was not like that.  This was a

1086
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,320
well planned trap in which both the

1087
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,640
entry and exit points were properly blocked

1088
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,320
and all the tourists were

1089
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,560
surrounded from all sides.  And the area was very

1090
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,720
large, so when all these things were happening,

1091
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,640
some people who were on the other side could not know

1092
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,319
what was going on on the other side.  He was

1093
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,319
comfortably doing his zip lining etc.

1094
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,400
Now when the crowd reaches the main entry-exit point,

1095
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,480
those two terrorists, who

1096
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
people thought were security personnel,

1097
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,880
also start firing.

1098
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,280
Then they gather all the crowd here

1099
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,440
at this point where there are Bhelpuri, tea and food stalls.

1100
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,599

1101
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,760
Separates men and women.  All these things were done

1102
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,079

1103
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,920
within 50 meters from the main entry-exit gate.  Now

1104
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
after separating men and women, they

1105
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,440
ask the men whether they are Hindu or

1106
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,680
not.  And then those who do not tell, they make them recite Kalma.

1107
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,680

1108
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,440
As soon as the terrorists came to Devashish Bhattacharya, he recited Kalma and the

1109
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,359
terrorists left him and went to the other side.

1110
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,079
A Christian was

1111
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,640
standing nearby and he was

1112
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,800
asked to speak on the issue of Palestine.  Some were forced to remove their pants

1113
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,880
and then the Hindu tourists were

1114
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,960
shot at close range.  Now, at this time,

1115
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,520
Adil Hussain, who was a pony rider, had

1116
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,359
brought the tourists for a tour.  A

1117
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,119
terrorist shoots one of Adil's tourists, and

1118
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,160
Adil begins arguing with him.  He

1119
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,240
tries to snatch his gun.  So the terrorists

1120
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,960
shoot three bullets at Adil Hussain and kill him too.

1121
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,839
He had an M4 rifle.  It was an AK-47.

1122
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,079
GP cameras were installed on their bodies and feet.  So they were

1123
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,720
recording all these things and

1124
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,560

1125
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,000
taking selfies with the people who had died and keeping them in their phones.  There are

1126
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,440
many more things which I will not be

1127
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,359
able to tell and you will not be able to hear either.  So

1128
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,760
these people did all these things for 20 to 25 minutes.

1129
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,200
In all these things, 26 people

1130
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
lost their lives.  This is his name.

1131
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,720
And then

1132
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,599
after all this was done, he forcibly snatched two phones from the crowd.

1133
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,079
And

1134
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,160
taking those phones, he jumped over the fence on the left side wall and ran away

1135
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,480
into the forest.  Now

1136
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,240
he has run away.  But there were people shouting all around on the side.  He was

1137
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000

1138
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,480
asking for help for his family.  But there was

1139
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,480
no help anywhere.  Then somehow at

1140
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,560
2:30 pm, for the first time,

1141
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,640
information reaches the police that terrorists have done all this in Baisaran Valley.  The

1142
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,640

1143
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,480
SAO of Pahalgam police station gets shocked

1144
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,400
and it takes him time to reach Baisaran valley, so to

1145
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,160
send help quickly, he

1146
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,400

1147
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,000
informs Abdul Wahid, the general president of all the unions of Kashmir,

1148
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
that all this has happened and

1149
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
help should be sent as quickly as possible.

1150
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,319
As soon as Abdul Wahid comes to know about it, he informs the president of Pony Owners

1151
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,920
Association, Rais Ahmed Bhatt.

1152
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,680
His phone network was also not working, so

1153
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,040
he

1154
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,720
starts running alone towards Baisaran valley and whoever he meets on the way, he takes

1155
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,400
them with him

1156
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,160
and takes a shortcut through the jungle and

1157
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,839
reaches before Farsas.  That

1158
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,920
means that in such a huge crowd only five to

1159
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,079
six people were able to reach out for help.  These people were

1160
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,240
not even professionals, so they were doing the

1161
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,400
rescue in whatever way possible, by sitting the victims on their backs etc.

1162
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,960
Then somehow

1163
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,920
SAO Riyaz reaches there and then

1164
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,720

1165
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,200
Rajesh Kumar, Commandant of the 116 battalion of CRPF, along

1166
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,960
with his team of 25 people, reaches the site running on foot

1167
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,480
and then the rescue operation

1168
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,160
begins.  Helicopters etc. come.

1169
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,640
Now as soon as this attack takes place,

1170
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,560
shortly thereafter TRF

1171
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,880
takes the responsibility of the attack and gives the reason that it has been done

1172
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,640
because of the domicile issue that is being issued.

1173
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Now after this the entire

1174
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,560
area is sanitized.

1175
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000

1176
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,400
Statements are taken from the tourists with whom all these things happened.

1177
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,359
Sketches are made.  The crackdowns begin.  Those who

1178
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,200
were OGWs are caught.

1179
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,760
Their statements are taken.  And the people who were

1180
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,079
involved were caught and how the planning was done was

1181
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,720
linked to it. And the

1182
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,560
houses of the OGWs and terrorists who were being caught were being

1183
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,560
destroyed.

1184
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,640
Now the most important thing in this is

1185
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,440
that TRF had already taken the responsibility

1186
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,680
of this entire attack.  But on 25th of April

1187
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,520
2025, United Nations Security Council

1188
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,240
issued a press statement

1189
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,240
criticizing this Pahalgam attack.  So in the

1190
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,640
first draft of this press statement, the

1191
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,960

1192
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,880
name of Direct the Resistance Front TRF was written.  But as soon as

1193
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,480
Pakistan saw the name of TRF written in it, it

1194
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,480
opposed it.  Pakistan

1195
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,480
said that the

1196
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,240
name of TRF should be removed from this official press statement of the UN.

1197
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,079
This is the original copy of that statement.  You can

1198
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,680
pause and see.  The name of TRF is

1199
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,400
not mentioned anywhere.  The Chinese Navy also blocked India's proposal to

1200
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,160
blacklist the TRF in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee.

1201
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400

1202
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,240
China's diplomat Chang Li

1203
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,400

1204
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,560
removed the name of TRF from the list at the request of Pakistan and

1205
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,640
after removing the name, Pakistan proudly

1206
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
told its parliament that it did

1207
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,640
not allow TRF's name to appear.  Now see, the search operation is

1208
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,960
still going on.  OGWs are being caught.

1209
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,079
But those who had their hands on the guns that day and

1210
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,240
who had killed Musa Ali Bhai, Adil

1211
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,920
Thokar, all of them are still alive.  The

1212
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,000
Indian Force is still searching for them in the forests of Kistwar.  The

1213
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
operation is in progress.

1214
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,160
I will let you know as more details come.  Lastly, let me

1215
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,880
tell you once again that you

1216
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,760
must try Derma Touch Salicylic 2% Face Wash.

1217
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:47,949
Thank you.

1218
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:47,949
