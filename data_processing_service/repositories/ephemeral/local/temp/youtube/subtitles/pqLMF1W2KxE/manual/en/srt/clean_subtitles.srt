The hands that fired the guns in the Pahalgam attack are still alive to this day.  The person who had come to attack Pahalgam turned out to be the SSG Para Commando of the Pakistani Army and this is how this thing came to light. At the end of the attack, he took selfies with the dead bodies and went to the person who had recorded the video and asked him to talk about Palestine. And as soon as he spoke this thing came up.  They changed the location of their plan to attack the hotel to Pahalgam.  Otherwise, the third terrorist who was the earlier target, entered Pakistan through the Attari border on a legal student visa. Why did the demand for buying satellite images of the Pahalgam area before the attack suddenly double? This is not normal.  When these OGWs were caught and questioned in a police style, they told line by line that as soon as the attack took place, US's Max Technology immediately broke its partnership with Pakistan's company BSI. This wasn't just any random firing.   By choking the ground from three sides, the crowd was gathered towards the Maggi stall saying, you have so much guts that now you will raise the domicile issue in Kashmir. [Music] Look, before we move ahead, let's talk about India's increasing problems with increasing heat - temperature and pollution.  India's geographical location is such where the weather remains hot and humid and due to global warming the average temperature has increased by 1 degree in the last 30 years. Dust, mud, heat, all this remains for 10 months out of 12. 40% plus people in India have oily skin and hence due to dirt, pollution and excess sebum production, acne problems are increasing in oily skin. See, the sebaceous glands in oily skin produce more sebum.  And when this sebum mixes with dirt and dead skin, the pores get blocked and that leads to pimples.  So for this today I would like to tell you about Derma Touch Salicylic 2% Face Wash.   It contains BHA which controls oil and cures acne and Zinc PCF which keeps the skin hydrated.  You will start seeing results in six to eight weeks. Formulated with powerful actives, this face wash is fragrance free and suitable for all skin types. So it is well suited for sensitive skin also.  Doctor recommended Indian pharmacy brand dermach makes solid products.  The starting price of this 4 plus rated face wash is just â‚¹149.  It is available on their website dermach.com and on all platforms like amazon, Flipkart, blink and also at your nearest pharmacy store.  So let's come back to the topic. See, this is Jammu and Kashmir and within Jammu and Kashmir, there is Anantnag district, within which falls Pahalgam.  And when you are 5 Km from Pahalgam.  If you climb up, there is a 800 meter long plain here, Baisar, which is also called Mini Switzerland of India. And this is the place where the terrorists attacked in a planned manner on April 22 and this incident is not like a terrorist came and just picked up a gun and started shooting.  This time a huge planning has been done in which multiple groups have attacked using well coordinated strategies and technologies like Ultrasats. Now how was this attack carried out?  How was the planning done?  Where did it happen?   If it happened in Pakistan, then did multiple proofs emerge?  I will tell you each and every thing in this video and to understand all these things we will have to go back a bit. So look, I just showed you the Baisaran area.  There is a village on this side whose name is Gur.  This village officially falls in Bijhara block of Anantnag district and in a house of this village, Adil Hussain Thokar, the first terrorist of Pahalgam attack, was born.  Just a few days ago his house was blown up, but when he was born in the year 1992, no one had even imagined that in the future he would carry out an attack like Pahalgam due to which a war like situation would arise between the two countries. [MUSIC] Network Successful Security.  Now when Adil was growing up here, he first took admission in Shah Hamdan Public School.  Then he completed his 12th class from Government Higher Secondary School, Beech Behara and by the year 2018, he completed his MA from Rahmat Alam College, Anantnag and started teaching. So till the year 2018, when he was in college, his name did not come up in any anti-India activity.  But there was just one thing that everyone noticed at that time, that whenever a terrorist was killed in that area, he would definitely go to his funeral. Its name had not been heard before in any other activity.  But in April 2018 it started its real game.  On 29th of April 2018, what does this Adil Thokar do?  He tells his family that he has an exam and for that he will have to go to Batgaon in Kashmir and after giving the exam he will return home. The family agrees to this and sends him but two to three days pass but Adil does not return home, instead he disappears. The family members call him back to back but he does not talk to them. Then, fed up and tired, on the second of May 2018, Adil Thokar's mother Shahzada Bano goes to the police station and registers a missing complaint.  Now, the missing report was registered but in reality, Adil had already made all the planning.  Without telling anyone, he had applied for a student visa for higher studies in Pakistan in the same month i.e. April 2018.  And in a very short time, i.e. in the same month, the Pakistan authority grants student visa to Adil Thokar. And on the basis of this visa, Adil, on the pretext of having an exam at home, reaches Pakistan in May 2018 via the Attari-Wagah border with a valid passport and valid student visa.  This is his pic from that time.  Now he had reached Pakistan but he did not want to go to Pakistan for studies. After reaching Pakistan, the first thing he does is switch off his phone. He completely cuts off contact with his family and the people around him. And the same day Lashkar meets the leadership of Taba.  Lashkar-e- Taba is the same militant organization that carried out the Mumbai and Parliament attacks.  Now after reaching Pakistan, there is a LED camp in Sawai Nala, Muzaffarabad which is 30km from LOC.  It falls inside POK.  Its training starts here.  Daura e Sufa, Daura e Aam, Daura Ekhas, all these, its training starts.  Out of the nine strikes that were carried out in Operation Sindoor, the first strike was carried out here.  Now Adil's training continues here.  It is prepared to attack further.   On the other hand, the next month after this came, i.e. on 28th June 2018, a problem arose for Pakistan.  FATF Financial Action Task Four.  This is an international body which monitors terror funding across the world. So considering the activities of Pakistan, FATF put it in its grey list. Before blacklisting, it is put in grey list.  A chance is given to improve.  Now this was a huge problem for Pakistan because due to this, the loans etc. that Pakistan gets from the IMF, World Bank etc. would be stopped. This would also have raised a survival issue for Pakistan. So after putting it in the grey list, FATF gave guidelines to Pakistan that you should stop funding of organisations like Lashkar-e-Taba operating in your country and take action against them.  So to show the world the FATF guidelines, Pakistan took small actions. They started submitting reports that they have stopped funding and their leaders of LET etc. were also put in jail.  Now, after few months, on 14th of February 2019, Pulwama is carried out in India. Everyone in India was very angry and immediately after the attack, India had all the proofs like how Rs 10.43 lakh was transferred from Pakistan to the account of Umar, the attacker.  By collecting all these proofs, a dossier was prepared and sent to FATF member countries like US, France, UK.  From 17 to 22 February, a meeting of FATF was held in Paris and a final warning was given to Pakistan that if anything like this happens again, it will be blacklisted. So now after this, the activities of Lashkar Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed inside Pakistan slowed down and there was peace in Pakistan as well and then after 5 months, on the Fifth of August 2019, India removed Article 370 from Kashmir. Article 37 Now after this thing happened, Pakistan was trapped from all sides. Here Article 370 had been removed. Pakistan could not take military action.  Lashkar Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, all these proxies were under the radar of FTF.  So, to deal with this thing, multiple meetings are held in Muridka, Pakistan where LeT has its head quarters. Its solution is found and then after some time a new plan is made so that the fight in Kashmir can be continued.  Pakistan creates terrorist outfit under a new name.  The Resistance Front TRF.   The plan here was to change your name, change your face and keep all your work the same old.  Like normally you must have seen that if a company whose name gets tarnished due to some fraud then it opens a company under a new name and starts doing the same work. So the same thing was done here as well. So Article 370 is removed in August 2019 and after 2 months i.e. in October 2019, The Resistance Front TRF is set up and this same TRF later carries out the Pahalgam attack.  This TRF was created in such a way that it gave the illusion of a clean local Kashmiri group. These people remained from all over the world in which the name of Pakistan was not mentioned anywhere.  And the responsibility of running the entire system and operation within this TRF was in the hands of the same old terrorists who were from Lashkar Taba Jaish Mohammad. Only the name was changed.  After the formation of TRF, hiring was a big issue.  So for this, in the initial phase, he started hiring some people from Tehreek Millat Islamia, Ghaznavi Hind, Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taba. And among all the hiring that has been done, one hiring is very important. You must remember his name because he is the actual mastermind of the Pahalgam attack.  His name is Hashim Musa.  This Hashim Musa is an SSG Para Commando of Pakistan Army.  So the Pakistan Army terminated its service and gave it on loan to Lashkar Taiba.  Gave it to LET on loan. This means that now it will execute all the operations of LET. And see, this is not a conspiracy theory. This thing has clearly come to light in the initial investigation conducted by the NIA. As many OGW statements have come, India Today, Times of India, The New Indian Express has been covering this thing from day one. And in this, what is being said is that NIA belongs to India.  These news agencies are also from India.  So see, the crime has happened inside India.  Investigation is going on inside India.  So there will be no report from Tokyo. And all these things that I am telling you cannot be hidden.  In all the previous attacks whether it was Pulwama, 2611, Kasab who was caught, whatever proofs came, whatever was said by NIA in the initial stage, all those things were later proved and the international community also accepted those proofs. And before this, how was the Pahalgam attack planned? How did these people enter?  How was the coordination done?   Let me tell you about it.  Before that, it is very important to understand that India is not the only country which says all these things about Pakistan. Organizations outside India whose reports are accepted by people all over the world.  The United Nations, International Wash Dogs, Independent Intelligence firms have all said this in their reports that Pakistan has created a proxy battle field in areas like Kashmir by using terror outfits. And the most dangerous part in this is that the Pakistan Army and ISI do not consider it terrorism.  Rather it follows a calculated military doctrine. Like in Afghanistan, the US CIA ousted the Soviet Union by fighting a proxy war through local Mujahideen.  So they believe that they will take Kashmir from India just like this without fighting a war.  The report of the European Foundation for South Asia Studies says that the Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency ISI have an unholy alliance with terror groups. They have given $25 to $250 million to terrorist groups.  Some of their salaries are given in the form of training, operational costs as required. I have placed the link to this entire report in the description. Apart from this, the US State Department said that Pakistan's ISI is still giving shelter to terrorist groups which are focusing on India. Congressional Research Service CRS. Its report number R41832 said on record that Pakistan's ISI is linked with anti-India militant organisations and is secretly providing financial assistance, training and strategic guidance to organisations like Lashkar-e-Taba. I have also included this report in the description.  When you read beyond page number 23 to 24 you will know what praises have been sung for Pakistan.  The CRS report which was published in the US Parliament, US Congress , also said that there are 15 terrorist groups inside Pakistan. Which have been divided into five categories.  The dedicated task of one of the groups is to spread terrorism in Kashmir. These are all their names and you will find the link for this in the description as well.  All these reports are from outside India and if you do not believe them then former President of Pakistan Musharraf accepted in an interview to CN that yes, we do provide training to fight in Kashmir. These are our heroes. Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, while giving an interview to Dawn, accepted that non-state actors like Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out the Mumbai attack using Pakistani soil. Rest, you must have seen these famous photographs recently.  The entire Pakistani leadership is standing with UN designated terrorist Hafiz Abdul Rauf. And I am telling this in short.   There are so many reports from the US Department of Defense Pentagon FADF.  The whole night will pass and in those reports only the connection with Pakistan and its terrorists will be told and all these are reports from outside India.  So whatever story I am telling you next, you cannot reject it just by saying that hey, this is an Indian YouTuber.  There are reports from India.  India has NIA.  By saying all these things you cannot remove Pakistan's link with terrorism.  Let's come back to our story.  So see, till now Hashim Musa, who was a para commando of Pakistan Army, had left the army and started working with the operatives of LeT. Adil Thokar, who had reached Pakistan from Kashmir, was undergoing training there. That means the two terrorists who were there on the day of Pahalgam attack were working inside Pakistan.  And the third thing, TRF had already been formed.  And after the formation of TRF, the second thing they had to do was to appoint a head of TRF and the head had to be someone on whom they had trust for a long time, who was skilled and local to Kashmir so that their narrative of the war could be executed in the same manner and by having a local head, he would have local hiring and good knowledge of that area, so it is a huge advantage.  So for this they selected Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, a resident of Kaima village, Rampura, Kulgam district of Kashmir. He was a very old and trusted terrorist of LeT.  It was involved in spreading terrorism with LeT since 1996. So for this reason, Mohammad Abbas Shaikh was made the head of TRF.  He is also called the founder of TRF.  But actually the founders of TRF were sitting in Pakistan. Along with TRF head Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, there lived another LET trustee man named Sheikh Sajjad Gul.  The planning of the Pahalgam attack , the location that was set, the shift from the hotel to Pahalgam, all the planning was done by him.  He will come forward soon.  He lived in Nawa Bazaar of Srinagar in Kashmir. He had completed his MBA and had been caught with IT extortion once before in Delhi. Was involved in many attacks.  His brother was also earlier a doctor in Maharaja Har Singh Hospital. Currently he handles funding in Gulf countries. So after doing all these things, now from here Mohammad Abbas Sheikh and Sheikh Sajjad Gul handle the entire network of TRF in Kashmir. And then after this, the responsibility of TRF's OGW network in Kashmir was given to Farooq Ahmed.  Farooq Ahmed was a very important man.  Till 2016, it was in Narikot village, Kalaroos block, Kupwara district of Kashmir.  But since 2016, he was handling the OGW network of Kashmir while staying in Muzaffarabad, PoK. And the terrorists who were sent inside Kashmir by crossing the LoC were also done by this Farooqui.  In fact, at the time of Pahalgam attack, it was he who had made all the terrorists who had come from Pakistan cross the LOC.  And all the OGWs who were involved in the Pahalgam attack and were doing recce before planning it, all of them were in contact with him.  See OGW, I have told this in the old video.  Let me tell you once again. OGW Over Ground Worker. People in Kashmir who hate India but don't want to risk their lives by taking up arms become OGWs. They run their household comfortably like ordinary people. Some drive auto, some manage shops.  But they help those who are terrorists.  They do all the work like providing them food, shelter, army information, sharing details of the area etc. OGWs play a very important role in Kashmir. Without OGW, this terrorist organization became LET , became Jaish-e-Mohammed.  It becomes very difficult for them to do all their work inside Kashmir.  Now after this, when all these things are setup, Farooq Ahmed starts infiltrating terrorists from Pakistan into Kashmir by making them cross the LOC.  in order to attack. All the terrorists who were entering from the LoC were entering from the areas of Samba, Katua, Rajouri and Punj. And these had a set pattern. After entering the Kashmir border, OGWs used to receive them.   They used to help them and after reaching the border, instead of taking the direct Jammu route and reaching Anantnag, they used to reach the Kistwar area which you can see from here through the route because there are very dense forests and natural caves here.  The average elevation is more than 2000 metres above sea level.  So it is very easy to escape.  It is very difficult to catch them here. 22 April 2025, the day this attack took place.  Till date, our forces are searching and killing them in the Sunday area.  The fighting is still going on in this area.  So see, by the year 2022, they had established their entire network inside Kashmir. TRF rebranded its model of terrorism. Create online portals. He used Telegram social media a lot.  A Telegram channel was also created by the name of Tj RF in which Kashmiris were made to join by sharing propaganda videos etc.  And then in the meantime they started attacking inside Kashmir. They started targeting those who were non-local.  He killed him in Har Singh High Street Market area, 100 meters from Lal Chowk.  This was the first attack of TRF inside Kashmir.  After this he killed Ajay Pandita ji and killed Akash Mehra.  Laborers who had come from every corner of India were attacked.  Basically, you can understand his model in this way that he was working like a contract killer. They were going and killing all the non-locals. But the real shock they faced came on 23 August.  Because on this day, in Alochi Bagh of Srinagar, the head of TRF, Mohammad Abbas Sheikh, who is also called the founder of TRF.  He was playing a cricket match with local people.  The Jammu & Kashmir Police got to know about it and they reached there and killed him.  The day he was killed, in the same week, the second hand command of TRF, as I had also told you, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, was made the head.  Here the head of TRF is killed.  On the other hand, the situation in Kashmir was also changing very rapidly.  For example, in 2018, 1,458 cases of stone platting were reported. Whereas in 2020, it had come down to 255 and then further reduced.  Further, in 2023 and 2024, the official data of stone pelting became zero.  Cases of 228 terrorists were registered in 2018.  On the other hand, if we talk about 2023, then TRF was able to carry out only 44 attacks. Where 8.5 lakh tourists came in 2018. This number increased to 31 lakh in 2023 and the next year 43 lakh tourists came. Whereas in 2019, an investment of Rs 296.64 crore was made. In 2022, an investment of Rs 153 crore was made in Kashmir. A lot of money was being injected. And the domicile laws had also come into force. Due to which people from outside Kashmir could also get domicile certificate made.  And the main target of TRF was that this growing trade and the money that is coming to Kashmiris due to increase in tourists should be stopped by attacking.  Due to this, they attacked some non-locals and people who were issued domicile but the number of tourists was not decreasing.   The hotels were full.  There were pony riders, auto drivers, everyone was busy. You must also listen to the interviews of local Kashmiris on YouTube in which they openly say that there was so much work that they did not have even a day's rest.  A lot of money was coming in and a lot of tourists were also coming.  So things were changing so fast in Kashmir, to deal with this, now the real game starts from here. I told you about Hashim Musa in September 2023 that it was revealed in the initial investigation that he was an SSG Para Commando of the Pakistan Army.  So along with Musa and Ali Bhai, not much details have come about Ali Bhai. It is not known whether he was in the Para Commando or not.  But these Ali Bhai and Musa, both were Pakistani citizens.  So in September 2023, they were infiltrated into Kashmir through both Kathua and Sama sector routes. After reaching Kashmir, with the help of OGW, these Khari Mahaurs live in a safe house in Basantgarh. This Moses had been given very good combat training.  It could survive in the snow in the forest for many days.  So the plan was that in future any attacks would happen in Kashmir, Musa would lead them along with Ali Bhai and Farooq's 15 to 20 OGWs would help him. So what it means is that the two main terrorists of the Pahalgam attack that was to happen later had reached Kashmir in September 2023.  After reaching Kashmir, they execute their small operations. And then in October 2024, in the Pahalgam attack, he was the third terrorist who fired guns.  Adil Thokar, about whom I told you in the beginning, had gone to Pakistan on a student visa.  After completing his training, he also enters Kashmir through this sector which was the Punj Rajouri area.   There was another terrorist who did a favor and came to Kashmir at the same time.  But there is no confirmed report whether this is the same Ehsan who was there on the day of the Pahalgam attack. Now after reaching Kashmir, these people attack non-locals for some time. Especially those laborers who were involved in infrastructure and development projects. Like they killed six labourers and a doctor at the G More Tunnel project in Gagangir. Then attacks were carried out in Dera's street DK J.  So in this way, every now and then these people were sitting there and attacking inside Kashmir. Now it was 2 months after this, i.e. in December 2024, i.e. 3-4 months before the Pahalgam attack.  At this time, there was a terrorist with him in Dachigam, Srinagar, Junaid Ahmed Bhatt.  The forces surround him and kill him in an operation.  And after his death, when his body is checked, a mobile phone is found near him.  Through which, the instructions etc. that were coming from his Pakistan connections, encrypted messages etc., all of them are caught and an image is found from his mobile. You might have seen this image recently also. This image went viral after the Pahalgam attack. This image was found from Junaid's mobile in December 2024.  But at that time the Farses could not recognize that Moses was also in it.  But when the Pahalgam attack happened and later when the tourists gave descriptions etc. and after the attack more sketches were made, then this photo came out and through the information of the OGWs who were caught, it was found out that the person on the right of this photo is Musa and the person you are seeing next to him is Junaid who was killed.  Now see, after this, when all these people reached Kashmir, reports also came about the arrangement of weapons. American M4 rifles were used in the Pahalgam attack and these M4 rifles were more advanced than AK-47.  These include night vision devices, cameras, etc. When cartridges were recovered from the crime scene after the Pahalgam attack, ballistic analysis of those cartridges was done. It came to light that guns like M4 carbines and AK-47 were used. And things have also come out about these American M4 rifles that when the USA left Afghanistan, it had left behind weapons worth about $7 billion in Afghanistan.  And these weapons, including American F4 rifles, all these weapons reached the black market from there. And according to intelligence reports, the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, was given the task of arms, procurement and logistics.  He smuggled these M4 rifles through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region to Jaish-Mohammed's headquarters, Markaz Camp, and then from there, using drones, these weapons were dumped in Kashmir. This process of bringing weapons to Kashmir had been going on for many years.  Now see, after this a very unusual activity took place and because of the style in which Pahalgam was attacked, the curiosity of this incident increased further.  What actually happened was that some time ago in August 2024, UN designated terrorist and head of Lashkar-e-Taba Saifullah Kasuri met Hamas leader Khalid Mashal in Doha, Qatar and at that time, Pakistan's Pakistan Central Muslim League (PMML) had also uploaded videos of this meeting.  At that time no one paid much attention to this thing. But the real alarm bell rings on the Fifth of February 2025.  What happens on this day is that Hamas leaders come to Shaheed Sabir Stadium in Rawalkot, Pakistan.  This was the first time in history that Hamas leadership entered PoK and held a conference after reaching there.  The official name of this conference was Kashmir Solidarity and Hamas Operation Al Aqsa Flood Conference.  And he held many rallies here.  A lot of venom was spewed against India and from here it started to seem that now these people are going to do something in Kashmir and the Pahalgam attack also happened in Hamas style and after this meeting, reports started coming that after coming here, Hamas discussed the tactics of carrying out attacks inside Kashmir, methods of encrypted communication and civilian targeting etc. Now see, on the Fifth of February, the Hamas leadership reached PoK and a week later, another unusual thing happens there.  There is a famous satellite company in the US called Max Technologies.  So what happens is that suddenly the demand for high resolution images of the Pahalgam area of â€‹â€‹Kashmir with this company doubles.  Now Pahalgam is a tourist area.  There is no battle field for the demand to increase in this manner.  This was not normal. Please pause this image and look at it once.  The highest number of orders for high resolution images were received on February 12, 15, 18, 21 and 22 this year 2025. These are those images.  Look, this US satellite company Max Technology provides high resolution satellite images whose size is 30 cm.  to 15 cm.  Happens till.  They sell them to approved government and defense agencies around the world. Like in India, ISRO and Ministry of Defense are its customers.  These high resolution satellite images are not normal.  With this, even the smallest things on the ground can be seen.  Through these high resolution images, planning of attack, target verification etc. all these things happen.  This image acts as a tactical weapon in the battlefield.  For this reason, they share their images only with approved government agencies.  If any private or random entity comes, we do not give him high resolution images.  They give low grade images. She is of no use.  Now the question arises that why is the demand for images of areas like Pahalgam so huge?  And access to these images is not that easy. So when investigation was done about this, a new game came to light.  What happened was that in June 2024, a Pakistani company Business System Intelligence Private Limited PSI entered into a partnership with the US satellite company Max Technologies by agreeing to all its terms and conditions.  Now, because of the partnership, the Pakistani company BSI got the advantage that it also got the rights to sell those high resolution images which cannot be accessed easily.  This means that this company also got access which till now was exclusive to approved government agencies.  If this Pakistani company BSI wants, it can give its Pakistani clients to them also.  And who knows, that Pakistani client might even be a terrorist organisation.  And the chances of this happening are very high.  I am saying this because the founder of this company, Obaidullah Syed, also turned out to be a fraud.  What it was doing was that it was illegally exporting high performance computing equipment and advanced software used for sensitive tasks like nuclear research and missile development to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), without privy to the US.   The US caught him red-handed and then the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois convicted him under 18 USC 371.  Now see, in the first week of February 2025, Hamas holds a meeting in PoK.  In the same month, the demand for the image of the Pahalgam area doubles and then 10 to 15 days later, in March 2025, an announcement is made.   The announcement was that PM Narendra Modi will visit Kashmir next month i.e. on 19th of April 2025.  To inaugurate Vande Bharat. Now, when this announcement was made, at that time Musa, Ali Bhai, Adil Thokar and others who had come from Pakistan and were in their group, were inside Kashmir.  In the month in which this announcement was made, i.e. March 2025, during this entire month neither any orders for satellite images came nor did Musa Ali Bhai do any activity inside Kashmir.  It is believed that this planning would have been done in this month itself. In the forests of Kishtwar, the head of TRF, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, Musa Ali Bhai and Adil Thokar might have done the planning in the month of March itself. But the most surprising thing in this was that all these people who were communicating, whether among themselves or inside Pakistan, no one came to know about this communication and why it was not known, that is also discussed.  See, earlier this Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar Taiba and all the terrorists who were there, during the 26/11 Mumbai attack, you must have heard the conversation at that time, you have even read it on YouTube, these people were communicating with each other through Thuraya satellite phone, all of that was caught, but this time they were given the Ultra sets that are used by Pakistan Military and sent to Kashmir, Huai is a Chinese company which is band in India, it had launched some special smartphones, med 60 pro60 series and 11 Ultra, what they did in this was that they put internal satellite antenna and specialized chip in these phones.  The purpose of this was that if the user has an emergency and there is no internet, he can connect these phones to China's Tiantong One satellite network which is managed by China Telecom.  By connecting to it, voice text and video chat can be done without internet.  Basically a normal phone gets converted into a satellite phone.  And these Ultra sets were brought into use after upgrading them.  These ultrasets were being used in the entire planning of Pahalgam and even on the day of the attack. They were not being caught because when terrorists like Musa and Ali Bhai were sitting in Kashmir and communicating with each other, what actually was happening was that the military grade encrypted radio signals used the Chinese satellite to bypass the Indian cellular and satellite surveillance system and then through it the signals went to the server in Pakistan. Due to which their communication could not be traced. And hence it is believed that the entire month of March and the entire planning that was done could not be captured. Their communications could not be captured. Coordination was done sitting in Karachi, Pakistan and Muzaffarabad, POK using these Ultra sets.  Where every step was explained as to when, where and how to complete the task.  These ultra sets were recovered only once in 2023 in an encounter in Surankot, from a terrorist.  An attempt was made to crack it.  In fact this ultraset was also sent to western countries. But it could not be cracked. This was a big reason why their communication could not be traced. So Ultrasats were used for communication and to find routes in the forests of Kashmir. Earlier, a lot of help was taken from the OGWs. But this time less help was taken from oGW.  That was done because they also used new methods for navigation.  He used an app called Alpine Quest. Which is used by trackers for offline navigation. When there is no internet, we use this to navigate in the mountains like Google Maps.  So in this offline version of Alpine Quest they used high resolution satellite images. Because of which this Musa Ali Bhai works without internet service and without the help of OGW like Google Map.  In that way, we were roaming in the forests of Kistwar using this Alpine Quest app. Now after this, planning starts in the first week of April as to how to impact the trade of the tourists coming to Kashmir so that the entire system which is changing very fast in Kashmir can be disrupted. So, in the first week of April, they decided that the luxury hotels near the Zabran Valley of Kashmir, especially those which house foreign tourists, would be attacked.  Basically they wanted to impact the trade of Kashmir.  In a way, this was a trade war against Kashmiris. One more thing has been said in this that perhaps this could also be the reason because PM Narendra Modi was also to come to Kashmir at that time for inauguration.  So at the same time, the chances of high value targets like PM's delegates etc. coming to luxury hotels to be there will also increase.  Because of that, the coverage of the attack will spread even more. For this reason, these people had fixed a plan to attack the tourists who would be inside the hotel at this time. Now after the target is fixed, let us start this Reiki on the Fourth of April 2025. Adil goes to OGW with Thokar to do Reiki.  The Pakistani brothers Musa and Ali did not go for Reiki.  When the Reiki was done, the OGW would go and share the footage etc. with them and then a plan would be made and Reiki would be done on a daily basis.  Now when this Reiki was happening, in the meantime, on the ninth of April, there was a local resident named Rashpal. Two to three terrorists enter his house with M4 rifles. Now who were these terrorists? This could not be confirmed.  But one thing was confirmed that this was neither Musa nor Ali Bhai. Now after entering Rajpal's house, they ask for food, travel bag and umbrella. Then he asked for the phone from Rajpal.  Make a WhatsApp call from his phone.  They go somewhere and talk in Urdu and then break the SIM card and return Rashpal's phone.  And after that, when these people were going, they asked Rashpal about the directions of all the areas around the region and after asking everything, they left.  And the next morning, i.e. on 10th of April, Rashpal would go to the police and tell them everything.  And along with this, at this time, other small intelligence was also coming to the agencies that terrorists were going to attack the hotel. So, due to all these things, the Jammu & Kashmir Police and the paramilitary force together started a joint operation in Dachigam Nishant and the nearby luxury hotels and increased security.  The forces had started surveillance at all the exit and entry points of the hotel. Guest verification had started.  The quick reaction team was kept on standby. Now at this time one more thing comes out that the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kashmir for inauguration is cancelled and the reason given is that the weather in Kashmir is bad.  Because of this, this visit will be cancelled and will be done through video conferencing. Now, after some time, this hotel was the place where Musa Ali Bhai and all of them had fixed their target that they would attack the tourists of the hotel.  These people cancel these plans.  Now, there is no clarity about whether this plan was cancelled due to security reasons or because of the cancellation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit. But the target of the hotel which was fixed first is cancelled.  Now for this these people started Reiki again and after doing Reiki, four locations were finalized in which the first was Aru Valley.  The second was Betaab Valley.  Thirdly, he selected the local amusement parks and the fourth was Baisaran Valley.  All the locations were such that tourists could be attracted there so that the growing economy could be impacted by the tourists coming here.  Now in the next step, out of the four locations that were selected, they removed and cancelled the location of the amusement park and the reason behind this was that the Pahalgam Police Station was just 500 meters away from this location.   That means the police could have reached within a minute or two and they also dropped the Aru Valley location from their plan.  The reason was that there was a network problem here.  Secondly, the connection with the road was very strong.  So it was very easy for the forces to come and for the people to run away. And there was the same issue in Betaab Valley also. Security forces were nearby and the terrorists had very limited options for escape after the attack. And then after calculating all these things he finally selected Baisaran Valley of Pahalgam.  The reason was that there was no security presence here.  Secondly, the tourist footfall here was comparatively higher than others.  The car could not reach.  One could reach there only by trekking or by horse.  It took 30 to 40 minutes for the security forces to arrive.  The nearest base of CRPF's Delta Company 116 Battalion was 4 to 5 km away.  It was on.  This map has dense forests all around it, so it was very easy to attack and escape into the forests and there were no CCTV cameras.  So from here they fixed the location as Byasaran Valley of Pahalgam and started preparations for it.  And when this happens, the next day news comes that the US Vice President is coming to India and because of this news, it was decided that the attack will be carried out when the US Vice President is in India so that the news gets made all over the world.  Therefore the date of 22nd April was fixed. Now as soon as the date was fixed, the remaining terrorists were already around the Baisaran area.  But on 21 April, Musa and Ali Bhai, who were hiding in the jungle for so many days, get the green signal and both of them leave the forest of Kokernag on the same date, i.e. on the night of 21st April. The route they take towards Baisaran Valley is Kishtwar Daksham Larnu Chatpal Aishmukam. For going towards 22 Run, in some reports you will also find the Avantipura Taral Siriguwar Pahalgaon route mentioned but in most reports only the Kishtwar route is mentioned, so I took that one. Now these people walk from here and after walking continuously for 21 to 22 hours, they had trained in such a way that they walk continuously and after walking continuously for 21 to 22 hours, they come and sit in the forests around Baisaran and wait to attack.  Adil Thokar was there in the area near Shri Gubara, so he was already there.  So what I mean to say is that now all the terrorists had come and sat in the forests around Baisaran Valley and were waiting in ambush. Now see, Pahalgam is here and it is 5 to 6 km from here.  If you trek up through the rough unpaved road, it takes around 1 hour and after trekking you reach this gate and as soon as you enter through this gate, you can see a green field of 800 meters long and 600 meters wide. This plain is Baisaran Valley.  And the terrorists were hiding and waiting in the surrounding forests. So there is one entry- exit gate from here and another entry- exit gate of this ground from here.  This entire area was given by the Pahalgam Development Authority to a man from Bridge Bahra through tender for 3 years for Rs. 3 crores.  So he introduced the ticketing system inside this area. Started zip lining and also secured the area by putting fencing around it. So it means that there are two entry and exit gates in this entire area.  There is fencing all around. And security is provided here during the Amarnath Yatra.  The rest of the time, security is provided only when the tour operators or hoteliers inform the authorities that there are more tourists. Now after this the day of 2nd of April 2025 starts.  The entry to Baisaran Valley opens at 9:00 AM and tourists from Pahalgam start reaching Baisaran Valley from their respective locations and from the main gate of Baisaran Valley, they buy tickets and start entering Baisaran Valley and gradually 1000 tickets were sold. Meaning that there had been a footfall of 1000 people in this area.  And now after this, it was 1:30 in the afternoon and till then there were about 400 tourists left inside this location. All the rest had gone back. No one had any idea what was going to happen next.  Now, after 15 minutes, i.e. at 1:45, the first terrorist, most probably Adil Thokar, enters. Look, whatever I will tell you here, in this entire scene it will be difficult to say whether Musa went from this side or Adil went from this side. Because it could not be confirmed from where Adil entered and from where Musa entered.  Only this much has been confirmed that Musa, Ali Bhai and Adil were there who fired the guns.  And some terrorists were there as a backup in the forest.  There were some who did not have guns in their hands but were mixed in the crowd.  Therefore, it was difficult to say how many terrorists were actually there at that time, but it was confirmed that Ali Bhai, Musa and Adil Thokar were there who picked up guns and killed people.  So this is how a terrorist wearing a Kashmiri pheran enters the ground from this side.  She had hidden it etc. inside the Kashmiri pheran she was wearing.  So he comfortably enters among the public and starts moving towards this entry-exit gate. As soon as he reaches the entry-exit gate, he takes out his gun and starts firing in the air.  It does not use it on any person.  He continuously fires in the air and tries to lead the crowd towards the main entry-exit gate. Now as the crowd starts gathering towards the main entry exit gate. So from the same side, from the forest side, which was over the fence, two terrorists jumped from there and stood there wearing military track suits etc. and most likely, they were Musa and Ali brothers.  The public was thinking that they were security personnel.  So see, some terrorists came and fired randomly and killed people.  It was not like that.  This was a well planned trap in which both the entry and exit points were properly blocked and all the tourists were surrounded from all sides.  And the area was very large, so when all these things were happening, some people who were on the other side could not know what was going on on the other side.  He was comfortably doing his zip lining etc. Now when the crowd reaches the main entry-exit point, those two terrorists, who people thought were security personnel, also start firing. Then they gather all the crowd here at this point where there are Bhelpuri, tea and food stalls. Separates men and women.  All these things were done within 50 meters from the main entry-exit gate.  Now after separating men and women, they ask the men whether they are Hindu or not.  And then those who do not tell, they make them recite Kalma. As soon as the terrorists came to Devashish Bhattacharya, he recited Kalma and the terrorists left him and went to the other side. A Christian was standing nearby and he was asked to speak on the issue of Palestine.  Some were forced to remove their pants and then the Hindu tourists were shot at close range.  Now, at this time, Adil Hussain, who was a pony rider, had brought the tourists for a tour.  A terrorist shoots one of Adil's tourists, and Adil begins arguing with him.  He tries to snatch his gun.  So the terrorists shoot three bullets at Adil Hussain and kill him too. He had an M4 rifle.  It was an AK-47. GP cameras were installed on their bodies and feet.  So they were recording all these things and taking selfies with the people who had died and keeping them in their phones.  There are many more things which I will not be able to tell and you will not be able to hear either.  So these people did all these things for 20 to 25 minutes. In all these things, 26 people lost their lives.  This is his name. And then after all this was done, he forcibly snatched two phones from the crowd. And taking those phones, he jumped over the fence on the left side wall and ran away into the forest.  Now he has run away.  But there were people shouting all around on the side.  He was asking for help for his family.  But there was no help anywhere.  Then somehow at 2:30 pm, for the first time, information reaches the police that terrorists have done all this in Baisaran Valley.  The SAO of Pahalgam police station gets shocked and it takes him time to reach Baisaran valley, so to send help quickly, he informs Abdul Wahid, the general president of all the unions of Kashmir, that all this has happened and help should be sent as quickly as possible. As soon as Abdul Wahid comes to know about it, he informs the president of Pony Owners Association, Rais Ahmed Bhatt. His phone network was also not working, so he starts running alone towards Baisaran valley and whoever he meets on the way, he takes them with him and takes a shortcut through the jungle and reaches before Farsas.  That means that in such a huge crowd only five to six people were able to reach out for help.  These people were not even professionals, so they were doing the rescue in whatever way possible, by sitting the victims on their backs etc. Then somehow SAO Riyaz reaches there and then Rajesh Kumar, Commandant of the 116 battalion of CRPF, along with his team of 25 people, reaches the site running on foot and then the rescue operation begins.  Helicopters etc. come. Now as soon as this attack takes place, shortly thereafter TRF takes the responsibility of the attack and gives the reason that it has been done because of the domicile issue that is being issued. Now after this the entire area is sanitized. Statements are taken from the tourists with whom all these things happened. Sketches are made.  The crackdowns begin.  Those who were OGWs are caught. Their statements are taken.  And the people who were involved were caught and how the planning was done was linked to it. And the houses of the OGWs and terrorists who were being caught were being destroyed. Now the most important thing in this is that TRF had already taken the responsibility of this entire attack.  But on 25th of April 2025, United Nations Security Council issued a press statement criticizing this Pahalgam attack.  So in the first draft of this press statement, the name of Direct the Resistance Front TRF was written.  But as soon as Pakistan saw the name of TRF written in it, it opposed it.  Pakistan said that the name of TRF should be removed from this official press statement of the UN. This is the original copy of that statement.  You can pause and see.  The name of TRF is not mentioned anywhere.  The Chinese Navy also blocked India's proposal to blacklist the TRF in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee. China's diplomat Chang Li removed the name of TRF from the list at the request of Pakistan and after removing the name, Pakistan proudly told its parliament that it did not allow TRF's name to appear.  Now see, the search operation is still going on.  OGWs are being caught. But those who had their hands on the guns that day and who had killed Musa Ali Bhai, Adil Thokar, all of them are still alive.  The Indian Force is still searching for them in the forests of Kistwar.  The operation is in progress. I will let you know as more details come.  Lastly, let me tell you once again that you must try Derma Touch Salicylic 2% Face Wash. Thank you. [music]
