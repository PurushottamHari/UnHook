1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
Productivity apps promise us clarity and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,279
simplicity, yet we always end up

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,890
juggling dozens of them. But today, I'm

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,400
betting on one app that claims to do it

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,160
[Music]

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,119
all. If you're new here, welcome. I'm

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,600
Thiago Forte. My mission is to help you

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,720
organize your digital life. Today is

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,760
about one simple question. Can one app

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,080
really handle every single part of your

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
workday? using our official second brain

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,880
notion templates, notion calendar and

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,920
notion mail. My goal is to simplify

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,750
everything down to one tool to see if it

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,520
truly improves my

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,360
[Music]

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,800
productivity. Ah, good morning. Let's do

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,399
this. What you're seeing on the screen

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,840
is our official second brain notion

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
template. The first thing I want to

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,600
point out is a little quote. The system

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,559
you use to manage information must be so

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,920
effortless that it liberates your focus

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,479
rather than constraining it. Your system

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
must provide you with time not consume

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,520
it. A tool like notion is very powerful

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,920
but it also has such a specific pitfall

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
which is you can spend too much time

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
over optimizing. And so everything I'm

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
going to show you is kind of a

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,479
minimalistic approach. It's the minimum

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
that I think you should do to get value

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,680
from your second brain without kind of

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,600
over investing your time and effort. So,

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,320
the first thing you'll see at the very

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,439
top of the page here is a section called

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,280
daily pages. This is a dedicated notion

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
page for today. It's almost like an

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
inbox for today for any notes, ideas,

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
brainstorms, just random things that

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,040
come up. So, I'm going to go ahead and

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
open that page. I like to retitle this

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
to today which is Tuesday. And then the

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
first thing I like to track just with a

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,719
yes no is whether I slept seven plus

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,479
hours of high quality sleep or not.

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,799
That's something I'm working on. You can

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
add more of these fields which in notion

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
are called properties to track anything.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Once I've done that, I'm going to go

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
ahead and open up the startup checklist.

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,400
I don't want to spend a lot of mental

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
cycles when I first sit down in the

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
morning thinking what do I start with?

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
How do I begin? And the same thing at

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
the end of the day. I don't want to end

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
my workday in a kind of haphazard,

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
frazzled way. I want to finish it very

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
intentionally. So for the startup

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
checklist, the first one is to check the

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
calendar. And this is the first time

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,120
that we're going to head over to the

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
recently released notion calendar. I'm

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
just going to do a quick pass to make

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
sure I'm not forgetting anything. So I

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
see that there was recycling at school

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
today. I've already dropped off the

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
kids, so that's done. And this is

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,360
typically what I try to do on most days.

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,599
Today, I'm trying to reserve really the

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
entire morning for deep work. Then I'll

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
usually have a break for lunch, like 30

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
minutes to an hour. This afternoon, from

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
1 to 2:00 p.m., we have a meeting about

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,400
redesigning our website, and I know I

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,760
have to leave to pick up the kids around

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,239
2:15 p.m. each day. Let's head back over

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,840
to Notion proper. And the last thing I

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
want to do as part of my startup

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
checklist is to check my task list. And

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
that kind of makes sense, right? I'm

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,519
getting ready now to actually start

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,440
doing things, to start executing on

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,480
things. So, I want to start bringing up

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
what are my priorities for the day in

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
terms of tasks. So, to do that, I'll

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
open up here the very next section. By

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,959
the way, this is something so cool with

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,799
a tool like notion, which is since

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
you're actually designing it, you can

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
create it the way you want. You're not

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,280
limited to the interface that some

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
faraway software designer made up for

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,560
you. So, I've actually put each of these

95
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
sections in the exact order that I

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,599
follow them and that I recommend you

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,239
follow them. And what we've created here

98
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,560
is essentially what's known as a task

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,959
manager. So, contained within this gray

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
box right here is really all of the key

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,200
functionality of what would normally be

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,920
a completely separate app that you would

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
have to research, download, learn, and

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
keep using. So today is probably the

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
most important view for deciding what

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm doing today, but there's a few

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
others here that are super useful. This

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,560
week is useful if you want to kind of

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
also get a broader view of what's going

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
on later this week as well. Then we also

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
have waiting on. These are things that

112
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,639
I've designated I'm waiting on someone

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
else for. For example, I'm waiting to

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,120
actually book our Airbnb for our

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,120
upcoming trip to Guatemala until I get a

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
recommendation for my Guatemalan friend

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,160
of where to stay. You can also view

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,639
tasks by status. You can also see them

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
according to parah. So you can see here

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
every either project area or resource of

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,080
parah has its own sections. And finally

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,479
you can also see things by calendar. The

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
fact that you now have notion calendar

124
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,280
which can track information in a

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,280
calendar view means you can also see a

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,639
calendar view within notion. This is a

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
downloadable template that you can

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
purchase from us and install your very

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
own second brain using everything that

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm about to show you. So, let me head

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
back to today. And this is really where

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm going to focus on. It's usually just

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,560
a few things that are the highest

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
priority for me to take on today. I've

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
already identified what that task is,

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,919
which is to draft the curriculum for our

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
new AI program, Second Brain Enterprise.

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
Now that I've identified that's what I

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,240
want to work on, I kind of want to see

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,960
the broader context of the project, the

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
wider project that that one task fits

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,560
into. So that's the perfect time to

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
close this tasks section and open up

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
projects. I've already decided I'm going

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
to dive into second brain enterprise

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
today. I can instantly kind of pivot

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,080
into a projecentric way of thinking. So

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,400
what you see here is a kind of rundown

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,400
of some of the main characteristics,

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
what notion calls properties of this

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,520
project. I have a link to the tasks here

152
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,720
to the notes. And the main thing to keep

153
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,240
in mind here is just really try to

154
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,160
centralize everything related to the

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
project in this one place. And lastly,

156
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
you can see here that I'm a big fan of

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
checklists. I also have a checklist for

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,600
how I begin every project and how I

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,160
complete every project. So if you

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
remember the task is to work on the

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
curriculum. You can see here I've

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,360
already made some progress on the

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
different class sessions and it's time

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,759
to get feedback from my team. This is

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,560
what something that's so cool about an

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,800
integrated all-in-one and team-based

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,520
application like notion. What I can do

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
is select this change I've made or this

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,440
heading class one and say comment and

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,080
say what do you think of the agenda for

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,840
class one and then I'm going to do at

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
and I'm going to start writing my

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,720
colleagueu's name which is Julia

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
question mark and then return and

175
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
there's now a comment as you can see

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,720
over here on the right which has tagged

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,039
Julia and therefore sent her a

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
notification

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,199
All right. So, now it's the end of the

180
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,440
morning. I feel really good that I spent

181
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
most of the morning in deep work. I did

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
get a little bit distracted by a couple

183
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,599
instant messages. But now is really time

184
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
to check in with what my team needs,

185
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
external collaborators, things that I'm

186
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
waiting on from people outside my

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,039
company. And that all means email. And

188
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,240
Notion actually recently launched Notion

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,759
Mail, its very first email client. And

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,919
let me show you some of the main

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,960
features that I'm getting the most value

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,039
from. The first one is auto labels,

193
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,919
which you can access by clicking on this

194
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,919
button. And what this does is it allows

195
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,039
you to automatically categorize certain

196
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,960
kinds of emails. simply describe using

197
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,880
natural language which the AI can

198
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,720
understand the kinds of emails you're

199
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,800
looking for. So I'm going to say any

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,199
emails related to second brain

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
enterprise and just to be sure that none

202
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,720
slip through the cracks I'm going to say

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:03,240
AI or that are from my collaborators on

204
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,160
this project which are Hayden Miamoto or

205
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,120
Julia Saxenna. And you can see here

206
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,120
there's two options. You can keep those

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,039
emails, the emails that fit those

208
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,840
criteria right where they are in the

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,680
inbox and simply add a label or you can

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,759
split them. This is a feature called

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
split inboxes. Let me show you what that

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,000
looks like. You can see here the AI is

213
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
working in the background to find all

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
the relevant emails and now it's

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
creating the label. And there you go.

216
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
You can see there are four existing

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
email threads that it has identified

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
with this check mark are definitely in

219
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,279
this category. And then there's a couple

220
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
that it's not sure about. Actually, all

221
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,519
of its decisions are already correct

222
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
whether it it is or isn't part of this

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,680
category. So, I'm going to go ahead and

224
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
click save. And there you go. You can

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,760
actually see that there's the normal

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
standard inbox up here, but now we've

227
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
created a new one called Second Brain.

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm actually going to retitle it Second

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Brain Enterprise because I have a lot of

230
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
different Second Brain related projects.

231
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,959
And now any emails that come in related

232
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
to this top priority of mine will appear

233
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,360
right here. The next feature I'd like to

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,120
show you is a really powerful one called

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
scheduling. So, let's say you have an

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
email thread such as this one about an

237
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
upcoming launch of one of our products

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,519
in Asia that you realize it's time for a

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
meeting. Okay, you can see there's been

240
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,920
many, many, many, many back and forth

241
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,399
messages. Let's just have a meeting and

242
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,640
hash this out. The more people are on

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,880
the message thread, the harder it is to

244
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,240
find a meeting time that fits everyone's

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
schedules. So, I'm going to make this

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,640
easier by hitting command K, which

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
brings up this little dialogue window

248
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
with all the different commands that I

249
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,040
can act on. And the one I'm going to do

250
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,360
is called schedule. So, I'll go down to

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,920
where it says compose schedule reply.

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,839
And what this does is it replies to the

253
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
currently open email or the currently

254
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,040
open thread with this interactive little

255
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,880
widget where you are going to create

256
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
options that other people can choose

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
from. In this case, this is probably

258
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,320
going to be longer than 30 minutes.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,160
Let's put 45 minutes just to be safe.

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
And then you can see this is my own

261
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,800
personal calendar. So, I'm going to look

262
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
at what are some open slots that I can

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,240
make available to schedule this. So,

264
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,040
let's do one on Thursday from 12 to 1.

265
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,680
That can be an option. One on Friday,

266
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
uh, let's say 11 to 12. Then I'll click

267
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,000
outside the window to close it. And what

268
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
this will do is insert a link right here

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,079
that once your recipients click it. This

270
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
is similar to a dedicated scheduling

271
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,079
tool such as Calendarly, except you now

272
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,959
no longer need to use a separate

273
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,880
dedicated app, much less pay for it. And

274
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
what you see here is exactly the time

275
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
slots that I designated were

276
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
possibilities for me that they can now

277
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,160
choose from. There's one more incredibly

278
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
useful feature in Notion Mail that I

279
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,959
want to show you, which is snippets. So,

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm going to open up the command

281
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,040
dialogue with command K. Start typing

282
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
snippets. You can see it's right there.

283
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,800
And what this allows you to do is to

284
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
pre-write. You can think of them as

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,720
templates, common emails that you send,

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,320
for example, to reply to a common kind

287
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
of message that you receive. So, let's

288
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
go ahead and do the one for Zoom links.

289
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm going to click here and say edit.

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,600
And all this is is a simple line saying

291
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
here's my Zoom link. instead of having

292
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
to go open up Zoom, navigate to the

293
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,720
settings, find my personal meeting link

294
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,279
every single time. No, I'm just going to

295
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,800
paste my Zoom link right here. And then

296
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,839
for the shortcut, I think I'll just make

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,920
it forward sloom and then hit save. So,

298
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,320
let's say I have an email that we are

299
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,200
corresponding on. I can hit return to

300
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,200
reply and just do forward slash zoom.

301
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
You can see this the snippet

302
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
autocompletes and pops up right there. I

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
can click it with my mouse or just hit

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,519
return. And instantly that entire

305
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,839
snippet, that entire template gets

306
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,320
inserted into the message. And I notice

307
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,800
that this is the first time I need to

308
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,760
leave the notion ecosystem, which is to

309
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,160
check my instant messages among the team

310
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
on Google chat. So now it's lunchtime.

311
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
I'm about to head off to get something

312
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
to eat. And by the way, if you want this

313
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,279
exact notion setup for yourself, check

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,079
out our official Second Brain Notion

315
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:14,399
template. Over 1,500 people are already

316
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,399
using it to manage their notes and

317
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,519
productivity. All

318
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:24,639
right, I am back from lunch. I know from

319
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,519
my morning review earlier that I have

320
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,680
one meeting this afternoon, which is to

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,240
talk about our website redesign. So,

322
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll go ahead and go over to Notion

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
calendar. So, I can see my meeting right

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,760
here. I'll go ahead and click it. And

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,839
then the join Zoom meeting button is

326
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,000
right there. And typically what I'll do

327
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
is as the meeting is happening, I'll

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,440
take the notes directly in my daily

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,959
pages. For now, I want to use the daily

330
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
page for today as just a kind of

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,959
temporary scratch pad so I don't have to

332
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,959
decide up front where this information

333
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,760
goes. All right, the meeting has just

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,160
ended. And as you can see here, I just

335
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,079
took a few notes around pending

336
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
decisions such as deciding between

337
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,800
WordPress and Web Flow. However, what I

338
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
also want to do is head over to my AI

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,279
meeting notetaker, which is Otter. I'm

340
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
going to go ahead and copy the summary

341
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
which has been generated using AI right

342
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,200
here, what we discussed and what the

343
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
action items were. And I'll head back

344
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,519
over to Notion and paste it right down

345
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,000
here just so that I have a more

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,959
comprehensive summary if I need it. All

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,959
right, it's now almost 2:00. I have just

348
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
about 20 minutes before I need to pick

349
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,480
up the kids from school. Let's see what

350
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
quick tasks I can tick off in that time

351
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,120
frame. Let me see if there's anything

352
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,519
quick here that I can make progress on.

353
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,040
I do have a note here that I added a few

354
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,000
days ago, which is let's see, ah, a

355
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,480
breakdown of what we plan to cover in

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,440
our upcoming interviews. What I might do

357
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,320
is I'm going to add an AI block to say

358
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:04,560
write a hook and introduction to an

359
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,480
indepth interview on the master prompt

360
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,320
method. So notice that it has the

361
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,839
context to know I actually want to get

362
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,839
the team's feedback on this. Please

363
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:18,000
Nikolai give me your thoughts on the

364
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
above. And that's now going to tag him

365
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,480
and he'll add his own comments and

366
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,000
edits. I'll go ahead and close this. And

367
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,639
we didn't really cover this, but you can

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,199
also take a a wider a broader

369
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,040
perspective on your priorities. Once a

370
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
month or a quarter or a year, you may

371
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,079
want to really zoom out. This is

372
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,760
something I recommend you do actually,

373
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
and think holistically about these

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,839
different hats you wear, these different

375
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,000
important domains of your life. By

376
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,560
clicking into these, you'll notice that

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,399
you can link to various projects. You

378
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
can create new projects. You could link

379
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
to certain daily pages where you've

380
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,399
taken notes or certain specific tasks.

381
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,320
You could add a deadline. Say you may

382
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,240
want to revisit this area of your life

383
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
on a certain basis by a certain time

384
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
with a certain frequency. The same is

385
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,279
true of resources. Let's say that you

386
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
have things you're researching or

387
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
learning or just kind of keeping content

388
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,279
and notes about. And then finally, if

389
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
you're familiar with my parah method,

390
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
the archive is projects, areas, and

391
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
resources. the previous three categories

392
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,000
up here, but anything from those

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
categories that is no longer

394
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,199
active. After the kids have gone to bed,

395
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I want to end the day intentionally. So,

396
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,120
I'm going through my shutdown checklist

397
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,959
in my daily page. I want to capture a

398
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
quick win from the day to appreciate

399
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,120
what I got done. Next, I'll take a look

400
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
at my calendar for tomorrow and for the

401
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,360
rest of the week. Is there anything I

402
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,519
need to move or take action on? Next,

403
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,199
I'll check my notes inbox and process

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,199
any notes that I've saved throughout the

405
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,519
day. That means I'll assign notes to a

406
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,760
project, area, or resource to get them

407
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,480
out of the inbox. Finally, I'll clear my

408
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,800
task inbox and assign due on dates or

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,199
deadlines to any tasks and then relate

410
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,560
them to either a project or an area.

411
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,639
Now, I can

412
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,839
relax. So, did I manage to spend my

413
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
entire workday inside notion? Mostly. I

414
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,079
was surprised how much I could get done

415
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
within notion. I barely touched any

416
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,560
other app today except for Google Chat

417
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
and my browser. I feel like this

418
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
actually helped me stay more focused. I

419
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,800
wasn't jumping between tabs or apps or

420
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,519
wondering where to put things. I just

421
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
opened Notion and it worked. I can see

422
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
the need for other apps sometimes,

423
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,440
especially, for example, Google Docs or

424
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,600
Google Sheets. But you can also easily

425
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
link those from within notion. If you

426
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,800
want to use this exact setup, you can

427
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
get the second brain notion template

428
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,320
using the link in the description. It

429
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,120
includes everything you saw in this

430
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,839
video. The paramethod structure, daily

431
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,560
pages with built-in checklists, a quick

432
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,440
capture inbox, and a flexible system for

433
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,759
tracking projects, tasks, notes, and

434
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,079
habits, and even more that I didn't even

435
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,720
get to cover. You'll also get access to

436
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,560
stepbystep walkthrough videos that show

437
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
you how to set it up, how to customize

438
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
it, how to make it your own. It doesn't

439
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
matter if you're brand new to Notion, or

440
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,520
you're already deep in it. This template

441
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,160
that we've created can help you build a

442
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,400
second brain that actually supports you

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,640
in your day-to-day work and life. I

444
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:19,999
invite you to try it out.
