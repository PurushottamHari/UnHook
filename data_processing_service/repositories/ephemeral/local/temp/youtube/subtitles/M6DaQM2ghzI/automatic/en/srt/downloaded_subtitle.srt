1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,040
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So is

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,440
radiation leaking?  At least

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,240
explode the bomb that America dropped yesterday, this is just the name.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,439
Break it, right?  If you want to break it, you will break it.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,359
So explode it, but is the bomb that you dropped

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,880
leaking radiation?  So today we will talk about this

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,840
and I will tell you that if we

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,079
drop an A bomb, can the nuclear bomb not explode

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,000
?  So it is dangerous that you are

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,520
dropping a bomb at a nuclear site.  So that

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
means a nuclear explosion can happen.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
So why doesn't this happen?  Today we will

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,840
learn a little about bombs and

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,399
see many other things.  So

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
basically three facilities have been attacked.

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,280
And yesterday the Pentagon told everything that it

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
took an 18-hour flight.  Everyone was sitting in the situation room.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
And then we

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,000
attacked with Diego Garcia, we

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
named it Operation Midnight Hammer,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
he told all this and after that there was a shower of

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,000
flowers on Donald Trump.  He

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,479
said, look,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
all the planes have now come out of Iran's airspace.

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,720
Anyway, Iran did not fire a single missile.  Is it

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
okay?  Now one thing,

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,280
although I will take a separate lecture in this, is there a

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,680
possibility that they have

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
shifted their entire nuclear arsenal.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
So all this said, a big congratulations to our American

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,320
warriors.  So,

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,799
all this is over.  The whole meaning was shown

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,439
here from satellite that how the bunker full of

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,360
bombs went inside and you know

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,759
what happened after that.  So you can comfortably pause it and

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,439
watch it and let me tell you that you can use our

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
combo of Chanakya Niti and Personality

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,560
Development.   The

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
link is given in the description comment box.

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,880
Both of these are available for â‚¹500 also.  So

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,600
now friends, what is there is a fear.  The fear is

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,560
that some radiation may leak.

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,680
This fear still persists.  Now let us

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
talk about what IAEA has to say on this.  So

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
first of all, I have told you about nuclear endeavour many

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
times.  Let me tell you again.   There

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,600
is nothing in it.  That very curd,

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,920
extracting butter from your cream is called that only.  So the

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,599
cream is yours U238, extract U235 from it.  U235 is

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
basically the best material for your bombs.  It is

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,800
unstable, right?  So now

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,800

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
uranium is used in nuclear enrichment, nuclear weapons and also in civil nuclear power plants.  So this

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
differentiates the two.  Is it okay?

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
What will happen to nuclear weapons and

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
civil nuclear power plant

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,160
centrifuges if they continue running.  Let's

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,840
assume that you have achieved nuclear penetration by 20 to 30%.  The

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
enrichment has been done.

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
Your uranium came out.  So what happens now is that

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,840
once your work of generating electricity is done,

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
you will turn off the centrifuge.

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,400
But if it keeps going, it keeps going and it will keep getting

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
enriched, keep churning,

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
the more you churn the

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,920
better you will get and a time will come

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,720
when 100% enrichment will be done, meaning you will

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,640
not get butter, after this it is the same that

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,879
when it comes to such a thing then you

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,000
can make nuclear bomb or atom bomb

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,400
and even if you enrich it up to 60% then also you

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
can make a bomb.  Ok?  Even if it is not of that intensity,

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
you can still make a bomb.  So

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
these are high enriched uranium

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,440
nuclear weapons and a low enriched

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,840
uranium civil power plant.  This is not very much

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,640
because uranium is a radioactive

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
material and you get so much energy from it, that

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
means you can assume that

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
now the European nations are

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
running on nuclear power plants.  Japan is

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,680
working on nuclear power plants.  We are walking on coal.

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
So, firstly, there is absolutely no damage to your environment in this.   There is

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
zero environmental damage.  Is it okay

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,840
?  So, if you want to go zero carbon then

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,480
you should go towards nuclear energy as much as possible.

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,920
Now this gives nuclear energy, this is

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,480
IAAEAaa.  Is it okay?  You sign the NPT and they will

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,720
provide you with the rest of the technology to

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,360
generate electricity.  But they make sure

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,599
that you only produce electricity and do not make bombs.  So

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Iran, North Korea, Israel all of them

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,239
made the bomb.  Ok?  So this is it.  Now Iran

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,599
and North Korea had signed the NPT.

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,799
So uranium is available in the form of U238 and U235.

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,879

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
It is heavier than U235 and U238.  This is stable.

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,560
Now many people say that Uranium 238 is of no

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
use.  Hey my brother this is more

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
stable.  It is more abundant.  You will

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,760
get it easily and it is used to generate electricity.

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,479
But when you make this bomb,

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639
only U 235 will be used.  And you know

109
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
it breaks down into barium and krypton, and

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
then three neutrons, which means it keeps

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
multiplying, a chain reaction.  Now

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
if you control it then

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,880
it will become your nuclear reactor and if it is

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
uncontrolled then it will become an atom bomb.  So

115
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
it will continuously multiply as long as there is

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,360
fuel in it.  So it has amazing

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,479
energy releasing properties.

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,600
Right?  So talking about U235, this

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,600
mind uranium is then

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
converted into uranium hexa fluoride.  Well,

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
this is what I am afraid of.  There is a fear of its leak

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
and it is physically separated.

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,479
Look, U235 is uranium

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,560
and the rest U235, U238 are all brothers.

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
Meaning these are isotopes.

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
What are isotopes?  All of them are brothers.  Just like

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
every element has an isotope.  Like

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
hydrogen, the first atomic

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
number of hydrogen is one.  Ok?  So now there are three isotopes of hydrogen:

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
protium, tritium and deuterium.

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,960
And let me tell you, just like we

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
drink H2O, we drink water.  It has an

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
isotope called D2.  This is called heavy water.

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
It is used in nuclear reactors

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680
to control the reaction.  So

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
what happens now is that these are deuterium isotopes,

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
meaning same atomic number but

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
different mass number.  Is it okay?  Meaning the atomic

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
number composition is same.  Ok?  Brother is standing

140
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,280
but his body structure will be

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,120
different.  Ok?  So suppose if you have to

142
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,039
run very fast then you call the lighter brother.  If you want to

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
fight then

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
call your heavier brother.  So this is something like this

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
you get to see here.  So there are two common

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
methods of uran enrichment.  One is

147
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
gaseous diffusion and the other is

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,800
centrifugation.  Centrifugation is the

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,120
best method.  With this

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,440
your nuclear enrichment can be achieved easily.

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
So, I have already told you the same thing.

152
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,600
So fuznable, well look

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,840
what fuzz is is that this large molecule is

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,639
broken down.  Is it okay?  It breaks and

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
releases tremendous energy and

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
then a chain reaction starts.

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
Its opposite is fusion.

158
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,680
I have already told you this many times.  Ok?  So

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,160
this is the thing.  So even if you enrich yourself by 3 to 5%,

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,720
that is enough.  Your electricity

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,800
works great.  But 90% is usually 60% but ideally

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,960
if you reach 90%.  Like India,

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
all the nuclear nations do not

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,280
shut down their centrifuges.

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Ok?  So 90% means you have

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,240
made a great bomb.  Ok?  Now, in the attack that has happened, there is a

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,319
fear that

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
nuclear radiation might be leaking.  Now

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,120
friends, let me tell you one thing.  Is

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,120
n't it?  This is true.  But no

171
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
radiation leak has been detected yet.

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,280
This has been said by the IAEA.  Ok?  Now

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,160
friends, what happens here is that you must be thinking

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,160
that brother, the

175
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
bomb has been dropped then why is the nuclear bomb not exploding.

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,800
Ok?  This is also a bomb, right?  So

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
instead of the cotton bomb, hit with a firecracker.  So

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,240
if that factory catches fire then all the

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
bombs will explode simultaneously.  Ok?  Everything will

180
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
catch fire.  But why doesn't this happen in this

181
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,080
?  Iran has also said that there is no such problem right now.

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
So friends, this

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
happens because nuclear weapon is different from ordinary bomb.  In

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,120
traditional bombs,

185
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,479
do they contain Chemical X, like your

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,880
TAT Tri Nitro Toluene, that is a chemical

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,680
bomb RDX.  Ok?  What are all these

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,080
?  These are different types of bombs.  These

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,520
may be chemical explosives.  Now

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,440
when will this terrible impact happen because of this?  When you

191
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
detonate them.  Ok?  There is a time bomb,

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,759
they detonate it with a remote.

193
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,240
This is how you press TAT, it is

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,720
used for mining winning.  Or you will

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,039
give them energy.  Ok?  Or these

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
grenades will hit very fast.  Ok?  They kill me.  The

197
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,599
friction makes them strong and

198
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,360
then they burst.  Isn't it?

199
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,840
But even in the

200
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
explosive there is a

201
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
secondary blast.  Like when India

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
fired a missile, brother, their ordnance

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,360
factor, wherever the bombs were present, they would have exploded.

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
But a nuclear bomb is entirely different.

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,319
Massive energy from a nuclear bomb means that

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,120

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,599
you will experience massive energy in a thousandth part of a second, which means in a very short time.

208
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
You will not be able to even blink your eyes and I mean

209
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,520
if a nuclear bomb explodes somewhere, someone will

210
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
not even blink his eyes, he will be destroyed.

211
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,759
He will die before he can even realize it.  Do

212
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,280
you understand?  There is so much horror in it.

213
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,160
So these are mid air detonates.  There was

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,720
no impact, that when there

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
was friction here, these got detonated.  It's

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,800
not like that.  Are you understanding?  So when these blasts happen in mid-air or due to

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,839
tremendous electromagnetic radiation,

218
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,080
they do not detonate like this.

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760
Now, it is obvious that the nuclear material present here

220
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,159

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,880

222
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,040
cannot detonate like this even if there is an accidental strike on it.  Proper

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
conditions are needed so that the chain reaction can

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,080
initiate.  The

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,880
chain reaction initiates here only under proper precise conditions

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
and has nothing to do with stress, shock or

227
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
external strike.   So

228
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,360
that is why when we attacked Noor Khan Base,

229
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,480
just by attacking there would not be a nuclear explosion.

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,040
That bomb will never explode.  Ok?

231
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,680
So this is the thing.  Now friends what is the problem

232
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
?  Friends, the problem that arises is the same as what

233
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
we told you about uranium hexafluoride.

234
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
This UF6 is correct, isn't it? This fluoride is

235
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,560
correct, isn't it? Group 17 element and this

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
fluorine is not that crop broid fluorine

237
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,040
chlorine, so in this nuclear explosion,

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,440
this UF6 is

239
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,000
in gaseous form and

240
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,880
like many radioactive substances, brother, if you

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
store it in UF6 form, it can leak, it can become

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,760
dust, this nuclear

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,480
dust can leak and that too is

244
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,320
very dangerous if you

245
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
do anything related to nuclear because what happens in it

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
brother?  What is radioactivity

247
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600
?  Alpha, Beta, Gamma.  Ok?  So gamma

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,800
radiation is very dangerous.  It

249
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,800
can damage your DNA.  Cancer is the most

250
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,519
dangerous death, friends, due to radiation.

251
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,920
The most dangerous.  Radiation means if you

252
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,720
ask me what are the top 10 deaths?

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,800
Actually it is very dangerous.  But

254
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
you will feel the radiation if you consume radiation.

255
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,600
You will feel wow!  I had fun.  very nice.   Will

256
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
you run in a totally fit Salman Khan style?

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
You will say wow!  In Tom Cruise style it has

258
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,399
never felt this good.  But the next

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,120
day your body starts melting.  Your flesh

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,519
starts melting.  From cancer to who knows

261
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,160
what else.  So that is why this is very

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,800
dangerous.  Okay friend, I know the

263
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,959
camera went off twice.  Ok?  Twice and my

264
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,760
mood gets so spoiled because I do it

265
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,600
in one take.  Now after that the camera went

266
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,440
off.  Isn't it?  I don't know what the

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,560
problem is.  I tried using two-three cameras.  It happens

268
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,560
and then the flow is broken.

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,920
So that's it.  So now here, for example, in

270
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,000
Chernobyl, in 1986, you see,

271
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
when the nuclear leak happened in Chernobyl, now

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
in Chernobyl, it was like that

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,120
when the nuclear dust was removed, those who removed it knew that we would

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,839
never come back.  Salute to Russia

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,399
brother, they took away their coal miners

276
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
120 people, we knew that we will die.  We are

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
not coming back.  But still

278
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,839
he did this for the world.  Otherwise this

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
nuclear radiation would have spread all over the world.

280
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
This is the nationalism of Russia.

281
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
After that, whatever happened in Fukushima in 2011, there too, there was a

282
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,320
huge danger of nuclear radiation

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
when tsunami hit Japan.  Then recently

284
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
when Russia attacked the Zafolissia power plant.

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
You know Ukraine could also have been a

286
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
nuclear power.  He

287
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
could have acquired nuclear weapons.  But

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,920
because of Russia, Ukraine did this because all the

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
nuclear weapons that Russia had in Ukraine were there.  The

290
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
Soviet Union was very big, so they had

291
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,880
abandoned everything.  So when the attack happened here, there was

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,880
a huge fear.  But the

293
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
good thing is that it was just said at Noor Khan airbase as

294
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
well that these were seen from the Boron plane,

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,680
look, I will not completely deny

296
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,600
that it might have happened at Noor Khan base

297
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,079
because these things are not disclosed so that there is

298
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,600
no panic, things are settled quietly.

299
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,160
Now IAEA has confirmed

300
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,959
that there is some radiation level and

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,040
till now in the new report Iran has also said that there is no

302
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,279
radiation.  There will be no harm to public health.

303
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Now I don't know how much of this is true.

304
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,680
But because IAEA is

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,360
confirming it, then we can count on it

306
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
and even if there is a little bit,

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
still IAEA is saying this, then it will go and do its

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
job, so there is nothing to be afraid of,

309
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
but still now Russia is also saying

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
that we will give our nuclear bomb, now let's

311
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
see what happens, rest you

312
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,720
can read our course, the

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,720
link is given in the description comment box, thank you so

314
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
much.
