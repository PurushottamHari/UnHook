I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So is radiation leaking?  At least explode the bomb that America dropped yesterday, this is just the name. Break it, right?  If you want to break it, you will break it. So explode it, but is the bomb that you dropped leaking radiation?  So today we will talk about this and I will tell you that if we drop an A bomb, can the nuclear bomb not explode ?  So it is dangerous that you are dropping a bomb at a nuclear site.  So that means a nuclear explosion can happen. So why doesn't this happen?  Today we will learn a little about bombs and see many other things.  So basically three facilities have been attacked. And yesterday the Pentagon told everything that it took an 18-hour flight.  Everyone was sitting in the situation room. And then we attacked with Diego Garcia, we named it Operation Midnight Hammer, he told all this and after that there was a shower of flowers on Donald Trump.  He said, look, all the planes have now come out of Iran's airspace. Anyway, Iran did not fire a single missile.  Is it okay?  Now one thing, although I will take a separate lecture in this, is there a possibility that they have shifted their entire nuclear arsenal. So all this said, a big congratulations to our American warriors.  So, all this is over.  The whole meaning was shown here from satellite that how the bunker full of bombs went inside and you know what happened after that.  So you can comfortably pause it and watch it and let me tell you that you can use our combo of Chanakya Niti and Personality Development.   The link is given in the description comment box. Both of these are available for â‚¹500 also.  So now friends, what is there is a fear.  The fear is that some radiation may leak. This fear still persists.  Now let us talk about what IAEA has to say on this.  So first of all, I have told you about nuclear endeavour many times.  Let me tell you again.   There is nothing in it.  That very curd, extracting butter from your cream is called that only.  So the cream is yours U238, extract U235 from it.  U235 is basically the best material for your bombs.  It is unstable, right?  So now uranium is used in nuclear enrichment, nuclear weapons and also in civil nuclear power plants.  So this differentiates the two.  Is it okay? What will happen to nuclear weapons and civil nuclear power plant centrifuges if they continue running.  Let's assume that you have achieved nuclear penetration by 20 to 30%.  The enrichment has been done. Your uranium came out.  So what happens now is that once your work of generating electricity is done, you will turn off the centrifuge. But if it keeps going, it keeps going and it will keep getting enriched, keep churning, the more you churn the better you will get and a time will come when 100% enrichment will be done, meaning you will not get butter, after this it is the same that when it comes to such a thing then you can make nuclear bomb or atom bomb and even if you enrich it up to 60% then also you can make a bomb.  Ok?  Even if it is not of that intensity, you can still make a bomb.  So these are high enriched uranium nuclear weapons and a low enriched uranium civil power plant.  This is not very much because uranium is a radioactive material and you get so much energy from it, that means you can assume that now the European nations are running on nuclear power plants.  Japan is working on nuclear power plants.  We are walking on coal. So, firstly, there is absolutely no damage to your environment in this.   There is zero environmental damage.  Is it okay ?  So, if you want to go zero carbon then you should go towards nuclear energy as much as possible. Now this gives nuclear energy, this is IAAEAaa.  Is it okay?  You sign the NPT and they will provide you with the rest of the technology to generate electricity.  But they make sure that you only produce electricity and do not make bombs.  So Iran, North Korea, Israel all of them made the bomb.  Ok?  So this is it.  Now Iran and North Korea had signed the NPT. So uranium is available in the form of U238 and U235. It is heavier than U235 and U238.  This is stable. Now many people say that Uranium 238 is of no use.  Hey my brother this is more stable.  It is more abundant.  You will get it easily and it is used to generate electricity. But when you make this bomb, only U 235 will be used.  And you know it breaks down into barium and krypton, and then three neutrons, which means it keeps multiplying, a chain reaction.  Now if you control it then it will become your nuclear reactor and if it is uncontrolled then it will become an atom bomb.  So it will continuously multiply as long as there is fuel in it.  So it has amazing energy releasing properties. Right?  So talking about U235, this mind uranium is then converted into uranium hexa fluoride.  Well, this is what I am afraid of.  There is a fear of its leak and it is physically separated. Look, U235 is uranium and the rest U235, U238 are all brothers. Meaning these are isotopes. What are isotopes?  All of them are brothers.  Just like every element has an isotope.  Like hydrogen, the first atomic number of hydrogen is one.  Ok?  So now there are three isotopes of hydrogen: protium, tritium and deuterium. And let me tell you, just like we drink H2O, we drink water.  It has an isotope called D2.  This is called heavy water. It is used in nuclear reactors to control the reaction.  So what happens now is that these are deuterium isotopes, meaning same atomic number but different mass number.  Is it okay?  Meaning the atomic number composition is same.  Ok?  Brother is standing but his body structure will be different.  Ok?  So suppose if you have to run very fast then you call the lighter brother.  If you want to fight then call your heavier brother.  So this is something like this you get to see here.  So there are two common methods of uran enrichment.  One is gaseous diffusion and the other is centrifugation.  Centrifugation is the best method.  With this your nuclear enrichment can be achieved easily. So, I have already told you the same thing. So fuznable, well look what fuzz is is that this large molecule is broken down.  Is it okay?  It breaks and releases tremendous energy and then a chain reaction starts. Its opposite is fusion. I have already told you this many times.  Ok?  So this is the thing.  So even if you enrich yourself by 3 to 5%, that is enough.  Your electricity works great.  But 90% is usually 60% but ideally if you reach 90%.  Like India, all the nuclear nations do not shut down their centrifuges. Ok?  So 90% means you have made a great bomb.  Ok?  Now, in the attack that has happened, there is a fear that nuclear radiation might be leaking.  Now friends, let me tell you one thing.  Is n't it?  This is true.  But no radiation leak has been detected yet. This has been said by the IAEA.  Ok?  Now friends, what happens here is that you must be thinking that brother, the bomb has been dropped then why is the nuclear bomb not exploding. Ok?  This is also a bomb, right?  So instead of the cotton bomb, hit with a firecracker.  So if that factory catches fire then all the bombs will explode simultaneously.  Ok?  Everything will catch fire.  But why doesn't this happen in this ?  Iran has also said that there is no such problem right now. So friends, this happens because nuclear weapon is different from ordinary bomb.  In traditional bombs, do they contain Chemical X, like your TAT Tri Nitro Toluene, that is a chemical bomb RDX.  Ok?  What are all these ?  These are different types of bombs.  These may be chemical explosives.  Now when will this terrible impact happen because of this?  When you detonate them.  Ok?  There is a time bomb, they detonate it with a remote. This is how you press TAT, it is used for mining winning.  Or you will give them energy.  Ok?  Or these grenades will hit very fast.  Ok?  They kill me.  The friction makes them strong and then they burst.  Isn't it? But even in the explosive there is a secondary blast.  Like when India fired a missile, brother, their ordnance factor, wherever the bombs were present, they would have exploded. But a nuclear bomb is entirely different. Massive energy from a nuclear bomb means that you will experience massive energy in a thousandth part of a second, which means in a very short time. You will not be able to even blink your eyes and I mean if a nuclear bomb explodes somewhere, someone will not even blink his eyes, he will be destroyed. He will die before he can even realize it.  Do you understand?  There is so much horror in it. So these are mid air detonates.  There was no impact, that when there was friction here, these got detonated.  It's not like that.  Are you understanding?  So when these blasts happen in mid-air or due to tremendous electromagnetic radiation, they do not detonate like this. Now, it is obvious that the nuclear material present here cannot detonate like this even if there is an accidental strike on it.  Proper conditions are needed so that the chain reaction can initiate.  The chain reaction initiates here only under proper precise conditions and has nothing to do with stress, shock or external strike.   So that is why when we attacked Noor Khan Base, just by attacking there would not be a nuclear explosion. That bomb will never explode.  Ok? So this is the thing.  Now friends what is the problem ?  Friends, the problem that arises is the same as what we told you about uranium hexafluoride. This UF6 is correct, isn't it? This fluoride is correct, isn't it? Group 17 element and this fluorine is not that crop broid fluorine chlorine, so in this nuclear explosion, this UF6 is in gaseous form and like many radioactive substances, brother, if you store it in UF6 form, it can leak, it can become dust, this nuclear dust can leak and that too is very dangerous if you do anything related to nuclear because what happens in it brother?  What is radioactivity ?  Alpha, Beta, Gamma.  Ok?  So gamma radiation is very dangerous.  It can damage your DNA.  Cancer is the most dangerous death, friends, due to radiation. The most dangerous.  Radiation means if you ask me what are the top 10 deaths? Actually it is very dangerous.  But you will feel the radiation if you consume radiation. You will feel wow!  I had fun.  very nice.   Will you run in a totally fit Salman Khan style? You will say wow!  In Tom Cruise style it has never felt this good.  But the next day your body starts melting.  Your flesh starts melting.  From cancer to who knows what else.  So that is why this is very dangerous.  Okay friend, I know the camera went off twice.  Ok?  Twice and my mood gets so spoiled because I do it in one take.  Now after that the camera went off.  Isn't it?  I don't know what the problem is.  I tried using two-three cameras.  It happens and then the flow is broken. So that's it.  So now here, for example, in Chernobyl, in 1986, you see, when the nuclear leak happened in Chernobyl, now in Chernobyl, it was like that when the nuclear dust was removed, those who removed it knew that we would never come back.  Salute to Russia brother, they took away their coal miners 120 people, we knew that we will die.  We are not coming back.  But still he did this for the world.  Otherwise this nuclear radiation would have spread all over the world. This is the nationalism of Russia. After that, whatever happened in Fukushima in 2011, there too, there was a huge danger of nuclear radiation when tsunami hit Japan.  Then recently when Russia attacked the Zafolissia power plant. You know Ukraine could also have been a nuclear power.  He could have acquired nuclear weapons.  But because of Russia, Ukraine did this because all the nuclear weapons that Russia had in Ukraine were there.  The Soviet Union was very big, so they had abandoned everything.  So when the attack happened here, there was a huge fear.  But the good thing is that it was just said at Noor Khan airbase as well that these were seen from the Boron plane, look, I will not completely deny that it might have happened at Noor Khan base because these things are not disclosed so that there is no panic, things are settled quietly. Now IAEA has confirmed that there is some radiation level and till now in the new report Iran has also said that there is no radiation.  There will be no harm to public health. Now I don't know how much of this is true. But because IAEA is confirming it, then we can count on it and even if there is a little bit, still IAEA is saying this, then it will go and do its job, so there is nothing to be afraid of, but still now Russia is also saying that we will give our nuclear bomb, now let's see what happens, rest you can read our course, the link is given in the description comment box, thank you so much.
