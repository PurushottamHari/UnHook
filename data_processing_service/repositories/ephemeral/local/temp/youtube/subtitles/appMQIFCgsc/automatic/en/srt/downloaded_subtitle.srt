1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,680
Praful bhai is faster than a drone.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,000

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,639
Read carefully the news which makes you upset.  Get the full perspective.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,880
What did you say?  Anything which

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,160
feels like it is hurting me.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,240
Meaning, there is something wrong with it.  Will you ever

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,240
enter politics?

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
In today's times, journalists around the world are

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
a little afraid to present their opinions.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
That's why we see less opinions.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
Correct.  Threats and all will continue and

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
we will not be afraid of them.  Because brother, in the

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,440
end the thing is, look, I follow

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,000
our freedom fighters.  Many people are

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,200
alive in our hearts even after their death and

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,200
many people died while they were alive.

[Music]

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,600
Praful bhai welcome to The Ranveer Show and

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,159
to The Internet and general how are you bhai, absolutely

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,360
great bhai, I am happy, I am good and it feels good

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,759
 

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
when people are talking about the country.

23
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,280
Now India is waking up.  Patriotism

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,119
is awakening.  So it feels great to see this and it is

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
important to stay awake more.  That's all I would

26
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
like to say.  Praful bhai is faster than a

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,640
drone.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,880
How did you feel about that comment?  Friend, when people

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
made that comment, I enjoyed hearing it.  Because I was

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
not able to realise it.  I mean what are you doing

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
brother?  It seemed very simple that

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
brother this news has come.

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,600
A fake narrative of Pakistan has been created in this.  Have to save.  I

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
just went and said it.  But when people

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,799
told me that Mama called.  Mummy says that

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,720
brothers are saying that their family members are

37
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
considering them terrorists, that brother, are

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,119
you yourself a terrorist that you are

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,040
bringing it before the news media and serving it on a platter like this.

40
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
But brother, do you know

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
when do we get to know all these things?  This becomes known only

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,520
when it happens.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,640
During this entire face, you are in the zone, that is my

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
assumption.  You were at it.  Yes dear.  I was

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
getting the news from somewhere and you are published.

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.  But what was the process itself?  Because

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
recently I spoke to Palki Sharma.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,200
And he said that his approach

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
in the first post was that they were going

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
slow and study.  Because

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
news was coming from so many different directions.  They were

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
trying to figure out what was true and what was

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,480
not.  So I am wondering

54
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,720
where did Praful bhai get this skill from?

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Like, how did you figure this out?  When you know

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
main stream news channels may not be able

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
to figure it out easily.  Brother, I kept it very simple,

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,160
followed the startup ecosystem,

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
bring the proof, bring two-way authentication

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
and print it.  Make a simple video.   I

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,599
had communication skills so I told him.  But how did you find out

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,599
?  Did two things.  Brother, the first thing I

63
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
did was Aadhar card verification.  Ok

64
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,720
?  That you are sending this to me that

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
this attack happened at this place, so is this a WhatsApp

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,840
forward or not?  So how will we find out

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
brother?  It is quite simple.  Please send me your

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
Aadhar card.  You have the guts to

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
send the Aadhaar card.  So, there

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
is some truth in what you say.  Now it can also be used.

71
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
Aadhar card can be sent as fake.  It

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
could be sent by someone else.  So there will

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,280
be a video call where my team will

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,319
keep their cameras turned off.  Your camera will be on.  The face

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,200
should match with the Aadhar card.  Now

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,840
both these things have matched.  After that we

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,440
will judge your video and then take it forward

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,360
to the country.  Ok?  And

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
a group of second Indian Diaspora Abroad was created

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
on WhatsApp.  I was talking to him on an individual level

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
only.  Ok?  That brother,

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
news is banned here but how are they

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
reporting what happened in UP,

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
what happened in Bihar, as these

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
news channels of Pakistan,

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,959
what are the news channels of Pakistan reporting

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
about India, it was also

88
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
necessary to bring that, so they sent from there but

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,599
with them also we kept doing verification of everything on the same passport

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,840

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
because whenever the country trusts, it cannot be

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
broken under any circumstances and what

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,879
you said about Palak ma'am that you went

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,519
very slowly and understood the news completely, I

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,480
learned a lot of things from Palak ma'am also

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
in this whole process like

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
how to use roasting sarcasm without raising voice

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
like I am telling you the truth, look a person should

99
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,840
know his mistake, I made a mistake,

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,919
okay what was the mistake, brother I was getting angry, I was

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160

102
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,479
getting very angry on asking about children dying, so once or

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,960
twice my voice got louder but when I saw Palak ma'am

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,840
learning that brother Virat Kohli one less

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,919
century, okay, I learned from there friend like this when

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
one of mine went very viral that

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,600
I made a video  I was saying,

108
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
brother, we have a habit of asking

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,320
what was happening in our Pakistan?  I

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
said my Pakistan, I said no,

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Pakistan is not mine.  So he said it and then he

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,199
said but he said it lovingly and softly,

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
brothers have picked it up.  Are we okay?  So, I do

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
n't know who was telling me this?  I was

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
not reading the comments at that time.  55

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,400
videos a day is no joke, man.  Meaning

117
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
you don't have time to read the comments.  Ok?  Just research is going on

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
, articles are going on, studies are going on at a

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
speed and content is coming.  Simple that was

121
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
the thing I was trying to know.  I

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,240
think all the Indian Instagram

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,240
users were absorbing the news from your page.

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,639
Which is a crazy

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,320
shift I feel.  See, the thing is that

126
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,240
alternative journalism, as we call

127
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,440
alternative journalists,

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,960
they were doing it because when one

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
goes to a channel in the media, there is a

130
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,280
process for everything in the media.  Ok?  Meaning

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
because he said something.  So as

132
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
we saw that Pakistan showed

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,600
what was being shown on Indian media to

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
its entire foreign diaspora which was there

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
when they were holding their conferences,

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,880
they showed that in front. So whatever we are

137
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,199
able to do on Instagram

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,680
or anywhere, we are able to put the right message of India in a

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,160
fast way and it is good

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,360
that I was able to do something for nation and religion at

141
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,919
the time when the need was the greatest and are you

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,039
happy with the phase you had right

143
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,639
now?  Hey, very nice brother.  Meaning, after one message

144
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,560
arrives, two or three messages arrive.  First comes the

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,320
National Crush of India.  My mom

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,639
sent it.  I said friend what is going on?

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
Ok.  So, one way or the other this operation had already taken place

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
before Indore.  A guy had

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
said, brother I am a boy, if you

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,240
were a girl I would have married you.  Ok.

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,919
So, there's my national crush.  So, I have

152
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
made a video on this.  I said brother, see what may happen.

153
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,400
Bollywood may have said it or not.   The

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,160
national crush is Hrithik Roshan sir.  Ok.

155
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,319
I said this directly in the video.

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,319
And after that, whatever happens at the wide angle, that

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
thing gets spread completely.

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
People started saying that brother, Mummy said about National Crush of

159
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,199
India.  Then

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,560
I get a message from a girl that Praful, there is

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,160
a dance video of my mother and me

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,840
on my personal account in which the song

163
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,000
playing is that you will find a girl for me.

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,160
Mom, if you say such a thing then I am a baniya.  A

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
reply comes from a Baniya girl.  Your mom

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
is talking about me.

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
And I am reading people's messages, so I am reading them

168
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,520
after a long time brother.  That means, go and read

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,759
all the messages that came two days ago on six, seven or eight.

170
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
Brother, half an hour at night is not enough, the

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
whole day is enough, so

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,759
friend, we have to calm our mind and

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,199
prepare for the next day.

174
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
So what is its process? I

175
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
open my personal account.  When I read the message, I

176
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,759
laugh a lot.  I start laughing whenever I keep reading.  It

177
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,759
feels a little bit good.  Then when I

178
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,440
listen to Palki ma’am my day becomes even better.

179
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
Then let's start like this the next day.  That

180
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
is, my intention behind this podcast is

181
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,440
that your name should reach more people

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,759
so that people can understand that there are people like you

183
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
in India.  Absolutely brother, look, tell me two

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
things happen.  News and Opinion.  There

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,479
is one news that comes and tells.  What does Palak ma'am

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
do?  Opinion.  What is the soft

187
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
opinion which we have?  Let the world

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,360
decide.  This is my opinion, you should think about it yourself.

189
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
So that is the thing, thank you for

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
giving this opportunity to reach out to the people and

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
we will continue doing the same in the future as well that this news has come and

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
such opinion can be built on it.  Now you do

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,960
yours.  So it's a division of three

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
things together.  We know, people often do that and

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,800
I am not saying this about people.

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,759
I feel the same problem exists for journalists too.

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,479
In today's times, journalists around the world are

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,440

199
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,479
a little afraid to present their opinions.  Correct?  That's why

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,160
we see less opinions.  Yes.  This allows

201
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,720
interpretations to be

202
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,120
formed in very diverse ways,

203
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
and that would be correct, brother.  Gradually

204
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
people will take inspiration from people and

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
say that just one Ranveer and just one

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
Praful will not achieve anything.  Ok?  So people will

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
gradually learn to form their own opinion.

208
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,120
Like I tell you.  I have a brother who

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
lives in some village.  Behind them, I

210
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
saw the background.  Looked at the ceiling above.  He

211
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
saw my video.  Now there are no English words in my videos.

212
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
In English.

213
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,879
What did he do?  Added subtitles to it

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,319
in Hindi.  And made my own video.

215
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,160
And cast it.  Now, there was not a single like on his video

216
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,000
, not a single comment.

217
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
I picked it up and put it on my story.

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,400
I said now listen to them.  Because brother,

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,919
I have a restriction, my health will get spoiled.

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
If I try to talk in every form, I will

221
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,440
not be able to talk for long.

222
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
Ok?  So my inspiration is

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
Pallaki ma'am, she is talking in a certain way.

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
I am talking in a way.  Now we

225
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,360
also need people who can

226
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,360
talk about this in different languages.  So that is how we will be

227
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,519
able to spread the message.  Hmm.

228
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,120
My hope is that news in 2030 is

229
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,240
mainly dependent on independent

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
journalism.  I hope I can tell you a statement from your podcast

231
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,800
which I listened to.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Was with Nitish Bhai.  Ok?  You

233
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,160
probably asked this question to Nitish Bhai that this is

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,839
mainstream journalism and what are you doing

235
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
?  So Nitish bhai had given such an answer

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,080
that I will never go to main stream journalism

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,080
because I

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,560
make 1 hour in-depth videos after a lot of thinking.

239
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,880
His answer was something like this.  Brother, the thing is that

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
in the coming time two types of things will be

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
seen, brother, one quickly

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,399
tell the opinion as to what it is, like we can form our opinion

243
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
and then the second one will go to

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,519
Nitish Bhai or to other people

245
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,040
like 50 people will come, whatever long form you used to do, if you do it in

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,880
future then from there people

247
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,360
will make their long form opinion that yes now

248
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,600
we have one hour we are on a drive.

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,080
Now let's listen and understand what is going on.

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,640
Brother,

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,000
I am happy that people are

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,760

253
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,040
getting a chance to know the real personality of Praful Bhai through this podcast.

254
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
But I'm also wondering, since you were

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,240
creating so much content during this whole

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,399
conflict, you also

257
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
faced backlash.  Brother, backlash is also called threat,

258
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,279
backlash is also called comments that

259
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,000
fielding is being done against you.

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,560
But Indians themselves caused the backlash?  Yes

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,560
dear.  Of course some of it is definitely

262
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
fueled by the Pakistani side.  Absolutely.

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,680
I can tell you the whole narrative, how

264
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,399
?  Yes, tell me this because effectively I

265
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,000
believe that social media is another

266
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,320
kind of battle field to be one.  And here I

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,640
genuinely felt that you were fighting the most in our entire country.

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,000

269
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,399
Online for A country.  And that

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,880
mission is visible in your Instagram growth.

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,839
So many people supported you.

272
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,560
But at the same time it's crazy for me to

273
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,240
think that you also got hate during all this.

274
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,079
You were releasing content so genuinely.   Were

275
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
spreading the correct news.

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,720
Were spreading real news.

277
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,360
Were spreading global narratives.  A I just don't

278
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
understand why you got hate?

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,720
During the whole phase.  Let's divide

280
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
this whole thing into four.  Sure.  Brother, look, first of all let me

281
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,399
start with why I started.

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
You will be shocked Run Bhai to hear

283
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,640
that I thought only a

284
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,320
90 second reel could be uploaded on Instagram.  When

285
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
I uploaded the first two videos, they came in the

286
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,279
evening on the day of the Pahalgam attack and the

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
second video came at 1:30 in the night.  Brother,

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
when I uploaded the video I was

289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
speaking so fast that I thought I could only

290
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
upload it for 90 seconds.  Then I

291
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
once checked the timing while inserting the bus, to see for

292
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
how many seconds it could be inserted.  I

293
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
said this is 180 seconds.  Meaning we

294
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,519
can put a 3 minute readle.  So let's explain the matter further.

295
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,200
So the first thing is that I did

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
not come here with the thought of

297
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
gaining followers.  Mine was very simple; I have to

298
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,279
save the nation and religion.  I have to save the nation

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,360
as much as I can.  Brother comes

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,519
on the hate.  So the hate started brother when I

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,320
made a statement which is a true statement that

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,760
people of one religion whose population

303
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,079
in India is around 78%, 77% were

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,399
killed after asking about their religion, so when I said this statement,

305
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,079
people said that he is a blind devotee.

306
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
Brother, do you know on which day the sorrow occurred?  I did

307
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,600
not abuse anyone, did not say anything.  I know that

308
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
people have said that this is a sleeper cell

309
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,320
of India.  Just imagine, people sitting in India keep

310
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,240
using the word sleeper cell.  I did

311
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
not react at all to that either.

312
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
Because as long as you are getting trolled then

313
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
understand that you are doing something right.  As

314
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,320
simple as that.  Ok?  So this happened.

315
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,480
After that when the narrative of Operation Sindoor came

316
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
that we did Operation Sindoor, to

317
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,200
tell you the truth, at that time my entire

318
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
proportion of audience suddenly changed because

319
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Pakistanis came on the account.  Because

320
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,639
I just told you one thing that if you abuse then the

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,320
game is over.  If you state your point without abusing then

322
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,480
everyone understands that nothing can be done to

323
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
this person and he will keep telling the truth.

324
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
What do you do the same thing brother?  Ok?

325
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,200
That I don't have any abuse in my mind and I don't want to give it.  The

326
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,760
thing is that when I

327
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
started talking about this entire incident

328
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,320
after Operation Sindoor, many threats came.  That means

329
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,279
my mother, my sister and I were abused.

330
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
All I said was that I understand that you are abusing me.  They are

331
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,440

332
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,000
abusing my country.  That is very wrong.

333
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,959
Nothing will stop because of your abuses because we

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
140-142 crore brothers have to be very honest.  It would be

335
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,519
better if we don't make round figures

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
because we have to feed even 2 crore people.

337
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,639
Water has to be provided to Rs 2 crore also.  So the

338
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,959
thing is that we are 142 crore people.

339
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,880
Ok?  So if we all come together then nothing happens.

340
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,360
All these abusive people are on one

341
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,800
side brother.  Many threats came.  If I

342
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,800
tell you the truth, maybe we did talk

343
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
once in between.  Then it was very clear that

344
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,880
I was not even coming out of my room.  Let

345
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,399
me tell you, I wore the shirt for around 22 days

346
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
because I had only four

347
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
shirts at that time.  Ok?  I have worn them alternately.

348
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
Without washing, without doing anything.  I have

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,639
not left the room.  I have been able to eat whatever has

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
come into the room.  Empty because I

351
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
don't live with my family.  So I ate whatever

352
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
came into the room.  He remained inside the room.  I was

353
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,519
scared to even go to the balcony for a long time.  Ok

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,880
?  So this was the situation.  But they say brother

355
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,639
that a lamp emerges only from the darkness.  I am

356
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,600
not calling myself a lamp but I am calling this country a lamp.

357
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
So this lamp came out and this lamp will keep

358
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,079
coming out.  This lamp will go up now.  It will

359
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
not come down.  So these threats and all will

360
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,639
continue.  And we will not be afraid of this.

361
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,639
Because as I just told you a war is

362
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,959
fought outside.  A war is fought within the country.

363
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,399
A war is fought on social media.

364
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,160
Hmm.  Our soldiers, our

365
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
defense forces are fighting outside.  Inside, our

366
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,240
government, our internal security

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,399
advisors are fighting.

368
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
You and I are fighting on social media.  People know me for the

369
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
fact that

370
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,800
something happened between India and Pakistan.  This guy came.  This

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,800
said, this probably covers everything.

372
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,519
Whatever words are being used, it becomes a viral sensation.

373
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,920
over now.  Brother, the story started from here

374
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,079
because since then

375
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,079
many people have died in India.  So the story does

376
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,920
not end here.  People will say that a Hindu has

377
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
awakened.  So yes, definitely a Hindu has awakened

378
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,440
but first an Indian has awakened.  Firstly,

379
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,839
if someone has a problem with Hindustan World, then

380
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
I say it for their happiness

381
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
because I have nothing against any religion.

382
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,680
Many of my

383
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,480
students come from every religion.  This is an Indian

384
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,320
place and this Indian place will not sleep because

385
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,360
people like you and many others will keep supporting it.

386
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,560
 

387
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,079
What kind of content is India hungry for?

388
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,480
Maybe you can give the correct answer to this.  I hope

389
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,800
India is hungry for research based content like what

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
you are doing.  Now I am starting it

391
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
brother.  What I am starting now.  What I am starting now.  Would you

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079

393
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,040
like to give a preview to the audience?  Absolutely.  I

394
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,519
would like to give a preview that first of all I would

395
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
like to tell one thing to the world.

396
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,279
What does the big creator say?  That brother,

397
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,160
why would I go empty handed?  Hmm.

398
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,040
I currently have 400 followers on YouTube as we

399
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,360
speak.  Ok?  You accepted my invite.  Are

400
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
you ready to

401
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
come to my Mission India University because

402
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
when people see you, they will trust

403
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
that more people should come.  But brother it

404
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,320
is very simple.  I won’t tell you the question.

405
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,600
But brother, I have the list of questions.

406
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,000
It is like aapki adalat on

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,760
youtube as simple as that.

408
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
Which show has the highest viewership on TV?  In

409
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,480
media news form.  Vintage program of your court and Palki

410
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,639
ma'am.  Well, they

411
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
have a huge viewership.  Ok?  We bring your court

412
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,680
to YouTube.  There will be no criticism but there will

413
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,079
definitely be questions.  Now

414
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
who has not gone and sat there?  Modi sir is also sitting.

415
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,800
Shahrukh Khan sir is also sitting.  Amitabh Bachchan

416
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,399
sir is also sitting.  Amit Shah Sir is also sitting.

417
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
Everybody has gone and sat down.  Rajat sir has

418
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
questioned everyone.  Now this is an

419
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,240
innovation that I am trying to do.

420
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
Brother in the same way is another thing.  India's

421
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
Make in India program.  Ok?  That in Make

422
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,480
in India, whatever factories are there in India,

423
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
everything is again a grey area.  One

424
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,320
should not judge in black and white.

425
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,320
You mean tell me, can we judge?

426
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Meaning, if it is in a grey area, then it will have to be

427
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,199
judged in the grey area.  Go to the point is factory.

428
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,199
Do a podcast in the factory

429
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,360
brother and show in the factory how does the factory

430
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,680
look?  And while walking, talk

431
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,160
to people about how is your brother?  How was this made?  How is this being

432
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,440
made?  Well, how much of Indian

433
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,880
cheese is being used in it?  How much is coming from outside

434
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
?  Well, why is that not happening in India

435
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,360
?  Ok.  This is the message which has to go to the.

436
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,880
So this is the innovation I will

437
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
try to do with my independent

438
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,920
journalism.  Will you actually ever

439
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,079
enter politics?  Look friend, only talks can happen from outside.

440
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
Change can be brought about by going inside.

441
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,040
The answer is simple.  If

442
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,519
14 lakh to 15 lakh people follow me in 15 days,

443
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
then they should all unfollow me.  The day Praful

444
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,199
enters politics, he makes it a Hindu, Muslim

445
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,800
or any caste.  My political agenda

446
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,040
will be nation religion and karma and religion.

447
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,639
And the second agenda is, irrespective of your religion or

448
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,120
caste, go and ask your parents from your heart.

449
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,839
What do you want?  They will say education is

450
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,079
for their child.  So my work will be

451
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,039
for studies.  My job will be to keep these three things –

452
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,600
India and State – State and religion – separate.

453
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,760
And if my political

454
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,520
career ever starts, it will be with a simple

455
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,280
agenda – India First.  We have

456
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,959
met many content creators who have

457
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,039
political ambitions.  I think

458
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,600
politics can be done in three ways.

459
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,960
Firstly, the money is not something hidden, friend, that you do

460
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,080
not pay money to buy the ticket.

461
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,400
Be it any party.  Ok?  Second, muscle power,

462
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
how big you are, that means how much muscle you have behind you.

463
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
Meaning, there are so many big people behind you

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
who will support you in the village.

465
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,919
Because friend, you and I are not voters.  You

466
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,640
and he are not going to decide.  The ones to decide

467
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,520
are the village people to what extent water,

468
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,640
education, electricity and roads are reaching them.

469
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,039
Right?  So politics was fought in two ways.  The

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,120
third method which I

471
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,440
think was brought by Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji is

472
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,000
Tech Ideology.

473
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Yaar look, just understand it simply, whose rule was there for 70 years,

474
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,919
one government, one family,

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
okay, some things were done right, some things were done

476
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,960
wrong, okay, if they had not done anything wrong,

477
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
how could another party have come to power in such a big

478
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,799
country where education has

479
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,440
not yet reached the people, if someone else has come and is

480
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,760
sitting as your Prime Minister for 3 years, then

481
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,440
brother, he must be doing something right

482
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,360
and you must have done something wrong, this should be

483
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,640
accepted and work should be done on it, there

484
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,160
is no denial of that ideology, this is the third weapon,

485
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,400
third way to get into politics

486
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
and be in politics, and I tell you one thing,

487
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
if I go to vote and

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,240
Nitish bhai is in front of me, then probably my

489
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,360
vote will go to Nitish bhai, because yaar,

490
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,960
that guy is sorted, he says everything without taking names, without

491
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,039
saying anything, that means there is no such

492
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,039
post of his on which I do not comment

493
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,320
and the comment is very simple, Nitish

494
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,120
bhai, how do you do this, I would say Nitish bhai

495
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,799
is India's most mature content creator,

496
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,000
very much  There is maturity in his content,

497
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,720
correct brother, maturity

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,640
communication brother, means he does not raise his voice, he

499
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,960
puts forth his entire point and leaves, means

500
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,400
very much, means I will say the word will not be wrong, you have to

501
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
use it for him, he is a sexy

502
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,440
content creator brother, means

503
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
in sexy language and the quality of the content is such

504
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,640
because he creates content by keeping anger away.

505
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,799
This is what I am learning from him brother.  I am

506
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,880
learning the same thing from him as well and probably I have

507
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,880
spent some time with you since morning

508
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,720
on this podcast.  I am learning from you as well.  Meaning The

509
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Commonness, I have always heard this statement

510
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,960
that the higher you go, the more down

511
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
to earth you become.  Ok?  And

512
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,200
I haven't met Nitish Bhai till date.  When I

513
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,360
met you, I noticed the way you guys meet,

514
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,600
the way you guys treat, maybe it is

515
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,679
important for the world to know how you guys are, in

516
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,440
what way, like a message should go from you to the

517
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,080
world that brother, I feel like this

518
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,600
brother.  It's ok brother, live your life like this.

519
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,799
 

520
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
Ok?  Ok?  As you told Bear brother,

521
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,280
build body like this.  In this way,

522
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,520
healthy fitness should be the way of life of

523
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,440
our youth.  That message

524
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,240
needs to go out.  Then people will enjoy it.  Then people

525
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,039
will learn that brother, keep your anger aside and

526
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,000
talk.  Keep the message calm and lovingly.

527
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,039
I think peace is the biggest need in life.

528
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,360
Absolutely.  But he has to earn it.

529
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,360
Peace doesn't come into your life like this.

530
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,000
how comes?

531
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,080
My idol is Naval Ravikant.  I am sure you

532
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
follow him a lot.  They

533
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,120
say that a calm mind is earned.  Either

534
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,880
you earn a working mind with age

535
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,640
or start meditating and studying.

536
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320
The more you know about the world,

537
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,280
the more you realize

538
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,679
how little you know.  Brother, I have a question in this.  The

539
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,640
person who doesn't know whether he will have

540
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,480
food for dinner or not.

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
Whether we will have roti or rice on the table or not.

542
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,880
How can that person keep his mind working?   There

543
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,360
is a need to live a segmented life.  I

544
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,760
feel of course this I am speaking from my

545
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,520
own perspective.  I feel that

546
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,480
in the first 10-15 years of one's career, one should engineer these financial

547
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,520
problems through

548
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,799
opportunity by figuring out the hustle.  But

549
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,720
after that there should be only one goal left in the mind.

550
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
And I also feel like you

551
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
said it right.  I feel there is one more thing that

552
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,880
people should understand.  You should not run after money.

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,280
Like in those three dates, brother,

554
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,400
success will follow you.  That you just keep

555
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,600
doing your work.  The nation's religion, the karma, the karma is

556
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,600
gone.  You keep working.  Money will come.  Ok

557
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,880
?  But don't look for shortcuts.  Have you

558
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,880
found any shortcut in life?  Rubbing.  Don't rub it

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,360
brother.  It means one thing, head down and work continues.

560
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,919
That's it.  And if you can lose yourself, then close your ears or

561
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,039
keep the flow from here to there going on.

562
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,360
You please tell me how do you maintain it, how much

563
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,520
?  I have kept myself busy.

564
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,480
Just correct.  The content that we will release in the next three to six months

565
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,440
is an

566
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,720
outcome of 10 years of content creation.  But

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,400
I just have to let my work do the talking.

568
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
Brother, from this I understand one thing.

569
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,080
Meaning, no matter what you say brother, destiny is

570
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
one thing in life.  I mean it is such a big

571
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,000
thing.  Could I have imagined that in my life

572
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,679
?  I thought in life that

573
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,159
I will text my friend Ranveer Alabadiya.  And

574
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,039
instead of his reply, his call will come.

575
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,440
Destiny this is all destiny.  Once upon a time, my

576
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,280
sister was getting married.  Ok?

577
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Just now on 30th April.  Ok?  When I was uploading 10 videos a day

578
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,159
even on the wedding day.  Is it

579
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,080
okay there?  So what is the message now?  Destiny

580
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:31,760
absolutely is.  You can make it.

581
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,960
If you try then you

582
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,200

583
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,520
can either bring out two things that are written, you can bring out that

584
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
this was written by God.  I brought it up.

585
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,679
Ok?  Or you can change it.

586
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,919
Believe in what you believe.  Start doing it.

587
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,000
And luck factor will play.   It

588
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,559
will definitely play.  Like it did in my case.

589
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,880
Luck factor played.  How did you do it?  There is

590
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,240
not a single such article in Indian Express for 9 years.

591
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,200
We say old

592
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
media, the oldest media is newspaper.  We have

593
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,159
watched very few news channels.  The truth is

594
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
as much as I have

595
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
come in contact with news channels.  This is happening to you right now.

596
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
Then there's another one called With The

597
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
News Channel.  This will continue.  Ok?

598
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,360
All this has just happened.  Ok?  Ok?  But

599
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
before this, what I have done throughout my life is

600
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,240
reading articles for 9 years.

601
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,799
Won the quiz in Delhi circuit.  Ok?

602
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,919
Won the quiz during my school time.  So I kept doing these things all my life.

603
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,640
So what did Luck do from here?  All these

604
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,559
things got articulated with the help

605
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,559
of communication skills and the message could

606
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,159
reach people.  Because you need to know that

607
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
whenever I talk to you, many times it will

608
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,120
seem as if a chatbot is speaking.

609
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,840
Ok?  It will seem as if this AI is speaking.

610
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
The thing is, when I am saying this brother,

611
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
I have not memorized anything.  Now the

612
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,799
point is, what China has been doing around India in the last 9 years has been imprinted in my mind.

613
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,320

614
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,600
Because you

615
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
know how quickly people will

616
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,919
talk about changing the name of Arunachal Pradesh.  Hey, what is

617
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,799
Modi government doing?  Friend, from 2006 to 2009,

618
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,200
he had made a strategy to do this.

619
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,200
He has been doing this thing since then.  And the

620
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,280
Indian Express and The Hindu cover

621
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,159
this.  What is the future of newspapers

622
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,440
brother?  Brother is absolutely super solid.  Those who have now come

623
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,039
into digital because

624
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,200
like me, I am

625
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,880
not able to buy the newspaper while reading it.  So e-newspaper comes in digital form

626
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
and we read it.

627
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
Look, the future of newspaper is very simple

628
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
that it can have a cult following as we talk about,

629
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
just like you can have a cult following.

630
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,279
Nitish Bhai may have a cult following.

631
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,720
Similarly, Indian newspapers have

632
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,960
a cult following.  Like I

633
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,120
am a cult follower of Indian Express.  Ok?  That

634
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
brother, Indian Express will say this, see what a

635
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,960
human being is like?  Either it's on the left,

636
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,880
or it's on the right, or it's

637
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
slightly to the right centrally.  It is slightly to the left.

638
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,679
I call this arc from centre

639
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,240
left to centre right as good

640
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,320
governance.  We are

641
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
absolutely right of center, blind devotees.   It

642
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,279
went completely left of the center.  Who is a

643
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,799
devotee and who is a devotee is very simple.  Who

644
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:52,960
means what brother?  C O N yes scam.

645
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
Ladies vs Ricky Well.  You must have seen it.  Ok.

646
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,760
What does who means?  The world would

647
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,760
know it very well.  Which devotee is a word.

648
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,120
Ok?  I myself said this in my video.

649
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,120
I said you will keep on calling me a blind devotee.

650
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,400
But this, this arc in the middle,

651
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,400
these patriots, we Modi Government or

652
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
Central Government, you have done wrong.  This is

653
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,320
my question.  Modi Government, you

654
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,559
did the right thing.  We will support you.  This arc is where

655
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
we need to live.  according to me.

656
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,919
Ok.  If you ask questions here then there will be no

657
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,200
propaganda.  There will only be one thing.

658
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,520
The right tick of patriotism.  Yes.  But

659
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,520
why do people go to extremes

660
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,000
?  I have not understood this exactly yet.

661
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,679

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Look at the financing, brother, where is terrorism coming from?  It

663
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,000
is coming from the stomach.  The person to whom you are telling this,

664
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,440
go to India, is attacking Taj Hotel.

665
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,120

666
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,640
You should broadcast what he said in his interview, people will see it once.  He

667
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,960
said clearly that brother, I used to get so much money for

668
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,960
doing this work.  Friend, if you

669
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,400
keep a person hungry then only he will

670
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,720
kill someone to satisfy his hunger.  Those who go to the extreme left

671
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,480
or try to mind wash their

672
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
brains.  It's because they are

673
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,159
financing to a certain

674
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
extent, I feel so friend, I also do

675
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,279
n't have any proof.  Who am I?  I mean, I

676
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,520
think this is my opinion.  Independent

677
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,039
opinion is that it's for the money.  Ok?

678
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,720
Because in the end what else are you getting.

679
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,799
nothing.  what are you getting?  And you wo

680
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,279
n't tell me.  I'm a journalist and you're

681
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,799
reporting on the extreme left.  Yes.  Correct.   I am

682
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,360
talking about them in a simple manner.

683
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,200
I agree.  But identifying what is

684
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,480
extreme left and what is extreme

685
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:25,360
right.  This is a modern day skill.

686
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,760
It is the duty of every viewer to improve art.

687
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,880
I would also like to say one thing if you

688
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,559
can put it clearly.

689
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200

690
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,559
What is the difference between westernization and modernization?  Modernization

691
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,080
is rational mindset.  Agreed?

692
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,919
I am not even talking about Western.  I am just

693
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
talking about modularization.

694
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,080
What did we do even when we got freedom

695
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,240
?  I had adopted a rational mind.  Sati was

696
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,919
arrested.  Lots of things curtain system

697
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,640
all rational mind thinking.  This is what a rational mind

698
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,559
needs, that don't take anything by merit.   Do

699
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,720
n't listen to what happened.  Don't believe him.

700
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,720
Use your mind.  Brother, there is another way

701
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,039
according to me.  I just came to know this.  When I was

702
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,960
watching this in the middle then I got to know about these things.   If

703
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,200
any video is coming on any page then

704
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,120
brother click on that page.  Do

705
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
n't look at his 6000 views.  Because those 6000 page videos

706
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,919
get views and go viral,

707
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
every single video is in the Instagram algorithm and

708
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
you will be able to tell how it fits.  But

709
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,559
understand what are her first five videos.  By

710
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,080
watching his first five videos we will understand

711
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,279
what this guy's agenda is.  Do

712
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,880
you understand us?  Because look,

713
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,760
people are very smart.  They will come and tell you also

714
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,600
that Ram ji was wrong.  You were right.

715
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
How correct was the Ram Mandir?  It was wrong.

716
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,799
Should one drink cow urine or not?  Now

717
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
what is the history of Mughals?

718
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,440
What is the French Revolution?  I will explain everything and then

719
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,159
suddenly a video will come that why does Modi

720
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
spread communal right?  Ok?

721
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,000
So you considered him right in everything and then you

722
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,080
realized that he must be right in this also.

723
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,240
Like if many people think that I am right they will

724
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,960
think that whatever Praful is saying must be right.

725
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,880
Ranveer is saying it will be right.  It won't happen

726
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,480
brother.  We might have an agenda.

727
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,360
Start using your brain.  But

728
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,240
how do we polish this skill?  Honestly,

729
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,360
when I started the podcast, my mission was to make

730
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,120
people recognize the skill of reading

731
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,720
between the lines of what's happening in

732
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,480
media.  Brother, please tell me how to

733
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,919
polish it?  Look, you know more than I do.

734
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,600
I think so.  You tell me

735
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
how to polish.  As much as I've

736
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,039
learned through the show.  I feel that you should

737
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,240
read the news carefully which makes you upset.

738
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,200
Know the complete perspective.

739
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,240

740
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,960
Know the complete news which makes you upset.  What did you say?  I mean anything which makes you feel that she is

741
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,919

742
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,679
hurting me, I mean there is something wrong with her.

743
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,240
Or correct or and or this news is making me

744
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,880
very happy so there may be something wrong in that too.

745
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,399
yes both.

746
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,480
If you are feeling any extreme emotion about something,

747
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
ask yourself what are you feeling?  A person

748
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,159
learns from his mistakes.  Let me tell you my two mistakes in this.

749
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,919
I have made two mistakes.  The

750
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,679
statement you just made that

751
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,240
if I had learnt it earlier then maybe I would

752
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,919
not have made those two mistakes.  What did I say and

753
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,080
our media

754
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,399
blew up Karachi port.

755
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,720
As soon as these statements were made, I felt

756
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,320
happy at an extreme level,

757
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,919
friend, that you are saying so much against India, you are

758
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,520
doing so much, we have done it.  But

759
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,120
I never thought that India would ever

760
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
do this because we do

761
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,720
not attack civilians.  If I had understood this thing that day,

762
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,720
which I understood on the second day very

763
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,120
well, the intention was not wrong but when I had

764
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,360
understood it, then perhaps I would have redone it,

765
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:29,679
thought about it myself, then perhaps it would have come out better,

766
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,080
right, yes I think that is called

767
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,960
skill of objectivity, yes at least

768
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,279
for me, explain it once, what does it mean, one should

769
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,159
absorb the news by keeping emotions away,

770
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,320
that's all and I have seen that

771
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,399
in today's times, people choose their friend

772
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,399
circle according to their political opinions.

773
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,640
All over the world, not just in India.

774
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,919
For example, in America,

775
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Democrats will only hang out with Democrats.

776
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,360
Republicans will only

777
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,919
hang out with Republicans.  Friend,

778
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,679
first of all friendship should be kept separate from everything else.

779
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,080
You tell me one thing.  A

780
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,919
man is very rich.  Today, any of your friend

781
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,080
brothers, today every person knows Ranveer Alwaje.

782
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,520
Ok.  Is your friendship with your school friend

783
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,559
better or not?  Off

784
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,240
course, did anything come in between?

785
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,880
Nothing came, right?  Then brother how can politics come

786
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,960
between friends?

787
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,960
Nothing should come between two friends.  Only then will you be

788
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,720
able to move forward.  Two friends discuss their matter.

789
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,919
If politics is ever discussed in it, then it is done.

790
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,360
No problem.  Now move on to the

791
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,200
next point.  Because the next point is,

792
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,480
brother, what has your mother

793
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,360
prepared at home?  My mother has

794
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,960
made potato parathas so I have to come to eat them.  Now we have to

795
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,320
talk about politics and if by

796
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
chance you do not have knowledge about it.

797
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,679
I don't have knowledge about that.  But there are four

798
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,159
people sitting here, so brother, I will tell you whatever I heard after

799
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,640
adding it to my daily routine.

800
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,720
We should also know when to remain silent.

801
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,559
 

802
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,480
If you don't know when to keep quiet.

803
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,640
For example, right now you tell me

804
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,120
what happened between Hinduism and Quran and when.

805
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,960
I will say Ranveer Bhai I am sorry.  I don't know.

806
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,039
Ok?  I have

807
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,240
no knowledge about the depth and history of the religion.

808
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,360
As much as I know, Jai Hind, Jai Bharat, Jai

809
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,080
Shri Ram, Jai Shri Shyam.  This is the order.   I will

810
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,960
speak in this order all my life.  Simple as

811
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,480
that.  Why us?  Because brother Praful

812
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Garg is the person who had walked barefoot for 16 kms to Khatushyam Ji temple on

813
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,360
27 January

814
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,559
25.

815
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,600
Because life was ruined brother.

816
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,840
Ok?  Destruction.  The business was going on.  Everything was going on.

817
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,640
But there was no peace inside.  Meaning there was

818
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,760
no movement from inside.  One thing is that there was no peace in the mind.

819
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,720
Ok?  17 Km  Brother went walking

820
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,000
barefoot, one step at a time, straight, there was

821
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,000
no coverage on the soil.  Brother, I do

822
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,600
not ask for anything from Khatu Shyam ji.  Meaning I do

823
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,159
n't ask for anything from the datar.  I say you can

824
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,519
give whatever approval you want.  Ok.  This is just a message

825
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,679
from me, you said I am coming.  and well.

826
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,120
He says here you go, one and half million

827
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,720
subscribers.  Brother, I say one and a half

828
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,480
million subscribers, 84 crore views,

829
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,320
84 crore in the last one month,

830
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,799
brother, I will tell you, the line is said for Khatu Shyam,

831
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,279
teen baandhari, that

832
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,679
means, I will tell you a little story, Krishna ji

833
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,159
knew that brother, this Mahabharata, if

834
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,320
Khatushyam ji comes down, then no one will be able to win, only he will

835
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,799
win, so he

836
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,200
told him to offer his head to him,

837
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,480
okay, so he offered his head

838
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,399
at one go, he was told that

839
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
in Kaliyuga, you will be treated like a king.

840
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,120
You will be worshipped.  The same thing happens today.  Khatu

841
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,279
Shyam ji is worshipped.  Brother, they are

842
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,360
told that if they shoot three arrows, they can make a

843
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,519
hole wherever they want.

844
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
Brother, he

845
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,919
shot all his three arrows for me.  No, I drove it all the way

846
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,440
and got it there.  But now

847
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,120
he has put the responsibility on my shoulders saying

848
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,840
that he has given this responsibility to me by shooting three arrows on you.  I do

849
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,399

850
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,120
not want to do any propaganda in my life.  Do

851
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,799
not abuse any religion.  It is okay, doesn't it? Our

852
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,960
Premananda ji Maharaj sometimes abuse anyone? I have

853
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,480
heard him a lot,

854
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
Muslim people go to his place, talk to him,

855
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,519
Christian people go and

856
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,080
talk to him, he talks lovingly to everyone,

857
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,000
okay, my religion teaches me this, that we should

858
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,919
not abuse anyone, we should

859
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,960
talk lovingly to everyone and the

860
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,600
responsibility that has been given to me on my shoulders, I have to fulfil it.

861
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,080
So many thoughts, so many thoughts, friend, so many

862
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,799
thoughts, means I want to ask you a question today,

863
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,440
if you permit, then you ask everyone that what is

864
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,840
your thought on life and death

865
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,240
?  For me is that friend, as long as you are

866
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,960
alive, spread happiness, reach peace and

867
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,360
then reach peace to others.  That's

868
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,840
it.  Everyone around you.  Loved Once,

869
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,919
Subscribers Simple Fundamentals of Life.  But do

870
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,799
n't lose your peace.  Do you know who I

871
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,880
learned this from?  Ankit bhaiya Anpuria.  I told

872
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,200
him once that before you came, he was India's

873
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,559
fastest Instagram growing account.

874
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,440
Yes yes I know.  I know it very well.

875
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,279
So I had asked Ankit bhai

876
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,799
that

877
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,679
what do you believe now that do you gain happiness

878
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,840
through money, will you

879
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
get happiness because of money, so he said

880
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,520
that no friend, happiness is achieved because of peace of mind,

881
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,440
through peace, yes brother absolutely right, as I

882
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,679
tell you brother I have reached 1.5, I am

883
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,599
telling you the truth, the money has reduced from what it was

884
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,760
because money is being spent from my pocket,

885
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,399
completely in the business, but the

886
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,879
peace in the heart, whenever the

887
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,879
message comes from housewives that Praful,

888
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,040
you know our husbands used to talk,

889
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,240
we used to remain calm, we did not know anything,

890
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,480
we did not have one hour time to

891
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,320
watch everything on YouTube, but now we are also listening to you, we are also watching the

892
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,720
one hour video that you told about

893
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,560
Nitish bhai, okay, so

894
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,040
they are enjoying a lot, they feel that

895
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,919
now we will also sit in the discussion, we will also

896
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,560
talk, that is the thing, I feel so

897
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,240
friend, I mean my message is about death, about

898
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,079
any such thing that it is

899
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,280
not in your control.  Meaning it is not

900
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,480
in your control.  So we should rather work on

901
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,119
things.  We should work on what is

902
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,599
in our control.  And don't be afraid of anything.

903
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,599
If the words of Premananda Maharaj ji are like yours

904
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,839
that brother, we will all

905
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,359
stand under the tricolor before religion.  We will

906
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,359
stand under the tricolour and even if there is a

907
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,480
need to get our heads chopped off, we will

908
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,560
not think twice.  So if anything happens regarding our national religion

909
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,240
then we all should stand together.

910
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
Because brother, in the end the thing is,

911
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,040
look, I follow our freedom

912
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,640
fighters, which I told you from the beginning,

913
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,320
 

914
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,480
brother, the thing is that many people are

915
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,119
alive in our hearts even after their death and many people have died while living.

916
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,720

917
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,320
Wow,

918
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,720
we need to understand this.  Wow, so we have to

919
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,640
abuse those who died while still alive.

920
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,920
They have to be awakened.  This should be our choice.

921
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
My choice is very clear.  I will

922
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,280
wake them up.

923
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,160
And those who are no longer among us but are alive in our hearts,

924
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,160
their message should not be forgotten.  Whether it is

925
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,520
written in any book or not.

926
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,079
Praful bhai thank you for being on DRS.

927
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,079
Had fun.  That was it.  It is my pleasure to

928
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,320
come to you brother.  Great note to end the

929
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,680
podcast.   I

930
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,760

931
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,359
wanted to present to the world the light that is within you.  I hope your

932
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,119
name reaches every Indian.  Thank you for

933
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,520
everything you do for the country brother.  That's what I'll say.

934
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,599
Thanks to you too Ranveer.

935
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,240
Whatever you did, whatever you have been doing, whatever

936
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,240
you will continue doing, it is important for everyone to come together for this country.

937
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,960
India needs to be

938
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,280
united like never before.  Thank you.  Thank

939
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,599
you Prabhu.  Thank you.  Last message I

940
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,320
would like to take one.  Lastly, I have one line which I

941
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,960
just want to tell everyone.  National duty and

942
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:38,880
karma dharma.  Please follow it in this order.

943
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,359
Hail India.  Victory to India.  I want to

944
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
travel with you.  That is my last message.

945
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,800
At some point.  Ok.  see you soon bro.   See

946
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,800
