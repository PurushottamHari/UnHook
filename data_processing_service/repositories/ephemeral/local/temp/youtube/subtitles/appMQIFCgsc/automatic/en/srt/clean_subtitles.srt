Praful bhai is faster than a drone. Read carefully the news which makes you upset.  Get the full perspective. What did you say?  Anything which feels like it is hurting me. Meaning, there is something wrong with it.  Will you ever enter politics? In today's times, journalists around the world are a little afraid to present their opinions. That's why we see less opinions. Correct.  Threats and all will continue and we will not be afraid of them.  Because brother, in the end the thing is, look, I follow our freedom fighters.  Many people are alive in our hearts even after their death and many people died while they were alive. [Music] Praful bhai welcome to The Ranveer Show and to The Internet and general how are you bhai, absolutely great bhai, I am happy, I am good and it feels good when people are talking about the country. Now India is waking up.  Patriotism is awakening.  So it feels great to see this and it is important to stay awake more.  That's all I would like to say.  Praful bhai is faster than a drone. How did you feel about that comment?  Friend, when people made that comment, I enjoyed hearing it.  Because I was not able to realise it.  I mean what are you doing brother?  It seemed very simple that brother this news has come. A fake narrative of Pakistan has been created in this.  Have to save.  I just went and said it.  But when people told me that Mama called.  Mummy says that brothers are saying that their family members are considering them terrorists, that brother, are you yourself a terrorist that you are bringing it before the news media and serving it on a platter like this. But brother, do you know when do we get to know all these things?  This becomes known only when it happens. During this entire face, you are in the zone, that is my assumption.  You were at it.  Yes dear.  I was getting the news from somewhere and you are published. Yes.  But what was the process itself?  Because recently I spoke to Palki Sharma. And he said that his approach in the first post was that they were going slow and study.  Because news was coming from so many different directions.  They were trying to figure out what was true and what was not.  So I am wondering where did Praful bhai get this skill from? Like, how did you figure this out?  When you know main stream news channels may not be able to figure it out easily.  Brother, I kept it very simple, followed the startup ecosystem, bring the proof, bring two-way authentication and print it.  Make a simple video.   I had communication skills so I told him.  But how did you find out ?  Did two things.  Brother, the first thing I did was Aadhar card verification.  Ok ?  That you are sending this to me that this attack happened at this place, so is this a WhatsApp forward or not?  So how will we find out brother?  It is quite simple.  Please send me your Aadhar card.  You have the guts to send the Aadhaar card.  So, there is some truth in what you say.  Now it can also be used. Aadhar card can be sent as fake.  It could be sent by someone else.  So there will be a video call where my team will keep their cameras turned off.  Your camera will be on.  The face should match with the Aadhar card.  Now both these things have matched.  After that we will judge your video and then take it forward to the country.  Ok?  And a group of second Indian Diaspora Abroad was created on WhatsApp.  I was talking to him on an individual level only.  Ok?  That brother, news is banned here but how are they reporting what happened in UP, what happened in Bihar, as these news channels of Pakistan, what are the news channels of Pakistan reporting about India, it was also necessary to bring that, so they sent from there but with them also we kept doing verification of everything on the same passport because whenever the country trusts, it cannot be broken under any circumstances and what you said about Palak ma'am that you went very slowly and understood the news completely, I learned a lot of things from Palak ma'am also in this whole process like how to use roasting sarcasm without raising voice like I am telling you the truth, look a person should know his mistake, I made a mistake, okay what was the mistake, brother I was getting angry, I was getting very angry on asking about children dying, so once or twice my voice got louder but when I saw Palak ma'am learning that brother Virat Kohli one less century, okay, I learned from there friend like this when one of mine went very viral that I made a video  I was saying, brother, we have a habit of asking what was happening in our Pakistan?  I said my Pakistan, I said no, Pakistan is not mine.  So he said it and then he said but he said it lovingly and softly, brothers have picked it up.  Are we okay?  So, I do n't know who was telling me this?  I was not reading the comments at that time.  55 videos a day is no joke, man.  Meaning you don't have time to read the comments.  Ok?  Just research is going on , articles are going on, studies are going on at a speed and content is coming.  Simple that was the thing I was trying to know.  I think all the Indian Instagram users were absorbing the news from your page. Which is a crazy shift I feel.  See, the thing is that alternative journalism, as we call alternative journalists, they were doing it because when one goes to a channel in the media, there is a process for everything in the media.  Ok?  Meaning because he said something.  So as we saw that Pakistan showed what was being shown on Indian media to its entire foreign diaspora which was there when they were holding their conferences, they showed that in front. So whatever we are able to do on Instagram or anywhere, we are able to put the right message of India in a fast way and it is good that I was able to do something for nation and religion at the time when the need was the greatest and are you happy with the phase you had right now?  Hey, very nice brother.  Meaning, after one message arrives, two or three messages arrive.  First comes the National Crush of India.  My mom sent it.  I said friend what is going on? Ok.  So, one way or the other this operation had already taken place before Indore.  A guy had said, brother I am a boy, if you were a girl I would have married you.  Ok. So, there's my national crush.  So, I have made a video on this.  I said brother, see what may happen. Bollywood may have said it or not.   The national crush is Hrithik Roshan sir.  Ok. I said this directly in the video. And after that, whatever happens at the wide angle, that thing gets spread completely. People started saying that brother, Mummy said about National Crush of India.  Then I get a message from a girl that Praful, there is a dance video of my mother and me on my personal account in which the song playing is that you will find a girl for me. Mom, if you say such a thing then I am a baniya.  A reply comes from a Baniya girl.  Your mom is talking about me. And I am reading people's messages, so I am reading them after a long time brother.  That means, go and read all the messages that came two days ago on six, seven or eight. Brother, half an hour at night is not enough, the whole day is enough, so friend, we have to calm our mind and prepare for the next day. So what is its process? I open my personal account.  When I read the message, I laugh a lot.  I start laughing whenever I keep reading.  It feels a little bit good.  Then when I listen to Palki ma’am my day becomes even better. Then let's start like this the next day.  That is, my intention behind this podcast is that your name should reach more people so that people can understand that there are people like you in India.  Absolutely brother, look, tell me two things happen.  News and Opinion.  There is one news that comes and tells.  What does Palak ma'am do?  Opinion.  What is the soft opinion which we have?  Let the world decide.  This is my opinion, you should think about it yourself. So that is the thing, thank you for giving this opportunity to reach out to the people and we will continue doing the same in the future as well that this news has come and such opinion can be built on it.  Now you do yours.  So it's a division of three things together.  We know, people often do that and I am not saying this about people. I feel the same problem exists for journalists too. In today's times, journalists around the world are a little afraid to present their opinions.  Correct?  That's why we see less opinions.  Yes.  This allows interpretations to be formed in very diverse ways, and that would be correct, brother.  Gradually people will take inspiration from people and say that just one Ranveer and just one Praful will not achieve anything.  Ok?  So people will gradually learn to form their own opinion. Like I tell you.  I have a brother who lives in some village.  Behind them, I saw the background.  Looked at the ceiling above.  He saw my video.  Now there are no English words in my videos. In English. What did he do?  Added subtitles to it in Hindi.  And made my own video. And cast it.  Now, there was not a single like on his video , not a single comment. I picked it up and put it on my story. I said now listen to them.  Because brother, I have a restriction, my health will get spoiled. If I try to talk in every form, I will not be able to talk for long. Ok?  So my inspiration is Pallaki ma'am, she is talking in a certain way. I am talking in a way.  Now we also need people who can talk about this in different languages.  So that is how we will be able to spread the message.  Hmm. My hope is that news in 2030 is mainly dependent on independent journalism.  I hope I can tell you a statement from your podcast which I listened to. Was with Nitish Bhai.  Ok?  You probably asked this question to Nitish Bhai that this is mainstream journalism and what are you doing ?  So Nitish bhai had given such an answer that I will never go to main stream journalism because I make 1 hour in-depth videos after a lot of thinking. His answer was something like this.  Brother, the thing is that in the coming time two types of things will be seen, brother, one quickly tell the opinion as to what it is, like we can form our opinion and then the second one will go to Nitish Bhai or to other people like 50 people will come, whatever long form you used to do, if you do it in future then from there people will make their long form opinion that yes now we have one hour we are on a drive. Now let's listen and understand what is going on. Brother, I am happy that people are getting a chance to know the real personality of Praful Bhai through this podcast. But I'm also wondering, since you were creating so much content during this whole conflict, you also faced backlash.  Brother, backlash is also called threat, backlash is also called comments that fielding is being done against you. But Indians themselves caused the backlash?  Yes dear.  Of course some of it is definitely fueled by the Pakistani side.  Absolutely. I can tell you the whole narrative, how ?  Yes, tell me this because effectively I believe that social media is another kind of battle field to be one.  And here I genuinely felt that you were fighting the most in our entire country. Online for A country.  And that mission is visible in your Instagram growth. So many people supported you. But at the same time it's crazy for me to think that you also got hate during all this. You were releasing content so genuinely.   Were spreading the correct news. Were spreading real news. Were spreading global narratives.  A I just don't understand why you got hate? During the whole phase.  Let's divide this whole thing into four.  Sure.  Brother, look, first of all let me start with why I started. You will be shocked Run Bhai to hear that I thought only a 90 second reel could be uploaded on Instagram.  When I uploaded the first two videos, they came in the evening on the day of the Pahalgam attack and the second video came at 1:30 in the night.  Brother, when I uploaded the video I was speaking so fast that I thought I could only upload it for 90 seconds.  Then I once checked the timing while inserting the bus, to see for how many seconds it could be inserted.  I said this is 180 seconds.  Meaning we can put a 3 minute readle.  So let's explain the matter further. So the first thing is that I did not come here with the thought of gaining followers.  Mine was very simple; I have to save the nation and religion.  I have to save the nation as much as I can.  Brother comes on the hate.  So the hate started brother when I made a statement which is a true statement that people of one religion whose population in India is around 78%, 77% were killed after asking about their religion, so when I said this statement, people said that he is a blind devotee. Brother, do you know on which day the sorrow occurred?  I did not abuse anyone, did not say anything.  I know that people have said that this is a sleeper cell of India.  Just imagine, people sitting in India keep using the word sleeper cell.  I did not react at all to that either. Because as long as you are getting trolled then understand that you are doing something right.  As simple as that.  Ok?  So this happened. After that when the narrative of Operation Sindoor came that we did Operation Sindoor, to tell you the truth, at that time my entire proportion of audience suddenly changed because Pakistanis came on the account.  Because I just told you one thing that if you abuse then the game is over.  If you state your point without abusing then everyone understands that nothing can be done to this person and he will keep telling the truth. What do you do the same thing brother?  Ok? That I don't have any abuse in my mind and I don't want to give it.  The thing is that when I started talking about this entire incident after Operation Sindoor, many threats came.  That means my mother, my sister and I were abused. All I said was that I understand that you are abusing me.  They are abusing my country.  That is very wrong. Nothing will stop because of your abuses because we 140-142 crore brothers have to be very honest.  It would be better if we don't make round figures because we have to feed even 2 crore people. Water has to be provided to Rs 2 crore also.  So the thing is that we are 142 crore people. Ok?  So if we all come together then nothing happens. All these abusive people are on one side brother.  Many threats came.  If I tell you the truth, maybe we did talk once in between.  Then it was very clear that I was not even coming out of my room.  Let me tell you, I wore the shirt for around 22 days because I had only four shirts at that time.  Ok?  I have worn them alternately. Without washing, without doing anything.  I have not left the room.  I have been able to eat whatever has come into the room.  Empty because I don't live with my family.  So I ate whatever came into the room.  He remained inside the room.  I was scared to even go to the balcony for a long time.  Ok ?  So this was the situation.  But they say brother that a lamp emerges only from the darkness.  I am not calling myself a lamp but I am calling this country a lamp. So this lamp came out and this lamp will keep coming out.  This lamp will go up now.  It will not come down.  So these threats and all will continue.  And we will not be afraid of this. Because as I just told you a war is fought outside.  A war is fought within the country. A war is fought on social media. Hmm.  Our soldiers, our defense forces are fighting outside.  Inside, our government, our internal security advisors are fighting. You and I are fighting on social media.  People know me for the fact that something happened between India and Pakistan.  This guy came.  This said, this probably covers everything. Whatever words are being used, it becomes a viral sensation. over now.  Brother, the story started from here because since then many people have died in India.  So the story does not end here.  People will say that a Hindu has awakened.  So yes, definitely a Hindu has awakened but first an Indian has awakened.  Firstly, if someone has a problem with Hindustan World, then I say it for their happiness because I have nothing against any religion. Many of my students come from every religion.  This is an Indian place and this Indian place will not sleep because people like you and many others will keep supporting it. What kind of content is India hungry for? Maybe you can give the correct answer to this.  I hope India is hungry for research based content like what you are doing.  Now I am starting it brother.  What I am starting now.  What I am starting now.  Would you like to give a preview to the audience?  Absolutely.  I would like to give a preview that first of all I would like to tell one thing to the world. What does the big creator say?  That brother, why would I go empty handed?  Hmm. I currently have 400 followers on YouTube as we speak.  Ok?  You accepted my invite.  Are you ready to come to my Mission India University because when people see you, they will trust that more people should come.  But brother it is very simple.  I won’t tell you the question. But brother, I have the list of questions. It is like aapki adalat on youtube as simple as that. Which show has the highest viewership on TV?  In media news form.  Vintage program of your court and Palki ma'am.  Well, they have a huge viewership.  Ok?  We bring your court to YouTube.  There will be no criticism but there will definitely be questions.  Now who has not gone and sat there?  Modi sir is also sitting. Shahrukh Khan sir is also sitting.  Amitabh Bachchan sir is also sitting.  Amit Shah Sir is also sitting. Everybody has gone and sat down.  Rajat sir has questioned everyone.  Now this is an innovation that I am trying to do. Brother in the same way is another thing.  India's Make in India program.  Ok?  That in Make in India, whatever factories are there in India, everything is again a grey area.  One should not judge in black and white. You mean tell me, can we judge? Meaning, if it is in a grey area, then it will have to be judged in the grey area.  Go to the point is factory. Do a podcast in the factory brother and show in the factory how does the factory look?  And while walking, talk to people about how is your brother?  How was this made?  How is this being made?  Well, how much of Indian cheese is being used in it?  How much is coming from outside ?  Well, why is that not happening in India ?  Ok.  This is the message which has to go to the. So this is the innovation I will try to do with my independent journalism.  Will you actually ever enter politics?  Look friend, only talks can happen from outside. Change can be brought about by going inside. The answer is simple.  If 14 lakh to 15 lakh people follow me in 15 days, then they should all unfollow me.  The day Praful enters politics, he makes it a Hindu, Muslim or any caste.  My political agenda will be nation religion and karma and religion. And the second agenda is, irrespective of your religion or caste, go and ask your parents from your heart. What do you want?  They will say education is for their child.  So my work will be for studies.  My job will be to keep these three things – India and State – State and religion – separate. And if my political career ever starts, it will be with a simple agenda – India First.  We have met many content creators who have political ambitions.  I think politics can be done in three ways. Firstly, the money is not something hidden, friend, that you do not pay money to buy the ticket. Be it any party.  Ok?  Second, muscle power, how big you are, that means how much muscle you have behind you. Meaning, there are so many big people behind you who will support you in the village. Because friend, you and I are not voters.  You and he are not going to decide.  The ones to decide are the village people to what extent water, education, electricity and roads are reaching them. Right?  So politics was fought in two ways.  The third method which I think was brought by Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji is Tech Ideology. Yaar look, just understand it simply, whose rule was there for 70 years, one government, one family, okay, some things were done right, some things were done wrong, okay, if they had not done anything wrong, how could another party have come to power in such a big country where education has not yet reached the people, if someone else has come and is sitting as your Prime Minister for 3 years, then brother, he must be doing something right and you must have done something wrong, this should be accepted and work should be done on it, there is no denial of that ideology, this is the third weapon, third way to get into politics and be in politics, and I tell you one thing, if I go to vote and Nitish bhai is in front of me, then probably my vote will go to Nitish bhai, because yaar, that guy is sorted, he says everything without taking names, without saying anything, that means there is no such post of his on which I do not comment and the comment is very simple, Nitish bhai, how do you do this, I would say Nitish bhai is India's most mature content creator, very much  There is maturity in his content, correct brother, maturity communication brother, means he does not raise his voice, he puts forth his entire point and leaves, means very much, means I will say the word will not be wrong, you have to use it for him, he is a sexy content creator brother, means in sexy language and the quality of the content is such because he creates content by keeping anger away. This is what I am learning from him brother.  I am learning the same thing from him as well and probably I have spent some time with you since morning on this podcast.  I am learning from you as well.  Meaning The Commonness, I have always heard this statement that the higher you go, the more down to earth you become.  Ok?  And I haven't met Nitish Bhai till date.  When I met you, I noticed the way you guys meet, the way you guys treat, maybe it is important for the world to know how you guys are, in what way, like a message should go from you to the world that brother, I feel like this brother.  It's ok brother, live your life like this. Ok?  Ok?  As you told Bear brother, build body like this.  In this way, healthy fitness should be the way of life of our youth.  That message needs to go out.  Then people will enjoy it.  Then people will learn that brother, keep your anger aside and talk.  Keep the message calm and lovingly. I think peace is the biggest need in life. Absolutely.  But he has to earn it. Peace doesn't come into your life like this. how comes? My idol is Naval Ravikant.  I am sure you follow him a lot.  They say that a calm mind is earned.  Either you earn a working mind with age or start meditating and studying. The more you know about the world, the more you realize how little you know.  Brother, I have a question in this.  The person who doesn't know whether he will have food for dinner or not. Whether we will have roti or rice on the table or not. How can that person keep his mind working?   There is a need to live a segmented life.  I feel of course this I am speaking from my own perspective.  I feel that in the first 10-15 years of one's career, one should engineer these financial problems through opportunity by figuring out the hustle.  But after that there should be only one goal left in the mind. And I also feel like you said it right.  I feel there is one more thing that people should understand.  You should not run after money. Like in those three dates, brother, success will follow you.  That you just keep doing your work.  The nation's religion, the karma, the karma is gone.  You keep working.  Money will come.  Ok ?  But don't look for shortcuts.  Have you found any shortcut in life?  Rubbing.  Don't rub it brother.  It means one thing, head down and work continues. That's it.  And if you can lose yourself, then close your ears or keep the flow from here to there going on. You please tell me how do you maintain it, how much ?  I have kept myself busy. Just correct.  The content that we will release in the next three to six months is an outcome of 10 years of content creation.  But I just have to let my work do the talking. Brother, from this I understand one thing. Meaning, no matter what you say brother, destiny is one thing in life.  I mean it is such a big thing.  Could I have imagined that in my life ?  I thought in life that I will text my friend Ranveer Alabadiya.  And instead of his reply, his call will come. Destiny this is all destiny.  Once upon a time, my sister was getting married.  Ok? Just now on 30th April.  Ok?  When I was uploading 10 videos a day even on the wedding day.  Is it okay there?  So what is the message now?  Destiny absolutely is.  You can make it. If you try then you can either bring out two things that are written, you can bring out that this was written by God.  I brought it up. Ok?  Or you can change it. Believe in what you believe.  Start doing it. And luck factor will play.   It will definitely play.  Like it did in my case. Luck factor played.  How did you do it?  There is not a single such article in Indian Express for 9 years. We say old media, the oldest media is newspaper.  We have watched very few news channels.  The truth is as much as I have come in contact with news channels.  This is happening to you right now. Then there's another one called With The News Channel.  This will continue.  Ok? All this has just happened.  Ok?  Ok?  But before this, what I have done throughout my life is reading articles for 9 years. Won the quiz in Delhi circuit.  Ok? Won the quiz during my school time.  So I kept doing these things all my life. So what did Luck do from here?  All these things got articulated with the help of communication skills and the message could reach people.  Because you need to know that whenever I talk to you, many times it will seem as if a chatbot is speaking. Ok?  It will seem as if this AI is speaking. The thing is, when I am saying this brother, I have not memorized anything.  Now the point is, what China has been doing around India in the last 9 years has been imprinted in my mind. Because you know how quickly people will talk about changing the name of Arunachal Pradesh.  Hey, what is Modi government doing?  Friend, from 2006 to 2009, he had made a strategy to do this. He has been doing this thing since then.  And the Indian Express and The Hindu cover this.  What is the future of newspapers brother?  Brother is absolutely super solid.  Those who have now come into digital because like me, I am not able to buy the newspaper while reading it.  So e-newspaper comes in digital form and we read it. Look, the future of newspaper is very simple that it can have a cult following as we talk about, just like you can have a cult following. Nitish Bhai may have a cult following. Similarly, Indian newspapers have a cult following.  Like I am a cult follower of Indian Express.  Ok?  That brother, Indian Express will say this, see what a human being is like?  Either it's on the left, or it's on the right, or it's slightly to the right centrally.  It is slightly to the left. I call this arc from centre left to centre right as good governance.  We are absolutely right of center, blind devotees.   It went completely left of the center.  Who is a devotee and who is a devotee is very simple.  Who means what brother?  C O N yes scam. Ladies vs Ricky Well.  You must have seen it.  Ok. What does who means?  The world would know it very well.  Which devotee is a word. Ok?  I myself said this in my video. I said you will keep on calling me a blind devotee. But this, this arc in the middle, these patriots, we Modi Government or Central Government, you have done wrong.  This is my question.  Modi Government, you did the right thing.  We will support you.  This arc is where we need to live.  according to me. Ok.  If you ask questions here then there will be no propaganda.  There will only be one thing. The right tick of patriotism.  Yes.  But why do people go to extremes ?  I have not understood this exactly yet. Look at the financing, brother, where is terrorism coming from?  It is coming from the stomach.  The person to whom you are telling this, go to India, is attacking Taj Hotel. You should broadcast what he said in his interview, people will see it once.  He said clearly that brother, I used to get so much money for doing this work.  Friend, if you keep a person hungry then only he will kill someone to satisfy his hunger.  Those who go to the extreme left or try to mind wash their brains.  It's because they are financing to a certain extent, I feel so friend, I also do n't have any proof.  Who am I?  I mean, I think this is my opinion.  Independent opinion is that it's for the money.  Ok? Because in the end what else are you getting. nothing.  what are you getting?  And you wo n't tell me.  I'm a journalist and you're reporting on the extreme left.  Yes.  Correct.   I am talking about them in a simple manner. I agree.  But identifying what is extreme left and what is extreme right.  This is a modern day skill. It is the duty of every viewer to improve art. I would also like to say one thing if you can put it clearly. What is the difference between westernization and modernization?  Modernization is rational mindset.  Agreed? I am not even talking about Western.  I am just talking about modularization. What did we do even when we got freedom ?  I had adopted a rational mind.  Sati was arrested.  Lots of things curtain system all rational mind thinking.  This is what a rational mind needs, that don't take anything by merit.   Do n't listen to what happened.  Don't believe him. Use your mind.  Brother, there is another way according to me.  I just came to know this.  When I was watching this in the middle then I got to know about these things.   If any video is coming on any page then brother click on that page.  Do n't look at his 6000 views.  Because those 6000 page videos get views and go viral, every single video is in the Instagram algorithm and you will be able to tell how it fits.  But understand what are her first five videos.  By watching his first five videos we will understand what this guy's agenda is.  Do you understand us?  Because look, people are very smart.  They will come and tell you also that Ram ji was wrong.  You were right. How correct was the Ram Mandir?  It was wrong. Should one drink cow urine or not?  Now what is the history of Mughals? What is the French Revolution?  I will explain everything and then suddenly a video will come that why does Modi spread communal right?  Ok? So you considered him right in everything and then you realized that he must be right in this also. Like if many people think that I am right they will think that whatever Praful is saying must be right. Ranveer is saying it will be right.  It won't happen brother.  We might have an agenda. Start using your brain.  But how do we polish this skill?  Honestly, when I started the podcast, my mission was to make people recognize the skill of reading between the lines of what's happening in media.  Brother, please tell me how to polish it?  Look, you know more than I do. I think so.  You tell me how to polish.  As much as I've learned through the show.  I feel that you should read the news carefully which makes you upset. Know the complete perspective. Know the complete news which makes you upset.  What did you say?  I mean anything which makes you feel that she is hurting me, I mean there is something wrong with her. Or correct or and or this news is making me very happy so there may be something wrong in that too. yes both. If you are feeling any extreme emotion about something, ask yourself what are you feeling?  A person learns from his mistakes.  Let me tell you my two mistakes in this. I have made two mistakes.  The statement you just made that if I had learnt it earlier then maybe I would not have made those two mistakes.  What did I say and our media blew up Karachi port. As soon as these statements were made, I felt happy at an extreme level, friend, that you are saying so much against India, you are doing so much, we have done it.  But I never thought that India would ever do this because we do not attack civilians.  If I had understood this thing that day, which I understood on the second day very well, the intention was not wrong but when I had understood it, then perhaps I would have redone it, thought about it myself, then perhaps it would have come out better, right, yes I think that is called skill of objectivity, yes at least for me, explain it once, what does it mean, one should absorb the news by keeping emotions away, that's all and I have seen that in today's times, people choose their friend circle according to their political opinions. All over the world, not just in India. For example, in America, Democrats will only hang out with Democrats. Republicans will only hang out with Republicans.  Friend, first of all friendship should be kept separate from everything else. You tell me one thing.  A man is very rich.  Today, any of your friend brothers, today every person knows Ranveer Alwaje. Ok.  Is your friendship with your school friend better or not?  Off course, did anything come in between? Nothing came, right?  Then brother how can politics come between friends? Nothing should come between two friends.  Only then will you be able to move forward.  Two friends discuss their matter. If politics is ever discussed in it, then it is done. No problem.  Now move on to the next point.  Because the next point is, brother, what has your mother prepared at home?  My mother has made potato parathas so I have to come to eat them.  Now we have to talk about politics and if by chance you do not have knowledge about it. I don't have knowledge about that.  But there are four people sitting here, so brother, I will tell you whatever I heard after adding it to my daily routine. We should also know when to remain silent. If you don't know when to keep quiet. For example, right now you tell me what happened between Hinduism and Quran and when. I will say Ranveer Bhai I am sorry.  I don't know. Ok?  I have no knowledge about the depth and history of the religion. As much as I know, Jai Hind, Jai Bharat, Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Shyam.  This is the order.   I will speak in this order all my life.  Simple as that.  Why us?  Because brother Praful Garg is the person who had walked barefoot for 16 kms to Khatushyam Ji temple on 27 January 25. Because life was ruined brother. Ok?  Destruction.  The business was going on.  Everything was going on. But there was no peace inside.  Meaning there was no movement from inside.  One thing is that there was no peace in the mind. Ok?  17 Km  Brother went walking barefoot, one step at a time, straight, there was no coverage on the soil.  Brother, I do not ask for anything from Khatu Shyam ji.  Meaning I do n't ask for anything from the datar.  I say you can give whatever approval you want.  Ok.  This is just a message from me, you said I am coming.  and well. He says here you go, one and half million subscribers.  Brother, I say one and a half million subscribers, 84 crore views, 84 crore in the last one month, brother, I will tell you, the line is said for Khatu Shyam, teen baandhari, that means, I will tell you a little story, Krishna ji knew that brother, this Mahabharata, if Khatushyam ji comes down, then no one will be able to win, only he will win, so he told him to offer his head to him, okay, so he offered his head at one go, he was told that in Kaliyuga, you will be treated like a king. You will be worshipped.  The same thing happens today.  Khatu Shyam ji is worshipped.  Brother, they are told that if they shoot three arrows, they can make a hole wherever they want. Brother, he shot all his three arrows for me.  No, I drove it all the way and got it there.  But now he has put the responsibility on my shoulders saying that he has given this responsibility to me by shooting three arrows on you.  I do not want to do any propaganda in my life.  Do not abuse any religion.  It is okay, doesn't it? Our Premananda ji Maharaj sometimes abuse anyone? I have heard him a lot, Muslim people go to his place, talk to him, Christian people go and talk to him, he talks lovingly to everyone, okay, my religion teaches me this, that we should not abuse anyone, we should talk lovingly to everyone and the responsibility that has been given to me on my shoulders, I have to fulfil it. So many thoughts, so many thoughts, friend, so many thoughts, means I want to ask you a question today, if you permit, then you ask everyone that what is your thought on life and death ?  For me is that friend, as long as you are alive, spread happiness, reach peace and then reach peace to others.  That's it.  Everyone around you.  Loved Once, Subscribers Simple Fundamentals of Life.  But do n't lose your peace.  Do you know who I learned this from?  Ankit bhaiya Anpuria.  I told him once that before you came, he was India's fastest Instagram growing account. Yes yes I know.  I know it very well. So I had asked Ankit bhai that what do you believe now that do you gain happiness through money, will you get happiness because of money, so he said that no friend, happiness is achieved because of peace of mind, through peace, yes brother absolutely right, as I tell you brother I have reached 1.5, I am telling you the truth, the money has reduced from what it was because money is being spent from my pocket, completely in the business, but the peace in the heart, whenever the message comes from housewives that Praful, you know our husbands used to talk, we used to remain calm, we did not know anything, we did not have one hour time to watch everything on YouTube, but now we are also listening to you, we are also watching the one hour video that you told about Nitish bhai, okay, so they are enjoying a lot, they feel that now we will also sit in the discussion, we will also talk, that is the thing, I feel so friend, I mean my message is about death, about any such thing that it is not in your control.  Meaning it is not in your control.  So we should rather work on things.  We should work on what is in our control.  And don't be afraid of anything. If the words of Premananda Maharaj ji are like yours that brother, we will all stand under the tricolor before religion.  We will stand under the tricolour and even if there is a need to get our heads chopped off, we will not think twice.  So if anything happens regarding our national religion then we all should stand together. Because brother, in the end the thing is, look, I follow our freedom fighters, which I told you from the beginning, brother, the thing is that many people are alive in our hearts even after their death and many people have died while living. Wow, we need to understand this.  Wow, so we have to abuse those who died while still alive. They have to be awakened.  This should be our choice. My choice is very clear.  I will wake them up. And those who are no longer among us but are alive in our hearts, their message should not be forgotten.  Whether it is written in any book or not. Praful bhai thank you for being on DRS. Had fun.  That was it.  It is my pleasure to come to you brother.  Great note to end the podcast.   I wanted to present to the world the light that is within you.  I hope your name reaches every Indian.  Thank you for everything you do for the country brother.  That's what I'll say. Thanks to you too Ranveer. Whatever you did, whatever you have been doing, whatever you will continue doing, it is important for everyone to come together for this country. India needs to be united like never before.  Thank you.  Thank you Prabhu.  Thank you.  Last message I would like to take one.  Lastly, I have one line which I just want to tell everyone.  National duty and karma dharma.  Please follow it in this order. Hail India.  Victory to India.  I want to travel with you.  That is my last message. At some point.  Ok.  see you soon bro.   See you soon. Jai Ho [Music]
