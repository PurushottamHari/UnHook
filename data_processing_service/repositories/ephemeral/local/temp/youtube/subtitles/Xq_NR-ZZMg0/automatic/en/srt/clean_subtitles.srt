Ladakh is at a very very high altitude, it is 16 times higher than Delhi, there is a shortage of everything here, there is a shortage of water, people should not have it here, still in every house of our Ladakh, potatoes are kept underground for six months, a 6 feet 7 feet long Ghaddar, Radish, Turnip, everything is kept for six months so that it does not get spoiled by snow, the Ladha people keep it like this, imagine that it rains only for 10 to 12 days in the whole year, it is so dry here, the highest place of India, Hello Sir, we stayed in Ladakh, in the house of this cute local couple, this thick roti of Ladakh is made of Gad only, but it is very thick, four times the thickness of our normal roti, and this is dal, the normal mixed dal, we are currently staying in a homestay, if you see this room, it is like a normal local house, room and right in the middle of it, there is a traditional heater, because Ladakh is a desert, so farming cannot be done here for six months.  So that's why these local solutions, local ways of living, help the people here to eat and live. If you see the food here, you must have seen Thuppa here, what are you making now? I have just made Thuppa, or take Gaja, this vegetable, so many vegetables have been prepared [Music] When you drink boiled soup, then one glass of soup gives heat to your whole body, so how efficient it is, you can see everything goes into it, so a nutritious meal in a single vessel because the resources are very limited here, so we cannot make three pots on three stoves, ah one more is happening very well, please thank you, very good, very good, it looks very healthy, it seems like he is eating something good, he is eating something healthy, what is in it, in this Ladakh he says like beer, like local beer of Ladakh [Music] wow and our drunkards have come, it's so tasty, I have this beer, it's beer, it's so tasty, I have not had beer, how is it, very good, it's like a tree, not like a tree, the food of Ladakh here is very good  It was nutritious but due to our changing lifestyle in our cities, people 's health is getting affected, so today 10 crore people in India are diabetic, which means that there is a diabetic patient in every third house, whom this BeatO glucometer helps.

The link for this is in the description below. Now let's go back to the [Music] video. In our Ladakh's capital, 66% of the population follows Buddhism [Prashasa] and this Shanti Stupa reflects this peaceful religion and if you come here, you will feel that peace, you will feel that peace because there is a lot of peace [Music] Right now, where I am standing, it is actually a frozen river, I mean, water is flowing under this ice and it has frozen so much that it has turned into ice [Music] [Prashasa] You can see this ice, even if you hit it a little, it will not break and people are ice skating on it, it is not easy to walk on it, people come from outside also to skate, yes ma'am, people come from everywhere and skating is going on in every village as well. Right now, the whole game is going on in the rivers and streams [Music] Yesterday, Ladakh  How was it made is the most interesting thing, millions of years ago the Ural plate collided with the Indian plate and then the mastic mountain Himalayas were formed and because of these Himalayas a rain shadow area is created here due to which the rain clouds are unable to reach here, so now where will the water come from, for this the people here have come up with many innovative solutions for years [Music] I mean it looks like a mountain made of ice [Music] and this is not naturally formed, it has been made artificially, it is man-made, it looks beautiful, it is not small, this Ice Tapa behind us has been formed out of helplessness because there is a lot of water shortage in Ladakh right now we are Ice Tapa's [Music] Oh they have been places who built a cafe inside this dome, it's a nice cafe inside an Ice Tapa. To make an Ice Tapa, first of all a structure of wood is made, it is the wood from which a complete mold structure is made and through an underground pipe, water is brought from many glaciers and  They place that pipe right in the middle of this mould. Now the water from the glacier comes so fast that it flows straight out of the pipe and then it meets -20 - 30 degree Celsius, so the water freezes completely and then these big mountains of ice are formed, which is like the biggest storm that has come last year, it was built only by Thatch, which conserved 13 million litres of water. This complete structure that you are seeing was built in 40 days, it will become bigger now, it will be quite big now, so why is it that so many problem-solving solvers come out of Ladakh? Because if there are a lot of problems then there will be a lot of solvers too. The going gets tough, it gets tough. I guess the lifestyle makes you think that everything is easily available in tier one cities, everything is there, there is no need of innovation, your lifestyle is pretty easy here in Ladakh, because there used to be so many problems earlier, and even now there are so many problems, so that would make you think.  What can we do differently? For example, in down plains, we use toilets, right? We do our business. We flush and then we forget about it. What happens to the stuff that we flush? In Ladakh, we have dry composting toilets. This is the only toilet in India that does not use water. You will find this toilet in every home in Ladakh. Like in western toilets, when we defecate, they have to be taken to septic tanks. But here, fertilizer is produced from human toilets. People defecate on the first floor. The waste is collected below. Grass or dung is put in it so that the material collected below becomes compost properly. After years, this manure is collected and used in the farms here. The whole of India can learn from Ladakh how to save water [Music] And still, there is no smell in this toilet. Oh, this bunch of spinach, this bunch of coriander, coriander too. Yes, yes, this coriander, this mint, these strawberries. Gradually, everything will grow big. They are small. Right now, we are small.  We are not proud of the fact that they make ice tops or solar buildings. This is not a big solution. What can we change with this because the root of these problems is here. No, these are small fixes. Their roots are in Delhi, London, Mumbai, Beijing. If the people there live a little simply, we will be able to live. [Music] What will you tell people about the good things in Ladakh? There is snow to see in Ladakh, there are apples to see, there is fruit here, there is nothing green here right now in winter. Everything will look good at my house. So all of you come, I will serve you a lot. Take a break or take a break because the altitude is so high here. That's why we were already taking this medicine Diamox two days ago before leaving. We have also taken a permit because we have come to Ladakh in the off-season. So we have to take a permit from the government site. No prepaid phone works here. Only the local Ladakhi SIM works or postpaid, that too only on airtelhellotunes.in. I am here. Thank you, good. [Music] Afternoon what is this mike, what is this, tell me what do you want to become, you are an engineer, tell me your ring, show it to the camera, what do you want to become when you grow up, I want to join the army when I grow up, I want to join the army, so why do you want to join the army, I like the army very much, what does the army do, it keeps our country safe and why is the security of the country important so that all the Hindus and Muslims in our India remain safe, that's why Kali [praise] Jai ma'am, I am a primary level teacher of this school, so I have a lot of affection with these small children, that's why I am in the class, now I am making NIPHM so that our children get the basic concept, um, I also made this, so we keep it in it, ma'am, skip and keep it in this way, now if we let the child pick it up through this, then the child will trap it from this, so this triangle will be matching with it, you saw the three idiots, in that Aamir Khan's character was as passionate and passionate, he was for education, in the same way  There are other teachers in Ladakh too, we got to know this after coming here and what do you want your children to become when they grow up, if everything happens according to my wish, then I would like that my children become human beings, when children become human beings, they become everything else on their own because I have stolen dialogues from many films, unless they become a good citizen, they will not be able to become a good doctor, they will not be able to become a good engineer, in school they teach on smart boards, these children have got university level facilities, so we talk about this every day in the classes that such good facilities have come for you people, if you people do not study then you people are unfortunate, I mean that I myself have come here after studying to teach them, in the same way, serve your community, serve your parents, serve others, become a worthy person, this is enough for a person, what a thing [Music] It felt good to see that in such a unique place, even in the highest place of India, there is a school like this  Which runs even in winters, in such extreme cold, there is a school which gives hope that no matter how many difficulties the nature gives you, the spirit should never diminish, Lord, I thank you for the sunshine, thank you for not thank you for joy, thank you for pain, it's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day, don't fear and fight, let us unite, we get one like so let's make it right, it's a beautiful day, beautiful day, it's a beautiful day and remember to check out BeatO Glucometer, the link for which is given in the description below.
