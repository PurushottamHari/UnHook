00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,720
Ladakh is at a very very high altitude, it is

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,760
16 times higher than Delhi, there is a

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,760
shortage of everything here, there is a shortage of water,

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:29,279
people should not have it here, still

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,239
in every house of our Ladakh, potatoes are

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,480
kept underground for six months, a 6

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,760
feet 7 feet long

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Ghaddar, Radish, Turnip, everything is kept for six months so that

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,840
it does not get spoiled by snow, the Ladha people

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,920
keep it like this, imagine that it

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,600
rains only for 10 to 12 days in the whole year, it is

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,600
so dry here, the highest place of

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
India,

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,840
Hello Sir, we stayed in Ladakh, in the house of this cute local

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,840
couple,

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,200
this thick roti of Ladakh is made of Gad only,

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,600
but it is very thick,

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,360
four times the thickness of our normal roti,

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,880
and this is dal, the normal mixed

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,400
dal, we are currently staying in a homestay, if

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,320
you see this room, it is like a normal

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,240
local house, room

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,040
and right in the middle of it, there is a traditional

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,040
heater,

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,399
because Ladakh is a desert, so

26
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
farming cannot be done here for six months.  So

27
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,600
that's why these local solutions, local ways of

28
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,119
living, help the people here to

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:58,759
eat and live.

30
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,439
If you see the food here, you must have

31
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,880
seen

32
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,479
Thuppa here, what are you making now? I have just made Thuppa, or

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,720

34
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,840
 

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,080
take Gaja, this vegetable, so many vegetables have been prepared

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080

38
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:33,280
When you drink boiled soup, then one glass of

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,599
soup gives heat to your whole body, so

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,879
how efficient it is, you can see everything goes into

41
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,319
it, so a nutritious meal in a single

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,319
vessel

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,480
because the resources are very limited here, so

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,120
we cannot make three pots on three stoves,

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,760
ah one more is happening very well,

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,040

how is it, very good, it's like a tree,

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,680
not like a tree, the food of Ladakh here is very good  It

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,040
was nutritious but

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,879
due to our changing lifestyle in our cities, people

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,120
's health is getting affected, so today

64
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,040
10 crore people in India are diabetic, which means that there is

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,760
a diabetic patient in every third house,

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,519

77
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,280
found out that my sugar level is slightly

78
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,400

Yesterday, Ladakh  How was it made is the most

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,240
interesting thing, millions of years ago the

118
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,319
Ural plate collided with the Indian plate and then the

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,319
mastic mountain

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Himalayas were formed and because of these Himalayas

121
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,960
a rain shadow area is created here

122
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,560
due to which the rain clouds are

123
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,560
unable to reach here, so now where will the water come from,

124
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,500
for this the people here have come

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,600
up with many innovative solutions for years

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,600

127
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,580

artificially, it is man-made, it

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,960
looks beautiful, it is not small, this

133
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:43,919
Ice Tapa behind us has been

134
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,360
formed out of helplessness

135
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,919
because there is a lot of water shortage

136

Oh they have been places who

140
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,919
built a cafe inside this dome, it's a nice cafe inside an Ice

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,919

142
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:31,680
Tapa. To make an Ice Tapa, first of all

143
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,080
a structure of wood is made, it is the wood

144
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,120
from which a complete mold structure is made and through an

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,599
underground pipe,

146
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,519
water is brought from many glaciers

147
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,760
and  They place that pipe right in the middle of this mould.

148
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,519

149
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,480
Now the water from the glacier

150
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,040
comes so fast that it flows straight out of the pipe

151
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,399
and then it meets

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:04,279
-20 - 30 degree Celsius, so the water

153
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,200
freezes completely and then these big

154
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,160
 

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,399
mountains of ice are formed, which is like the biggest storm that has come

156
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,800
last year, it was built only by Thatch, which

157
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,760
conserved 13 million litres of water. This

158
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,079
complete structure that you are seeing was

159
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,720
built in 40 days, it will become bigger now, it will be

160
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,200
quite big now, so why is it that

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,600
so many problem-solving

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,040
solvers come out of Ladakh? Because if there are a lot of problems then there will be a

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,959
lot of solvers too. The

164
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,480
going gets tough, it gets tough. I guess the

165
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,920
lifestyle makes you think that

166
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,279
everything is easily available in tier one cities,

167
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,680
everything is there, there is no need of innovation,

168
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,600
your lifestyle is pretty easy here

169
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,320
in Ladakh, because there used to be so many problems earlier, and

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,360
even now there are so many problems, so that

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
would make you think.  What can we do differently?

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,640
For example, in down plains, we

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,600
use toilets, right? We do our business. We

174
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,640
flush and then we forget about it. What happens to the

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,200
stuff that we flush? In Ladakh, we

176
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,440
have dry composting

177
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,480
toilets. This is the only toilet in India that does

178
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,800
not use water. You will

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,480
find this toilet in every home in Ladakh. Like

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,320
in western toilets, when we defecate,

181
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,000
they have to be taken to septic tanks.

182
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,399
But here,

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,880
fertilizer is produced from human toilets. People defecate on the first floor. The waste is collected

184
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,839
below.

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Grass or dung is put in it so that the

186
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,399
material collected below becomes compost properly.

187
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,800
After years, this manure is collected

188
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,560
and used in the farms here. The

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,300
whole of India can learn from Ladakh

190
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,399
how to save water

191
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,320
[Music]

192
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,200
And still, there is no smell in this toilet.

193
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,200

194
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,040
Oh, this bunch of spinach, this bunch of coriander, coriander too.

195
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,639
Yes, yes, this coriander, this

196
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,000
mint, these strawberries. Gradually, everything will grow

197
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,000
big. They are small. Right now,

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,600
we are small.  We are not proud of the fact that they make ice tops or

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,839
solar buildings.

200
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,440
This is not a big solution.

201
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,600
What can we change with this because the root of these problems is

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,200
here. No, these are small fixes.

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,160
Their roots are in Delhi, London, Mumbai,

204
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:35,480
Beijing. If the people there live a little

205
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,480
simply, we will be able to live.

206
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:47,289
[Music] What will

207
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,120
you tell people about the

208
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,560
good things in Ladakh? There is

209
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,519
snow to see in Ladakh, there are

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,880
apples to see, there is fruit here, there is nothing green here right now in

211
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,760
winter.

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:15,800
Everything will look good at my house. So all of you come, I will

213
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,800
serve you a lot. Take a break or take a

214
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:25,800
break because the altitude is so high here. That's

215
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:29,320
why we were already taking this medicine Diamox

216
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,360
two days ago before leaving.

217
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,360
We have also taken a permit because we have

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,240
come to Ladakh in the off-season. So we have to

219
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,320
take a permit from the government site. No

220
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,959
prepaid phone works here. Only the

221
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,639
local Ladakhi SIM works

222
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,639
or postpaid, that too only on

223
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
airtelhellotunes.in.

224
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,839
I am here. Thank

225
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,720
you, good.

226
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:17,399
[Music]

227
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Afternoon what is this mike, what is

228
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,480
this, tell

229
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:29,320

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,399
me what do you want to become, you are an engineer,

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,519
tell me your ring, show it to the camera,

232
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,519
 

233
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,120
what do you want to become when you grow up, I want to join the

234
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,600
army when I grow up, I want to

235
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,279
join the army, so why do you want to join the army, I like the

236
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
army very much, what does the army do, it

237
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,279

238
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,040
keeps our country safe and why is the security of the country important so that all the

239
00:13:52,279 --> 00:14:00,399
Hindus and Muslims in our India

240
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,900
remain safe, that's why

241
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,160
Kali

242
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,880
[praise]

243
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,320
Jai ma'am, I am a primary level teacher of this school,

244
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,440
so I have a lot of

245
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,880
affection with these small children, that's why

246
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,880
I am in the class, now I am making

247
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
NIPHM so that

248
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,360
our children get the basic

249
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,040
concept, um, I also

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,639
made this, so we keep it in it,

251
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,279
ma'am, skip and keep it in this way, now if we let the

252
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,759
child pick it up through this, then the child will

253
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:52,639
trap it from this, so this

254
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:56,519
triangle will be matching with it,

255
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,199
you saw the three idiots, in that Aamir Khan's

256
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,360
character was as passionate and

257
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,199
passionate, he was for education, in the same way  There are

258
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,240
other teachers in Ladakh too, we got to know this after coming here

259
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,000

260
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,279
and what do you want your children to

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,519
become when they grow up, if everything happens according to my wish, then

262
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,639
I would like that

263
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:19,199
my children

264
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,839
become human beings, when children become human beings,

265
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,360
they become everything else on their own because I have

266
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
stolen dialogues from many films,

267
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,360
unless they become a good citizen, they will not be

268
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,120
able to become a good doctor, they will not be

269
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,480
able to become a good engineer, in school they

270
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,319
teach on smart boards,

271
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,880
these children have got university level facilities, so

272
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,880
we talk about this every day in the classes that

273
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,360

274
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,319
such good facilities have come for you people, if you people do

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,680
not study then you people are unfortunate, I

276
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:53,279
mean that I myself have

277
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,399
come here after studying to teach them, in the same

278
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,199
way, serve your community,

279
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,920
serve your parents, serve others,

280
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,060
become a worthy person, this is enough for a person,

281
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,079
what a thing

282
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,319
[Music] It

283
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,440
felt good to see that in such a unique

284
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,000
place, even in the highest place of India, there is

285
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,839
a school like this  Which

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,920
runs even in winters, in such extreme cold, there is a

287
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,959
school which gives hope that no matter

288
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,560
how many difficulties the nature gives you, the spirit should never

289
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,560
diminish,

290
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:32,360
Lord, I thank you for the sunshine, thank you

291
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:36,600

295
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,880
like so let's make it right, it's a

296
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,519
