I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So you know that a huge tragedy happened with Air India.  One person was saved, no one could kill him because of God.  This is probably the final destination and death is inevitable.  You ca n't do anything. This is a little dim deterministic, not a deterministic theory that maybe it is true that your death is written but it is a very unfortunate incident, one survived, one survived, he was sitting on seat 11A and he jumped before the crash, right, that means the crash happened and he immediately came out from there and after that, his name is Ramesh, maybe he was going and after that people are asking him what happened, how did it happen, it is strange that people are asking instead of helping and he is saying that he was in no condition to tell.  He asked where is my brother? Perhaps his brother Ajay was sitting in the front seat. But what do we know right now?  I had lectures yesterday. One thing, yes friend, see, I cracked this news immediately.  So, there was one thing that I told him wrong.  In that I had said that it was a hospital.   There is a hospital.  Is it okay?  BG Hospital is the biggest hospital in Gujarat brother.   The biggest hospital but the one where the plane crashed was missed.  The doctors were eating food there.  So she missed the hostel. It was basically a canteen.  Right? So this is the thing.  So what do we know so far ?  Now look at this article of Times of India. Times of India has reported that 254 flights have said that there were 242. Now they are saying that there were 254. No problem.  But for now, assume that there were around 250 people.  And she was going to London.  I was going to Gatwick Airport in London. Proper figures have not been released yet. But friends, you should assume that there is only one survivor and the rest are all dead because the plane has fallen so badly and it seems like there is a dual engine failure.  Ok? This is what it appears from looking at it, which happens in very rare cases. This is the first accident of the Dream Liner in India in 2014.  However, many questions continue to arise regarding Boeing.  There is a great documentary on Netflix.  It contains a detailed investigation of the airline crashes that happened in 2018 and recently in Singapore and Indonesia.  And let me tell you that Boeing has even apologized to the American people.  And I gave the description of their whistle blower yesterday and now I will give the description of that lecture again and the link in the comment box that I had made this 6 months ago that Boeing can uproot a plane from the middle, their employees, who were engineers, told me but now this is it, what has happened has happened and what has happened is so dangerous that so many people have lost their lives, such photos are going viral, friends, a family which was going on a vacation, doctor sahib, his three children are sitting, some were saved, some wanted to go in the flight but could not go due to some reason. But this accident is very big, friends.  This is India's biggest aviation disaster.   The biggest one is this Dream Liner, friends, just in 2011, the name of its commercial flights was changed.  Being 787 was named Dream Liner.  It was such a big plane. And Air India, just yesterday friends this news came early in the morning that Tata had acquired Air India and Air India was going into loss.  Tata had it.  Then after that the government acquired it after 1950.  Then Tata acquired Air India and it is in profit. This news came only yesterday because at this time there are only two biggest players. One is Indigo and one is Tata.  That means Air India, these two are in a way a duopoly in the aviation sector and this happened. All the shares have fallen from the ground.  Tata's have already fallen down with a thud.  Boeing shares have also fallen by 7 to 8%. And the whole world is in power.  So now it had two pilots.  Captain Sabarwal and Captain Kunder Vikrant Massey who is an actor, his cousin is Captain Kunder Cyril Kunder, he too has reacted, he has 1100 hours of flying experience and Captain Sabarwal has 8400 hours of flying experience, so the pilots were experienced, there was a problem in the plane itself, there was 10 cabin crew, two pilots, total 12 and this one directly entered here in the canteen, in the mess, the doctors were having food here and look at these, I have photos and videos, I have not uploaded them, they are so disturbing friends, the burnt body of one, I said the head is chopped off, the head is lying there, the whole head got burnt tearing it apart, I mean you can't even imagine and you are telling that when this plane fell, there was so much heat, it is summer season, it is very hot in Gujarat, so the temperature rose so much that no one was able to go, it was a moving missile, there was fuel of lakhs of tonnes, brother, because it was a long distance  It takes approximately 9 to 10 hours if you take the direct flight, this is a shortcut route, so it takes you a lot of time, so this 91 was a moving missile, that is why it was a long route airplane and this is what we got to see, so this accident took place at around 1:39, approximately at 1:30 pm, 1:39 pm, and you can see it as it took off. Everyone must have seen the video. So he could not take off and this is the most crucial part.  I will make another lecture on this also.  Is it Boeing's, I will cover all the details in it. But now in this lecture I will tell you what we have found out.  I will not mix the two.  It will be uploaded today. So what has happened in this is that immediately as soon as med A is said, med A, it is a French word.  Isn't it?  From Med Air and from there it came Med A which means it is a very emergency situation.  Save the relief worker.  So first of all this is the last call, it is an emergency call, you must have often heard of may day, may day, so may day was immediately given to the ATC but before the ATC could respond, the plane crashed and it could not reach very high altitude, so dual engine failure, there are two engines in an airplane, if one fails then the other will work but it seems that here both the engines have failed and there were 169 Indians in it.  Ok?  If we talk, there were 53 British nationals.  One was a Canadian national and seven were Portuguese.  Now the video of two Britishers in this is going viral. He just came to India for a visit and is saying that now we are going back.  So you can see this. Look, it has flown in this manner.  This plane has flown.  Is it okay ?  This plane flew.  Look at this.  This is yesterday 's video and after that, now see, whenever planes fly, they take off very fast.  But now it has flown and it will go down immediately.  Look at this, he could not even attain height.  Ok?  Where it had to go all the way up.  One thing is heavy - plane. And Boeing says that it is a very cheap and 20% fuel efficient plane.  And its parts are very light.  So see, it fell completely down and look at this, yesterday as soon as the impact happened, friends, the blast due to the impact was so terrible, I then realised that it is very difficult to survive but we were praying for this and we are still praying that the people in this should come out safely, the ex-CM Vijay Runi was also there and a lady was sitting in front of him, she has also posted a photo that Vijay Runi is travelling with us in the business class.  He is the second CM who died in a plane crash.  Who was first, tell me in the comment box.  The accident happened in 1965. So that's it.  Was going to London to meet my daughter. But now his daughter is coming here to Ahmedabad.  It is a game of fate, meaning after seeing all this one feels what a thing it is. life your live.  Meaning, every single day, as much as possible, it feels like what is it, one moment you are laughing and playing and the next moment absolutely no one would have thought of it but this is the last day friends, today is the last day of Dark Psychology, so you can use the positive coupon code, it is a course of ₹500, then tomorrow it will become ₹1000, so the link is given in the comment box, so 200 bodies have been recovered till now and only one is the survivor, rest all have died, it is being told, Ahmedabad Police Commissioner GS Malik has said that 200 bodies have been recovered till now.  Only one survivor has been found and it is not yet known how many people have died in the college on which the plane collapsed.  How many people died in that ?  How many doctors have died?  Because here the resident doctors were having their meals and very horrific scenes were visible everywhere.  Now is there clarity now?  What happened?  Don't know.  Not yet.  No clarity what soever.  That black box will come.  Only after investigation will we know what has happened.  The aircraft is the same as we told you, it was being flown by Captain Sumit Sabharwal and Clive Kunder, both of whom had considerable experience.   It was quite a good experience.  Jock John Medmit is a professor at New York University. This shows that it could not fly very high.  It is obvious that something severe and rotten must have happened in these 200 meters.  Something severe and rotten has happened.  The Jets usefully have a backup system.  Such crushes brother, he makes 2100 flights every day.  It is a dream liner and flights are flying every day.  It is said that one such incident occurs one in millions or lakhs.  So jets always have a backup system and the jets' props are checked before flying. Engineers come and check whether everything is working properly or not. Ok? So, BJ Medical College is right here, Meghani Nagar, just when you cross the airport, it is completely different, after crossing the other side Meghani Nagar comes and this BJ Medical College here is a very prestigious medical college, it is one of the biggest medical colleges of Gujarat, right, so this college is spread over 100 acres, it has collapsed here and after that some of the residents here got injured.  There were five- floor buildings nearby that also caught our attention because a very horrific loud explosion took place here and it is being said that five doctors have been killed in this and how many more, I told you that the complete figures have not been released yet, such pictures were visible here.  It has entered completely.  This tail has gone inside and this mouth has come forward.  And all other things, the fuses flew away somewhere else.  They were telling that when this accident happened, New York Times has reported that five students have died but 60 to 80 students who were there were inside because see, it was lunch time yesterday, around 1:40, this plane crashed, so at that time most of the doctors were having lunch, everyone was in the canteen, okay, and the surrounding areas have also been affected very badly. Rescue operations are underway right now but there was so much smoke yesterday that rescue operations could not be carried out.  People could not even go inside.   The NDRF, SDRF team is so much, okay, the rest of the UK, America, they all have said that we will investigate it, we will cooperate with India, okay and this entire route was from Ahmedabad to London, you can see they had to reach here but it could not happen, it was a flight of 7-8-9 hours and this plane crashed but the dream of the Dream Liner, that came to an end, let me tell you that Boeing has sold 2500 Dream Liner till now and I told you that America and France are the two countries which have duo poly in the aviation sector, these two countries are making planes and in that Boeing and Airbus, further you sit in Indigo, which are small planes in which there is no business task, now Indigo has also started giving business task, it is their Air Bus, so they gave 47 to Air India as well, just as soon as Tata acquired Air India, although a lot of complaints keep coming, friends, I liked Air India Express very much but Air India A lot of complaints keep coming regarding this.  Now it is obvious that Tata had acquired it just now and it has been one and a half years.  Slowly and slowly he will move forward.  He will renovate them further.  But just yesterday a video is going viral. A man travelled in this same flight and he is showing how bad the service is.  No, nothing is going on.  You can look at the seats.  So all this has happened.  Dreamliners started flying in 2013, 2013, 2011. And in 2013 he said that some Dreamliners will not fly.  Why? Because battery issues were found in it. However there was no injury.  But Boeing shares fell 8% at that time and are still falling.  Is it okay?  This accident which happened in it was delivered in 2014 and it is the smallest one.  This is the smallest of the three variants.  It can accommodate 248 passengers. And they are saying that it is always overbooked.  Even just a day before, when its flight was scheduled, it was overbooked.  Is it okay?  And issues had come up at that time also. 26 passengers were disembarked.  He was put up in a five star hotel and the next day he was sent to London.  Told this.  So, this is the first crash of Boeing since its debut, but other variants have also been crashing, friends, it gets stuck these days, I don't know what has happened, so these things, now see, if we talk about compensation in this, then compensation of Rs 1 crore has been announced, Tata has said that we will give compensation of Rs 1 crore, currently its owner Chandrasekaran has said that we will give this thing and has said that look, we cannot express it in any words whatever happened, brother, we cannot compensate the loss that the families have suffered, but currently, Tata has said about all the medical expenses and compensation of Rs 1 crore. Now is this the first crash in Ahmedabad the answer is no. Friends, crashes have happened before also.  This is the second major air tragedy.  See October 1988, before the year 2000, incidents of plane hijacking were very common and along with plane hijacking, incidents of plane crashes were also very common here.  Is it okay ?  So this was also quite common that planes kept crashing.  At that time also there were 135 people on board and 133 people lost their lives and it flew and fell for 2.5 km.  He had an accident on the air strip. So this is not the first major air crash.  After that is the flight restored?  The answer is no.  Currently, Ahmedabad airport is not closed but very limited operations are going on.  When this accident happened, the entire surrounding area was closed.  The airport was closed. But right now, only limited flights are flying and passengers are being told to keep checking.  If you are going from Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Ahmedabad then keep checking regularly.  Is it okay? So this is it.  Friends, in 2018 also, this crash of 73 Max Boeing happened in which 346 out of 350 people were killed. In 2004, the FAA, which is their aviation authority, the Federal Aviation Authority of America, had said that the main fuselage section of the 787 should be removed, the fuselage wings should be removed.  Remove the tail.  The rest of the plane is the fuselage section where you sit.  So I am telling you that it might break in the middle.  I will lecture on that, friends, and I had made the first lecture on that just 6 months ago. I will give you its link in the description.  Is it okay?  So that's it.  Rest of the friends, whatever happens, I will tell you.  As of now, this is all we have come to know about the tragedy that has happened.  I will give another lecture on this. In that I will go into the technical details. Friends, I have given the link to Dark Psychology in the description comment box. today is the last day.  Today we will be running out of coupon codes.  Then the sale will come after two-three months. So if you want to complete that course then you can complete it. Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off.
