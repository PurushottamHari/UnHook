1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,560
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,280
you know that a

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,039
huge tragedy happened with Air India.  One person was saved, no

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,960
one could kill him because of God.  This is

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
probably the final destination and

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,119
death is inevitable.  You ca

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
n't do anything.

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,320
This is a little dim deterministic, not a

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,519
deterministic theory that maybe it is true that

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,000
your death is written but it is a very

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,960
unfortunate incident, one survived, one

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,920
survived, he was sitting on seat 11A and

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,399
he jumped before the crash, right, that means the crash happened

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,040
and he immediately came out from there and after that, his

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,000
name is Ramesh, maybe he was going

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,480
and after that people are asking him

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
what happened, how did it happen, it is strange that people are

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,800
asking instead of helping

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,160
and he is saying that he was

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
in no condition to tell.  He asked where is my brother?

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,480
Perhaps his brother Ajay was sitting in the front seat.

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,080
But

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,799
what do we know right now?  I had lectures yesterday.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,040
One thing, yes friend, see,

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,439
I cracked this news immediately.  So, there was

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
one thing that I told him wrong.  In that

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
I had said that it was a hospital.   There

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
is a hospital.  Is it okay?  BG Hospital

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
is the biggest hospital in Gujarat brother.   The

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
biggest hospital but the one where the plane

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,040
crashed was missed.  The doctors were

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,159
eating food there.  So she missed the hostel.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
It was basically a canteen.  Right?

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
So this is the thing.  So what do we know so far

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,880
?  Now look at this article of Times of India.

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,159
Times of India has

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,640
reported that 254 flights have said that there were 242.

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
Now they are saying that there were 254.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
No problem.  But for now, assume that there were

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
around 250 people.  And she was going to London.  I was

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
going to Gatwick Airport in London.

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
Proper figures have not been released yet.

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,920
But friends, you should assume that there is

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
only one survivor and the rest are all dead

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,399
because the plane has fallen so badly

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,040
and it seems like there is a dual

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
engine failure.  Ok?

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
This is what it appears from looking at it, which happens in very rare

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,960
cases.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
This is the

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,319
first accident of the Dream Liner in India in 2014.  However,

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
many questions continue to arise regarding Boeing.  There

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
is a great documentary on Netflix.  It contains a

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,959

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,599

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,800
detailed investigation of the airline crashes that happened in 2018 and recently in Singapore and Indonesia.  And let me tell you

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,040
that Boeing has even apologized

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,879
to the American people.  And I gave the description of their whistle blower

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
yesterday and now I will give the description of that lecture again

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
and the link in the comment box that

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,080
I had made this 6 months ago that

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Boeing can uproot a plane from the middle, their

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,599
employees, who were engineers, told me

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
but now this is it, what has happened has happened and

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,560
what has happened is so dangerous that so many

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,560
people have lost their lives, such photos are going viral,

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
friends, a family which was

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
going on a vacation, doctor sahib, his three children are

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,560
sitting, some were saved, some

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,319
wanted to go in the flight but could not go due to some reason.

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
But this accident is very big, friends.  This

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,440
is India's biggest aviation disaster.   The

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,840
biggest one is this Dream Liner, friends, just

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,480
in 2011, the name of its commercial flights was

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,959
changed.  Being 787 was

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,920
named Dream Liner.  It was such a big plane.

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
And Air India, just yesterday friends this news

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,840
came early in the morning that

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
Tata had acquired Air India

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,480
and Air India was going into loss.  Tata

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,239
had it.  Then after that the government

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
acquired it after 1950.  Then Tata

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,200
acquired Air India and it is in profit.

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
This news came only yesterday because at this

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
time there are only two biggest players.

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,680
One is Indigo and one is Tata.  That means Air

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,920
India, these two are in a way a duopoly

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
in the aviation sector and this happened.

91
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,480
All the shares have fallen from the ground.  Tata's have already fallen down

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,480
with a thud.  Boeing shares have also fallen by 7 to 8%.

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,360
And the whole world is

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,799
in power.  So now it had two

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,120
pilots.  Captain Sabarwal and Captain

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
Kunder Vikrant Massey who is an actor, his

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,200
cousin is Captain Kunder Cyril Kunder,

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
he too has reacted, he has 1100 hours of

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,040
flying experience and Captain Sabarwal has

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,280
8400 hours of flying

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,000
experience, so the pilots were experienced, there was a

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,920
problem in the plane itself, there was 10

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,160
cabin crew, two pilots, total 12 and this one

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,479
directly entered here in the canteen,

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,720
in the mess, the doctors were having food here

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,360
and look at these, I have photos and videos, I have

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,759
not uploaded them, they are so disturbing

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,759
friends, the burnt body of one,

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,639
I said the head is chopped off, the head is lying there, the

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,040
whole head got burnt tearing it apart, I mean you can't

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
even imagine and you are telling that

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,280
when this plane fell, there was so much heat, it is

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
summer season, it is very hot in Gujarat, so the

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,759
temperature rose so much that no one was able to go, it was a

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,880
moving missile, there was

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,280
fuel of lakhs of tonnes, brother,

118
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,199
because it was a long distance  It takes approximately 9 to 10 hours

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
if you take the direct flight,

120
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,479
this is a shortcut route, so it takes you a lot of

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,759
time, so

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,360
this 91 was a moving missile, that is why it was a long

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,520
route airplane

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,759
and this is what we got to see, so

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,840
this accident took place at around 1:39, approximately at 1:30 pm, 1:39 pm,

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
and you can see it as it took off.

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,759
Everyone must have seen the video.

128
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,680
So he could not take off and this is the

129
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
most crucial part.  I will

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
make another lecture on this also.  Is it Boeing's,

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
I will cover all the details in it.

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
But now in this lecture I will

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
tell you what we have found out.  I

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
will not mix the two.  It will be uploaded today.

135
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
So what has happened in this is that immediately

136
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
as soon as med A is said, med A, it

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,960
is a French word.  Isn't it?  From Med Air and from

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,160
there it came Med A which means it is a very emergency

139
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,880
situation.  Save the relief worker.  So first of all this is

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,520
the last call, it is an emergency call,

141
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,320
you must have often heard of may day, may day,

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
so may day was immediately given to the ATC but

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,240
before the ATC could respond, the

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,680
plane crashed and it

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,000
could not reach very high altitude, so dual engine

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,280
failure, there are two engines in an airplane, if

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,880
one fails then the other will work but it

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
seems that here both the engines have

149
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,080
failed and there were 169

150
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Indians in it.  Ok?  If we talk, there were

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,120
53 British nationals.  One was a Canadian national

152
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
and seven were Portuguese.  Now the video of two Britishers in this is going

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
viral.

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,960
He just came to India for a visit and is saying that

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
now we are going back.  So

156
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,080
you can see this.

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Look, it has flown in this manner.  This plane has flown.  Is it okay

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,960
?  This plane flew.  Look at this.  This is yesterday

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,240
's video

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,319
and after that, now see,

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
whenever planes fly, they

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,240
take off very fast.  But now it has flown

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,199
and it will go down immediately.  Look at this, he could

164
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
not even attain height.  Ok?  Where it had to

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
go all the way up.  One thing is heavy - plane.

166
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,160
And

167
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,560
Boeing says that it is a very cheap and 20%

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,199
fuel efficient plane.  And its

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,960
parts are very light.  So see, it

170
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,039
fell completely down and look at this,

171
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
yesterday as soon as the impact happened, friends, the

172
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
blast due to the impact was so terrible,

173
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,360
I then realised that it is very difficult to

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,280
survive but we were praying for this

175
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,479
and we are still praying that the

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,800
people in this should come out safely, the

177
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,880
ex-CM Vijay Runi was also there

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,919
and a lady was sitting in front of him, she has

179
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,520
also posted a photo that

180
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
Vijay Runi is travelling with us in the business class.  He is the

181
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,160
second CM who

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
died in a plane crash.  Who was first,

184
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
tell me in the comment box.  The accident happened in 1965.

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,880
So that's it.  Was going to London to meet my daughter.

187
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,599
But now his daughter is

188
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,759
coming here to Ahmedabad.  It is a game of fate,

189
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,120
meaning after seeing all this one feels what a thing it is.

190
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,000
life your live.  Meaning, every single day, as much as possible, it

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
feels like what is it, one moment you are

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,680
laughing and playing and the next moment absolutely no

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
one would have thought of it but this is the

194
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
last day friends, today is the last day of Dark Psychology,

195
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,400
so you can use the positive coupon code, it

196
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,479
is a course of ₹500, then tomorrow it will become ₹1000, so the

197
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,520
link is given in the comment box, so 200

198
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,919
bodies have been recovered till now and

199
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,919
only one is the survivor, rest

200
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
all have died, it is being told,

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,560
Ahmedabad Police Commissioner GS Malik has said

202
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,720
that 200 bodies have been recovered till now.  Only

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,039
one survivor has been

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
found and it is not yet known

205
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,159

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,680
how many people have died in the college on which the plane collapsed.  How many people died in that

207
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,760
?  How many doctors have died?  Because

208
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,640
here the resident doctors were

209
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
having their meals and very horrific scenes were

210
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
visible everywhere.  Now is there

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,600
clarity now?  What happened?  Don't know.  Not

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,680
yet.  No clarity what soever.  That black

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,080
box will come.  Only after investigation will we know

214
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
what has happened.  The aircraft is the

215
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
same as we told you, it was being flown by Captain Sumit

216
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,399
Sabharwal and Clive Kunder, both of

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
whom had considerable experience.   It was

218
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,800
quite a good experience.  Jock John

219
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,959
Medmit is a professor at New York University.

220
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,519
This shows that it could not fly very high.  It is

221
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,920
obvious that

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,480
something severe and rotten must have happened in these 200 meters.  Something

223
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,160
severe and rotten has happened.  The Jets usefully have a

224
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,480
backup system.  Such crushes brother,

225
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,839
he makes 2100 flights every day.  It is a dream liner

226
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,519
and flights are flying every day.  It is

227
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,600
said that one such

228
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,680
incident occurs one in millions or lakhs.  So

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
jets always have a backup system

230
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,240
and the jets' props are checked before flying.

231
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,680
Engineers come and check whether

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,519
everything is working properly or not.

233
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Ok?

234
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,040
So, BJ Medical College is right here,

235
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Meghani Nagar, just when you cross the airport, it is

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,279
completely different, after crossing the other side Meghani

237
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
Nagar comes and this BJ Medical

238
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,959
College here is a very prestigious medical college,

239
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,519
it is one of the biggest medical

240
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,920
colleges of Gujarat, right, so

241
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,720
this college is spread over 100 acres,

242
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,560
it has collapsed here and after that some of the

243
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,399
residents here got injured.  There were five-

244
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,480
floor buildings nearby that also

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
caught our attention because a very horrific loud

246
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,440
explosion took place here and it is being said

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,800
that five doctors have been killed

248
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,560
in this and how many more, I told you

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,640
that the complete figures have not been released yet, such pictures were

250
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,399

251
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,800
visible here.  It has

252
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,160
entered completely.  This tail has

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,959
gone inside and this mouth has come forward.  And all other

254
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,360
things, the fuses flew away somewhere else.  They were

255
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
telling that when this

256
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,920
accident happened, New York Times has reported

257
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
that five students have died

258
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,480
but 60 to 80 students who were there were

259
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,160
inside because see, it was lunch

260
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,000
time yesterday, around 1:40, this

261
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,480
plane crashed, so at that time most of the

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,760
doctors were having lunch, everyone was in the canteen,

263
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,519
okay, and the surrounding areas have also been

264
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,440
affected very badly.

265
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,440
Rescue operations are underway right now but there was so

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
much smoke yesterday that rescue operations could

267
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,000
not be carried out.  People could not even go inside.   The

268
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
NDRF, SDRF team is so much, okay, the

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,880
rest of the UK, America, they all have

270
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
said that we will investigate it, we

271
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,320
will cooperate with India, okay and this

272
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,480
entire route was from Ahmedabad to London,

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,040
you can see they had to reach here

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
but it could not happen, it was a flight of 7-8-9 hours

275
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,600
and this plane crashed

276
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,560
but the dream of the Dream Liner, that came

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,800
to an end, let me tell you that Boeing has

278
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,959
sold 2500 Dream Liner till now and

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,200
I told you that America and France are the

280
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,040
two countries which have duo poly

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,839
in the aviation sector, these two countries are making planes

282
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,600
and in that Boeing and Airbus,

283
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
further you sit in Indigo, which are

284
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
small planes in which there is no

285
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,959
business task, now Indigo has also

286
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,800
started giving business task, it is their Air

287
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,800
Bus, so they gave 47 to Air India

288
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
as well, just as soon as Tata acquired Air India,

289
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,760
although a lot of complaints

290
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
keep coming, friends, I liked Air India Express

291
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,680
very much but Air India

292
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
A lot of complaints keep coming regarding this.  Now it is

293
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,079
obvious that Tata had acquired it just now and it has been

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
one and a half years.  Slowly and slowly he will

295
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,519
move forward.  He will renovate them further.  But just

296
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,360
yesterday a video is going viral.

297
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
A man travelled in this same flight and he is showing

298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
how bad the service is.  No,

299
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,959
nothing is going on.  You can look at the seats.  So

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,800
all this has happened.  Dreamliners

301
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,320
started flying in 2013, 2013, 2011.

302
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,680
And in 2013 he said that some Dreamliners will

303
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
not fly.  Why?

304
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
Because battery issues were found in it.

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
However there was no injury.  But

306
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
Boeing shares fell 8% at that time and are still falling.  Is it

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
okay?  This accident which happened in

308
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
it was delivered in 2014

309
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
and it is the smallest one.  This

310
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,720
is the smallest of the three variants.  It can accommodate 248 passengers.

311
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
And they are saying that it is

312
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
always overbooked.  Even just a day

313
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,200
before, when its flight was scheduled, it was overbooked.  Is it

314
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,519
okay?  And issues had come up at that time also.

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,519
26 passengers were disembarked.  He was

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
put up in a five star hotel and the next

317
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,920
day he was sent to London.  Told this.  So,

318
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,120
this is the first crash of Boeing since its debut,

319
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,800
but other variants have also been

320
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,880
crashing, friends, it gets stuck

321
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,880
these days, I don't know what has

322
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,440
happened, so these things, now see,

323
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,480
if we talk about compensation in this, then

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,720
compensation of Rs 1 crore has been announced,

325
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,560
Tata has said that we will give compensation of Rs 1 crore,

326
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,079
currently its owner

327
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,200
Chandrasekaran has said that we will

328
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,360
give this

329
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
thing and has said that look,

330
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,600
we cannot express it in any words whatever happened,

331
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,680
brother, we

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,480
cannot compensate the loss that the families have suffered, but

333
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,639
currently, Tata has said about all the medical expenses and

334
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,600
compensation of Rs 1 crore.

335
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,760
Now is this the first crash

336
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,079
in Ahmedabad the answer is no.

337
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,920
Friends, crashes have happened before also.  This is the second major

338
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,480
air tragedy.  See October 1988,

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,959
before the year 2000, incidents of plane hijacking were

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,720
very common and

341
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
along with plane hijacking, incidents of plane crashes were

342
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
also very common here.  Is it okay

343
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,160
?  So this was also quite common that

344
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,880
planes kept crashing.  At that

345
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,519
time also there were 135 people on board and 133

346
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
people lost their lives and it flew and fell for 2.5

347
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,680
km.  He had an accident on the air strip.

348
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,399
So this is not the

349
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,680
first major air crash.  After that is the

350
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,760
flight restored?  The answer is no.  Currently,

351
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
Ahmedabad airport is not closed but very

352
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,800
limited operations are going on.  When

353
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
this accident happened, the entire surrounding area was

354
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,160
closed.  The airport was closed.

355
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,079
But right now, only limited flights are

356
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
flying and passengers are being told to keep

357
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
checking.  If you are

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,040
going from Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Ahmedabad then

359
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,839
keep checking regularly.  Is it okay?

360
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,160
So this is it.  Friends, in 2018 also,

361
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,680
this crash of 73 Max Boeing happened in which

362
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,639
346 out of 350 people were killed.

363
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,120
In 2004, the FAA, which is their aviation authority, the

364
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,760
Federal Aviation Authority of America, had

365
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,680
said that the main fuselage section of the 787 should be removed, the

366
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
fuselage wings should be

367
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,360
removed.  Remove the tail.  The rest

368
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,399
of the plane is the fuselage section where you

369
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,160
sit.  So I am telling you that it

370
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,839
might break in the middle.  I will lecture on that,

371
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,079
friends, and I had made the first lecture on that just 6 months ago.

372
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,240
I will give you its link

373
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
in the description.  Is it okay?  So

374
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,079
that's it.  Rest of the friends, whatever happens, I will

375
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,480
tell you.  As of now, this is all we have come to know about the

376
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
tragedy that has happened.  I will give another lecture on this.

377
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,079
In that I will

378
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,920
go into the technical details.

379
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
Friends, I have given the link to Dark Psychology in the description comment box.

380
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
today is the last day.  Today we will be

381
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
running out of coupon codes.  Then the sale will come after two-three months.

382
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,120
So if you want to complete that course

383
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
then you can complete it.

384
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,199
Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,199
Agnihotri signing off.
