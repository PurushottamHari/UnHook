Tell us about your first flirting experience.   There was one too many. Hi my name is Aditya.  I definitely get nervous.  Look, if a person says nervous, then he says that he does not feel nervous.  But there is such a vibe in which it just happens. These people are not talking about any JE exam.  Rather, these people are feeling shy because they are being asked how flirting happens?  And it is not their fault either because where is our country learning floating from?  From the movies.   I have just entered the locality.  Let me find out a little , let me know a little, when I reach the door of the house , I will also take the permission.  The characters of these movies are extremely confident and can impress girls very easily. You see the majority of the stuff happening?  You see it there for the first time.  First hand, I too like the girl if you do this.  But things are different in real life. People are very nervous in real life. He is sweating profusely and thinking, brother, if I make a mistake then what will happen to me.  And I am saying this from my personal experience, from my first and only date.  The first time I tried flirting with her was when I texted her.  I sent an SMS with a hello and a few exception marks.  So there are two-three exclamations in it.  This was a strategic decision because I wanted to show to her that I am so excited to meet her but the story that was told after many years is that in my hello there were 15 exclamation words or 15 years later that story got revised it was from the stoy hello 10 exclamation words there were two and three exclamation words and honestly no one has taught you what to do at the most important moment of life. Basically, no one teaches.  Nobody teaches. So the only place that you can learn from to like when you're smaller when you're younger is through movies and like TV shows.  But Aditya is speaking absolutely the truth.  Our society will talk about everything. We will peek inside each other's houses. But if the topic of romance comes up then he remains completely silent.  In fact, we thought that it would be very easy to find a subject for this video.  There are so many young people, anyone can be found.  But no, some people are afraid of what their girlfriend or boyfriend will say and other people are afraid of what their parents will say.  But thankfully many people agreed to tell us how to flirt in our country? So come let's go to a special video where you will be given a master class on how to flirt. Flirting for me I think it has to be settled.  Flirting is equal to settling for me. You cannot be obvious.  Anything that makes me laugh.  I don't do flirting. I'm a little funny.  I mean, people know me, so I joke a lot. So maybe flattery might have happened in that too. When you like someone, one way to tell them that yes I like you is instead of being very straight forward.  For me, it's the small gestures he's doing for me. For example, just do something for me or even bring me a glass of water.  When he knows that I want it but I am not saying anything. And he should make some such gesture at that time. Now all these people are saying different things.  But two things that are common in all his words are subtle and natural.  No matter how much direct approach the hero and heroine use in Bollywood, flirting has the opposite effect.  Patrick King shows in his book The Science of Attraction that flirting is a way of signaling to others that you are romantically interested in them.  But this thing cannot be done by shouting.  Rather it is done as a hidden signal.  So flirting is a way of giving a signal to your romantic partner that may not be a very clear signal.  And that's why flirting is so complicated, because if you give signals too directly, people might creep out. Flirting is a balance between charming and creepy.  Just don't be creepy about it.  Like go up to them.  Some what there up to ass for coffee.  Keep it low stakes, keep it chill and like yourself.  I should say that it's generalizing but a lot of men approaching women are mostly they do not know what they are doing first.  Secondly, sometimes they do more and sometimes they do less. They are trying to act cool.  So, a lot of mistakes happen.  So basically to do good flirting you have to decide how indirect or direct your signals should be.  If you go too direct then there are chances of rejection, which everyone shies away from. One thing comes in every boy's mind that I should not get rejected because whether she will say yes or not is a matter for later.  But if you get rejected by her then your morale will go down and you will think why did she reject me ?  Then you will work on yourself and see yourself.  So, if some guys get rejected by three or four girls, even if they look good, they will automatically start feeling that there is something lacking in themselves.  Many people believe that flirting is like a play and that you have to memorize lines and deliver a performance. Because if this performance is not perfect then you will fail. But because of this performance, your partner will never know what kind of person you actually are because remember, you are performing.  You are not doing it naturally. Hi.  Hi.  Hi. Your eyes are a different world in which we get lost. Ok have a seat up.  This performance can cause two problems.  If your performance gets rejected, you will develop self-doubt.  And even if it works, you will be constantly under pressure to play the same character every time.  It's better to be natural and authentic.  Now this is very easy for me to say but obviously it is very difficult to do.  But it is important for you to know that one thing is very important because first impressions matter.  Yes, I think first impression very much matters.  I mean, if I'm meeting someone and that person ca n't even give me a handshake, then I feel like I would be a little taken back.  So first impressions do matter. But what does it mean?  This means that you should like the perfume.  Your teeth should be absolutely white or you should tell a funny joke in 3 minutes. Wait a second.  When we asked people about first impressions they said that first impressions do matter but not the ones we think Bollywood taught us.  Actually One Very Cute Plating Experience The First Dinner Tape That We Went Onto At The Italian Restaurant. Mohak asked one of her girlfriends how to use all the different forms of cutlery.  SOAP [MUSIC] Or like I had no idea where to put the folk if it was going to be a formal dinner ?  How to drink soup?  I had absolutely no idea.  So I was very nervous for that date.  So I asked my friend how to use all these things?  And she's like you're going to eat pizza dude.  Like you don't need to be so. Or but I found that effort very sweet.   If we believe in Bollywood then love happens at first sight. Be it due to rain or due to collision with each other.  But in real life, first impression is not the moment when you see your partner for the first time. Rather, it is the moment when you talk to them.  First time, second time, third time.  If I feel at the first time that this person has no depth or he does not know how to talk or this person will not understand and is not vibing at the what do I say at the level that I want the person I want to date to vibe, then I will get turned off at once and I will not give him a chance again, but if in the first impression you seem to me that yes, okay you have potential, then I will give you a chance. The truth is that people put a lot of pressure on themselves regarding the first impression.  But people do n't connect with each other because of who told what joke in the first 3 minutes; rather, they connect through conversation. So give yourself time.  Bollywood has just two hours to show a love story. But in real life you should have patience and give yourself time to wipe yourself with your partner.  Do n't put pressure on yourself to talk too much but try to understand others. What is his body language like and what is he saying. Nice clip bye. Thank you. [MUSIC] And how are you liking this meeting?  Yes definitely.  I think girls only like that kind of stuff.  The one who is noticing your small things, I think he is not even flirting with you a little bit. I think people who flirt a lot generally don't notice many things about you. And the small things that we are observing, in a conversation like this, those things are just sliding away.  I think those people are more attractive in any way.  Everyone has a boundary that yes, with so much flirting that person would reciprocate but after a point he becomes uncomfortable.  It seems that whatever this friend says, he always flirts.  Meaning he always gives compliments. So that's not, that's not normal.   I understand that you are trying hard. And even the boys know this thing deep inside. But unfortunately their conditioning is such that they try to heart.  Look, the first impression is that if you have to make an impression in front of a girl then the first thing you will have to do is to be as confident as possible in front of her and don't let her feel that she should not make such gestures like boys do, that she should look at you.  Mind your own business. Keep it as normal as you can.  Now you will say that what do these single people know about first impressions ?  So let's talk to Aditi and Sunny who have been in a relationship for eight years. When they met for the first time, Aditi did not think much about first impressions but today they both are happily married.  The first time we met four days after my birthday.  She was wearing an over size t-shirt and a capri I actually went to completely you know make him feel whether he does it or not, I have not seen him but however I could see that spark in her eyes which I was more attracted to then I could see tears like this coming on her you know in her eyes and by the way she asked me if I would like to eat something, I refused, okay I am ordering for myself. I was hungry plus and later on she told me that no she had a bad day and everything and she had a fight with a friend okay like okay so no problem it's okay fine by the end of it or mean she had a smile on a face I was able to make a smile that has been my job for the past With our second couple Nidhish and Nivedita also there was a perfect first impression very intelligent very smart tell me the truth okay when he first saw me.  He thought that I would not be that interesting.  Must be.  Yes.   He thought I was not a very political person.   He didn't really think he would hit it off with me.  Then what has changed?  Meaning our first date was like three hours long. And I don't think I've ever been able to sustain a conversation like that with anyone I know let alone like a person I've met for the first time.  So that was my impression of him.  Like someone who is who makes it really comfortable for me to just be myself.  The story of these two couples exactly matches what Thomas Smitherman says in his book that first impressions can be average.  Average does not mean that you impressed her so much that she went crazy about you. Rather, average means that you were natural and authentic.  Didn't have a very bad impression. And there is room in the future.  Movies will make you feel that the girl should fall in love at first impression otherwise we will fail.  But it is not like that.  But you should also remember that a bad impression can definitely spoil everything.  I mean, whether the first impression is mind blowing or not, that doesn't matter to me. But if it is very bad then it is not okay.  There must be dissent. If I feel in the first impression that I don't want to talk to someone then it wo n't be possible.  Look, social skills do matter.  You have to laugh.   You have to make the other person laugh.  Curiosity has to be shown.  As you would always show up like smiling and very genuine.  So the NA I got was like this someone who was morally interested in me and not trying to act cool and do some gimmicks to impress me.  And basically you have to make your partner feel comfortable.  If you make someone feel weak then it is not easy to recover from there. Not just for flirting.  I think for the entire relationship. Being able to lift up another person's mood and make them smile is not something that everybody can do at.  The Ability to Make Your Partner Smile Laugh.  Such random smiles from the bottom of their heart titleiest laughter. Very very nice.  Now I have given you all this knowledge but here a problem arises. Dating apps. Dating apps have spoilt the whole thing because there is so much competition hence the pressure to make a first impression.  In dating apps where people swipe left and right, you have to compress your entire personality into a profile in half a second.  Even if the profiles match, you have to impress through chat because who knows your partner might start messaging someone else. Which Fruit Loves Go On Slides. But the issue is that dating apps are also unpredictable.  Tanvi told that using the apps was just a one or two day phase for her. I have a very very interesting story.  So, my face comes when I download Tinder for just two days or Hinge, Bumble, any dating app, okay, so once there was an Australian, he was so cute, man, there was such a lovely boy in pink color, I really enjoyed seeing him, so I just told him, I mean, we matched, we started talking and he was totally like brother, now the room has been booked, you come, okay, I said no no, but I am scared, I do n't have the courage to go anywhere, I flirt like this, but from a distance, so he generally called me.  I said no no no no I am not like that.  I was just saying oh you are so cute.  So I said it and he said this and unmatched it. For some people, these abs are just a temporary excuse. While for other people it's a way they can finally talk. Adri explained this well.  The biggest advantage after the advent of dating apps is that there are people who actually have personality and who can chat well.  So some people are such that maybe they don't mean they don't want to be able to impress people in front of them, they might be introverted people and or they don't know how to express themselves that much or they may not be the prettiest one in the room but their humor is very good or they can talk very well or like their texting game is strong, so if something like this happens then he gets a chance that that person puts his personality out first, basically if you are introverted or not conventionally attractive then dating apps can help you because in pictures even then you can tweak a little bit here and there and make yourself look presentable. But what you are talking about, the text you are typing and the way you are approaching someone, you cannot change that.  So from there, those people get a chance who have the potential to impress someone with their words.  So that is a huge advantage with I Wood.  This is of course a simplistic view.  But there is a pressure of performance on these dating apps also.  You are judged every second.  Every photo and every comment is analyzed 10 times. Dating abs is a slightly completely different scale or level.  You don't know how the other person will perceive the line you are going to say. Because you know zero about him.  It's a trial and something else.  You may try it, it works. Otherwise you flattered in a general way that or like nice fans like you notice something in their photo like which someone else would notice because but you notice it so or Aditya says that the conversations that happen on these apps are very surface level but you have to work very hard to move ahead, people started using dating apps so that there would be less judgement and we would be able to find our partner easily but actually there is a lot of judgement in these apps, that was the part of dating where you would first know the person and then date.  That has something gone away here and there.  Now you date first and then you understand the human being that no friend, this is not my time.  I won't be able to do this.  And now dating apps have developed a reputation of their own. Dating app I think is very unpopular in India because that has also become a place for just you know situations and one night stands.  And more sexual than relationship stuff.  Aditi also said a practical thing that given the kind of life we ​​have, it is very difficult to meet people.  So that gives you a platform to meet people.  Otherwise, every day you are going to the same office and meeting the same people. So where will I find a human being ?  So when we talk about dating apps, it is a mixed thing.  Now this is definitely creating opportunities but additional pressure is also being added.  But whether it is in person or on dating apps, the fear of rejection is constant. I see your reading one or my favorite book that's great what's your favorite? I am sorry.  I'm not living to chat right now. Have a great time bro. That friend, if I work too hard and expose myself too much and then get rejected, my confidence will definitely be shattered. When I got rejected for the first time, I felt bad. You have this idea that your world revolves around that person and he rejected you.  So you start doubting yourself. You keep wondering what wrong thing did I say.  You start doubting your self worth.  You get stuck in this loop of, friend, what did I say?  What did I do wrong. Because rejection not only hurts your feelings but also hurts your self- confidence.  You start doubting yourself that she rejected me?  Was it all my fault?   Am I weird?  Am I not that attractive?  Am I not that funny ?  Was I not dressed properly?  No matter how much I tell you that rejection is not personal.  But when we get rejection in dating, we all feel it personal. If you get rejected sometimes it's not your fault.  Don't take it personally, rather than just thinking that there is something lacking in you.  It is not always the case that you will be lacking something. Depends on the circumstances.  Don't blame yourself and try to move on.  So how can we solve this thing ?  There are two different perspectives.  One is of Aditya. Meet friends.  Tell your friends that this has happened.  Tell your friend that the girl has been left behind, then he will give it to you friends.  Friends, he will make you drink, then just drink and be happy.  Or have fun with friends and try to forget.  Tanvi offers a different alternative. So I think you will move in another direction or focus more on your career.  I think that's a great shift to get out of that emotion. So I think you are engaged in other things rather than that emotion.  So I think gradually all the feelings get suppressed little by little.  Look, dating, like most things in life, is a game of high risk, high reward.  If you don't want to take risk then remember that you will not get any reward.  And the reward is finding a partner and finding a partner is probably one of the most important things in your life.  So if you want to find your partner then you will have to take a risk and to take the risk you may have to face some rejections.  In fact, I believe that many people get disappointed after rejection.  Not just because they got rejected but because they compare themselves with their friends like, my friend proposed and he got a yes but I did not. Why so?  And it is because of this comparison that people's lives are ruined.  Now the question is how to talk properly? What is the right way to flirt?  Aditya says that he likes talking about pop culture and Bollywood.  If there is a girl who is a major Bollywood fan or of course he will work with her.  Because she loves Bollywood right?  She loves may be she loves Shahrukh Khan.  So of course if you say something which Shahrukh Khan is for her. She will be like oh my god.  So, I borrowed this trick a bit from Modern Family 's Feel Done Free.  So whenever I get comfortable with someone or the conversation progresses a little further, I kind of compliment them like, hey you're beautiful, you're really pretty, you're really kind, and then I put a coin from behind their ear, I hope you never change. Right now this is corny and very cheesy too, but it's okay, it has worked so far, but by trying this, people also learn different things.  This gap is called self-presentational gap. This is the gap between how we should flirt and how we actually flirt.  In the Science of Attraction, Patrick King says that the real nervousness in flirting does not come from what will we say?  Rather it comes from the pressure that we have to say the right thing. Another thing that Hollywood and Bollywood movies have done is that they have put pressure on boys that they have to do everything. He has to make the first move. Because of which the pressure on them increases further.  Thankfully, this has changed thanks to dating apps. However, shares show that Bumble has made this thing easier for boys.  Personally, I have only used Bumble.  So Useful Women Make the First Move on Bumble.  So it becomes a little easy to carry the conversation forward because you know that the other person is interested in you. So or it makes things a bit easier.  But the overall pressure is still more on boys.  And Adriya also believes that we will have to change this thing. Meaning that by making the first move no one should feel like why should I do this, why should I do this ?  This is nothing to be ashamed of. If you feel that yes, he is also invested that much then anyone can make the first move. It's not that man's thing.  But yes, women do expect that men will do it first.  We generally don't do it from now on. But if needed and the situation is like that then I will do it.  I have no problem. It's like auditioning for a play.  Where I have memorized a line and I have to deliver that line. But as I told you earlier, you will have to reduce this performance pressure to whatever extent possible.  I am not saying that it will become zero.  We're all nervous before a date.  But you do n't have to do any acting there.  This is not a play.  this is your Life.  So, first of all pay attention to the small things.  Be confident, smile, and try to get to know others realistically.  Rather than delivering a pickup plan. If there are small things in your life that are very strange.  Like if you laugh awkwardly, don't try to cover it up. You are the same human being.  Remember that there is no formula for flirting.  You have to discover it yourself.  And don't think that you have to flirt only once in your life.  In fact, to maintain the relationship, you have to use the same ingredients every day. Or I think why this worked out was probably because we were just our genuine selves.  Like we've been together in 2011 and we've been together since.  I think just being yourself and making time making time understanding each other's needs like not everything is about you it's also about them so adjusting when you need to like change yourself and I 'm a different person now you're a different person or [MUSIC]
