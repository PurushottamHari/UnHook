00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
Tell us about your first flirting

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,600
experience.   There

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,400
was one too many.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Hi my name is Aditya.  I definitely

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,680
get nervous.  Look, if a person says nervous, then he says

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,840
that he does not feel nervous.  But there is

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
such a vibe in which it just happens.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
These people are

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
not talking about any JE exam.  Rather, these people are feeling

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
shy because they are being asked

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
how flirting happens?  And it is not their

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,079
fault either because where is our country

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
learning floating from?  From the movies.   I have

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,559
just entered the locality.  Let me find out a little

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,200
, let me know a little, when I reach the door of the house

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,120
, I will also take the permission.  The

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
characters of these movies are extremely

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
confident and can impress girls very easily.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
You see the majority of the

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,000
stuff happening?  You see it there for the

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,039
first time.  First hand, I

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,360
too like the girl if you do this.  But

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
things are different in real life.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
People are very nervous in real life.

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
He is sweating profusely and thinking,

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
brother, if I make a mistake then

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
what will happen to me.  And I am

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,520
saying this from my personal experience, from

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,920
my first and only date.  The first time I

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,759
tried flirting with her was when I

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,600
texted her.  I sent an SMS with a

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,920
hello and a few exception marks.  So

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,200
there are two-three exclamations in it.  This

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,920
was a strategic decision because I

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,000
wanted to show to her that I am so excited

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,400
to meet her but the story that was

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
told after many years is that

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,560
in my hello there were 15 exclamation words or 15

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,920
years later that story got revised it was

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,159
from the stoy hello 10 exclamation

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
words there were two and three exclamation

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
words and honestly no one has taught

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
you what to do at the most important moment of life.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,560
Basically, no one teaches.  Nobody teaches.

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,040
So the only place that you can learn

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
from to like when you're smaller when

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,840
you're younger is through movies and like TV

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,479
shows.  But Aditya is speaking absolutely the truth.  Our

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,480
society will talk about everything.

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,120
We will peek inside each other's houses.

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,360
But if the topic of romance comes up then he remains

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
completely silent.  In fact, we thought that it would be

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
very easy to find a subject for this video.  There are

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,280
so many young people, anyone can be

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
found.  But no, some people are afraid of

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,959
what their girlfriend or boyfriend will

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,680
say and other people are afraid of

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,640
what their parents will say.  But thankfully many people

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,519
agreed to tell us

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,680
how to flirt in our country?

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,280
So come let's go to a special video where you will be

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,319
given a master class on how to flirt.

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,720
Flirting for me I think it has to be

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,280
settled.  Flirting is equal to settling for me.

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,280
You cannot be obvious.  Anything that

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
makes me laugh.  I don't do flirting.

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm a little funny.  I mean,

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
people know me, so I joke a lot.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,599
So maybe flattery might have happened in that too.

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,920
When you like someone, one

72
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,400
way to tell them that yes

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
I like you is instead of being very

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
straight forward.  For me, it's the

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
small gestures he's doing for me.

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,959
For example, just do something for me

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
or even bring me a glass of water.  When he

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
knows that I want it but I am not saying anything.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
And he should make some such gesture at that time.

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Now all these people are

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
saying different things.  But two things that are common

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
in all his words are subtle and

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,799
natural.  No matter

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,599
how much direct approach the hero and heroine use in Bollywood,

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,840
flirting has the opposite effect.  Patrick King

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,560

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
shows in his book The Science of Attraction that flirting is a way of

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,360
signaling to others that you are

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,080
romantically interested in them.  But this thing

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,319
cannot be done by shouting.  Rather it is done as a hidden

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,319
signal.  So flirting is

92
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,440
a way of

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,519
giving a signal to your romantic partner that may

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,000
not be a very clear signal.  And that's why

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,080
flirting is so complicated, because

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
if you give signals too directly,

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
people might creep out.

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,200
Flirting is a balance between charming and

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,239
creepy.  Just don't be creepy

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,680
about it.  Like go up to them.  Some what there

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,079
up to ass for coffee.  Keep it low stakes,

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,440
keep it chill and like yourself.  I should say that

103
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,240
it's generalizing but a lot of men

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
approaching women are mostly they do not know what they are

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,880
doing first.  Secondly,

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,199
sometimes they do more and sometimes they do less.

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
They are trying to act cool.  So, a lot of

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
mistakes happen.  So basically to

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
do good flirting you have to decide

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
how

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
indirect or

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
direct your signals should be.  If you go too direct

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,840
then there are chances of rejection,

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
which everyone shies away from.

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
One thing comes in every boy's mind that I should

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,000
not get rejected because whether she will say yes or not is a

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
matter for later.  But if you get

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
rejected by her then your morale will go down and you will think

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,639
why did she reject me

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
?  Then you will work on yourself and see

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,400
yourself.  So, if some guys get rejected by three or four

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,479
girls, even if they

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
look good, they will automatically

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,520
start feeling that there is something lacking in themselves.  Many people

125
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,240
believe that flirting is like a play and that

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
you have to memorize lines and deliver a performance.

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
Because if this

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,800
performance is not perfect then you will fail.

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,039
But because of this performance, your

130
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,199
partner will never know

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,440
what kind of person you actually are because remember,

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
you are performing.  You are

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,639
not doing it naturally.

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,840
Hi.  Hi.  Hi.

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,680
Your eyes are a different world

136
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,680
in which we get lost.

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,680
Ok have a seat up.  This performance

138
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,080
can cause two problems.  If your

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,039
performance gets rejected, you will develop

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,600
self-doubt.  And even if it works,

141
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,680
you will be constantly under pressure to

142
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
play the same character every time.  It's

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
better to be natural and authentic.  Now

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,759
this is very easy for me to say but

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
obviously it is very difficult to do.  But it is

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
important for you to know that one thing is very

147
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
important because first

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,880
impressions matter.  Yes, I think

149
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,960
first impression very much matters.  I mean, if

150
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm meeting someone and that person ca

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,759
n't even give me a handshake, then I

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,919
feel like I would be a little taken

153
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
back.  So first impressions do matter.

154
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,400
But what does it mean?  This means that you should like the

155
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
perfume.  Your teeth

156
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
should be absolutely white or

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
you should tell a funny joke in 3 minutes.

158
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Wait a second.  When we asked people

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
about first impressions they

160
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,280
said that first impressions do matter but

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,919
not the ones we think Bollywood

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
taught us.  Actually One Very Cute

163
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,240
Plating Experience The First Dinner Tape

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,080
That We Went Onto At The Italian Restaurant.

165
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:59,010
Mohak asked one of her girlfriends how to

166
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,520
use all the different forms of cutlery.  SOAP

167
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,000
[MUSIC]

168
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Or like I had no idea

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,280
where to put the folk if it was going to be a formal dinner

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,160
?  How to drink soup?  I

171
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,840
had absolutely no idea.  So I was very nervous

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
for that date.  So I asked my friend

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,120
how to use all these things?  And

174
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,400
she's like you're going to eat pizza

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,240
dude.  Like you don't need to be so.

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,199
Or but I found that effort very sweet.   If we

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,919
believe in Bollywood then love happens at first sight.

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,560
Be it due to rain

179
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
or due to collision with each other.  But

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
in real life, first impression is

181
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,520
not the moment when you see your partner for the first time.

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,080
Rather, it is the moment

183
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,400
when you talk to them.  First time, second

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,960
time, third time.  If I feel at the first time

185
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
that this person has

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,000
no depth or he does not know how to talk

187
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,199
or this person will not understand and

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,639
is not vibing at the what do I say at the

189
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,560
level that I want the person I want to date to vibe,

190
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
then I will get turned off at once and

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,039
I will not give him a chance again,

192
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,759
but if in the first impression you seem to

193
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,319
me that yes, okay you have potential,

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,919
then I will give you a chance. The truth is that people

195
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
put a lot of pressure on themselves

196
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,639
regarding the first impression.  But people do

197
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,599
n't connect with each other because of

198
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,000
who told what joke in the first 3 minutes;

199
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,800
rather, they connect through conversation.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,039
So give yourself time.  Bollywood has

201
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,440
just two hours to show a love story.

202
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,080
But in real life you should have patience

203
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,240
and give yourself time to

204
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
wipe yourself with your partner.  Do

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,120
n't put pressure on yourself to talk too much

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,519
but try to understand others.

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,040
What is his body language like and what is he saying.

208
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,040
Nice clip bye.

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,399
Thank you.

210
00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:05,519
[MUSIC]

211
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
And

212
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,000
how are you liking this meeting?  Yes

213
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,320
definitely.  I think girls only like that

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,760
kind of stuff.  The one who is noticing your small things, I

215
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,240
think

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
he is not even flirting with you a little bit.

217
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
I think people who flirt a lot

218
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
generally don't notice many things about you.

219
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,839
And the small things that we are observing, in a

220
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,920
conversation like this, those things are just

221
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,720
sliding away.  I think

222
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,279
those people are more attractive in any

223
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
way.  Everyone has a boundary that yes, with so much

224
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,880
flirting that person would

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
reciprocate but after a point he becomes

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,240
uncomfortable.  It seems that

227
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
whatever this friend says, he

228
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
always flirts.  Meaning he always gives compliments.

229
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
So that's not, that's not normal.   I

230
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
understand that you are trying hard.

231
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,680
And even the boys know this thing deep inside.

232
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,080
But unfortunately their

233
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,880
conditioning is such that they try to

234
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,959
heart.  Look, the first impression is that if

235
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,040
you have to make an impression in front of a girl

236
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,880
then the first thing you will have to do is to be

237
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,760
as confident as possible in front of her

238
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,399
and don't let her feel that she should

239
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,000

240
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,399
not make such gestures like boys do, that she should look at you.  Mind your own

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
business.

242
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,320
Keep it as normal as you can.  Now you will say that

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
what do these single people know about first impressions

244
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
?  So let's talk to Aditi and Sunny

245
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
who have been in a relationship for eight years.

246
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,560
When they met for the first time, Aditi did

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
not think much about first impressions

248
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,160
but today they both are happily married.  The

249
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,959
first time we met four days after

250
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,760
my birthday.  She was wearing an over size

251
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:40,720
t-shirt and a capri I actually went to

252
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,200
completely you know make him feel whether he does it or not, I have not

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,920
seen him but however I could see that

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,120
spark in her eyes which I was more

255
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,079
attracted to then I could see tears like this coming

256
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,959
on her you know in her eyes and

257
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,519
by the way she asked me if I would like to eat something, I

258
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,760
refused, okay I am ordering for myself.

259
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
I was hungry plus and later on

260
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
she told me that no she had a bad day and

261
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,760
everything and she had a fight with a friend okay like

262
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,959
okay so no problem it's

263
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,480
okay fine by the end of it or mean she had

264
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,480
a smile on a face I was able to make a

265
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
smile that has been my job for the past

266
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,200
10

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,720
With our second couple Nidhish and Nivedita

268
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,720
also there was a perfect first impression very

269
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,519
intelligent very smart tell me the truth okay

270
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,000
when he first saw me.  He thought that I would

271
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,959
not be that interesting.  Must be.  Yes.   He thought I was

272
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,560
not a very political person.   He didn't

273
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,040
really think he would hit it off

274
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
with me.  Then what has changed?  Meaning our

275
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,640
first date was like three hours long.

276
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,279
And I don't think I've ever been able to

277
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,240
sustain a conversation like that with

278
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,000
anyone I know let alone like a person I've

279
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
met for the first time.  So that was my

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
impression of him.  Like someone who is who

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
makes it really comfortable for me to just be

282
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,320
myself.  The story of these two couples

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,920
exactly matches what Thomas Smitherman

284
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
says in his book that first

285
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
impressions can be average.  Average does

286
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,959
not mean that you impressed her so much

287
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
that she went crazy about you.

288
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,160
Rather, average means that you

289
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,600
were natural and authentic.  Didn't have a very bad impression.

290
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,079
And there is room in the future.  Movies will make

291
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
you feel that the

292
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,720
girl should fall in love at first impression otherwise

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,120
we will fail.  But it is not like that.  But you should

294
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,120
also remember that a bad impression

295
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,440
can definitely spoil everything.  I mean, whether the

296
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,480
first impression is mind blowing or not, that doesn't matter to me.

297
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,720
But if it is very bad

298
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,320
then it is not okay.  There must be dissent.

299
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,800
If I feel in the first impression

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,880
that I don't want to talk to someone then it wo

301
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
n't be possible.  Look, social skills do

302
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
matter.  You have to laugh.   You have to make the

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,680
other person laugh.  Curiosity has to be

304
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,320
shown.  As you would always show up

305
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:02,720
like smiling and very genuine.  So the NA

306
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,200
I got was like this someone who was morally

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,279
interested in me and not trying to act

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,120
cool and do some gimmicks to impress me.  And

309
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
basically you have to make your partner

310
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,160
feel comfortable.  If you make someone feel weak

311
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,320
then it is not easy to recover from there.

312
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,639
Not just for flirting.  I think

313
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,680
for the entire relationship.

314
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,399
Being able to lift up another person's mood

315
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,519
and make them smile is not something that

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,720
everybody can do at.  The Ability to Make Your

317
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,200
Partner Smile Laugh.  Such random smiles

318
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,320
from the bottom of their heart titleiest laughter.

319
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Very very nice.  Now I have

320
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,760
given you all this knowledge but here a problem arises.

321
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,760
Dating apps.

322
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,600
Dating apps have spoilt the whole thing

323
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,839
because there is so much competition hence the

324
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,240

325
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,079
pressure to make a first impression.  In dating apps where people

326
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,639
swipe left and right,

327
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,800
you have to compress your entire personality

328
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,199
into a profile in half a second.  Even if the profiles match, you have to

329
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,040
impress through chat

330
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,279
because who knows your partner might start messaging someone else.

331
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,600
Which Fruit Loves Go

332
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,600
On Slides.

333
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,320
But the issue is that dating apps are also

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,880
unpredictable.  Tanvi told that

335
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,440
using the apps was just a one or two day phase for her.

336
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,240
I have a very very interesting

337
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
story.  So, my face comes when

338
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
I download Tinder for just two days

339
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,800
or Hinge, Bumble, any dating app, okay, so

340
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,800
once there was an Australian, he was so

341
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,720
cute, man, there was such a lovely boy in pink color,

342
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
I really enjoyed seeing him,

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,680
so I just told him, I mean, we matched,

344
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
we started talking and he was

345
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,040
totally like brother, now the room has been booked,

346
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,959
you come, okay, I said no no, but I am scared, I do

347
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,639
n't have the courage to go anywhere,

348
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
I flirt like this, but

349
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,199
from a distance, so he generally

350
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,240
called me.  I said no no no no I am

351
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,880
not like that.  I was just saying

352
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,480
oh you are so cute.  So I said it and

353
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,800
he said this and unmatched it.

354
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,040
For some people, these abs are just a temporary excuse.

355
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,279
While for other people it's a way

356
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,440
they can finally talk.

357
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,000
Adri explained this well.  The

358
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,079
biggest advantage after the advent of dating apps is

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,639
that there are people who actually have personality

360
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,639
and who can chat well.  So

361
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,600
some people are such that

362
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,839
maybe they don't mean they don't want to be able to impress

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,079
people in front of them, they might be introverted

364
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,480
people and or they don't know how to express themselves that much

365
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,199
or they may not be the

366
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
prettiest one in the room but their humor is

367
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,839
very good or they can talk very well

368
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
or like their texting

369
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,240
game is strong, so if something like this happens then he gets a

370
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,720
chance that that person puts his

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
personality out first, basically if you are

372
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
introverted or

373
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,680
not conventionally attractive then dating apps can help you

374
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
because in pictures even then

375
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,440
you can tweak a little bit here and there

376
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
and make yourself look presentable.

377
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
But what you are talking about, the text you are

378
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,079
typing and the way you are approaching

379
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,240
someone, you cannot change that.  So

380
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,560
from there, those people get a chance

381
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
who have the potential to

382
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,720
impress someone with their words.  So that is a huge

383
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,040
advantage with I Wood.  This is of course a

384
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
simplistic view.  But there

385
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,120
is a pressure of performance on these dating apps also.  You are

386
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,839
judged every second.  Every photo and every

387
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,880
comment is analyzed 10 times.

388
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,279
Dating abs is a slightly completely different scale

389
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,680
or level.  You don't know

390
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,920
how the other person will perceive the line you are going to say.

391
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,560
Because you

392
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,759
know zero about him.  It's a trial and

393
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,079
something else.  You may try it, it works.

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,880
Otherwise you flattered in a general way that or

395
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,160
like nice fans like you notice something in

396
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,520
their photo like which someone else would notice because

397
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,280
but you notice it so or Aditya says

398
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,360
that the conversations that happen on these apps are

399
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,600
very surface level but you have to

400
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
work very hard to move ahead, people

401
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,480
started using dating apps so that there would be

402
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,480
less judgement and we would be

403
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
able to find our partner easily but actually there is a

404
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,280
lot of judgement in these apps, that

405
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
was the part of dating where you would first

406
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,440
know the person and then date.  That has

407
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
something gone away here and there.  Now you

408
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
date first and then you understand the

409
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,799
human being that no friend, this is not my

410
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,960
time.  I won't be able to do this.  And now

411
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,600
dating apps have developed a reputation of their own.

412
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,559
Dating app I think is very unpopular in India

413
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,440
because that has also

414
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,640
become a place for just you know

415
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,919
situations and one night stands.  And more

416
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,240
sexual than relationship stuff.  Aditi also

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,240
said a practical thing that given the

418
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,360
kind of life we ​​have, it is

419
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,760
very difficult to meet people.  So that gives you a

420
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
platform to meet people.  Otherwise, every day you are

421
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,080
going to the same office and meeting the same people.

422
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,559
So where will I find a human being

423
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,720
?  So when we talk about dating apps, it is a

424
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,720
mixed thing.  Now this is

425
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,120
definitely creating opportunities but additional pressure is

426
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,600
also being added.  But whether it is in person or on

427
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:25,400
dating apps, the

428
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,400
fear of rejection is constant.

429
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,480
I see your reading one

430
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,640
or my favorite book that's great

431
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,559
what's your favorite?

432
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,559
I am sorry.  I'm not living to chat right

433
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,559
now.

434
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,480
Have a great time bro.

435
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,120
That friend, if I work too hard and

436
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,440
expose myself too much and then get

437
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,160
rejected, my confidence will definitely be shattered.

438
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,640
When I got rejected for the first time, I

439
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,640
felt bad.

440
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,039
You have this idea that your world

441
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
revolves around that person and he

442
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,240
rejected you.  So you start doubting yourself.

443
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
You keep wondering

444
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,960
what wrong thing did I say.  You

445
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,760
start doubting your self worth.  You get

446
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,080
stuck in this loop of, friend,

447
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,320
what did I say?  What did I do wrong.

448
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,480
Because rejection not only hurts your feelings

449
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,720
but also hurts your self-

450
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
confidence.  You

451
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,799
start doubting yourself that she

452
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,000
rejected me?  Was it all my fault?   Am

453
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,480
I weird?  Am I

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,720
not that attractive?  Am I not that funny

455
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,880
?  Was I not

456
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,440
dressed properly?  No matter how much I tell you that

457
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,919
rejection is not personal.  But

458
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,160
when we get rejection in dating, we all feel it personal.

459
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,960
If you get rejected sometimes it's

460
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,720
not your fault.  Don't take

461
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,880
it personally, rather than just thinking that there is

462
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,600
something lacking in you.  It is not always the case that

463
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,919
you will be lacking something.

464
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Depends on the circumstances.  Don't blame yourself and

465
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,919
try to move on.  So how can we solve this thing

466
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
?  There are two different

467
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,440
perspectives.  One is of Aditya.

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,160
Meet friends.  Tell your friends that this has

469
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,640
happened.  Tell your friend that the girl has been

470
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:31,039
left behind, then he will give it to you friends.  Friends, he will make

471
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,679
you drink, then just drink and be happy.  Or have

472
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,760
fun with friends and

473
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,559
try to forget.  Tanvi offers a different alternative.

474
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,360
So I think you will

475
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,200
move in another direction or

476
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,280
focus more on your career.  I think that's a

477
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,280
great shift to get out of that emotion.

478
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,000
So I think you are

479
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,240
engaged in other things rather than that emotion.  So I

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,640
think gradually all the feelings get

481
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
suppressed little by little.  Look, dating,

482
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,880
like most things in life, is a

483
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
game of high risk, high reward.  If you don't want to

484
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
take risk then remember that you will

485
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
not get any reward.  And the reward is finding a

486
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,760
partner and finding a partner is

487
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,919
probably one of the most important things

488
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,320
in your life.  So if you want to find your partner then

489
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,640
you will have to take a risk and to

490
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,799
take the risk you may have to face some rejections.  In

491
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,799
fact, I believe

492
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,720
that many people get disappointed

493
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,960
after rejection.  Not just because they got

494
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,120
rejected but because

495
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
they compare themselves with their friends like,

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,280
my friend

497
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,400
proposed and he got a yes but I did not.

498
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Why so?  And it is because of this comparison that people's lives are

499
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,840
ruined.  Now the question is

500
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,080
how to talk properly?

501
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,320
What is the right way to flirt?  Aditya says that

502
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,640
he likes talking about pop culture and Bollywood.  If there is

503
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,280
a girl who

504
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
is a major Bollywood fan or of course

505
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,280
he will work with her.  Because she loves

506
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,679
Bollywood right?  She loves may be she loves

507
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,320
Shahrukh Khan.  So of course if you say something which

508
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,159
Shahrukh Khan is for her.

509
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
She will be like oh my god.  So, I

510
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,440
borrowed this trick a bit from Modern Family

511
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,600
's Feel Done Free.  So whenever I get

512
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,679
comfortable with someone or the conversation

513
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,720
progresses a little further, I kind of

514
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,520
compliment them like, hey you're beautiful,

515
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,000
you're really pretty, you're really kind, and

516
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,600
then I put a coin from behind their ear,

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I hope you never change. Right now this is corny

518
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,400
and very cheesy too, but it's okay, it has worked

519
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,360
so far, but by trying this, people

520
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,600
also learn different things.  This gap is

521
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,240
called self-presentational gap.

522
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,960
This is the gap between how we should

523
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,840
flirt and how we actually

524
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,320
flirt.  In the Science of Attraction,

525
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Patrick King says that the real

526
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,600
nervousness in flirting does

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,480
not come from what will we say?  Rather it

528
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,480
comes from the pressure that we have to say the right thing.

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,559
Another thing that Hollywood and Bollywood

530
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,799
movies have done is that they have

531
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,960
put pressure on boys that they have to do everything.

532
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,200
He has to make the first move.

533
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,679
Because of which the pressure on them

534
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,760
increases further.  Thankfully, this has changed thanks to dating apps.

535
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,799
However, shares

536
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,440
show that Bumble has made this

537
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,440
thing easier for boys.  Personally, I have

538
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,880
only used Bumble.  So

539
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,120
Useful Women Make the First Move on Bumble.  So it becomes

540
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,919
a little easy to carry the conversation forward

541
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,720
because you know that the other person is interested in you.

542
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,600
So or it makes things a

543
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,760
bit easier.  But the overall pressure is still

544
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,720
more on boys.  And Adriya also

545
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,720
believes that we will have to change this thing.

546
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,159
Meaning that by making the first move no one should

547
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,240
feel like why should I do this, why should I do this

548
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
?  This is nothing to be ashamed of.

549
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
If you feel that yes, he

550
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,159
is also invested that much then anyone can make the first move.

551
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
It's not that man's thing.  But

552
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,679
yes, women do expect that men will do it

553
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,400
first.  We generally don't do it from now on.

554
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,400
But if needed and the situation is like that then

555
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,799
I will do it.  I have no problem.

556
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,120
It's like auditioning for a play.  Where

557
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,120
I have memorized a line and I have to deliver that line.

558
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
But as I told you earlier,

559
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,760
you will have to reduce this performance pressure

560
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,320
to whatever extent possible.  I am not

561
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,360
saying that it will become zero.  We're all nervous

562
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,840
before a date.  But you do

563
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,640
n't have to do any acting there.  This is not a play.  this

564
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,279
is your Life.  So, first of all

565
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
pay attention to the small things.  Be confident, smile,

566
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,320
and

567
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,559
try to get to know others realistically.  Rather than delivering a pickup plan.

568
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,520
If there are small things in your life

569
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,240
that are very strange.  Like if you

570
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,559
laugh awkwardly, don't try to cover it up.

571
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,400
You are the same human being.  Remember that there

572
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,799
is no formula for flirting.  You have to

573
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,799
discover it yourself.  And don't think that

574
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
you have to flirt only once in your life.  In

575
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,080
fact, to maintain the relationship,

576
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,880
you have to use the same ingredients every day.

577
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Or I think why this

578
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,720
worked out was probably because we were

579
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,320
just our genuine selves.  Like we've

580
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,080
been together in 2011

581
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,840
and we've been together since.  I think just

582
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,880
being yourself and making time making

583
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,360
time understanding each other's needs like

584
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,400
not everything is about you it's also about

585
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,480
them so adjusting when you need to like

586
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,720
change yourself and I

587
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,440
'm a different person now you're a different

588
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,440
person or

589
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:32,549
