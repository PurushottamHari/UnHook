I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. This was bound to happen, friends, the war has already begun and it is very dangerous. Israel and Iran have now directly clashed.  And now let us assume that earlier if Iran was attacked, it would have waited a little.  A journalist even said that Pakistan is worried that Israel might attack Pakistan. But that's not going to happen.  But Iran immediately launched the attack. Friends, immediately yesterday there was an attack on Iran and yesterday evening at around 9:00 pm Iran launched two consecutive attacks on Israel. Look, the Israeli attack was on their Natansh facility, the nuclear facility in Ishavahan province, which is the most important.  It is here that Israel has destroyed their centrifuges and the entire nuclear program. Friends, eight cities have been attacked.  78 people have been killed in Iran.  324 are injured. In which their Chief of Defence Staff, their IRGC head, all have been killed in Iran and scientists have been killed.  Eight cities have been attacked.  More than 200 facilities have been hit.  Israel has never carried out such a dangerous attack. Donald Trump Bhaiya, what can I say?  Donald Trump said that if you attack America or he spoke through proxy.  If you attack American interests, you will see.  America directly threatened and America has a hand in this.  Now Donald Trump himself has said it indirectly. Donald Trump said that we had told them for two months that they should make a deal with Iran. You did not deal in uranium.  Yesterday was day 61 so we killed it.  Meaning, Israel is still telling you that you still have time to do the deal.  So Donald Trump is saying this.  Well, I told you this many times yesterday also that why did the attack happen?  Brother, here everything is about uranium. IAEA said that their uranium enrichment program has reached a different level.  Is it okay?  And here America has been trying for the last two months to sign a deal with Iran and stop their uranium enrichment program. Now Iran is not agreeing to this. So now this deal will never happen.  But now their foreign minister, Mr. Bagchi, and their UN envoy have clearly said that Israel has now crossed all the red lines.  Lakshman Rekha has been crossed. Now the drum of war will remain.  And now the war started.  This is not a very good thing. I will make separate lectures for the whole world and for India. Even today two lectures will be given on Israel and Iran.  But why ultimately this will create a huge problem for India, we will discuss it in the next lecture.  For now let us look at the updates. Benjamin Netanya made a great poster of Operation Rising Line brother.  He did that.  The stock is roaring and Benjamin Atanyahu said we will kill you because in World War Two you thought there was World War Two.  This will be holo cost. No no, the cost will now be done in a different way.  Not anymore, we are not going to stop and we will bomb and bomb more and Iran has been continuously attacking.  Now friends, the big thing is that their Iron Dome has also been breached.  The Iron Dome Has Been Breached.  What they say is that their Sea Dome, Iron Dome is Israel 's own protection system.  India's air defense system was 100% efficient. But their air defence system is fine.  It is 90, 95, 96% but 4% is always a risk and that was seen because the missiles that were fired at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, it is being said that Iran first fired more than 100 drones and then fired missiles and some missiles breached the Iron Dome.  There is a very big building in Tel Aviv.  A missile has hit him. People have been injured.  10 to 12 people have been injured.  There have been casualties too.  I do n't know how much it is now.  But this is the second missile attack, this is the second consecutive attack by Iran.  So Iran is not going to stop this time. And this is a huge conflict, friends.  Leaders all over the world are scared.  PM Modi also said that you should immediately deescalate while Timer Emmanuel Macron said don't involve us in this.  We are not supporting you in this war; Iran and the whole of Europe are scared.  Only America is giving full support and it is being said that more than 40 people have been injured in the target hit by Iran's missile. Iran says Israel has killed 78 of its people. Pictures like this.  Well, the Iranian military has said to take out the swords.  Isn't it?  Take out your swords.  And when the final strike happens we'll see who survives.  Hu Remains, Right? When the Last Sword Strikes.  This is a good court, guru.  We will see who remains.  When the sword will attack for the last time, then we will see and this direct war has happened in such a way that here they said that you started it, you started it and have posted a photo, now how much of this is real or fake, I don't know, but they have posted a photo of a building burning here and it is being said that it is a high rise building and it is on fire, currently we cannot confirm this photo, aldo this is their official Twitter handle or ex-handle and brother Acharya Chanakya had already said that this world will keep on fighting for land, will keep on dying as long as it exists.

He addressed the nation and said, look, do not assume that they attacked us and the matter is over. He has initiated it.  He has started the conflict.  We now know you we will not permit them to invade so what do you think you will escape the sequences. You won't escape the sequences. You started it, we will finish it.  Ali Khomenei has given a clear warning.  And brother, Israel had already said that as long as Israel exists, there will always be a threat to Iran and the rest of the West Asian countries. So, Iran had called it a threat to survival.  So Israel said that until we tell them about this threat to survival, what can we do? Israel has a very aggressive stand and now there will be repercussions of this.   There will be sequences because Iran is not a weak country.  Brother, do n't make the mistake of considering him weak.  Ok? He created Hezbollah Houthi proxies. He stood there intentionally. Everything has happened since 1980.  He knows that these people will be needed.  And that is why America has now issued a warning that proxies should not attack American interests.  Because we have the most advanced weapons.  And Donald Trump, now look, Donald Trump gave an interview to Axios yesterday.  They are saying that we had given them an ultimatum of 2 months to do the deal.  He didn't.  They should do it, today is day 61.  You are seeing that now America is saying, Mark Rubio is saying that we have no role in this. And Donald Trump is shouting that we are the ones who got this done.  Day 61.  Now, in Day 61, your band was destroyed and after that we told you not to do all this.  Now you still have a second chance.  Make the deal. That means if you make a deal, we will stop this war. But Iran said that now no deal is going to happen.  Forget the deal. Dealville isn't going to do anything.  There will be a direct war.  Now Israel has said that there will be more to follow.  We will kill more now. And right now, friends, while I am taking the lecture, the update is that Israel has again attacked Tehran.  Iran's capitol has been attacked.  The missile has been fired again.  So this will continue.  Both of them do not share the border with each other. Attacks will be carried out only through missiles.  But we have to go and see where it will stop. Till when?  How long will you keep shooting missiles at each other?  If Israel gets frustrated, it can attack its surroundings also.  can kill pakistan. Do not know?  Anything can happen friends, you never know that Pakistan and Israel do not have very good relations anyway.  Okay Narendra Modi, he said that we have talked to Netan Yahoo.  He has informed us about the situation.  Now see what happened yesterday, when Israel attacked, it published a map.  The map of India was shown incorrectly in it. Ok?  POK in Pakistan.  So then there was backlash about it and then he apologized.  So he said that we have conveyed India's concerns to them and said that look, peace and stability has always been India's stand and it is absolutely correct to restore it in the region as soon as possible.  See, Iran had said when the Palgaon attack happened that we are ready.  Iran had said this and Iran did not give any special support.  I think now India needs to support those countries that supported us. Israel was one of them.  Ok? What Israel is doing in Gaza is absolutely not right.  This is absolutely wrong. Small children and women are dying there, Parleg biscuits cost Rs 2500. But we should not forget that in the Pahalgam attack, Israel was the only country which openly came out in our support. But India cannot do this.  But yes, he can definitely say that we are ready to mediate.  As Iran had said that we are ready to mediate on the Kashmir issue. So India should also say that brother, we are ready to mediate.  tit for tat.  Iran's military has said that for two years there were attacks on Palestine, massacres happened and you remained silent.  Now last night Iran was attacked. Now we will not remain silent.  That's enough.  Enough of respect.  So both the countries have clashed with each other. Now the big question is who is powerful ?  Iran is not powerful friends.  It is Israel.  For one thing, America is behind Israel.  So as long as America is at the helm of affairs, it will always be powerful.  Is it okay?  Indirectly, Israel belongs to America, America supports Israel and the Career Timers have said that stability must be maintained, there should be de-escalation, so all these things have been said here and the attacks that have taken place have caused a lot of damage to Iran and Iran also knows that there will be attacks again.  Actually Iran has no choice.  The more he delays, he knows that his brother is bound to die. Israel will definitely kill.  So it is best that brother, you die after beating me to death.  This is the thing.  Rest, as we told you, both the countries are powerful.  It is not that one country or another is weak.  Both the countries are powerful. Israel has more upper hand.  But the problem here is that more state actors can get involved.  Hamas definitely exists.  Next to it is Lebanon.  Ok?  Here in Yemen, Israel can attack from anywhere but their technology is better so they can count on them but still we will have to look here and some such pictures have come out.  In the next lecture that I take, I will tell you in what ways the world will be impacted. Where will the war stop and what impact will it have on India?  UN chief Antonio Guterres has said that Iran 's missile strike has taken place in Talvi. Israel attacks Iran.  Enough of escalation time to stop.  As long as this world exists, as Chanakya Acharya Chanakya says, this war will continue to happen.   We will fight and die by throwing bombs at each other. Be happy, keep reading.
