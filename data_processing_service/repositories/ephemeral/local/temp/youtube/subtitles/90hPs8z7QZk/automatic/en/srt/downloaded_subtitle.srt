1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
If someone wants to begin Ganesh sad at

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,960
home, what is your suggestion? Start

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,639
from basic

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,040
mantras. You can make a Ganesha out of

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,960
out of clay. After some time, there is

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,120
not even Ganesha. There's not even me.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,880
There's only light, which is the actual

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,640
purpose of any sadena. Wow.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
When you read the DI scripture, it says

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
that he's the creator. Shiva's

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
scriptures say the same thing. Vishnu,

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
they say the same thing. So, is there a

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,760
battlefield up there? You have to

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
understand God has won. If you're just

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,840
asking pundits and people who perform

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
pujas, they'll misguide you. They are

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,200
not teachers. Approach people who don't

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
scare because fear is so

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,600
anti-spirituality. Always remember the

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,280
deity loves you more than you love the

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
dity. He chooses you because he's

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,239
already fallen in love with you.

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
I would like to believe that the deity

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,079
is speaking to you. Yes, a relationship

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
with the deity is a very beautiful

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,760
relationship and the deity himself will

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,120
teach you. There is a guru's voice that

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
starts speaking in your head. Some

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,559
people call it the voice in your head.

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
There's clear indication of what you

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,400
should do. A lot of people get very

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,799
excited because of our tantra based

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,560
podcast. Yes. And begin to do some very

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,799
intense sadas at home. Don't go into

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
complex dities. Some house lady was

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,400
reading durahati during the navatras and

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,000
she died of a cardiac arrest.

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
There is a point where your body and

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
your head tells you hey stop. You may

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,439
not want to stop. This is called japa

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,520
japa. The mind is now saying the mantra

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
in a repeated manner. You just keep

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,680
going. Why did no one teach us this when

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,680
we were growing up?

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,799
Mansira, one of our most loved tantra

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,960
based guests is back. Today we cover

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,200
gpati tantra, an aspect of sanatan dhan

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
and tantra in general that's not spoken

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
about on the Indian internet much. We

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
hope to change that. Beginning with this

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,050
episode, Marian Svira's back with

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:13,639
another Tantra

53
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:13,639
[Music]

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,040
blockbuster. I'm going to start with a

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,720
tiny mantra.

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,440
Omg, thank you for being here ma. Thank

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,360
you. So nice to see you again. Glad to

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,800
be hosting you in my house. Like that's

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
Yes. It feels so wonderful. The energy

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
is so lovely. Okay. Uh how are you

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,560
ma'am? I'm doing very nice. Thank you.

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,400
Okay. Uh I would love to know what you

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,400
think of Sarna in general. Uh and I

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
would love to ask you from the

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,200
perspective of the listeners. If someone

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,160
wants to begin a very basic at-ome uh

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Ganesh sadha, what is something they can

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,280
do? Uh I offer dura every morning. Yes,

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,720
I light

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,959
a uh I just

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,080
say and place it with intention and then

72
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,080
I do the 18

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:15,120
names and then it goes on. Um firstly,

74
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,000
am I publicly allowed to say this?

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,239
Secondly, uh what is your suggestion

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
from a very practical perspective for

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
the listeners? I know that people have

78
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
clicked on this are already bs of Ganesh

79
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,519
G. And one last thing before we move

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,280
forward, we had our first podcast with a

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
child yesterday. His name is Pratamesh.

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,159
One of the most beautiful conversations

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,560
of my whole podcasting career. And this

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,000
is a gift from him. So sweet. So it's a

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,959
Gpati. Yes. And uh I know that today's

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,200
podcast is dedicated to Gpati. Mhm. So

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:52,879
uh you know uh over to you all. Yes. You

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:58,480
see our Gurude's teachings say that when

89
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,319
you uh consecrate your life to the deity

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,480
when you give your life to the deity

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,120
then the deity invocation can happen in

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
any way. He his teachings are very

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,920
organic. The school that I belong to

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,439
very organic teachings says that and we

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
see people practicing when there is the

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,759
Ganesh festival uts happening in you you

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
get so many reels and so many talks on

98
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
the on the TV that say that you can make

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
a ganesha out of haldi you know out of

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,759
turmeric or out of clay just by yourself

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
at home or with you know mixing various

102
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,120
herbal powders and make a ganesha

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
actually that is the process of

104
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,400
invocation. The point here is that when

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
people want to start a Ganesh sadena,

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,759
first they should decide in their mind

107
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
that uh what is the purpose of doing any

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,240
sadena? First of all, let us understand

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
whether it is of this god or that god.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
The purpose is to dissolve your ego

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,040
completely into that dity. To dissolve

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,560
our identity completely into the dity.

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,040
The dity is an I am not. The dity is an

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,960
I am not. He he is an I am not. That

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,120
means the power of him is there. He you

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
know he is functioning through me so to

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
say my ego is not functioning through me

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
the dity is functioning through me that

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,199
means whatever carry forward of life I

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,720
have you know from my past lives and uh

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
the ego is shouldering the

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,160
responsibility in this life and I am the

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,360
doer you know but when you dedicate your

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,759
life to any sadena any deity sadena then

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,560
now you're handing over your life the

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,039
steering of your life wheel to him so he

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,960
is and I am

128
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,840
not you know and that is the process of

129
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
starting the sadena. So if one starts

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,400
sad with a pigeon brain thinking okay

131
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,240
let me experiment with Ganesha then I'll

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,560
see how this is then let me experiment

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
with this one then I'll see how this is

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,039
who is beating around the bush the ego

135
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,360
is beating around the bush and the ego

136
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,039
has to ultimately dissolve in peratma

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
then it is better that you get wedded to

138
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
one dity

139
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
once for all tie the knot you know

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
understanding knowing the science of it

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
that this dity also dissolves in peratma

142
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
and I am actually getting wedded to

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
permatma

144
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,919
When that is clear then the sadena will

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
reveal itself.

146
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,960
The deity himself reveals the sadhena

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,039
which mantra how many times you know he

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,840
will mold you. He will mold you to get

149
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,440
absorbed. It will reveal itself through

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
the people you meet and through the

151
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,479
internet. Yes. Yes. To something that

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,639
you come across and you really feel I

153
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
want to do this. I mean I'm asking you

154
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
this from the perspective of people I've

155
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,000
come across in my journey over the last

156
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,000
2 three years. There's a lot of people

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,360
who get very excited because of our

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,720
tantra based podcasts. Yes. And begin to

159
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,400
do some very intense sadas at home based

160
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
on mantras they picked up off of the

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
internet. That shouldn't be done. I feel

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,880
especially if it's got a bakure. Yes.

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,720
You have to prepare your body.

164
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,199
Uh it's like a copper wire has to be

165
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,080
strong enough to take a thousand volt

166
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,400
current you to prepare your body. Not

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,400
that anything wrong will happen but it

168
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
doesn't take you anywhere. You should

169
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,280
start from basic small basic mantras of

170
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,360
that dity slowly increasing the count um

171
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
you know of chance that you're doing and

172
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,319
then slowly reading the stotras

173
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,479
connected to that dity slowly meditating

174
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,880
and focusing on how your energy field

175
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,880
feels. It's like establishing a

176
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,720
relationship with a deity slowly in

177
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,080
privacy rather than making it a public

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,160
affair where you're misguided and you

179
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
know oh you don't do this this way do it

180
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,599
this way you you have a thousand people

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,080
giving you

182
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,319
mundina they say the thousand you know

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
heads and thousand advices. So a

184
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
relationship with the deity is a very

185
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
beautiful relationship and the deity

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,639
himself will teach you in some way or

187
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,240
there is inner voice that opens up. We

188
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,400
call it sa guru bodh in in our sanskriti

189
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
we call it sa guru bodh. Swaguru both

190
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,000
means there is a guru's voice that

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,479
starts speaking in your head you know

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
and that inner voice some people say the

193
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,560
voice of your heart some people call it

194
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
the voice in your head but there's clear

195
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,599
indication of what you should do and

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,560
when you begin your journey lovingly

197
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,560
with faith trust surrender have a firm

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
conviction that the deity that I'm

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,919
associating with you know is not a

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,479
punishable system it's a loving system

201
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
so there there ought not to be any fear

202
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
number one Number two, start

203
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,719
establishing consciously a loving

204
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
relationship. you know then the guidance

205
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
will come the the pace the speed with

206
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,800
which you want to progress will come and

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,000
then there are people like us who are

208
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,800
there who can you know uh someone I

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,760
think everyone should approach people um

210
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,800
who don't scare number one because fear

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,120
is something I think is so

212
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,120
anti-spiritual you know spirituality and

213
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
don't go into complex deities take on

214
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
simple daties which all the rishies have

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
given for humanity to practice why

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,720
should one go into go

217
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,279
uh sadas tell me a beginner should never

218
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,480
go into go sadas they should go into

219
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,240
household sadas that are uh advised by

220
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,000
our seers simple omna simple gang nama

221
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,399
or dvi's mantra or you know and and from

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,959
there you build up your inner potential

223
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,200
build it up you know then get into and

224
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
then the guru will come a guru will

225
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
arrive in your life who will take you

226
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,480
into gua sadhas okay according to me

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,519
lighting A diya is a great yes first

228
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,480
step. Absolutely. Yes. Right. Are there

229
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,839
any rules about ghee or oil? No rules.

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
The basic purpose of the diya

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,920
is that is the prayer for the dya. We

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,120
are actually lighting the lamp because

233
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,440
we want that flame to burn inside of us.

234
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,040
And so it does not matter whether you're

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
having a ghee or there's puja tail

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,519
available in puja shops which is

237
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,040
normally either s mustard oil or there

238
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,800
is a sesame oil you know people can use

239
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,279
that and if there is a special occasion

240
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
do agia in north India the ghee you know

241
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
the ghee gets solidified in winter so we

242
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,320
don't use ghee that time we use sesame

243
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,640
oil or we use mustard oil so that does

244
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
not matter god is not looking into the

245
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,600
micro things of you know what what we

246
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,079
are using you see how poor people um

247
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
worship you know they use ordinary

248
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,839
things and they worship they don't buy

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
extraordinary things when people are

250
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,959
economically good then they want to

251
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,360
offer dry fruits to god god does not

252
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,600
differentiate between sugar granules or

253
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
little jaggery or dry fruits he doesn't

254
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
you know so it's like that so the basic

255
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
purpose of lighting a lamp and it's the

256
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
most important thing you rightly said

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,880
that first thing people have to learn to

258
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,240
light a lamp because that invokes the

259
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
it's like lighting a lamp within you

260
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,480
inside and there are mantras for

261
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
lighting a lamp. You

262
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,000
have simple mantras are there or you can

263
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,399
say in English if your thought language

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,240
is English light a lamp and say god

265
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,040
please invoke this light inside me so

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
that I can see you in brightness you

267
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
know you can we can do invocations in

268
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,880
any language if if someone's mother

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,279
tongue is tamil maratti gujarati doesn't

270
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,079
matter god is beyond language because

271
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,800
every deity recognizes

272
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,120
the root of your intentions behind the

273
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,480
sad. Yes. They can go deep within and

274
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,839
understand why you're doing this.

275
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
Absolutely. Yes. So if you're doing this

276
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,839
from a place of material gain or from a

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,680
place of aggressive spiritual growth,

278
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,079
you know, putting that intention of um

279
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,000
hustle behind the sadna. I don't even

280
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,839
think that's correct. Yes. I think it

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
has to be completely from a place of

282
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
love and surrender. It has to be from

283
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,839
you start there. There are there may be

284
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,279
issues in one's life that one would want

285
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,279
to deal with with the help of the deity.

286
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
No doubt about it. But that can be dealt

287
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,519
later that can be spoken to the deity

288
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,079
later. You have to begin with love and

289
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,120
surrender. Absolutely. Perfect.

290
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:15,240
Something that helps me tremendously is

291
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,200
uh that I try offering specific things

292
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,000
to the deities I worship. But if those

293
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
things are not available, I visualize

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
that it's coming out of my heart. Yes.

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
And I'm placing it in front of the D.

296
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,880
And sometimes as I'm doing that, I tear

297
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
up. Yes. Cuz I know the place it's

298
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
coming out of. Yes. And I think the

299
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,279
daties recognize that as Oh yes. Yes.

300
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,920
There's Shamanas Puja written uh very

301
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,560
beautiful um Adiguru Shankrara has

302
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,560
written. It says when things are not

303
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,120
available even when the vigra is not

304
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,000
there suppose you're traveling and even

305
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,839
your you know the idol of the the lord

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
is at home and you're traveling you

307
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,760
could visualize him and you could do all

308
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,240
the decorations that you want mentally

309
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,160
and offer all your bhavana you know to

310
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
the dity and it is accepted it is a

311
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
complete puja the reason I'm mentioning

312
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,959
this is because when you actually have

313
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,800
those objects available

314
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,440
if you have practiced doing it in your

315
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,600
mind and heart for some time then you'll

316
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,639
be able to offer those objects with that

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,959
intention of bacti love do that yes u it

318
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,240
it kind of trains your heart into doing

319
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,560
sad with the right intention yes another

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,560
thing that helps me tremendously is I

321
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,639
genuinely

322
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,360
try burning myself up in my sad like I'm

323
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
just there is nothing I'm not thinking

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,839
about how many mantras are left I'm not

325
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,680
thinking about how many mantras I've I

326
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,920
first and foremost try to enjoy it. And

327
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,320
if I'm not enjoying it, I get up and

328
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,320
come back to it after some time. Yes. Uh

329
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,480
the enjoyment is at the core of what I'm

330
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
doing, not the numbers. Yes, that's

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
absolutely right. You have to do your

332
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,160
sadna with your heart. All your puddra,

333
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
all your rituals, you have to do it with

334
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,240
your heart. If you do it like a

335
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,639
formality, it makes no sense. It it's

336
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,160
it's okay. But you know, we take a salpa

337
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
for instance to light a lamp every day

338
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,720
and do your everyday mantras or pura. We

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
take a salpa. We take a promise. So

340
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,000
people do it sometimes they are in a

341
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,320
hurry to go to the office or you know to

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,959
go to their work then they just do it as

343
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,760
a formality that's okay but the actual

344
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,000
purpose of doing this is to develop a

345
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,079
you know emotional relationship with

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,720
with the go with the lord uh with gpati

347
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,000
because this is a gpati special episode

348
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,120
uh offering dura which is like a I don't

349
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,240
know how you'd describe dura is that a

350
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,720
wise early step that anyone can take

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes, it is. You see the things that are

352
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,199
written in the uh purans, the offerings

353
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,440
of different gods and goddesses, one can

354
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,560
adhere to that, one can stick to that.

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,240
But at some point in your life, you

356
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,639
transcend, you know, all the dos and

357
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,680
don'ts with god at some point in your

358
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,320
life. And that is true uh progress when

359
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,800
you transcend you know and then for

360
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,240
instance we have the mahagpati uh

361
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,720
pratima with the dvi sitting in our

362
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,040
temple and when we did the pranatishta I

363
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,680
was uh the pandi was saying he should

364
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,680
wear a it's nice if you can have a cloth

365
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,560
for him you know the way the south

366
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,079
Indians decorate and you know and I want

367
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,639
him to just wear the yagy pavit and uh

368
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,560
because this is this is the way my

369
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
shreddha was coming and then with

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,480
gurude's permission it happened like

371
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,120
that. So at some point you will

372
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,680
transcend all the formalities and then

373
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,800
what you will design will be with lot of

374
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,920
love and with lot of all the available

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,680
things. There are people living in

376
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,440
America, there are people living in

377
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,360
Europe and many places where lot of

378
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
things are not available. Many things

379
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,759
are not easily available. So if you tie

380
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,399
your mental conditioning uh that my puja

381
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,600
is not complete until I offer the dura

382
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,720
or until I offer a supari or pan or you

383
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,320
know then that gives you

384
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,519
yes tension discomfort you know so uh

385
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,639
all the things that are there you know

386
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,720
in my vicinity and in my availability

387
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,279
these are things I will offer to my god.

388
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Same thing goes with neya. There is a

389
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,079
system of offering neya every day. And

390
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,720
uh if we program our head or condition

391
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,720
our mind that this is one sweet and one

392
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
vegetable and one dal and this is going

393
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,360
to be offered to the god every day and

394
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,680
then that is not done sometimes

395
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,160
household uh we are making sandwiches

396
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
sometimes for instance in household uh

397
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,000
you know uh I'm not talking about the

398
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
temples the temples are very strict

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
about it and that's good you know but

400
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,759
I'm talking about common people common

401
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
people sometimes you're making soup or

402
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,040
you're making sandwiches or you're

403
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,800
making all kinds of food these days.

404
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Nvida means that before I partake, my

405
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,839
lord should partake. That this is the

406
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,839
meaning of offering the neva. Before I

407
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,079
consume food, I want to offer this to

408
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,360
the Lord. A with gratitude that this is

409
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,959
cooked in my house. B that what I am

410
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,160
eating also goes to him.

411
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,160
What I am eating also goes to him.

412
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Braharam

413
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,919
brahagnut. Very beautiful shloka in the

414
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Gita in all the guruguls the children

415
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,039
say this shloka before eating food. So

416
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,880
we are putting everything into

417
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,039
consciousness. Consciousness is cooking.

418
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
Consciousness is being cooked and it has

419
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,760
been eaten by consciousness. It goes

420
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,559
into the fire of consciousness.

421
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:40,960
Wow. Wow. That's the translation. Yeah.

422
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:44,000
Kind of. Wow. Wow. Okay.

423
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,919
Um I'm almost at the end of that early

424
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,880
step description again storas

425
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,919
uh bhajan great place to begin for

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,799
someone beginning early I think every

427
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,799
Ganesh bakan the world

428
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,160
knows is that a mantra you can chant at

429
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
home. Yes, you can. There is a opanishad

430
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
connected with Ganesha called

431
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,240
atarvashisha opanishad which is a part

432
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,240
of our sadhana what we give to our

433
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,960
students there is a gpati moola mantra

434
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
given and there is

435
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,120
aarosisha given. So the the the path is

436
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,120
parallel you know as it goes in asam

437
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,799
praa the path is parallel that means we

438
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,520
do the moola mantra also and we recite

439
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,000
the opanishad also. This way you are

440
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,559
taking the help of bacti yoga with the

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,919
mantra and kana yoga with the help of

442
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,200
opanishad. Upanishad every whichever is

443
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,039
being composed. We have a cannon of

444
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,200
108ishads which are officially uh

445
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,679
scholarly declared to be the group of

446
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,320
opanishads that people can study in the

447
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,160
vantic tradition. All these opishads

448
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,679
give you

449
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,200
brahagan. They all give you brahagan.

450
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
That is the purpose of composing the

451
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
opanishad. The rishies have composed the

452
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,840
oponyishad because brahmagan you will

453
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,679
get. Now how does one get the brahagan?

454
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,559
Just by reading the opanishad once this

455
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,000
once that once that one does not get

456
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,960
brahmagan brahagyan you get when you

457
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,679
read the upanishad a million times and

458
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,720
you atma it that means it goes right

459
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,720
into every cell of your body and there

460
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,400
is a very beautiful composition of adi

461
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,400
guru chakra calledam the first stanza

462
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,400
saysamakaram

463
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,280
yadrian so he saying in

464
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
paragraph

465
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,960
that there is no such knowledge. There

466
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,600
is knowledge is not knowledge if it does

467
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,520
not quieten your indrias. He says that

468
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,679
means if it is does not purify your

469
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,440
senses and quietens down all your

470
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,120
system then it's not knowledge and where

471
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
do you find this knowledge you will find

472
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,799
only in the opanishad. So when we doing

473
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,280
dati pujas any kind of dati puja they

474
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,000
are associated stotras and opanishads

475
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,039
for that dity also always all of them

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,840
most of them have and this oponyishad

477
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,880
should be read every day it should be

478
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,640
read then you absorb the intelligence

479
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,320
which belongs to that deity and that

480
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,320
will take you to permatma where can I

481
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,240
find the opanisha oh there are there

482
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
everywhere it's there on the internet so

483
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
much is there you know so we have the

484
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,320
atarvashisha opanishad for instance and

485
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,919
every opanish will declare. Every

486
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,720
upanishad will declare whether it is a

487
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,720
Dvi upanishad or a Ganesha or a Shivaad.

488
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,799
It will declare that you are Brahma, you

489
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,600
are Vishnu, you are this, you are that,

490
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,600
you know.

491
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:47,840
So that means every will declare that

492
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,039
you arema. So the intelligent people

493
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,080
should understand that every path every

494
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,480
deity is taking you into the same

495
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
playground of

496
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,760
permatma. When the when you read the Dvi

497
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
scripture, it says that Dvi is

498
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
everything. She has she's the creator.

499
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,760
She is the sustainer and the anal. You

500
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,840
read Shiva's scriptures, they say the

501
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,280
same thing. Vishnu, they say the same

502
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
thing, you know. So is there a

503
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,360
battlefield somewhere up there where the

504
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,799
deities are fighting? No. They are

505
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,320
saying that whichever dity you have

506
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,520
fallen in love with it will take you

507
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,559
there. It will take you across the

508
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,280
ocean. M you see so in the system of

509
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,080
worship as you started this topic that

510
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,880
lighting a lamp reading one mantra or

511
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,640
doing one mantra mala and reading that

512
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,840
particular one that particular

513
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,960
associated stotra or upanishad upanishad

514
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,760
is far more superior because upanishad

515
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,000
gives you brahagyan and these sectarian

516
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
differences that are there in our head

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,559
about this god is mine this god is not

518
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,320
mine that will fall apart all the walls

519
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,400
break And you come in the field of

520
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,280
oneness which is the actual purpose of

521
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,919
any sadena. You have to understand God

522
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,799
as one. As long as there are fragments

523
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,600
in their head then that worship is not

524
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,919
complete yet. Now I'll bring you back to

525
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,320
that second pathway because I think this

526
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,919
has concluded the basics of Ganesh sadha

527
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,600
uh section. I also feel that if one does

528
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,600
this for 3 to 6 months at least and then

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,840
becomes extremely hungry for a higher

530
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,760
form of sad they need to seek out people

531
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,760
like yourself. Yes. Actually go to

532
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Rishies, go to Banaras, go to these

533
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,240
places. Yeah. Contemplate, contemplate,

534
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,120
ask, talk you know talk to different

535
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,320
people to scholars and you know when

536
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,960
when one wants to seek advice about what

537
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,600
mantra to do what sadena to do you need

538
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,000
to approach a mature mind and if if

539
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,919
you're just asking you know pundits and

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,200
people who perform pujas they are not

541
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,080
teachers they are not teachers they may

542
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,600
advise with their all good intention I'm

543
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,240
not saying they'll misguide you but all

544
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,400
good intention but that advice is not

545
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,039
something that would be uh you know you

546
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,919
must approach people with experience and

547
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,880
who are sadhuks themselves and uh then

548
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,200
go ahead then go ahead to begin with if

549
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,840
you if you spend that 1 six months for

550
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,480
instance in our school uh you know we

551
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,000
offer them the mantra we offer them the

552
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,840
upanishad after 2 three months I often

553
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,080
ask them what appeals to you more does

554
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,760
this feel good you feel happy doing the

555
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
opanishad or do you feel happy doing the

556
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
mantra as some people say the Upanishad

557
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,799
really really feels nice. Then we give

558
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
them um

559
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,039
aishad. Say that okay now you know do

560
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,880
par ends of the opanishad. Do do more

561
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,960
counts of the opisha and one mala of the

562
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,799
gpati mantra. If someone says the mantra

563
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,600
feels lovely then we say okay read

564
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,799
uponishad once and do uh multiple counts

565
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,799
of the mantra. So each one's wisdom

566
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,400
opens up from inside you know and

567
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,400
therefore it's important to have a

568
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,960
teacher at least a guide if not a

569
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
teacher mentor guru at least a guide

570
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,960
someone you can talk to and can guide

571
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,120
you on the on the path and swag guru

572
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,360
both should be trusted you should trust

573
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,039
what feelings you get inside you know

574
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,840
when you're chanting the mantra or doing

575
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,600
the opishad how do you feel inside and

576
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,760
and let go of the confusion the

577
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
confusion about you know the crowd of

578
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
information that is there of different

579
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
deities and different padi is that crowd

580
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
should be just offered at the feet of

581
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,840
the lord that I don't want to confuse

582
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,640
myself. It's like you can't make a good

583
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,400
dish out of a 100 vegetables, you know.

584
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
It's like that. You want to you want to

585
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,919
make a bangan kverta, make a bangan

586
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,039
kaba. Don't put too many vegetables in

587
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,360
it. It's like that. So you one needs to

588
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,440
a listen to the inner voice, inner

589
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,559
calling. And there therefore silence is

590
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,960
very important. One needs to sit down in

591
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,360
silence to listen to the heart and

592
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,679
listen to the head, you know, and and

593
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,279
ask what what do I want? Even if you're

594
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,960
a te theory, many people get tearary

595
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,200
when they, you know, they they break

596
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,679
down when they're in silent. It's okay.

597
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
You know that it's always nice. It's

598
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,600
always nice because it'll open you up to

599
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,520
listening to what's coming from inside.

600
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,159
Your soul is talking to you actually all

601
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,880
the time. Your soul is on this journey

602
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,400
in a slumber for so many uh lifetimes

603
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,320
and now finally it's it's knocking you

604
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,080
know knocking the door to your prriti

605
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,799
inside that please do something and find

606
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,200
out who I am where am I you know on the

607
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,919
on the long journey of being in slumber

608
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,400
it has lost its way home and it wants to

609
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,320
go home you know so it'll tell you talk

610
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,760
to you it'll speak out and it'll

611
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,000
definitely convey something and the the

612
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,640
magnetism of the soul is such that if

613
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,159
you are not able to hear

614
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,240
him, you will find someone coming and

615
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,559
talking exactly what he wants to tell

616
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
you. You know, consciousness speaks to

617
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,919
consciousness. We spoke in the last

618
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
episode, consciousness speaks to

619
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,640
consciousness. Actually, here in this

620
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,080
world, it's only uh there's only there's

621
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
only God and nothing else. They

622
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,000
say, so there's nothing else in this

623
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,919
world other than me and I'm only

624
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,159
interacting, you know.

625
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm only interacting. Yes. There there's

626
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,640
nothing else in this world. So what what

627
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,799
you want to hear what he wants you to

628
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,440
hear if you're not able to hear it in

629
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,320
silence then he will make someone say

630
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,480
that to you and you will know that this

631
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
is for me.

632
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,480
You will know this is for me because now

633
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,240
you recognize that this is coming from

634
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,320
my inside.

635
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,640
Yeah. M one of the greatest soldiers of

636
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,360
the Indian military was on the show some

637
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,440
years ago. Major Vive Jacob. Uhhuh. Said

638
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,440
the exact same thing. He said the same

639
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,880
thing. He said that all your life's

640
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,559
experiences are first and foremost

641
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,720
happening inside you. Yes. Then it just

642
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,120
gets reflected on the outside. Yes. It

643
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,480
is projected outside.

644
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,320
And he was probably one of the most

645
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,720
evolved beings I've ever come across.

646
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Yes. Yes.

647
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,919
Um anyway coming back to what we were

648
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,799
talking about

649
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,360
um a practice that's helped me a lot is

650
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,559
that say if I'm doing five malas of a

651
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,960
particular mantra or if I've really deep

652
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,320
dived into a particular stotra

653
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,640
uh where I've been reciting it in my own

654
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,080
mind while you recite it and while you

655
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,279
burn yourself in that yes blaze of the

656
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
mantra

657
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:26,320
Um there is a point where you're done

658
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,000
with the count required. Yes. Or where

659
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,200
your body and your head tells you, hey,

660
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,039
stop now. Yes. Uh I think it's very

661
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,320
important to pause at that moment and

662
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,720
reflect. Yes. I would like to believe

663
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,520
that the dat speaking to you in that

664
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,039
window. Yes. Could we speak about this

665
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
window a little bit? It's it's basically

666
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
what you said about reflection. Yes.

667
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,799
It's transcending. When you when you say

668
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,520
you are you are burnt in the mantra, who

669
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,880
is burnt in the

670
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,720
mantra? When you say you are burnt, who

671
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,840
is burnt? Your ego. The identity. The

672
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,559
identity that is renir inside that gets

673
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,360
in it's like in the oven of the mantra

674
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,279
and it is in in a in a you know

675
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,799
non-existing form at this moment and

676
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,760
that is when you should keep quiet

677
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,799
because now the ego is not there. Now

678
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,039
it's only the dity you know and that

679
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,720
communication is very important. You may

680
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,080
call it communication, you may call it

681
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,760
transference of energy, you may call it

682
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,919
transmutation, you may call it uh

683
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,559
transformation, anything there is

684
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,039
something that happens subtly and one

685
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,880
should give a pause to that. So ideally

686
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,799
the counts are given where you give

687
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,360
mantra chants they do two malas, five

688
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,679
malas, 11 malas. It's basically a

689
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,120
training to the ego. It's basically the

690
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
training to the ego and the mind. The

691
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,000
mind gets tired, the ego gets tired. And

692
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,679
when these two are tired, then your

693
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,399
system is open and receptive to

694
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,360
receiving what the dity wants to give

695
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:59,360
you. It's basically that exercise. So if

696
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,360
you're not fulfilling that count and you

697
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,679
are tired for instance and you want to

698
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,440
stop, you stop. Give it a pause. Let

699
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,679
that transference happen and then can

700
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,520
continue. If you're truly immersed in

701
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,440
that burning blaze, yes. Uh you may not

702
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
want to stop also. You may not not want

703
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,200
to stop also. Yes. And then you just

704
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,720
keep going. You just keep going without

705
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,120
a count. Yes. Yes. That's how the urapa

706
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,080
japa happens. There is a japa japa.

707
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,000
There is one that we count and then you

708
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,240
just keep the mala down and the mind is

709
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
now saying saying saying saying saying

710
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
saying saying the mantra you know. So

711
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
there's no vocal voice. There's no voice

712
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,360
coming but the mind is now saying the

713
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,399
mantra in a you know repeated manner.

714
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,399
This is called japa japa.

715
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,720
Wow. Yeah, it's very beautiful and

716
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,279
that's actually the yogic way of doing

717
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,080
the mantra. The yogis sit for hours

718
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,399
together with ajapa. They don't count,

719
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,080
you know. So, it's the two hours, 3

720
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,320
hours of just doing the mantra. Let

721
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,480
them, like you said, let the fire burn.

722
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
Uh, I have to kind of pull it out to a

723
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,480
hyper practical almost materialistic

724
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,279
perspective on everything we've spoken

725
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,039
about.

726
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,679
Um, I'll just give the audience a bottom

727
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,919
line if they're not with us up till this

728
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,960
point and they're questioning starting

729
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,679
sadha.

730
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,919
Um, on every single day that I do my

731
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,200
sadha, I'm a different person right

732
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,760
after it. Right after it, I'm elevated.

733
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,960
It's almost like every cell in your body

734
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,640
has had a micro caffeine shot. Then I

735
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,520
begin my day. Feels great. Yes. And I

736
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,320
cannot operate unless I do at least a

737
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,760
proportion of my ideally whatever I have

738
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,880
planned for every morning I need to get

739
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,320
that done at least. Uh but I need to at

740
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,320
least touch it to begin my day. Uh and

741
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,240
it's a great place to be. Yes. For

742
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,559
multiple material world reasons as well.

743
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,799
Yes. Uh would you like to just shed some

744
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,480
light on this? I I I think it's an

745
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,080
important conversation to be had for

746
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,880
young people who are listening in. So

747
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,360
there are these three stages uh taking

748
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,399
reference to exactly what you said there

749
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,919
are these three stages when uh in your

750
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,760
marker on your path of doing bacti the

751
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,080
first stage you are imposing a system

752
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,320
that someone advised you you know it's

753
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,559
like you're you're you're in a school

754
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,440
and you are practicing it without

755
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,360
knowing what's going to happen and at

756
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,240
the second stage you have anchored into

757
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
the dity and it is the stage that you

758
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,600
are talking about when you're anchored

759
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,919
into the dity and without holding that

760
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,320
anchor you don't feel complete you don't

761
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,399
feel confident you don't feel ready to

762
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,120
go for the work or for your for your day

763
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,320
that's the second uh stage and at the

764
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,600
third stage this physical anchor melts

765
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,600
into a subtle beautiful faith you know a

766
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,960
subtle beautiful faith that your sadena

767
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
goes with you wherever you're going

768
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,480
through the day and uh it's like the

769
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,159
anchor is not just there in the morning

770
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
the anchor is there with me through the

771
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,840
day. The anchor is pulling me and taking

772
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,000
me everywhere you know and therefore

773
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,600
that connection never breaks. I think

774
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,679
the obvious question is when does the

775
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,880
third stage arrive? But third stage

776
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,600
happens and it's a a matter of ka it's

777
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,279
ka sadhya it's a matter of ka the more

778
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,799
you are in love with the dity and the

779
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
more the dity falls in love with you

780
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,720
always remember the dity loves you more

781
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,279
than you love the

782
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,519
dity always that's why you you're

783
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,399
practicing you know he picks up the the

784
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,799
sadhak and the sadhak does not have the

785
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,960
capability to even fathom that power

786
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,559
he picks you up yes he chooses you

787
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,960
because he's already fallen in love with

788
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,960
you. Oshi. Oshi. Yes.

789
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:57,039
Um there there is a connection

790
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,360
of deities with their own vahans for

791
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:04,000
sure. Their vahans and their you know

792
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,159
respective herbs and essences and herbs

793
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,519
and things smells that they like flowers

794
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:13,360
that they like

795
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,360
association. Puja Puja

796
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,279
Puja like their preferences. Yes.

797
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,640
Frequential you know. For example, we

798
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,120
have the seven chakras, seven

799
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,519
corresponding colors, flowers, aromomas,

800
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,960
vegetables, herbs, everything.

801
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,640
Similarly, planets are their

802
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
corresponding herbs, corresponding

803
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,559
aromomas. Similarly, deities have. So

804
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,679
they are basically vibrational

805
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,000
frequencies that they correlate and

806
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,000
that's

807
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,039
how you

808
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,880
know correspondence. What about the

809
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,880
animals?

810
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Animals

811
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,399
connected. The lion is connected.

812
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,880
They're symbolic. Animals are more

813
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,080
symbolic. Like the black dog with the

814
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,399
beer is very symbolic of his power. You

815
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,639
know, and appearance.

816
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,440
Our mind you know is a fantastic

817
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,720
machine. When we understand these

818
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,800
correlations, correlation when we

819
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,399
understand then it becomes a reality.

820
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,560
If someone doesn't understand it, he

821
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,280
won't even notice it. Someone doesn't

822
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,200
know it. So whatever we believe to be

823
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,800
real, our whole being reacts to it.

824
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,960
Magic reveals itself to those who

825
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,520
believe in it. The the synchronosity and

826
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,839
there is a law of synchronization, you

827
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,200
know. Then that black dog that you have

828
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,200
in your head and that black dog will

829
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,200
actually develop the qualities, you

830
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,679
know, that uh gives you the sense of

831
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,280
beer. You know similarly a cat you know

832
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,200
there are people that we it's all the

833
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
conditioning of the mind basically

834
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
because the whole nature the whole

835
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,079
proriti is inside of you and outside of

836
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,960
you consequently. So when we start

837
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,240
relating with uh

838
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,920
correspondence crystal correspondence

839
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,160
flower correspondence aroma

840
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,760
correspondence then you put that essence

841
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,160
and you get that vibe.

842
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,240
Your mind connects now to that frequency

843
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,400
instantly. Therefore we have all the

844
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,240
corresponding flowers liked by the

845
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
deities and you know like you have

846
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,680
bailputra liked by Shiva and lotus liked

847
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,160
by Lakshmi etc. Pan and supari offered

848
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,880
to Ganesha or Dwva offered to Ganesha.

849
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,160
All these correspondence is there based

850
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,079
on their frequencies and the human mind

851
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,160
programming

852
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,520
and also the books written thereafter.

853
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
You know in the piranhas they have

854
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,680
written so many stories about what the

855
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,760
vahans are, what the offerings are, what

856
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,000
bananas to be offered, what fruits to be

857
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,560
offered. So now this becomes a big

858
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
collective programming and it works like

859
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,160
that because it falls under the law of

860
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
synchronosity.

861
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,800
Um you know you spoke about beer and

862
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,280
dogs and effectively a dog represents

863
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,200
the quality of the blessings that beav

864
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,880
can bring in terms of protection,

865
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,359
strength, yes, bravery. Yes. I have to

866
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,320
twist it and ask you about Gandatino.

867
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,800
Yes. Could you explain the mouse a

868
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,119
little more? Symbolically speaking, it

869
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,240
represents the ego and Ganesha rides

870
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,440
over it. The mouse is a very destructive

871
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,119
creature. It's a very destructive

872
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,359
creature. You leave a mouse in the house

873
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,880
and it's going to break things and you

874
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,119
know nibble into something and eat eat

875
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,680
spoil things and eat food grains etc.

876
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,680
And it represents the ego. Symbolism is

877
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,400
that Ganesha rides that mouse because

878
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,720
the intellect rides the ego then it is a

879
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,920
fantastic combination. If the intellect

880
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,880
rides the ego, yeah, that means the your

881
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,480
decisions are not based on the ego. You

882
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,480
know, your decisions are not based on

883
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,680
the ego, but the decisions are taken by

884
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,359
the power of the intellect. Ganesha is a

885
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,320
power. When he sits on the mouse, then

886
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,200
that means the broadened widened

887
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,760
enlightened intellect is now sitting on

888
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,640
the ego and that ego is in in control of

889
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,400
that intellect. What is intellect? What

890
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,560
what intellect is a discriminating

891
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,599
power. See in the western world there's

892
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,760
only mind you know in but but our

893
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,000
vidantic scripture has gone deeper to

894
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,560
understand different facets of the mind

895
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and we have classified in you know into

896
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,000
the four distribution of uh antakarna.

897
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,320
So that means man buddhi chitta and

898
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,560
ahankar these are the four aspects they

899
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,280
are aspects of the mind only but there

900
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,359
are four departments sub departments. So

901
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,040
buddhi which is intellect is the

902
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,680
discriminating factor that means if I

903
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,079
see something there's a thought in my

904
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,160
mind suppose I see a bearded man in

905
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,839
front of me my mind says who is this the

906
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
thought that comes when there is a

907
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,800
sensual input the mind will immediately

908
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,560
put a question or a thought who is this

909
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,040
now who is going to give me this answer

910
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,680
of who is this inside this thought it

911
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,160
put is put into the

912
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,359
intellect the intellect is

913
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,560
discriminating and going to give me an

914
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,920
answer looks like a thief or looks like

915
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,640
a sadhu. How does it take that decision?

916
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,720
How does the intellect take this

917
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,280
decision? It takes decision tapping into

918
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,200
the memory and the

919
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,880
ego. It taps into the memory and ego. If

920
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,440
I have had good experiences with a

921
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,760
bearded person in the past, not past

922
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,079
life, can be past life also. Even in

923
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,839
this life there is a conditioning in my

924
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,760
head that such kind of people are not

925
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,160
good you know which is not an absolute

926
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,920
truth yeah but that conditioning is

927
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,320
there in my head now that such kind of

928
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,640
people are based on the memory and the

929
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
ego if I'm if my ego feels threatened if

930
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,480
I feel threatened with that man

931
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,240
immediately the intellect puts it in the

932
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,960
mind is not a good person let him sit

933
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,520
out you know so the mind is where

934
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,000
thoughts are produced intellect is where

935
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,160
these thoughts are discriminated

936
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,560
based on ego and the memory right and

937
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,960
you know the I identity which is all the

938
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,280
time doing things what have I to do how

939
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,200
do I progress the I is a doer all the

940
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,480
time

941
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,520
uselessly actually under the folds of

942
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,520
doing the happening process is there you

943
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,680
know but the eye feels that I am doing

944
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,800
everything including I I've eaten my

945
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,720
food and I'm you know you eat your food

946
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,440
none of that after that is done by the

947
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,119
ego everything is automated machine. The

948
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,480
digestion is happening. Everything is

949
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,800
happening. But the ego has this habit of

950
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,119
doing everything and so it worries about

951
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,000
the past. It worries about the future

952
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,480
and it takes everything into its credit.

953
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,400
Ego is the root of anxiety. Ego is the

954
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,400
absolute root of ignorance and anxiety

955
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,680
both when and that's the purpose of the

956
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,640
sadena. The purpose of the sadena is to

957
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,560
make this mouse even

958
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,440
smaller as small as it can and let your

959
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,800
buddhi ride over it. That is Ganesha. So

960
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,560
with Ganesh sadena basically the ego is

961
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,119
minimized which happens with all the

962
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,599
sadas. I'm not biased with you know I'm

963
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,280
someone who loves all the deities and I

964
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,119
love all the paths and I know all the

965
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,359
paths take you to peratma. So all the

966
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,599
sadas will minimize the ego and

967
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:32,960
eventually dissolve this ego into the

968
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,960
real eye which is Brahman which is which

969
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,640
is the lord sitting inside you and when

970
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,680
you take up the sadena for instance we

971
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,599
take ganeshas you know the ganesha in

972
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,800
the beginning of the sadena the ganesha

973
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,320
is there and I am here I'm woriing I'm

974
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,880
doing the sadena over a period of time I

975
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,960
can only see ganesha I don't feel me

976
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,240
that's when my my ego has started

977
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,119
dissolving into the deity. Wow. And

978
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,599
after another sometime which which could

979
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,359
be months or years there is not even

980
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,440
Ganesha, there's not even me, there's

981
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,119
only

982
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,680
light. This is what we say that the

983
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,720
triad in in Triputi we call it in

984
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,800
vidanta that the the the seer and the

985
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,240
scene have merged into

986
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,319
knowledge and that is the purpose of any

987
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,319
sadena be it sadena sadena any sadena to

988
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,000
merge into the deity the deity is only

989
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,680
there you are not there and that the

990
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
dity dissolves into the light

991
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,960
that fire that you burn in during your

992
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,839
bacti yes that takes over the whole

993
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:45,200
universe Yes, absolutely. Wow.

994
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,359
Buddhi anar chitta. Chitta is your

995
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,119
unconscious mind. The dark mind where

996
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,720
there are all you know um unseen things

997
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,000
hiding especially traumas and old

998
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,280
conditioning. It's heavy. It's like tar

999
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,480
chitta is almost like um like it takes

1000
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,240
you to gravity shackles. Yeah. Your mind

1001
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,400
is uh we we categorize mind into three

1002
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,480
levels. Your conscious mind you and me

1003
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,640
are talking right now. This is conscious

1004
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,400
mind. It always gets connected to the

1005
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,960
unconscious to the you know. So this two

1006
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
two together we call chitta. Your

1007
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,560
conscious mind which is working hand in

1008
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,079
hand with the unconscious mind we call

1009
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,440
it chitta. And in bi in any sadena and

1010
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,119
bacti the aim first aim is to make your

1011
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,000
chitta shant. That means to bring peace

1012
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,240
in your chitta because the unconscious

1013
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,680
is all the time hitting the conscious.

1014
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,520
You know there's fear all the time.

1015
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,280
There is worry all the time. There is

1016
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,079
all the time because your past

1017
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,480
experiences are kind of you know pushing

1018
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,400
the conscious mind. And the secret of

1019
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,200
bacti is that the secret of spiritual

1020
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,359
growth is that that if you are able to

1021
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,839
liberate your conscious mind from the

1022
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,160
unconscious mind and connect it with the

1023
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,920
higher mind which is always connected to

1024
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,440
the

1025
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,920
deities then your journey becomes very

1026
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,440
flawless and smooth. That's probably the

1027
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,200
process of sadena right that's the

1028
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,599
process of the sadhana that when your

1029
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,400
chitta become shant first stage then

1030
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,119
unconscious you get disconnected and you

1031
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,359
get connected to the higher conscious to

1032
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,240
the higher mind you know and higher mind

1033
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,880
is handinhand with your dity in fact

1034
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,319
your higher mind becomes adin of the

1035
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,760
dity that's how your dity will start

1036
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,760
speaking to you in your head

1037
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,640
I want to dive deeper into exactly what

1038
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:41,200
you said Yes. Uh what what do you mean

1039
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,400
by adin? Adin means submitted. Okay.

1040
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,720
Under. Okay. So effectively to

1041
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,200
summarize, you're saying that the sadha

1042
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,839
allows you to shed off what is holding

1043
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,359
your mind back. Yes. And that is always

1044
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,440
the past. Okay. That creates space. Yes.

1045
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,119
And that space is where the dity can

1046
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,800
come and pick you up. Yes. Okay. Yes.

1047
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,119
Okay. Okay.

1048
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,400
I have a cricketer friend of mine. His

1049
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:12,240
name is KL Rahul. Yes. And we discuss

1050
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,079
Sadna a lot. Uh and he's also got a very

1051
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,800
intense amount of bacti towards Hanuman

1052
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,359
Gi like Oh, how beautiful. And he's got

1053
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,640
this one beautiful tattoo where uh it

1054
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:26,800
showcases a human being lifted by this

1055
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,359
really muscular arm. It's clearly that

1056
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,720
of Hanumah. Wow. Is it similar to what

1057
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,960
you're saying? Yes, it's similar. The

1058
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,280
maruds you know we I remember in the la

1059
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,839
in the episode that we did in the first

1060
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,440
episode we spoke little about maruts you

1061
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:44,160
know so maruds are a very very peculiar

1062
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,079
and intrinsic part of your panic system

1063
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,079
they are very very and very few people

1064
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,160
know about know and talk about this the

1065
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,520
word marauti in hanuman has come out of

1066
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,520
the word marut you know maruts are born

1067
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,920
to the vayu's movement in the sun when

1068
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,640
the process of creation happened you

1069
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,920
know The movement of bayou in the sun

1070
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,040
created maruts. These are particles that

1071
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,079
high high velocity particles that come

1072
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,839
from other galaxies. All right. The word

1073
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,520
marauti comes from marut. The word

1074
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:20,720
hanuman also comes from marut. Han is a

1075
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,280
is a has a is a is like a bjakar that

1076
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:28,560
has the meaning that something that

1077
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:32,800
strikes with great velocity and man is

1078
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,800
huge and heavy and stable. So hanuman

1079
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,400
word combination means something that

1080
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,119
moves with great velocity and can

1081
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,680
destroy anything which is huge and

1082
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:46,400
stable. All right. He was born to

1083
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,920
queseri queserand he was born to queseri

1084
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,640
and anjana dvi. Queseri means son and

1085
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,200
Anjana Dvi means the dark primordial

1086
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,240
proriti when the thing was born

1087
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,880
goosebumps all over right go on you know

1088
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,280
Hanuman is that force and this quality

1089
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,359
actually of the maruts is present in all

1090
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,200
the

1091
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,960
deities is present in all the deities

1092
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,640
especially a portal of Hanuman has

1093
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,440
happened because of the bi that people

1094
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,680
have immense bi that people have done of

1095
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,000
hanuman hanuman portal is there he is a

1096
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,000
living deity and people have seen in

1097
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,960
him. You know, I met a girl very

1098
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,440
recently who had a lot of skin issues

1099
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,079
all over her body and she was a 30-some

1100
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,000
not married and gone into a lot of you

1101
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,880
know uh uh sadness in the body and uh

1102
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,280
she went out for a corporate uh uh you

1103
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,319
know meet up somewhere and she was in

1104
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,440
that duka and probably she had something

1105
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,440
with with everyone and she had a saksha

1106
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,160
dan of

1107
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,400
hanuman she saw Hanumani in front of her

1108
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,160
and that episode could have been a

1109
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,240
hallucination. I mean anybody could have

1110
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,160
just taken it to be a hallucination but

1111
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:01,440
that event changed her life completely.

1112
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,000
Number one her entire body was changed.

1113
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,960
That whole skin issue that she had

1114
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,599
disappeared within a matter of one month

1115
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,800
her whole

1116
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:14,319
kayakalpul everything changed and she

1117
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,400
has become a devout ba of hanuman.

1118
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,240
devout bakta who never ever went into

1119
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,680
any temple or believed in any gods and

1120
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,119
goddesses because of her own tormenting

1121
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,119
life. She has become a devout bakta of

1122
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,280
Hanuman. So Hanuman dashan people have

1123
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,359
had all the deities give dashan. How

1124
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,839
does the dashion happen? You know I mean

1125
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,319
this is what my guruv taught me. I many

1126
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:39,599
people may not uh be in line with this

1127
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:42,640
thought but he says that when a bhakta

1128
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,599
has become completely surrendered and

1129
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,560
dissolved in the dity the deity is so

1130
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,480
happy and when I say deity ultimately it

1131
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,079
is consciousness and permatma permatma

1132
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,079
is so happy that to please his eyes a

1133
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,520
dashion is created and who creates this

1134
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,920
dashion the maruts in his body the panic

1135
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,160
particles in our body have we have marut

1136
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
paws every act of destruction in your

1137
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,960
body destruction means I'm not talking

1138
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,800
negatively the food is broken into food

1139
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,560
is broken into smaller particles

1140
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,880
absorption is happening so it's an act

1141
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,280
of destruction every act of destruction

1142
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,319
in our body which is required is done by

1143
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,119
the maruts the prana does not have its

1144
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:26,280
own power other than the maruts and when

1145
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,319
a person comes into bacti the maruts are

1146
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,520
maximized and when the maruts are

1147
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,400
maximized the soul itself self has ka

1148
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,000
over the bhta and shows him gives him

1149
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:42,000
the dashan of the deity he believes in.

1150
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,400
So people have seen life krishna shiva

1151
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,040
those who are in baki have seen their

1152
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,839
their deities in front of them and this

1153
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,359
is the miracle of pmatma showering grace

1154
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:56,319
and the maruts do it. So Marauti Bhagwan

1155
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,280
talking about him he's an immense portal

1156
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,119
of power

1157
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,200
perhaps this is why Hanumanji is linked

1158
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,640
to physical powers. Yes also all the

1159
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,119
siddhis are associated with him and uh

1160
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,720
you know the physical powers in the

1161
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,040
sense he can become small like this

1162
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,880
much. He can become big like this much.

1163
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,040
He can become heavy like a mountain. He

1164
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,559
can be light as air as a feather. All

1165
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,240
these siddhis come from they they come

1166
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,200
from the maruts. This is what needs to

1167
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,599
be understood. They come from the maruts

1168
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,240
and hanuman being the deity for the

1169
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,119
marut paws. They called marut paws. He's

1170
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,200
vayup putra. Vayup putra means he's born

1171
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,400
to the vayu. The moment of the vayu in

1172
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,559
the sun. Okay. To kind of summarize what

1173
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,960
you said, I think you've given us the

1174
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,280
sanatani version of what are we but

1175
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,680
stardust. Yes.

1176
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,760
So you're saying that according to

1177
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:55,040
Sanatan Dharm um there were high

1178
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:01,800
velocity particles that found their way

1179
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:04,400
near the atmosphere of the sun. Uh

1180
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,319
these particles of light or energy

1181
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,960
particles are referred to as maroots.

1182
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,480
Yeah. They're born to the spand of

1183
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,599
Shivashaki.

1184
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,000
You know the S that you see in a ying

1185
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,280
and single symbol the white and black is

1186
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,880
divided by a s line bright line this

1187
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,040
bright line is where maruts are born

1188
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,720
rdra is also a synonym to this marut

1189
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,119
only you know when we say the power of

1190
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:32,640
rdra you see it's also a product uh

1191
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:36,000
which is born to this spand of shivan

1192
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,240
shaki from a very human perspective uh

1193
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,240
everyone has heard the word pranayam or

1194
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,640
increase the pran flowing through your

1195
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,119
Yes. Uh so pran could be loosely

1196
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,359
understood to be external energy or

1197
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,319
energy that's present all around us.

1198
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,599
Energy every kind of energy is prana

1199
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,720
number one. When we do pranayyam it's

1200
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,640
basically the life force energy inside

1201
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:01,680
us. We are bringing that into control.

1202
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,760
Yama means to bring it in control. So

1203
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,680
say you're doing the pranayam and the

1204
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,200
life force in you is increasing. Yes.

1205
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,359
Physical manifestation of that would be

1206
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,880
good skin, good hair, good health. Yeah.

1207
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,920
Yeah. But you said something

1208
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,720
interesting. You said that it's the

1209
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,720
maruts that actually cause changes

1210
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,800
inside your body and not the prana. Yes.

1211
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,400
They are the soldiers in your prana. So

1212
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,800
what is the linkage between the prana

1213
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,480
and the maruts? The maruts are like you

1214
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,000
could say like floating particles on

1215
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,720
prana. They are the soldiers of the

1216
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,440
prana. And let's say as you say you know

1217
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,319
in your blood there is hemoglobin. When

1218
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,880
when when your hemoglobin count is good

1219
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,119
then you say your blood is good. M in

1220
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,800
the same way when the count of maruds

1221
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,440
and which automatically goes the moment

1222
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,680
you start sadha that is how people are

1223
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,240
able to manifest anything out of the

1224
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,079
thin air the yogis you know they

1225
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,960
manifest anything out of the thin air

1226
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,960
all these siddhis even vaka siddhi you

1227
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,800
know all these siddhis come because of

1228
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,720
the maruts you're increasing the number

1229
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,200
of maruts in your body in the body with

1230
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,920
the sadena

1231
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:08,599
automatically automatically just when I

1232
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,880
think that I've learned a lot about

1233
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,240
Sada. There's suddenly a new concept

1234
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,160
through I've never heard of this in my

1235
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,079
life. Yeah. It's the joy of podcasting

1236
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,599
as well. Yes. Yes. You know, so many

1237
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,240
human beings don't even click on these

1238
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,720
episodes because just notions about what

1239
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,160
uh would be contained in the episode.

1240
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh, this is the kind of my parents

1241
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,760
watch. I want to watch this. Yeah. Yeah.

1242
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,960
Yeah. Yeah. Because their time is not

1243
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,800
yet right for them. Time comes. Then in

1244
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,359
the timeline, God lets you play in the

1245
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,880
nursery school as long as you want. Then

1246
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:41,680
he takes you up to graduation. He is the

1247
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:47,480
doer and he takes us. That's why when

1248
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,480
you come into bi you understand that um

1249
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:01,800
and uh with your dire compassion, dear

1250
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,040
compassion, uplift me and take me

1251
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,599
higher. So when when we don't know this,

1252
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:12,000
then we are ignorant. Then the doer is

1253
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,000
the ego and the ego goes battling

1254
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,960
everywhere on the account of Maya.

1255
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,480
You're just going round and round like

1256
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,240
merry goround and you you fall you get

1257
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,800
up you fall you get up you fall you get

1258
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,119
up and then you question why am I

1259
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,839
falling you know it's so that time comes

1260
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,440
for everyone not to judge anyone even

1261
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,319
those who are ignorant are on their

1262
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,359
journey even those who are ignorant are

1263
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,680
on their journey everyone even a the

1264
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,319
worst of the person in the world is on a

1265
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,200
journey and this journey is is ruled by

1266
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:51,520
a higher power not by us. So to judge is

1267
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,760
to is to fall down in your bi. I I

1268
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,359
always believe that that it's God's

1269
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,839
world. It's his sata, his governance and

1270
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:03,200
he knows what to do with all the men

1271
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:05,200
folk and the you know human folk and uh

1272
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,400
we should quietly watch everything that

1273
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,160
is happening in the world and the if

1274
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:16,599
there is any analysis that one should do

1275
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:18,960
is only of oneself. That's it. M okay.

1276
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,920
Um because this whole episode has been

1277
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,359
about Gpati. Yes. Another associated

1278
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,119
question. You know

1279
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:30,559
how one categorizes themselves as being

1280
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,000
a shite or shak. Yes. Or vishnavite.

1281
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:36,319
Where do you place gpati in this gapata?

1282
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,559
That's a fourth. It's a sraa. Yes. Like

1283
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:42,400
you have shyites, vashnovites, shaktas.

1284
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,040
Disa are called shakta.

1285
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,119
upas are called ghapatya. It's a sra.

1286
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,480
Okay. Yeah. And would you say that every

1287
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,079
sra has their own rules? Yeah. Rules are

1288
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,240
made like schools have rules and

1289
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,680
colleges have rules. But they're always

1290
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:00,480
these scientist and these creative uh

1291
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,520
lads, you know, students who surpass all

1292
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:08,000
the rules. I'm one of them.

1293
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:11,760
Gosh. So I I honor the rules and uh but

1294
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,599
but my love equation with God is like I

1295
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:20,079
feel that uh above these rules are love

1296
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:22,720
is love and that is uh paramount and he

1297
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,640
teaches me rules. He teaches me rules.

1298
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,160
It's not that I am uh unruly. No, he

1299
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,280
teaches me rules and I make my own

1300
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,280
rules. Yes. just asking you a question

1301
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,880
that's kind of been popping on the

1302
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,400
internet lately. Okay. So, I'm not

1303
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,400
trying to cause chaos or anything. Yes.

1304
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:49,040
Uh in Ghana year, yeah, Gapata, how is

1305
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,599
like non-veg versus veg looked at? Is it

1306
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,640
a health related thing? Are there strict

1307
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,280
rules with food? Um and generally

1308
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,440
speaking from a larger lens what is your

1309
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,960
opinion on the rules of diet with

1310
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,280
respect to sanatan dharm in general

1311
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,280
because I get very varied answers

1312
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,599
whenever I ask this question. In all the

1313
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,760
sraayas you would always have three

1314
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,240
categories of followers. One very satic

1315
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,480
which go with by the law by the rule and

1316
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,839
they are very strict about food habits

1317
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,079
and about sensory inputs and about

1318
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,680
celibacy and about spending the energy

1319
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,880
in a particular way and not in a

1320
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,680
particular way about the sut and uh

1321
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,760
susati and not never kangati. They're

1322
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,640
very strict. There are rajasik people

1323
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,799
who are more celebrating you know they

1324
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,440
like colorful gate you know very

1325
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,119
beautiful uh celebrations with their bi

1326
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,000
they're rajasik people and often they

1327
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,760
are businessoriented and people who are

1328
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
you know having material pursuits in

1329
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,319
this world and can afford elaborate

1330
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,079
celebrations etc. And then you have

1331
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:58,640
tamasi followers who are exploratory and

1332
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,160
they often get uh attracted to tantric

1333
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,280
practices and uh uh they have uh

1334
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,680
backgrounds that do not uh suddenly want

1335
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,119
to jump into a satic way of life. For

1336
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,000
instance, if somebody is born in a

1337
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,400
non-vegetarian family and uh has been

1338
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,319
eating non-vegetarian food like food,

1339
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,440
you know, it's food for them like you

1340
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:22,880
have fish for for someone born in Bengal

1341
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,799
or like uh in Kerala you have seafood as

1342
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,040
is there. It's like staple food for

1343
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:31,359
them. Um so the non-vegetarian food I

1344
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,559
don't critically look at the food per

1345
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:38,160
se. It's after a certain stage of

1346
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,160
development of a saddak that he needs to

1347
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,119
be very watchful about how the energy is

1348
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,280
moving in me. So the beginning stages

1349
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,000
whatever family background you belong to

1350
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,799
culture you belong to you can you need

1351
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,960
not rebel against it one need not rebel

1352
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:56,000
against it the food is not bad but what

1353
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,799
it does to you is bad after a point. So

1354
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,440
when you reach a certain level of um

1355
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:05,119
sadena where your meditation is getting

1356
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,720
intense and your then you know yourself

1357
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:12,079
for instance I if I eat urat kidal two

1358
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,400
or three days at stretch my body can

1359
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,760
feel the heaviness and I can't

1360
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,079
meditate similarly with onions or garlic

1361
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,559
or you know anything that is so you know

1362
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,640
your energy system then after some time

1363
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,359
so not to critically speak about

1364
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,880
non-vegetarian food. I say that any kind

1365
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,040
of food which is there in your

1366
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,040
refrigerator and in your kitchen can be

1367
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,240
good or bad for you. You have to

1368
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,799
identify your energy this thing. So

1369
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,359
because non-vegetarian food is difficult

1370
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,680
to digest and uh creates a lot of

1371
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,920
tamasic heaviness. When you say tamasi

1372
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,680
does not mean you become a bad person.

1373
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,000
It means it creates heaviness in the

1374
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,520
body. energy that you have to fight with

1375
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,119
then to become light in your you know in

1376
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,200
your being. It it gives you more um

1377
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,440
tamas means more heaviness when you're

1378
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,079
meditating you feel sleepy when you want

1379
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:10,319
to exercise you can't you know when you

1380
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,720
want to uh do long couplets long chance

1381
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,520
then you can't and the mind will then

1382
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:18,000
say it's enough I've done this much so

1383
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,559
that procrastination and that heaviness

1384
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,680
in the mind and body comes with anything

1385
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,079
that does not digest easily and could be

1386
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,480
even a black lentil

1387
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,200
could be even a black lentil. That's why

1388
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,480
when you reach a yogic level of sadena

1389
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,160
then people take only little kiti or

1390
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,000
they take very little they don't even

1391
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,240
eat all the elaborate food which is

1392
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,200
there because everything leaves an

1393
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,520
impact on the panic system you know so I

1394
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,359
don't view at that uh thing critically

1395
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,440
it's not that oh he's a non-vegetarian

1396
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:51,599
person should should not be brought here

1397
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,520
or that's that's that's a wrong way to

1398
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,760
talk about it it's a staple food for

1399
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,599
many of the states that we know about

1400
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,680
many of the countries that we know about

1401
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,480
right so we we don't view at it

1402
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,359
negatively it's every individual on his

1403
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,680
mara of sadena and bi for him to decide

1404
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:10,880
what is not doing good to my body I stop

1405
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,240
it similarly it goes with pancha macara

1406
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,400
we talk about the tantric um sraayas

1407
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,839
most of the tantric sraayas especially

1408
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:24,119
the wamachara sects they puncha makaras

1409
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:28,960
are allowed pancha macakaras means um uh

1410
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:33,200
mamsa uh madiraa that is alcohol or then

1411
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,559
um maiduna which is sex and mudra you

1412
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,240
know so these these pancha macakaras are

1413
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,680
actually banned things in spiritual

1414
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:45,599
practices in in sanatan dharma or in any

1415
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,520
you know um but these are used by a lot

1416
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,599
of the sradas they're allowed not used

1417
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,920
they're allowed by a lot of the sraas

1418
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,559
the compassionate approach being that if

1419
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,240
these are there in your life then you

1420
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:00,160
need to watch observe and grow over

1421
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,960
them. Say for instance, celibacy is an

1422
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,359
important aspect in many yogic streams

1423
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,760
because it saves energy. But if someone

1424
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:10,240
is in householder, then you cannot ask

1425
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,160
the person to become a celibate when he

1426
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,079
has his dharmic duties towards his

1427
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:18,000
spouse, you know. So watchful all the

1428
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,960
five things one needs to be watchful

1429
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,559
about and taken in moderation to begin

1430
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,079
with and eventually

1431
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,240
transcend as you progress on the path

1432
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,480
then you are asked to transcend. So

1433
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,240
satwic, rajasic and tamasic approach to

1434
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:37,200
sadhana is there in all the sraas be it

1435
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,720
dvi sadena be it shy you know you have

1436
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,559
in in shiva's sraaya also you have the

1437
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,839
you know the deities are there where

1438
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,319
there is alcohol uh offered to the dvita

1439
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:51,200
there is uh plant medicines that people

1440
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:52,720
consume but it's not because the the dva

1441
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,480
wants you to get addicted to these

1442
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,440
things it's because the dva wants you to

1443
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,400
transcend and eventually go over it so

1444
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,040
The beauty of sanatan dharma is that our

1445
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,880
tradition Indian vic tradition is that

1446
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:10,960
for every level of person there is a

1447
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,760
path. M the crudest of the person who

1448
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,880
does not know any language or refinement

1449
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,960
in their in their you know being for him

1450
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,359
also there is

1451
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,200
sadena there is a dity you see people in

1452
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,400
tribals and villages and all there are

1453
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,880
kula devatas guladvis their very crude

1454
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,880
practices are there but they do it with

1455
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,359
faith and they transcend and it's not

1456
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,440
the journey of one life right it is the

1457
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,520
journey of many lifetimes so over the

1458
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,920
lifetimes they refine And they come on

1459
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:44,240
better cleaner ways of worship. These

1460
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,480
are all stages of evolution. Our bacti

1461
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,720
also evolves sometime and you see that

1462
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,480
in one lifetime also as you were 10

1463
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,480
years back as you are now and as you

1464
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,599
would be 10 years later you would be

1465
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,720
able to trace that journey. Similarly it

1466
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:01,839
is with many

1467
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,760
lifetimes. Yeah. Okay. We almost reached

1468
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,839
the end of this episode. There was

1469
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,160
something in your heart that you wanted

1470
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:12,319
to speak about on this platform. Uh

1471
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:17,359
something about common mistakes in the

1472
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:19,760
bi notions. Yes. False notions and uh um

1473
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,000
you know misunderstandings

1474
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,240
like events we were speaking about when

1475
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,720
we were having our cup of tea. We were

1476
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,599
discussing about in some house that I

1477
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,400
spoke about with someone a few days

1478
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,480
back. uh some lady was reading dura

1479
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,599
shaphati during the navatras and she

1480
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,359
died she died of a cardiac arrest

1481
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,400
thereafter in that house during the

1482
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:45,039
navatri they don't touch da shapashati

1483
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,960
now this is something that happens of

1484
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,559
often with many things you know there

1485
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,359
somebody some lady died so they don't

1486
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:54,480
wear bangles in the house and something

1487
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,400
un unto an accident happened and there

1488
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,960
people don't touch black thereafter in

1489
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,920
their family these are misunderstandings

1490
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,680
and and false conditionings. You see

1491
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,000
there is a simple vidantic statement

1492
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,920
that sits that says whatever you

1493
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
consider to be real your whole being

1494
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,119
responds to it.

1495
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,720
Now if you wire this thought into the

1496
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,559
head that something's going to happen to

1497
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,440
me if I wear black something will

1498
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,119
happen.

1499
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,319
So your whole journey of spiritual

1500
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,559
sadena is to uncondition yourself

1501
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:29,880
completely uncondition yourselves and

1502
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:33,039
give yourself into the open ground of

1503
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,200
permatma where there is no conditioning

1504
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,599
and unless you are able to untie

1505
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,440
yourself free yourself of conditioning

1506
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,720
there will be no progress.

1507
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,559
Such an important tiny

1508
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,880
paragraph. I think people randomly

1509
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,760
associate these beliefs with the process

1510
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,039
of being sanatani. One of which is

1511
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,559
wearing black clothes. You're wearing a

1512
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,640
black t-shirt. Yes, I'm wearing a black

1513
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,359
coat. Yes. For me, I feel powerful with

1514
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,760
black. Same. It's my dedication to my

1515
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,920
god. Yeah. Same here. We our Ganesha is

1516
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,160
black in color. Oh, really? The Ganesha

1517
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,799
is black in color. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

1518
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:12,559
Same. My So, it's for my bear of DVA.

1519
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:15,839
Uh, and I feel very comfortable. We are

1520
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,520
all born to darkness. Renir, isn't it an

1521
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,839
important thing to understand? We are

1522
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,400
all born to darkness and born to go

1523
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:25,119
towards the light. Our mother is

1524
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,599
darkness. Our mother is black. We are

1525
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,760
born to the primordial kali. Yeah. We

1526
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,079
are born to the prim primordial procriti

1527
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,680
which is complete darkness. And then we

1528
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,200
are progressing towards the light. So

1529
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,400
all the colors in between are good

1530
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,799
colors. No conditioning. Finish.

1531
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,319
Colors is one aspect of it. Would you

1532
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,960
would you say that vasu shastra is

1533
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:48,400
another? Yes, it's it's a shastra it's

1534
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:51,680
and it's a that means it's a vic subject

1535
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,400
you know but uh overdose of it is is is

1536
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,680
fatal

1537
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,680
I think let's leave this aspect of the

1538
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:03,799
conversation up to the audience let them

1539
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:07,760
digest it in the way they seem

1540
01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:10,079
uh right yes in the way they deem fit I

1541
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,960
just feel like ending this episode now I

1542
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,119
I felt like there was something to do in

1543
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,480
today's episode and I think we've done

1544
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:20,880
the job. Okay. Uh needed to keep

1545
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,559
something Gpati related on the channel

1546
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,160
just as an offering. Yes. Um I'm glad I

1547
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,880
got to do it with you. That's all I'll

1548
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:32,880
say. Yes. Thank you. Thank you ma. Uh as

1549
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,160
usual uh it's genuinely an honor sitting

1550
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,599
in front of you and listening to your

1551
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,680
words. Thank you Ranir and all the best

1552
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,440
to you for your journey ahead and thank

1553
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,200
you to all your audience. You have

1554
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,960
beautiful audience and may they always

1555
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,880
be there with you. Thank you. Thank you

1556
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,559
ma'am. On their behalf as thank you.

1557
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,000
That was the episode for today ladies

1558
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,720
and gentlemen. This is actually our

1559
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,119
third recording with Marian Suvira. Uh

1560
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,920
thought we should record this and

1561
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:58,480
release it before the second one

1562
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:00,799
releases because GPati was honestly a

1563
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,119
very big part of whatever happened in my

1564
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:05,200
life over the last three to four months.

1565
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,960
just trusted my gut with this release

1566
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,960
and I think for those of you who've

1567
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,359
gained from this episode uh we've done

1568
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,280
the right thing as a production house

1569
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:20,440
keep supporting beeps keep listening

1570
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,440
into TRS and keep growing with us

1571
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:39,840
[Music]
