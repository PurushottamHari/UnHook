If someone wants to begin Ganesh sad at home, what is your suggestion? Start from basic mantras. You can make a Ganesha out of out of clay. After some time, there is not even Ganesha. There's not even me. There's only light, which is the actual purpose of any sadena. Wow. When you read the DI scripture, it says that he's the creator. Shiva's scriptures say the same thing. Vishnu, they say the same thing. So, is there a battlefield up there? You have to understand God has won. If you're just asking pundits and people who perform pujas, they'll misguide you. They are not teachers. Approach people who don't scare because fear is so anti-spirituality. Always remember the deity loves you more than you love the dity. He chooses you because he's already fallen in love with you. I would like to believe that the deity is speaking to you. Yes, a relationship with the deity is a very beautiful relationship and the deity himself will teach you. There is a guru's voice that starts speaking in your head. Some people call it the voice in your head. There's clear indication of what you should do. A lot of people get very excited because of our tantra based podcast. Yes. And begin to do some very intense sadas at home. Don't go into complex dities. Some house lady was reading durahati during the navatras and she died of a cardiac arrest. There is a point where your body and your head tells you hey stop. You may not want to stop. This is called japa japa. The mind is now saying the mantra in a repeated manner. You just keep going. Why did no one teach us this when we were growing up? Mansira, one of our most loved tantra based guests is back. Today we cover gpati tantra, an aspect of sanatan dhan and tantra in general that's not spoken about on the Indian internet much. We hope to change that. Beginning with this episode, Marian Svira's back with another Tantra [Music] blockbuster. I'm going to start with a tiny mantra. Omg, thank you for being here ma. Thank you. So nice to see you again. Glad to be hosting you in my house. Like that's Yes. It feels so wonderful. The energy is so lovely. Okay. Uh how are you ma'am? I'm doing very nice. Thank you. Okay. Uh I would love to know what you think of Sarna in general. Uh and I would love to ask you from the perspective of the listeners. If someone wants to begin a very basic at-ome uh Ganesh sadha, what is something they can do? Uh I offer dura every morning. Yes, I light a uh I just say and place it with intention and then I do the 18 names and then it goes on. Um firstly, am I publicly allowed to say this? Secondly, uh what is your suggestion from a very practical perspective for the listeners? I know that people have clicked on this are already bs of Ganesh G. And one last thing before we move forward, we had our first podcast with a child yesterday. His name is Pratamesh. One of the most beautiful conversations of my whole podcasting career. And this is a gift from him. So sweet. So it's a Gpati. Yes. And uh I know that today's podcast is dedicated to Gpati. Mhm. So uh you know uh over to you all. Yes. You see our Gurude's teachings say that when you uh consecrate your life to the deity when you give your life to the deity then the deity invocation can happen in any way. He his teachings are very organic. The school that I belong to very organic teachings says that and we see people practicing when there is the Ganesh festival uts happening in you you get so many reels and so many talks on the on the TV that say that you can make a ganesha out of haldi you know out of turmeric or out of clay just by yourself at home or with you know mixing various herbal powders and make a ganesha actually that is the process of invocation. The point here is that when people want to start a Ganesh sadena, first they should decide in their mind that uh what is the purpose of doing any sadena? First of all, let us understand whether it is of this god or that god. The purpose is to dissolve your ego completely into that dity. To dissolve our identity completely into the dity. The dity is an I am not. The dity is an I am not. He he is an I am not. That means the power of him is there. He you know he is functioning through me so to say my ego is not functioning through me the dity is functioning through me that means whatever carry forward of life I have you know from my past lives and uh the ego is shouldering the responsibility in this life and I am the doer you know but when you dedicate your life to any sadena any deity sadena then now you're handing over your life the steering of your life wheel to him so he is and I am not you know and that is the process of starting the sadena. So if one starts sad with a pigeon brain thinking okay let me experiment with Ganesha then I'll see how this is then let me experiment with this one then I'll see how this is who is beating around the bush the ego is beating around the bush and the ego has to ultimately dissolve in peratma then it is better that you get wedded to one dity once for all tie the knot you know understanding knowing the science of it that this dity also dissolves in peratma and I am actually getting wedded to permatma When that is clear then the sadena will reveal itself. The deity himself reveals the sadhena which mantra how many times you know he will mold you. He will mold you to get absorbed. It will reveal itself through the people you meet and through the internet. Yes. Yes. To something that you come across and you really feel I want to do this. I mean I'm asking you this from the perspective of people I've come across in my journey over the last 2 three years. There's a lot of people who get very excited because of our tantra based podcasts. Yes. And begin to do some very intense sadas at home based on mantras they picked up off of the internet. That shouldn't be done. I feel especially if it's got a bakure. Yes. You have to prepare your body. Uh it's like a copper wire has to be strong enough to take a thousand volt current you to prepare your body. Not that anything wrong will happen but it doesn't take you anywhere. You should start from basic small basic mantras of that dity slowly increasing the count um you know of chance that you're doing and then slowly reading the stotras connected to that dity slowly meditating and focusing on how your energy field feels. It's like establishing a relationship with a deity slowly in privacy rather than making it a public affair where you're misguided and you know oh you don't do this this way do it this way you you have a thousand people giving you mundina they say the thousand you know heads and thousand advices. So a relationship with the deity is a very beautiful relationship and the deity himself will teach you in some way or there is inner voice that opens up. We call it sa guru bodh in in our sanskriti we call it sa guru bodh. Swaguru both means there is a guru's voice that starts speaking in your head you know and that inner voice some people say the voice of your heart some people call it the voice in your head but there's clear indication of what you should do and when you begin your journey lovingly with faith trust surrender have a firm conviction that the deity that I'm associating with you know is not a punishable system it's a loving system so there there ought not to be any fear number one Number two, start establishing consciously a loving relationship. you know then the guidance will come the the pace the speed with which you want to progress will come and then there are people like us who are there who can you know uh someone I think everyone should approach people um who don't scare number one because fear is something I think is so anti-spiritual you know spirituality and don't go into complex deities take on simple daties which all the rishies have given for humanity to practice why should one go into go uh sadas tell me a beginner should never go into go sadas they should go into household sadas that are uh advised by our seers simple omna simple gang nama or dvi's mantra or you know and and from there you build up your inner potential build it up you know then get into and then the guru will come a guru will arrive in your life who will take you into gua sadhas okay according to me lighting A diya is a great yes first step. Absolutely. Yes. Right. Are there any rules about ghee or oil? No rules. The basic purpose of the diya is that is the prayer for the dya. We are actually lighting the lamp because we want that flame to burn inside of us. And so it does not matter whether you're having a ghee or there's puja tail available in puja shops which is normally either s mustard oil or there is a sesame oil you know people can use that and if there is a special occasion do agia in north India the ghee you know the ghee gets solidified in winter so we don't use ghee that time we use sesame oil or we use mustard oil so that does not matter god is not looking into the micro things of you know what what we are using you see how poor people um worship you know they use ordinary things and they worship they don't buy extraordinary things when people are economically good then they want to offer dry fruits to god god does not differentiate between sugar granules or little jaggery or dry fruits he doesn't you know so it's like that so the basic purpose of lighting a lamp and it's the most important thing you rightly said that first thing people have to learn to light a lamp because that invokes the it's like lighting a lamp within you inside and there are mantras for lighting a lamp. You have simple mantras are there or you can say in English if your thought language is English light a lamp and say god please invoke this light inside me so that I can see you in brightness you know you can we can do invocations in any language if if someone's mother tongue is tamil maratti gujarati doesn't matter god is beyond language because every deity recognizes the root of your intentions behind the sad. Yes. They can go deep within and understand why you're doing this. Absolutely. Yes. So if you're doing this from a place of material gain or from a place of aggressive spiritual growth, you know, putting that intention of um hustle behind the sadna. I don't even think that's correct. Yes. I think it has to be completely from a place of love and surrender. It has to be from you start there. There are there may be issues in one's life that one would want to deal with with the help of the deity. No doubt about it. But that can be dealt later that can be spoken to the deity later. You have to begin with love and surrender. Absolutely. Perfect. Something that helps me tremendously is uh that I try offering specific things to the deities I worship. But if those things are not available, I visualize that it's coming out of my heart. Yes. And I'm placing it in front of the D. And sometimes as I'm doing that, I tear up. Yes. Cuz I know the place it's coming out of. Yes. And I think the daties recognize that as Oh yes. Yes. There's Shamanas Puja written uh very beautiful um Adiguru Shankrara has written. It says when things are not available even when the vigra is not there suppose you're traveling and even your you know the idol of the the lord is at home and you're traveling you could visualize him and you could do all the decorations that you want mentally and offer all your bhavana you know to the dity and it is accepted it is a complete puja the reason I'm mentioning this is because when you actually have those objects available if you have practiced doing it in your mind and heart for some time then you'll be able to offer those objects with that intention of bacti love do that yes u it it kind of trains your heart into doing sad with the right intention yes another thing that helps me tremendously is I genuinely try burning myself up in my sad like I'm just there is nothing I'm not thinking about how many mantras are left I'm not thinking about how many mantras I've I first and foremost try to enjoy it. And if I'm not enjoying it, I get up and come back to it after some time. Yes. Uh the enjoyment is at the core of what I'm doing, not the numbers. Yes, that's absolutely right. You have to do your sadna with your heart. All your puddra, all your rituals, you have to do it with your heart. If you do it like a formality, it makes no sense. It it's it's okay. But you know, we take a salpa for instance to light a lamp every day and do your everyday mantras or pura. We take a salpa. We take a promise. So people do it sometimes they are in a hurry to go to the office or you know to go to their work then they just do it as a formality that's okay but the actual purpose of doing this is to develop a you know emotional relationship with with the go with the lord uh with gpati because this is a gpati special episode uh offering dura which is like a I don't know how you'd describe dura is that a wise early step that anyone can take Yes, it is. You see the things that are written in the uh purans, the offerings of different gods and goddesses, one can adhere to that, one can stick to that. But at some point in your life, you transcend, you know, all the dos and don'ts with god at some point in your life. And that is true uh progress when you transcend you know and then for instance we have the mahagpati uh pratima with the dvi sitting in our temple and when we did the pranatishta I was uh the pandi was saying he should wear a it's nice if you can have a cloth for him you know the way the south Indians decorate and you know and I want him to just wear the yagy pavit and uh because this is this is the way my shreddha was coming and then with gurude's permission it happened like that. So at some point you will transcend all the formalities and then what you will design will be with lot of love and with lot of all the available things. There are people living in America, there are people living in Europe and many places where lot of things are not available. Many things are not easily available. So if you tie your mental conditioning uh that my puja is not complete until I offer the dura or until I offer a supari or pan or you know then that gives you yes tension discomfort you know so uh all the things that are there you know in my vicinity and in my availability these are things I will offer to my god. Same thing goes with neya. There is a system of offering neya every day. And uh if we program our head or condition our mind that this is one sweet and one vegetable and one dal and this is going to be offered to the god every day and then that is not done sometimes household uh we are making sandwiches sometimes for instance in household uh you know uh I'm not talking about the temples the temples are very strict about it and that's good you know but I'm talking about common people common people sometimes you're making soup or you're making sandwiches or you're making all kinds of food these days. Nvida means that before I partake, my lord should partake. That this is the meaning of offering the neva. Before I consume food, I want to offer this to the Lord. A with gratitude that this is cooked in my house. B that what I am eating also goes to him. What I am eating also goes to him. Braharam brahagnut. Very beautiful shloka in the Gita in all the guruguls the children say this shloka before eating food. So we are putting everything into consciousness. Consciousness is cooking. Consciousness is being cooked and it has been eaten by consciousness. It goes into the fire of consciousness. Wow. Wow. That's the translation. Yeah. Kind of. Wow. Wow. Okay. Um I'm almost at the end of that early step description again storas uh bhajan great place to begin for someone beginning early I think every Ganesh bakan the world knows is that a mantra you can chant at home. Yes, you can. There is a opanishad connected with Ganesha called atarvashisha opanishad which is a part of our sadhana what we give to our students there is a gpati moola mantra given and there is aarosisha given. So the the the path is parallel you know as it goes in asam praa the path is parallel that means we do the moola mantra also and we recite the opanishad also. This way you are taking the help of bacti yoga with the mantra and kana yoga with the help of opanishad. Upanishad every whichever is being composed. We have a cannon of 108ishads which are officially uh scholarly declared to be the group of opanishads that people can study in the vantic tradition. All these opishads give you brahagan. They all give you brahagan. That is the purpose of composing the opanishad. The rishies have composed the oponyishad because brahmagan you will get. Now how does one get the brahagan? Just by reading the opanishad once this once that once that one does not get brahmagan brahagyan you get when you read the upanishad a million times and you atma it that means it goes right into every cell of your body and there is a very beautiful composition of adi guru chakra calledam the first stanza saysamakaram yadrian so he saying in paragraph that there is no such knowledge. There is knowledge is not knowledge if it does not quieten your indrias. He says that means if it is does not purify your senses and quietens down all your system then it's not knowledge and where do you find this knowledge you will find only in the opanishad. So when we doing dati pujas any kind of dati puja they are associated stotras and opanishads for that dity also always all of them most of them have and this oponyishad should be read every day it should be read then you absorb the intelligence which belongs to that deity and that will take you to permatma where can I find the opanisha oh there are there everywhere it's there on the internet so much is there you know so we have the atarvashisha opanishad for instance and every opanish will declare. Every upanishad will declare whether it is a Dvi upanishad or a Ganesha or a Shivaad. It will declare that you are Brahma, you are Vishnu, you are this, you are that, you know. So that means every will declare that you arema. So the intelligent people should understand that every path every deity is taking you into the same playground of permatma. When the when you read the Dvi scripture, it says that Dvi is everything. She has she's the creator. She is the sustainer and the anal. You read Shiva's scriptures, they say the same thing. Vishnu, they say the same thing, you know. So is there a battlefield somewhere up there where the deities are fighting? No. They are saying that whichever dity you have fallen in love with it will take you there. It will take you across the ocean. M you see so in the system of worship as you started this topic that lighting a lamp reading one mantra or doing one mantra mala and reading that particular one that particular associated stotra or upanishad upanishad is far more superior because upanishad gives you brahagyan and these sectarian differences that are there in our head about this god is mine this god is not mine that will fall apart all the walls break And you come in the field of oneness which is the actual purpose of any sadena. You have to understand God as one. As long as there are fragments in their head then that worship is not complete yet. Now I'll bring you back to that second pathway because I think this has concluded the basics of Ganesh sadha uh section. I also feel that if one does this for 3 to 6 months at least and then becomes extremely hungry for a higher form of sad they need to seek out people like yourself. Yes. Actually go to Rishies, go to Banaras, go to these places. Yeah. Contemplate, contemplate, ask, talk you know talk to different people to scholars and you know when when one wants to seek advice about what mantra to do what sadena to do you need to approach a mature mind and if if you're just asking you know pundits and people who perform pujas they are not teachers they are not teachers they may advise with their all good intention I'm not saying they'll misguide you but all good intention but that advice is not something that would be uh you know you must approach people with experience and who are sadhuks themselves and uh then go ahead then go ahead to begin with if you if you spend that 1 six months for instance in our school uh you know we offer them the mantra we offer them the upanishad after 2 three months I often ask them what appeals to you more does this feel good you feel happy doing the opanishad or do you feel happy doing the mantra as some people say the Upanishad really really feels nice. Then we give them um aishad. Say that okay now you know do par ends of the opanishad. Do do more counts of the opisha and one mala of the gpati mantra. If someone says the mantra feels lovely then we say okay read uponishad once and do uh multiple counts of the mantra. So each one's wisdom opens up from inside you know and therefore it's important to have a teacher at least a guide if not a teacher mentor guru at least a guide someone you can talk to and can guide you on the on the path and swag guru both should be trusted you should trust what feelings you get inside you know when you're chanting the mantra or doing the opishad how do you feel inside and and let go of the confusion the confusion about you know the crowd of information that is there of different deities and different padi is that crowd should be just offered at the feet of the lord that I don't want to confuse myself. It's like you can't make a good dish out of a 100 vegetables, you know. It's like that. You want to you want to make a bangan kverta, make a bangan kaba. Don't put too many vegetables in it. It's like that. So you one needs to a listen to the inner voice, inner calling. And there therefore silence is very important. One needs to sit down in silence to listen to the heart and listen to the head, you know, and and ask what what do I want? Even if you're a te theory, many people get tearary when they, you know, they they break down when they're in silent. It's okay. You know that it's always nice. It's always nice because it'll open you up to listening to what's coming from inside. Your soul is talking to you actually all the time. Your soul is on this journey in a slumber for so many uh lifetimes and now finally it's it's knocking you know knocking the door to your prriti inside that please do something and find out who I am where am I you know on the on the long journey of being in slumber it has lost its way home and it wants to go home you know so it'll tell you talk to you it'll speak out and it'll definitely convey something and the the magnetism of the soul is such that if you are not able to hear him, you will find someone coming and talking exactly what he wants to tell you. You know, consciousness speaks to consciousness. We spoke in the last episode, consciousness speaks to consciousness. Actually, here in this world, it's only uh there's only there's only God and nothing else. They say, so there's nothing else in this world other than me and I'm only interacting, you know. I'm only interacting. Yes. There there's nothing else in this world. So what what you want to hear what he wants you to hear if you're not able to hear it in silence then he will make someone say that to you and you will know that this is for me. You will know this is for me because now you recognize that this is coming from my inside. Yeah. M one of the greatest soldiers of the Indian military was on the show some years ago. Major Vive Jacob. Uhhuh. Said the exact same thing. He said the same thing. He said that all your life's experiences are first and foremost happening inside you. Yes. Then it just gets reflected on the outside. Yes. It is projected outside. And he was probably one of the most evolved beings I've ever come across. Yes. Yes. Um anyway coming back to what we were talking about um a practice that's helped me a lot is that say if I'm doing five malas of a particular mantra or if I've really deep dived into a particular stotra uh where I've been reciting it in my own mind while you recite it and while you burn yourself in that yes blaze of the mantra Um there is a point where you're done with the count required. Yes. Or where your body and your head tells you, hey, stop now. Yes. Uh I think it's very important to pause at that moment and reflect. Yes. I would like to believe that the dat speaking to you in that window. Yes. Could we speak about this window a little bit? It's it's basically what you said about reflection. Yes. It's transcending. When you when you say you are you are burnt in the mantra, who is burnt in the mantra? When you say you are burnt, who is burnt? Your ego. The identity. The identity that is renir inside that gets in it's like in the oven of the mantra and it is in in a in a you know non-existing form at this moment and that is when you should keep quiet because now the ego is not there. Now it's only the dity you know and that communication is very important. You may call it communication, you may call it transference of energy, you may call it transmutation, you may call it uh transformation, anything there is something that happens subtly and one should give a pause to that. So ideally the counts are given where you give mantra chants they do two malas, five malas, 11 malas. It's basically a training to the ego. It's basically the training to the ego and the mind. The mind gets tired, the ego gets tired. And when these two are tired, then your system is open and receptive to receiving what the dity wants to give you. It's basically that exercise. So if you're not fulfilling that count and you are tired for instance and you want to stop, you stop. Give it a pause. Let that transference happen and then can continue. If you're truly immersed in that burning blaze, yes. Uh you may not want to stop also. You may not not want to stop also. Yes. And then you just keep going. You just keep going without a count. Yes. Yes. That's how the urapa japa happens. There is a japa japa. There is one that we count and then you just keep the mala down and the mind is now saying saying saying saying saying saying saying the mantra you know. So there's no vocal voice. There's no voice coming but the mind is now saying the mantra in a you know repeated manner. This is called japa japa. Wow. Yeah, it's very beautiful and that's actually the yogic way of doing the mantra. The yogis sit for hours together with ajapa. They don't count, you know. So, it's the two hours, 3 hours of just doing the mantra. Let them, like you said, let the fire burn. Uh, I have to kind of pull it out to a hyper practical almost materialistic perspective on everything we've spoken about. Um, I'll just give the audience a bottom line if they're not with us up till this point and they're questioning starting sadha. Um, on every single day that I do my sadha, I'm a different person right after it. Right after it, I'm elevated. It's almost like every cell in your body has had a micro caffeine shot. Then I begin my day. Feels great. Yes. And I cannot operate unless I do at least a proportion of my ideally whatever I have planned for every morning I need to get that done at least. Uh but I need to at least touch it to begin my day. Uh and it's a great place to be. Yes. For multiple material world reasons as well. Yes. Uh would you like to just shed some light on this? I I I think it's an important conversation to be had for young people who are listening in. So there are these three stages uh taking reference to exactly what you said there are these three stages when uh in your marker on your path of doing bacti the first stage you are imposing a system that someone advised you you know it's like you're you're you're in a school and you are practicing it without knowing what's going to happen and at the second stage you have anchored into the dity and it is the stage that you are talking about when you're anchored into the dity and without holding that anchor you don't feel complete you don't feel confident you don't feel ready to go for the work or for your for your day that's the second uh stage and at the third stage this physical anchor melts into a subtle beautiful faith you know a subtle beautiful faith that your sadena goes with you wherever you're going through the day and uh it's like the anchor is not just there in the morning the anchor is there with me through the day. The anchor is pulling me and taking me everywhere you know and therefore that connection never breaks. I think the obvious question is when does the third stage arrive? But third stage happens and it's a a matter of ka it's ka sadhya it's a matter of ka the more you are in love with the dity and the more the dity falls in love with you always remember the dity loves you more than you love the dity always that's why you you're practicing you know he picks up the the sadhak and the sadhak does not have the capability to even fathom that power he picks you up yes he chooses you because he's already fallen in love with you. Oshi. Oshi. Yes. Um there there is a connection of deities with their own vahans for sure. Their vahans and their you know respective herbs and essences and herbs and things smells that they like flowers that they like association. Puja Puja Puja like their preferences. Yes. Frequential you know. For example, we have the seven chakras, seven corresponding colors, flowers, aromomas, vegetables, herbs, everything. Similarly, planets are their corresponding herbs, corresponding aromomas. Similarly, deities have. So they are basically vibrational frequencies that they correlate and that's how you know correspondence. What about the animals? Animals connected. The lion is connected. They're symbolic. Animals are more symbolic. Like the black dog with the beer is very symbolic of his power. You know, and appearance. Our mind you know is a fantastic machine. When we understand these correlations, correlation when we understand then it becomes a reality. If someone doesn't understand it, he won't even notice it. Someone doesn't know it. So whatever we believe to be real, our whole being reacts to it. Magic reveals itself to those who believe in it. The the synchronosity and there is a law of synchronization, you know. Then that black dog that you have in your head and that black dog will actually develop the qualities, you know, that uh gives you the sense of beer. You know similarly a cat you know there are people that we it's all the conditioning of the mind basically because the whole nature the whole proriti is inside of you and outside of you consequently. So when we start relating with uh correspondence crystal correspondence flower correspondence aroma correspondence then you put that essence and you get that vibe. Your mind connects now to that frequency instantly. Therefore we have all the corresponding flowers liked by the deities and you know like you have bailputra liked by Shiva and lotus liked by Lakshmi etc. Pan and supari offered to Ganesha or Dwva offered to Ganesha. All these correspondence is there based on their frequencies and the human mind programming and also the books written thereafter. You know in the piranhas they have written so many stories about what the vahans are, what the offerings are, what bananas to be offered, what fruits to be offered. So now this becomes a big collective programming and it works like that because it falls under the law of synchronosity. Um you know you spoke about beer and dogs and effectively a dog represents the quality of the blessings that beav can bring in terms of protection, strength, yes, bravery. Yes. I have to twist it and ask you about Gandatino. Yes. Could you explain the mouse a little more? Symbolically speaking, it represents the ego and Ganesha rides over it. The mouse is a very destructive creature. It's a very destructive creature. You leave a mouse in the house and it's going to break things and you know nibble into something and eat eat spoil things and eat food grains etc. And it represents the ego. Symbolism is that Ganesha rides that mouse because the intellect rides the ego then it is a fantastic combination. If the intellect rides the ego, yeah, that means the your decisions are not based on the ego. You know, your decisions are not based on the ego, but the decisions are taken by the power of the intellect. Ganesha is a power. When he sits on the mouse, then that means the broadened widened enlightened intellect is now sitting on the ego and that ego is in in control of that intellect. What is intellect? What what intellect is a discriminating power. See in the western world there's only mind you know in but but our vidantic scripture has gone deeper to understand different facets of the mind and we have classified in you know into the four distribution of uh antakarna. So that means man buddhi chitta and ahankar these are the four aspects they are aspects of the mind only but there are four departments sub departments. So buddhi which is intellect is the discriminating factor that means if I see something there's a thought in my mind suppose I see a bearded man in front of me my mind says who is this the thought that comes when there is a sensual input the mind will immediately put a question or a thought who is this now who is going to give me this answer of who is this inside this thought it put is put into the intellect the intellect is discriminating and going to give me an answer looks like a thief or looks like a sadhu. How does it take that decision? How does the intellect take this decision? It takes decision tapping into the memory and the ego. It taps into the memory and ego. If I have had good experiences with a bearded person in the past, not past life, can be past life also. Even in this life there is a conditioning in my head that such kind of people are not good you know which is not an absolute truth yeah but that conditioning is there in my head now that such kind of people are based on the memory and the ego if I'm if my ego feels threatened if I feel threatened with that man immediately the intellect puts it in the mind is not a good person let him sit out you know so the mind is where thoughts are produced intellect is where these thoughts are discriminated based on ego and the memory right and you know the I identity which is all the time doing things what have I to do how do I progress the I is a doer all the time uselessly actually under the folds of doing the happening process is there you know but the eye feels that I am doing everything including I I've eaten my food and I'm you know you eat your food none of that after that is done by the ego everything is automated machine. The digestion is happening. Everything is happening. But the ego has this habit of doing everything and so it worries about the past. It worries about the future and it takes everything into its credit. Ego is the root of anxiety. Ego is the absolute root of ignorance and anxiety both when and that's the purpose of the sadena. The purpose of the sadena is to make this mouse even smaller as small as it can and let your buddhi ride over it. That is Ganesha. So with Ganesh sadena basically the ego is minimized which happens with all the sadas. I'm not biased with you know I'm someone who loves all the deities and I love all the paths and I know all the paths take you to peratma. So all the sadas will minimize the ego and eventually dissolve this ego into the real eye which is Brahman which is which is the lord sitting inside you and when you take up the sadena for instance we take ganeshas you know the ganesha in the beginning of the sadena the ganesha is there and I am here I'm woriing I'm doing the sadena over a period of time I can only see ganesha I don't feel me that's when my my ego has started dissolving into the deity. Wow. And after another sometime which which could be months or years there is not even Ganesha, there's not even me, there's only light. This is what we say that the triad in in Triputi we call it in vidanta that the the the seer and the scene have merged into knowledge and that is the purpose of any sadena be it sadena sadena any sadena to merge into the deity the deity is only there you are not there and that the dity dissolves into the light that fire that you burn in during your bacti yes that takes over the whole universe Yes, absolutely. Wow. Buddhi anar chitta. Chitta is your unconscious mind. The dark mind where there are all you know um unseen things hiding especially traumas and old conditioning. It's heavy. It's like tar chitta is almost like um like it takes you to gravity shackles. Yeah. Your mind is uh we we categorize mind into three levels. Your conscious mind you and me are talking right now. This is conscious mind. It always gets connected to the unconscious to the you know. So this two two together we call chitta. Your conscious mind which is working hand in hand with the unconscious mind we call it chitta. And in bi in any sadena and bacti the aim first aim is to make your chitta shant. That means to bring peace in your chitta because the unconscious is all the time hitting the conscious. You know there's fear all the time. There is worry all the time. There is all the time because your past experiences are kind of you know pushing the conscious mind. And the secret of bacti is that the secret of spiritual growth is that that if you are able to liberate your conscious mind from the unconscious mind and connect it with the higher mind which is always connected to the deities then your journey becomes very flawless and smooth. That's probably the process of sadena right that's the process of the sadhana that when your chitta become shant first stage then unconscious you get disconnected and you get connected to the higher conscious to the higher mind you know and higher mind is handinhand with your dity in fact your higher mind becomes adin of the dity that's how your dity will start speaking to you in your head I want to dive deeper into exactly what you said Yes. Uh what what do you mean by adin? Adin means submitted. Okay. Under. Okay. So effectively to summarize, you're saying that the sadha allows you to shed off what is holding your mind back. Yes. And that is always the past. Okay. That creates space. Yes. And that space is where the dity can come and pick you up. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. I have a cricketer friend of mine. His name is KL Rahul. Yes. And we discuss Sadna a lot. Uh and he's also got a very intense amount of bacti towards Hanuman Gi like Oh, how beautiful. And he's got this one beautiful tattoo where uh it showcases a human being lifted by this really muscular arm. It's clearly that of Hanumah. Wow. Is it similar to what you're saying? Yes, it's similar. The maruds you know we I remember in the la in the episode that we did in the first episode we spoke little about maruts you know so maruds are a very very peculiar and intrinsic part of your panic system they are very very and very few people know about know and talk about this the word marauti in hanuman has come out of the word marut you know maruts are born to the vayu's movement in the sun when the process of creation happened you know The movement of bayou in the sun created maruts. These are particles that high high velocity particles that come from other galaxies. All right. The word marauti comes from marut. The word hanuman also comes from marut. Han is a is a has a is a is like a bjakar that has the meaning that something that strikes with great velocity and man is huge and heavy and stable. So hanuman word combination means something that moves with great velocity and can destroy anything which is huge and stable. All right. He was born to queseri queserand he was born to queseri and anjana dvi. Queseri means son and Anjana Dvi means the dark primordial proriti when the thing was born goosebumps all over right go on you know Hanuman is that force and this quality actually of the maruts is present in all the deities is present in all the deities especially a portal of Hanuman has happened because of the bi that people have immense bi that people have done of hanuman hanuman portal is there he is a living deity and people have seen in him. You know, I met a girl very recently who had a lot of skin issues all over her body and she was a 30-some not married and gone into a lot of you know uh uh sadness in the body and uh she went out for a corporate uh uh you know meet up somewhere and she was in that duka and probably she had something with with everyone and she had a saksha dan of hanuman she saw Hanumani in front of her and that episode could have been a hallucination. I mean anybody could have just taken it to be a hallucination but that event changed her life completely. Number one her entire body was changed. That whole skin issue that she had disappeared within a matter of one month her whole kayakalpul everything changed and she has become a devout ba of hanuman. devout bakta who never ever went into any temple or believed in any gods and goddesses because of her own tormenting life. She has become a devout bakta of Hanuman. So Hanuman dashan people have had all the deities give dashan. How does the dashion happen? You know I mean this is what my guruv taught me. I many people may not uh be in line with this thought but he says that when a bhakta has become completely surrendered and dissolved in the dity the deity is so happy and when I say deity ultimately it is consciousness and permatma permatma is so happy that to please his eyes a dashion is created and who creates this dashion the maruts in his body the panic particles in our body have we have marut paws every act of destruction in your body destruction means I'm not talking negatively the food is broken into food is broken into smaller particles absorption is happening so it's an act of destruction every act of destruction in our body which is required is done by the maruts the prana does not have its own power other than the maruts and when a person comes into bacti the maruts are maximized and when the maruts are maximized the soul itself self has ka over the bhta and shows him gives him the dashan of the deity he believes in. So people have seen life krishna shiva those who are in baki have seen their their deities in front of them and this is the miracle of pmatma showering grace and the maruts do it. So Marauti Bhagwan talking about him he's an immense portal of power perhaps this is why Hanumanji is linked to physical powers. Yes also all the siddhis are associated with him and uh you know the physical powers in the sense he can become small like this much. He can become big like this much. He can become heavy like a mountain. He can be light as air as a feather. All these siddhis come from they they come from the maruts. This is what needs to be understood. They come from the maruts and hanuman being the deity for the marut paws. They called marut paws. He's vayup putra. Vayup putra means he's born to the vayu. The moment of the vayu in the sun. Okay. To kind of summarize what you said, I think you've given us the sanatani version of what are we but stardust. Yes. So you're saying that according to Sanatan Dharm um there were high velocity particles that found their way near the atmosphere of the sun. Uh these particles of light or energy particles are referred to as maroots. Yeah. They're born to the spand of Shivashaki. You know the S that you see in a ying and single symbol the white and black is divided by a s line bright line this bright line is where maruts are born rdra is also a synonym to this marut only you know when we say the power of rdra you see it's also a product uh which is born to this spand of shivan shaki from a very human perspective uh everyone has heard the word pranayam or increase the pran flowing through your Yes. Uh so pran could be loosely understood to be external energy or energy that's present all around us. Energy every kind of energy is prana number one. When we do pranayyam it's basically the life force energy inside us. We are bringing that into control. Yama means to bring it in control. So say you're doing the pranayam and the life force in you is increasing. Yes. Physical manifestation of that would be good skin, good hair, good health. Yeah. Yeah. But you said something interesting. You said that it's the maruts that actually cause changes inside your body and not the prana. Yes. They are the soldiers in your prana. So what is the linkage between the prana and the maruts? The maruts are like you could say like floating particles on prana. They are the soldiers of the prana. And let's say as you say you know in your blood there is hemoglobin. When when when your hemoglobin count is good then you say your blood is good. M in the same way when the count of maruds and which automatically goes the moment you start sadha that is how people are able to manifest anything out of the thin air the yogis you know they manifest anything out of the thin air all these siddhis even vaka siddhi you know all these siddhis come because of the maruts you're increasing the number of maruts in your body in the body with the sadena automatically automatically just when I think that I've learned a lot about Sada. There's suddenly a new concept through I've never heard of this in my life. Yeah. It's the joy of podcasting as well. Yes. Yes. You know, so many human beings don't even click on these episodes because just notions about what uh would be contained in the episode. Oh, this is the kind of my parents watch. I want to watch this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because their time is not yet right for them. Time comes. Then in the timeline, God lets you play in the nursery school as long as you want. Then he takes you up to graduation. He is the doer and he takes us. That's why when you come into bi you understand that um and uh with your dire compassion, dear compassion, uplift me and take me higher. So when when we don't know this, then we are ignorant. Then the doer is the ego and the ego goes battling everywhere on the account of Maya. You're just going round and round like merry goround and you you fall you get up you fall you get up you fall you get up and then you question why am I falling you know it's so that time comes for everyone not to judge anyone even those who are ignorant are on their journey even those who are ignorant are on their journey everyone even a the worst of the person in the world is on a journey and this journey is is ruled by a higher power not by us. So to judge is to is to fall down in your bi. I I always believe that that it's God's world. It's his sata, his governance and he knows what to do with all the men folk and the you know human folk and uh we should quietly watch everything that is happening in the world and the if there is any analysis that one should do is only of oneself. That's it. M okay. Um because this whole episode has been about Gpati. Yes. Another associated question. You know how one categorizes themselves as being a shite or shak. Yes. Or vishnavite. Where do you place gpati in this gapata? That's a fourth. It's a sraa. Yes. Like you have shyites, vashnovites, shaktas. Disa are called shakta. upas are called ghapatya. It's a sra. Okay. Yeah. And would you say that every sra has their own rules? Yeah. Rules are made like schools have rules and colleges have rules. But they're always these scientist and these creative uh lads, you know, students who surpass all the rules. I'm one of them. Gosh. So I I honor the rules and uh but but my love equation with God is like I feel that uh above these rules are love is love and that is uh paramount and he teaches me rules. He teaches me rules. It's not that I am uh unruly. No, he teaches me rules and I make my own rules. Yes. just asking you a question that's kind of been popping on the internet lately. Okay. So, I'm not trying to cause chaos or anything. Yes. Uh in Ghana year, yeah, Gapata, how is like non-veg versus veg looked at? Is it a health related thing? Are there strict rules with food? Um and generally speaking from a larger lens what is your opinion on the rules of diet with respect to sanatan dharm in general because I get very varied answers whenever I ask this question. In all the sraayas you would always have three categories of followers. One very satic which go with by the law by the rule and they are very strict about food habits and about sensory inputs and about celibacy and about spending the energy in a particular way and not in a particular way about the sut and uh susati and not never kangati. They're very strict. There are rajasik people who are more celebrating you know they like colorful gate you know very beautiful uh celebrations with their bi they're rajasik people and often they are businessoriented and people who are you know having material pursuits in this world and can afford elaborate celebrations etc. And then you have tamasi followers who are exploratory and they often get uh attracted to tantric practices and uh uh they have uh backgrounds that do not uh suddenly want to jump into a satic way of life. For instance, if somebody is born in a non-vegetarian family and uh has been eating non-vegetarian food like food, you know, it's food for them like you have fish for for someone born in Bengal or like uh in Kerala you have seafood as is there. It's like staple food for them. Um so the non-vegetarian food I don't critically look at the food per se. It's after a certain stage of development of a saddak that he needs to be very watchful about how the energy is moving in me. So the beginning stages whatever family background you belong to culture you belong to you can you need not rebel against it one need not rebel against it the food is not bad but what it does to you is bad after a point. So when you reach a certain level of um sadena where your meditation is getting intense and your then you know yourself for instance I if I eat urat kidal two or three days at stretch my body can feel the heaviness and I can't meditate similarly with onions or garlic or you know anything that is so you know your energy system then after some time so not to critically speak about non-vegetarian food. I say that any kind of food which is there in your refrigerator and in your kitchen can be good or bad for you. You have to identify your energy this thing. So because non-vegetarian food is difficult to digest and uh creates a lot of tamasic heaviness. When you say tamasi does not mean you become a bad person. It means it creates heaviness in the body. energy that you have to fight with then to become light in your you know in your being. It it gives you more um tamas means more heaviness when you're meditating you feel sleepy when you want to exercise you can't you know when you want to uh do long couplets long chance then you can't and the mind will then say it's enough I've done this much so that procrastination and that heaviness in the mind and body comes with anything that does not digest easily and could be even a black lentil could be even a black lentil. That's why when you reach a yogic level of sadena then people take only little kiti or they take very little they don't even eat all the elaborate food which is there because everything leaves an impact on the panic system you know so I don't view at that uh thing critically it's not that oh he's a non-vegetarian person should should not be brought here or that's that's that's a wrong way to talk about it it's a staple food for many of the states that we know about many of the countries that we know about right so we we don't view at it negatively it's every individual on his mara of sadena and bi for him to decide what is not doing good to my body I stop it similarly it goes with pancha macara we talk about the tantric um sraayas most of the tantric sraayas especially the wamachara sects they puncha makaras are allowed pancha macakaras means um uh mamsa uh madiraa that is alcohol or then um maiduna which is sex and mudra you know so these these pancha macakaras are actually banned things in spiritual practices in in sanatan dharma or in any you know um but these are used by a lot of the sradas they're allowed not used they're allowed by a lot of the sraas the compassionate approach being that if these are there in your life then you need to watch observe and grow over them. Say for instance, celibacy is an important aspect in many yogic streams because it saves energy. But if someone is in householder, then you cannot ask the person to become a celibate when he has his dharmic duties towards his spouse, you know. So watchful all the five things one needs to be watchful about and taken in moderation to begin with and eventually transcend as you progress on the path then you are asked to transcend. So satwic, rajasic and tamasic approach to sadhana is there in all the sraas be it dvi sadena be it shy you know you have in in shiva's sraaya also you have the you know the deities are there where there is alcohol uh offered to the dvita there is uh plant medicines that people consume but it's not because the the dva wants you to get addicted to these things it's because the dva wants you to transcend and eventually go over it so The beauty of sanatan dharma is that our tradition Indian vic tradition is that for every level of person there is a path. M the crudest of the person who does not know any language or refinement in their in their you know being for him also there is sadena there is a dity you see people in tribals and villages and all there are kula devatas guladvis their very crude practices are there but they do it with faith and they transcend and it's not the journey of one life right it is the journey of many lifetimes so over the lifetimes they refine And they come on better cleaner ways of worship. These are all stages of evolution. Our bacti also evolves sometime and you see that in one lifetime also as you were 10 years back as you are now and as you would be 10 years later you would be able to trace that journey. Similarly it is with many lifetimes. Yeah. Okay. We almost reached the end of this episode. There was something in your heart that you wanted to speak about on this platform. Uh something about common mistakes in the bi notions. Yes. False notions and uh um you know misunderstandings like events we were speaking about when we were having our cup of tea. We were discussing about in some house that I spoke about with someone a few days back. uh some lady was reading dura shaphati during the navatras and she died she died of a cardiac arrest thereafter in that house during the navatri they don't touch da shapashati now this is something that happens of often with many things you know there somebody some lady died so they don't wear bangles in the house and something un unto an accident happened and there people don't touch black thereafter in their family these are misunderstandings and and false conditionings. You see there is a simple vidantic statement that sits that says whatever you consider to be real your whole being responds to it. Now if you wire this thought into the head that something's going to happen to me if I wear black something will happen. So your whole journey of spiritual sadena is to uncondition yourself completely uncondition yourselves and give yourself into the open ground of permatma where there is no conditioning and unless you are able to untie yourself free yourself of conditioning there will be no progress. Such an important tiny paragraph. I think people randomly associate these beliefs with the process of being sanatani. One of which is wearing black clothes. You're wearing a black t-shirt. Yes, I'm wearing a black coat. Yes. For me, I feel powerful with black. Same. It's my dedication to my god. Yeah. Same here. We our Ganesha is black in color. Oh, really? The Ganesha is black in color. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Same. My So, it's for my bear of DVA. Uh, and I feel very comfortable. We are all born to darkness. Renir, isn't it an important thing to understand? We are all born to darkness and born to go towards the light. Our mother is darkness. Our mother is black. We are born to the primordial kali. Yeah. We are born to the prim primordial procriti which is complete darkness. And then we are progressing towards the light. So all the colors in between are good colors. No conditioning. Finish. Colors is one aspect of it. Would you would you say that vasu shastra is another? Yes, it's it's a shastra it's and it's a that means it's a vic subject you know but uh overdose of it is is is fatal I think let's leave this aspect of the conversation up to the audience let them digest it in the way they seem uh right yes in the way they deem fit I just feel like ending this episode now I I felt like there was something to do in today's episode and I think we've done the job. Okay. Uh needed to keep something Gpati related on the channel just as an offering. Yes. Um I'm glad I got to do it with you. That's all I'll say. Yes. Thank you. Thank you ma. Uh as usual uh it's genuinely an honor sitting in front of you and listening to your words. Thank you Ranir and all the best to you for your journey ahead and thank you to all your audience. You have beautiful audience and may they always be there with you. Thank you. Thank you ma'am. On their behalf as thank you. That was the episode for today ladies and gentlemen. This is actually our third recording with Marian Suvira. Uh thought we should record this and release it before the second one releases because GPati was honestly a very big part of whatever happened in my life over the last three to four months. just trusted my gut with this release and I think for those of you who've gained from this episode uh we've done the right thing as a production house keep supporting beeps keep listening into TRS and keep growing with us [Music]
