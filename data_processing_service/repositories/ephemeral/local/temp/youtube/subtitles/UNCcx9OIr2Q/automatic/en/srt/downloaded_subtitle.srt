1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,600
Friends, the Supreme Leader of Iran has said that do as

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,960
you wish.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,759
If you want to fire a missile there, do it

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,240
over the USA.  If you want to attack Israel, do it.

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,720

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,080
You can even do whatever you wish.  Who has said this

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,400
?  Khomanai has told all his military

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
personnel and officers that

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,400
you are free to do whatever you

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,439
wish to do.  Because I'm going

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,600
inside the bunker myself.  He himself is inside the bunker

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,160
and is saying do whatever you want to do.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,719
But is Benjamin Eniya Ho himself

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,960
inside Israel?  He has also

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,320
left Israel.  Recently, what they did was that

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,360

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,200
Benjamin Tanyahu of Israel, who had an F35 fighter jet, escorted him and left the country.  Ok?  At least

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Khamanai is within our country.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,480
But the thing is, friend, look, the simple thing is that

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,280
the way Israel has

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,719
attacked Iran, Israel itself has become a pawn of the

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,760
USA.  Because that treaty was

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,000
between USA and Iran.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,520
But Israel is pressurizing him.   To

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,439
bring him to the table, to bring him to the table,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,640
forcing him to sit at the table and

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,280
talk.  So the USA

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,000
wants to talk to Iran but

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,880
who will bring it to the table?  Israel will do it.  So

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
inside Tehran right now everybody is leaving the country.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,080
Especially, they are going towards

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
where their supporting countries are.  So

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,360
they have said that they have transferred the

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,520
power to the Iranian military.  That do whatever you want to do.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,280
Now

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
do as you wish.  Now look, Iran has

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,680
some missiles which

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,200
even Israel cannot destroy.  The thing is that

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,840
if you look at where Khomanai is right now,

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
he is inside a bunker right now.   Is it

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,000
okay?  Actually, look at the threats that were

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,159

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
coming from the White House.  So the Supreme Leader

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
said that where will he transfer his power now

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
?

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,760
This power will be handed over to the Iranian military and especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, IRGC.

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,840
See, two

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,319
types of armies operate inside Iran.  One is their

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
general army and within that, the one that

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
directly reports

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
to the supreme leader is the IRGC.

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,160
We will talk a little more about this later.  Now

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,480
where is Khomanai himself?  Where are they

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
hiding?  Inside the underground bunker.

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,560
Because the whole of Iran runs on bunkers.

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,440

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,519
Their weapons are hidden inside these bunkers that have been built.  Like the

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,319
nuclear weapons that Iran has made right now are

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,000
also inside bunkers.  Their bunkers

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,239
start from approximately 200 metres.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,480
Now I will show you the photographs.  Now the

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,200
biggest problem for Israel is that

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,599
it cannot attack these bunkers

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,160
because it does not have such missiles.

67
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,800
He will have to take help from USA.

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,879
If USA sends those missiles near Israel

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
then those

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,120
missiles can destroy even the bunkers.

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,519
Otherwise USA has this power.

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Now what he has done is that he has taken his close

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,599
family members and relatives

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,319
also to the bunker.  Along with that, he has

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,000
also taken his son Mustaba

76
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,640
along with him.  So this is also

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
inside the bunker right now and inside the bunker,

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,200
their entire military group and all

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
their weapons etc., all of them remain underground.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,599

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,519
Look, now there are these hills inside Iran.   There are

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,360
these mountains in Iran,

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,159
inside these mountains it is not known

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
where they have built their underground bases.

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,480
They have all their fighter jets there.

86
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,760
Like if we talk about Fateh missile, it is

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,280
tremendous.  Even Israel's Iron Dome

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,000
could not intercept it and

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
it collided inside Taladi.  So, there are

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
bunkers built deep inside these hills.

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,159
Look like this is the entrance to the tunnel.  It is not

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
known which way you will go from the entrance of this tunnel

93
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,640
because there is a bunker below and it is

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,120
completely underground.  So this

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,000
is an entrance to the tunnel.  After that the check points are

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,400
here.  That means let us assume that

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
they have laid it out in a systematic manner.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
Along with this,

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,079
they have made good arrangements for the military personnel who guard the place

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,519
and

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,919
as you can see,

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,320
some people are sitting inside the bunker.

103
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,080

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
See all the facilities etc. here, as you can see, it is

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,680
for exhaust etc.  Everything is

106
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,680
completely proper there, lighting, whitening,

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
everything is already there, this is not something new today.  It has been there for

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
a long time already.

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
All this has been going on since 1979, when the revolution took place there.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,600
So let's go inside the bunker now.

111
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Now look at what Donald Trump has said,

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Donald Trump said that we know

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,199
where the supreme leader of Iran is hiding.  Ok?  So

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,840
exactly where the Iranian supreme leader

116
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,800
is hiding.  We know where it is.

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,280
Adding that there was no intention.  It means that

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
we have no intention to kill him.

119
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
 

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
But what is this matter?  This is a threat.  Brother,

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,240
we know that we will kill when the need arises, we will

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
not kill now.  So who is making this threat

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
?  USA.  And USA is giving this threat on the basis that

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
it has the missile

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,199
which can destroy even the bunker by going so deep.

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,600
So do they know where it

127
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,479
is?  And what has America done till date

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
?  I have just done surveillance.  Who has done the

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
work of surveillance on all the countries of the world

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,440
?  America has done it.  Today he has

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,600
become the watchman of the entire world.  That's why

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
he has kept the GPS system so active.

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
Global Positioning System which has a

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,360
total of 25 satellites.

135
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,160
He keeps watching the entire world.  This is what America has

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,440
done today.  When America, that is Israel, carried out

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,440
air strike on Iran, what happened to the

138
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
supreme leader of Iran, after the supreme leader, that is

139
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,720
his right

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,479
hand, we can say Ali Shadmani

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,400
?  A murder was committed inside it.

142
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,759
He had died inside it.  So

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,720
Iran suffered a big blow due to this.  Now we

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,800
talk about

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,639
how much damage the army and defence there

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,199
can cause if they are given free rein.  So

147
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,440
we will have to do a comparative study between Israel and Iran.

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,720
So if we talk about Israel, there

149
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,240
are 170000 active personals.  Whereas there

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
are 60000 active personals here.  Who has it with

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
?  Near Iran.  First of all, there

152
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,919
can be loss from here.  The second reserve

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,479
they have is 465000 and

154
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
how much is there here?  365000 so they have

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
more reserve and the reserve is there because they

156
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,039

157
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,600
keep it involved in their educational system.  They keep their

158
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,440
reserve army within their educational system

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
because there they teach how to

160
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
use weapons etc.  Then if we

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
talk about paramilitaries, this number that you are

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,440
seeing, 2200,

163
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
can cause the most damage to Israel.

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,160
This is the biggest number they have.  If

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,960
we talk about air power, the total

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,199
aircraft that Iran has is 551 and these

167
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,280
611 aircraft that Israel has are

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,080
all from the USA.  He does

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,560
n't have these.  So whatever money USA has made,

170
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,319
it has made it by selling these aircrafts.

171
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Talking about fighter aircraft,

172
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,319
Israel has 240 of these fighter aircraft.

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
Who has 188?  It

174
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
is near Iran.  So Israel is balancing this a bit here.

175
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
After this, there are

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
19 special mission aircraft and there are

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
10 here.  So, this whole

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
camp that you can see in the Israeli team has been

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,479
given to

180
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
them by USA.  He doesn't have anything of his own.  But the

181
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,319
thing is, if we talk about land forces,

182
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,240
look here Iran 1713 and here

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
65825,

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,120
what is this?  They have more ordinary vehicles.

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,280
So if

186
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Iran frees them somewhere then they will get a chance

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,240
and what will they be able to do after going inside Israel

188
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,120
?  You will be able to attack.  Now we will have to understand the story a little bit to know

189
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360

190
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,360
how Iran can attack.  First of all,

191
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
if we talk about Navy, then

192
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,479
107 is here.  Isn't it?  There is flat strength.  The

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,039
Frigits are seven.  There

194
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,120
is absolutely zero here.  Israel in particular does

195
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
not need a navy.  Isn't it?

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
Israel has very rarely

197
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
used its navy and it will never do so against Iran.

198
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,199
It will not make such a mistake.

199
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,240
What will Iran do in Iran? It will

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,240
close the Hormuz Water State

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,800
because Iran has complete control

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,120
there. It is very difficult for Israel to

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
use its navy. Now the

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,879
biggest thing is that

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,039

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,960
how does Iran use the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards,

207
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,039
and what are they? After all, you people must

208
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,519
know that there was a

209
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,800
revolution in 1979 and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa came

210
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,640
into existence there.  At that time they

211
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
needed an army which would

212
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,279
report directly to the Supreme Commander or the Supreme

213
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
Leader.  If not the commander, then the commander himself will

214
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,000
come under the Supreme Leader.  So

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,080
what did the Supreme Leader do?  He

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,880
appointed a supreme commander under him and

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,600
whose supreme commander was that?  Belonged to IRGC.  And this

218
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,839
IRGC reports directly.

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
Now what did he do?  Served as Axis of Resistance.

220
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,040
Who?  The IRGC.  So,

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,160
under the Axis of Resistance, it left its own military groups, called Mili, in all these countries like Syria,

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,240
Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine.

223
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,640

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,440
So what they did under these militias was that they

226
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,480
gave them military power so that

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,800
they could attack Israel.  So who is

228
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,200
inside that axis under the Axis of Resistance

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,920
?  There is Iran and what Iran did was that it

230
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,160

231
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,360
supported its own military groups and started sending them to different countries.

232
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,440
Isn't it?  Ok?  As

233
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,080
you will see,

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
on June 13, the head of IRGC of this same group was

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
also killed.  Now

236
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,680
first of all, look, you people will talk about Hamas.  Now

237
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,040
this is what Hamas is.  Hamas is basically

238
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
operating inside Palestine,

239
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
inside the Palestine territory.  And

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,839
who is supporting this?  IRGC.  So the

241
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,720
IRGC has supported all of these.  So

242
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,120
if we mainly talk about Hamas,

243
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,399
on whom does it have moderate influence?

244
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,680
Over Iran.  And also they have 3000 to 400

245
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,560
active persons in it.  That means 300 to

246
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
400 Hamas fighters

247
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,120
attack Israel.  Similarly, it is there in different

248
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,519
countries, like it is there in Bahrain,

249
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,399
similarly it is there in Iraq.  Similarly, there

250
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,959
is Hezbollah in Lebanon.  Similarly,

251
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,800
they have kept their militias

252
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,200
stationed inside Syria.  There are Houthis inside Yemen.

253
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Now if you see their numbers, they

254
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
are tremendous.  And what is this they do?  They

255
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,000
attack Israel.  So when they will be given free hand,

256
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,480
as recently orders have been

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
passed that you have complete freedom, then

258
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
they will launch this massive attack on Israel.

259
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
But Israel is

260
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,079
not going to give up so easily.  Israel will

261
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
work according to its own will.  The US is

262
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,279
coming to help it.  And these are indications of the fact that

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,680

264
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,160
Donald

265
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,079
Trump left the G7 meeting in the middle of it and

266
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
came to the USA because he knew that

267
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,399
something or the other was going to go wrong.   It is

268
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
possible that Iran is targeting nuclear weapons and

269
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,360
warheads.  You may be

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,279
dispatching them from there.

271
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,519
How far has this news reached?  Until Don Trump

272
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,320
and the meeting had to be abandoned midway.  So

273
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,040
this is the entire development and now Iran is

274
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,600
not going to back down.  Iran is in its place

275
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
and Israel is also in its place.

276
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
Now you will get to see a tremendous war between the two.

277
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,480

278
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,040
But who will suffer loss in this?

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,200
Generally you see that the humans who

280
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,680

281
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,079
suffer the most in this are the children and women.  Well, whatever this

282
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,560
war is, some result will come

283
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,399
out.  On the other hand, Russia has

284
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
started a massive attack on

285
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,320
Ukraine.  Perhaps you might have read this morning

286
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
's news.  Friends,

287
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,640
you must accept this challenge of ours

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,560
and if you cannot accept the challenge in life

289
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
then there will never be any change in life.

290
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,000
So you guys must

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
accept this.  I have told you the techniques

292
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
how you can get out of this addiction

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
and look, you can pick it up at a very minimum price.

294
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,640

295
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
According to me you should do it.  Ok you
