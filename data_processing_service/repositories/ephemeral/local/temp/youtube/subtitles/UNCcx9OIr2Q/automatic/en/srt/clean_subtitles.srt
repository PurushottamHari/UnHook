Friends, the Supreme Leader of Iran has said that do as you wish. If you want to fire a missile there, do it over the USA.  If you want to attack Israel, do it. You can even do whatever you wish.  Who has said this ?  Khomanai has told all his military personnel and officers that you are free to do whatever you wish to do.  Because I'm going inside the bunker myself.  He himself is inside the bunker and is saying do whatever you want to do. But is Benjamin Eniya Ho himself inside Israel?  He has also left Israel.  Recently, what they did was that Benjamin Tanyahu of Israel, who had an F35 fighter jet, escorted him and left the country.  Ok?  At least Khamanai is within our country. But the thing is, friend, look, the simple thing is that the way Israel has attacked Iran, Israel itself has become a pawn of the USA.  Because that treaty was between USA and Iran. But Israel is pressurizing him.   To bring him to the table, to bring him to the table, forcing him to sit at the table and talk.  So the USA wants to talk to Iran but who will bring it to the table?  Israel will do it.  So inside Tehran right now everybody is leaving the country. Especially, they are going towards where their supporting countries are.  So they have said that they have transferred the power to the Iranian military.  That do whatever you want to do. Now do as you wish.  Now look, Iran has some missiles which even Israel cannot destroy.  The thing is that if you look at where Khomanai is right now, he is inside a bunker right now.   Is it okay?  Actually, look at the threats that were coming from the White House.  So the Supreme Leader said that where will he transfer his power now ? This power will be handed over to the Iranian military and especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, IRGC. See, two types of armies operate inside Iran.  One is their general army and within that, the one that directly reports to the supreme leader is the IRGC. We will talk a little more about this later.  Now where is Khomanai himself?  Where are they hiding?  Inside the underground bunker. Because the whole of Iran runs on bunkers. Their weapons are hidden inside these bunkers that have been built.  Like the nuclear weapons that Iran has made right now are also inside bunkers.  Their bunkers start from approximately 200 metres. Now I will show you the photographs.  Now the biggest problem for Israel is that it cannot attack these bunkers because it does not have such missiles. He will have to take help from USA. If USA sends those missiles near Israel then those missiles can destroy even the bunkers. Otherwise USA has this power. Now what he has done is that he has taken his close family members and relatives also to the bunker.  Along with that, he has also taken his son Mustaba along with him.  So this is also inside the bunker right now and inside the bunker, their entire military group and all their weapons etc., all of them remain underground. Look, now there are these hills inside Iran.   There are these mountains in Iran, inside these mountains it is not known where they have built their underground bases. They have all their fighter jets there. Like if we talk about Fateh missile, it is tremendous.  Even Israel's Iron Dome could not intercept it and it collided inside Taladi.  So, there are bunkers built deep inside these hills. Look like this is the entrance to the tunnel.  It is not known which way you will go from the entrance of this tunnel because there is a bunker below and it is completely underground.  So this is an entrance to the tunnel.  After that the check points are here.  That means let us assume that they have laid it out in a systematic manner. Along with this, they have made good arrangements for the military personnel who guard the place and as you can see, some people are sitting inside the bunker. See all the facilities etc. here, as you can see, it is for exhaust etc.  Everything is completely proper there, lighting, whitening, everything is already there, this is not something new today.  It has been there for a long time already. All this has been going on since 1979, when the revolution took place there. So let's go inside the bunker now. Now look at what Donald Trump has said, Donald Trump said that we know where the supreme leader of Iran is hiding.  Ok?  So exactly where the Iranian supreme leader is hiding.  We know where it is. Adding that there was no intention.  It means that we have no intention to kill him. But what is this matter?  This is a threat.  Brother, we know that we will kill when the need arises, we will not kill now.  So who is making this threat ?  USA.  And USA is giving this threat on the basis that it has the missile which can destroy even the bunker by going so deep. So do they know where it is?  And what has America done till date ?  I have just done surveillance.  Who has done the work of surveillance on all the countries of the world ?  America has done it.  Today he has become the watchman of the entire world.  That's why he has kept the GPS system so active. Global Positioning System which has a total of 25 satellites. He keeps watching the entire world.  This is what America has done today.  When America, that is Israel, carried out air strike on Iran, what happened to the supreme leader of Iran, after the supreme leader, that is his right hand, we can say Ali Shadmani ?  A murder was committed inside it. He had died inside it.  So Iran suffered a big blow due to this.  Now we talk about how much damage the army and defence there can cause if they are given free rein.  So we will have to do a comparative study between Israel and Iran. So if we talk about Israel, there are 170000 active personals.  Whereas there are 60000 active personals here.  Who has it with ?  Near Iran.  First of all, there can be loss from here.  The second reserve they have is 465000 and how much is there here?  365000 so they have more reserve and the reserve is there because they keep it involved in their educational system.  They keep their reserve army within their educational system because there they teach how to use weapons etc.  Then if we talk about paramilitaries, this number that you are seeing, 2200, can cause the most damage to Israel. This is the biggest number they have.  If we talk about air power, the total aircraft that Iran has is 551 and these 611 aircraft that Israel has are all from the USA.  He does n't have these.  So whatever money USA has made, it has made it by selling these aircrafts. Talking about fighter aircraft, Israel has 240 of these fighter aircraft. Who has 188?  It is near Iran.  So Israel is balancing this a bit here. After this, there are 19 special mission aircraft and there are 10 here.  So, this whole camp that you can see in the Israeli team has been given to them by USA.  He doesn't have anything of his own.  But the thing is, if we talk about land forces, look here Iran 1713 and here 65825, what is this?  They have more ordinary vehicles. So if Iran frees them somewhere then they will get a chance and what will they be able to do after going inside Israel ?  You will be able to attack.  Now we will have to understand the story a little bit to know how Iran can attack.  First of all, if we talk about Navy, then 107 is here.  Isn't it?  There is flat strength.  The Frigits are seven.  There is absolutely zero here.  Israel in particular does not need a navy.  Isn't it? Israel has very rarely used its navy and it will never do so against Iran. It will not make such a mistake. What will Iran do in Iran? It will close the Hormuz Water State because Iran has complete control there. It is very difficult for Israel to use its navy. Now the biggest thing is that how does Iran use the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and what are they? After all, you people must know that there was a revolution in 1979 and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa came into existence there.  At that time they needed an army which would report directly to the Supreme Commander or the Supreme Leader.  If not the commander, then the commander himself will come under the Supreme Leader.  So what did the Supreme Leader do?  He appointed a supreme commander under him and whose supreme commander was that?  Belonged to IRGC.  And this IRGC reports directly. Now what did he do?  Served as Axis of Resistance. Who?  The IRGC.  So, under the Axis of Resistance, it left its own military groups, called Mili, in all these countries like Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine. So what they did under these militias was that they gave them military power so that they could attack Israel.  So who is inside that axis under the Axis of Resistance ?  There is Iran and what Iran did was that it supported its own military groups and started sending them to different countries. Isn't it?  Ok?  As you will see, on June 13, the head of IRGC of this same group was also killed.  Now first of all, look, you people will talk about Hamas.  Now this is what Hamas is.  Hamas is basically operating inside Palestine, inside the Palestine territory.  And who is supporting this?  IRGC.  So the IRGC has supported all of these.  So if we mainly talk about Hamas, on whom does it have moderate influence? Over Iran.  And also they have 3000 to 400 active persons in it.  That means 300 to 400 Hamas fighters attack Israel.  Similarly, it is there in different countries, like it is there in Bahrain, similarly it is there in Iraq.  Similarly, there is Hezbollah in Lebanon.  Similarly, they have kept their militias stationed inside Syria.  There are Houthis inside Yemen. Now if you see their numbers, they are tremendous.  And what is this they do?  They attack Israel.  So when they will be given free hand, as recently orders have been passed that you have complete freedom, then they will launch this massive attack on Israel. But Israel is not going to give up so easily.  Israel will work according to its own will.  The US is coming to help it.  And these are indications of the fact that Donald Trump left the G7 meeting in the middle of it and came to the USA because he knew that something or the other was going to go wrong.   It is possible that Iran is targeting nuclear weapons and warheads.  You may be dispatching them from there. How far has this news reached?  Until Don Trump and the meeting had to be abandoned midway.  So this is the entire development and now Iran is not going to back down.  Iran is in its place and Israel is also in its place. Now you will get to see a tremendous war between the two. But who will suffer loss in this? Generally you see that the humans who suffer the most in this are the children and women.  Well, whatever this war is, some result will come out.  On the other hand, Russia has started a massive attack on Ukraine.  Perhaps you might have read this morning 's news.
