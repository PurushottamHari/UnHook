3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,880
success that i got 3 million subscribers

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,639
In just a year of doing YouTube? no it

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
Very difficult to do what I am doing. it's

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,400
One of the best content creators in the

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,160
Country Today. Very grateful to be here.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
I feel you can go to any place and capture the

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
essence very well and translate it into

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,519
Screen. what I do is not at all

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,199
ReplicaCable. We Allocate at Rs 1.5 Lakh

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
Video. you need to be a little crazy too

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
Grow as a content creator.

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,239
Video of Imagine India's Biggest Desert

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
are doing it. literally the temperature said 50

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
Degrees and we were on the ground. Worked

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,399
On videos which are like wettest place.

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,480
We went to Dharavi. we spend five days

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,719
There and every day we realise that.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,719
Feel you are able to get the soul of your place

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
Transferred into your videos. I Wood Se

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,440
Don't.

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,719
You face trouble? Yes. a lot of the times you

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,800
Who's gone on the field? five men came started

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
deleting all the videos and started

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
Beating the shoot out of my videographer. only

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,680
Was a man. which i also think is the

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,640
Barriers to entry for a lot of women

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,200
Because doing that isn't easy. I Just Fear

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,600
that there will be a day, where everything will

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
Break down, and that's a deep fear I have

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,130
because i derive a lot of my senses of

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Identity from my work.

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,920
[music]

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,600
every single year we do one isolated

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,799

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
The subject keeps evolving the guess today is

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
One of the best content creators in our

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
Country in 2025 She Goes by the Name of

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,759
Kavya Karnataka and KK Creates I Believe

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
That She Understands Modern Day Social

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,560
The media is better than everyone else from this

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
Current Generation of Content Creators in Saying

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,520
saying that this particular episode is

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,799
Created for content creators all over the

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,280
World. kavya karnataka is india's best

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,439
Young Content Creator In My Eyes. Mother

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
Personal Favorite Thing About Her Is That She

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,479
Is Incredible When It Comes to the Business

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,440
That side of things is well. personally over the

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,760
Last 10 years of this job. I have

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Created five businesses myself. and I

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,400
I am actively involved in all of these

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,160
Businesses. Across all these businesses, we have

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,640
A team of over 300 people, managing that many

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,400
people, all these operations, keeping all these

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
Goals in mind while also being a fool

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,959
Time Creator. That's the challenge. But

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,760
Businesses are an important part of the long term

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,720
Term Content Creation and Businesses Don't Run

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,959
On Creativity Alone. HR, CRM,

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,239

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,200

I mean when I say that we try to talk

138
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,479
about social realities is that sin

139
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,880
Childhood, what we have been taught is very

140
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,639
Grey is very black and white. Sins

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Childhood: What We've Been Taught Is Very

142
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
Black and white. there is a good kid and a

143
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,240
Bad kid. There's a boy, there's a girl.

144
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,840
Pink is for girls, blue is for boys.

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
there is

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,199
there is rich and there is poor there is right

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,160
the ideology there is left

148
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,319
ideology but my education my the people i

149
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,080
got surrounded will told me that the world is

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,479
Not that black and white world is so grey

151
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,720
what i want to do with my channel is that

152
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to cover each and every district

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
of india give the mic to the people in those

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Districts and Let Them Tell There

155
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Stories like for example one of the

156
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,479
Videos That We Made Which Has Now 10

157
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,680
Million plus plus views which is insane to

158
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,759
Think about to have in this category that does

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
many number of views in just two months of

160
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,960
It's releasing. We went to dharavi which

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Is the world's biggest slum. We Spend

162
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,039
Five days there and every day we realize that

163
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,039
there are so many stories to be told

164
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,520
here. There is a story of a woman who has

165
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,639
come from a village and living in this big

166
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,919
House. Literally this big house. and there are

167
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,360
20 People Living With Her in This Bigger House.

168
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,319
imagine like this studio which is i

169
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,120
think three times the size of this woman

170
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
The house is one third the size and there are 20

171
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,520
People Living in That House. That's Dharavi

172
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
For you. but dharavi is also india's

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
Biggest leather producing market. it's

174
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,199
also the biggest plastic recycling

175
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,120
Industries of Mumbai. it's a lot of

176
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
Rappers Are Born With. like gully boy

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
The stories come from there. So

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,800
What I want to do with my videos is

179
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,639
Make the stories about the social realities of

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
India, Culture of India, Geography of

181
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,240

I told you this outside. but as a content

196
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,240
Creator. I'm Inspired to Do the Kind

197
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
of content you are doing. by actually

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Going out on the field. and i love this

199
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,959
Medium. also i think it's got its own

200
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,399
Ahhh

201
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,440
Fruits. But I miss going out in the field,

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,200
Recording the Real Experience of Real

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
Human Beings. also as a content

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,560
Creator I feel you are able to get the soul of

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,040
Your place transferred into your videos.

206
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,800
Hmm. I Wood Se

207
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Don't. I wouldn't say that. Like face trouble?

208
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Yes. there is no procedure when you go on

209
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
Ground. there are so many factors that

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,080
Can go that are not in your control. I

211
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
Wanna say one thing before you. I Actually

212
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
Think you are one of the most talented content

213
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
Creators have seen it in the last 10 years of

214
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
Being in this industry and you are hard

215
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
Working along with the talent. because i have

216
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Seen a lot of talented content creators

217
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,360
Not actually a take on the long form. and I

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
don't think that's the average person

219
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,839
understands how difficult it is to

220
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Create a 10, 15, 20 minute video, and keep it

221
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,440
The Audience's Retention in the Age of Short

222
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,279
Form content. so what are you doing is

223
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Very intric and its very real content

224
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,920
And you are getting the views. so you are

225
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,800
Hitting too many marks. i hope that everybody

226
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,200
Content creation on the country sees this

227
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,519
Episode. so you are the prototype that i

228
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
present in front of a lot of young and

229
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,920
Older content creators. So Figuring Long

230
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
Form. ah but very few people are able to do this

231
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,800
what you do. now i love you to break

232
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,680
Down. perfect. so a lot of things to

233
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,839
Break down late. it's only been two years

234
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,320
Since I started content creation on my

235
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,360
On. The first year was entirely focused on

236
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Short form. In 10 Months We Could Gain 1.2

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Million Followers on Instagram Geography

238
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,320
yes we focused around geography and second

239
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,200
Year we pivoted we didn't pivot. Wee Broad

240
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,720
Our Scope to Culture. hmm and thats it

241
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Exactly a year ago in March 2024 is

242
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
When We Started Our YouTube Long

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,279
Format.

244
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,200
when i

245
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,920
started i new for sure that there were

246
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,920
100 more than 100 people going to say that

247
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,320
Short Form Creators Can't Do Long

248
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,760
Form like if you are a shorts creator you

249
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
can not do long format also the space

250
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,640
was so saturated because there was already a

251
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,720
lots of established figures who are sitting in

252
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,800
their houses breaking anything that was

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,240
Happening Weather It Is Geopolitical Weather

254
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,120
it is a finance weather it is a anything in

255
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,760
the news news people wood sill sit they had a

256
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,880
team of 20 people already and they wood break

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,360
down that same news after reading four five

258
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,279
Six Research Papers. so when we begin

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
YouTube I wanted to know that I wanted to

260
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,160
do it in the education rail but i didn't want to

261
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,880
To sit at home and do it. because there was

262
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,120
so many people doing it

263
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,480
Already. And when I vented out I saw a new eye

264
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,200
new that this short haired girl is thin

265
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,800
C will go to such tough places. this is peepal

266
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,959
will think that this is itself an

267
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,720
interesting story s well right like you

268
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,800
are a character exactly i am the

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Character So Many Women So Many Men Also

270
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,640
relate to that character then when so the

271
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,720
the premise was decided that we would go to each

272
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,800
Districts of India tell the story

273
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,200
through my lens and while at the same time

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,839
that was the basic thing everything we

275
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,320
perfected dude like we spend so much till the

276
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,440
The day I began two years ago on the day I came

277
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,760
Begin till today. I have all the data fed by

278
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
My own hands. How many views did you get on the first day?

279
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Pay? How many views did you get on the seventh day? How many?

280
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,079
Did you get views on the 30th day? How many likes did you get,

281
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,320
How many shares came? how many what comments

282
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,920
type was it? what was the audience that was

283
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,720
watching it? what was the ctr on the

284
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,920
First day, seventh day, 30th day. I Come

285
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,399
From a mother who is a maths teacher. we sleep

286
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,399
That love for data, that love for analysis

287
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,200
Comes from her. Yes. so, the second thing that

288
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,440
We did respect the platform. So We

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
Figure out the niche that we want to enter into

290
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
And that's the way that we are going to enter into. The

291
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,399
the second thing i did was we respected the

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Platform. What does YouTube want before

293
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
Even if you make the best story you will give

294
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,519
To get people to click on it. Right? Like

295
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,560
as you also said, you still spend a lot

296
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,639
of your time thinking about the thumbnail and the

297
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,160
Title. i also spend a lot of my time

298
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,680
Packaging It. then once they have clicked it the

299
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,800
15 Seconds You Have to Be the Best

300
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,200
of your video till today i am the one who

301
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
seats at the end of the day once the video has

302
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,240
Been edited I still sit with it for three

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,399
Days on my own editing table I spend full

304
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Three Days Without Sleeping and Thinking About It

305
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,440
What is the 15 seconds. how are we making it

306
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,360
the best 15 seconds

307
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Possible.

308
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,399
And ah not just 15 seconds. 15 seconds

309
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
This is the beginning of it. if you don't give

310
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,320
something new for after every 30 seconds,

311
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
You are going to lose your audience. and it

312
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,839
Sounds very capitalistic. it sounds

313
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,639
very scathing that

314
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh there are tricks and tricks of

315
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,639
Detaining the audience. but it's important,

316
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Right? like these are stories that should reach so

317
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,560
Many people. If we are spending so much money,

318
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,600
So much time, so much energy in making those

319
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,839
Stories. Why Not Spend Time in Making

320
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
Sure people watch it. More and More People Watch

321
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
It's over, people watch it till the end. I also

322
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,639
think you are doing the job that journalists are

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,120
Paid to do. For sure. we get so many

324
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,920
Governments saying this is what I want

325
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,480
Journalism to be. why is media houses

326
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,360
Not covering it. a lot of people this is this

327
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,600
Happened not by design. this happened i

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,600
Think because of my education. what did you

329
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,920
Study? ah i went to first a womans

330
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,279
College. I did my bachelors from lady

331
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,720
Shri Ram College. and Ranveer A Women's College

332
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,519
is the best space to be for any female.

333
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Because that space is freeing. it freezes

334
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,639
You up. you can dance walk talk in whatever

335
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,880
the way you want

336
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,079
Two. So I went to a women's college. i did

337
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,680
My under graduation in english honours. But

338
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
during those three years of being in a

339
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,480
women's college, i was also involved

340
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,839
In Theatre. for three years, every year we

341
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Wood Do 300 Performances on Ground. So,

342
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,720
people think that this is an overnight success

343
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,720
that i got 3 million subscribers in just

344
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,000
A Year of Doing YouTube. no, i also did

345
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
Three Years of Street Theatre Where We Were

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,440
Writing our own scripts. We are the best

347
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
Directing That Play. we were also

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Acting in it. We were also making the

349
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,040
music of those who play and think about it

350
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,199
This is the area where Imtiaz Ali has come

351
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,120
From. this is the area where a lot of our

352
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,440
Directors have come from. So The Talent

353
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,600
There is very rich. and then i did my

354
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,120
Masters from India's Best Social Science

355
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,680
Institute. So Sir Ratan Tata has built

356
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,240
This college called Tata Institute of Social

357
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,199
Science which is in Mumbai only where I

358
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,880
Learned how to make documentaries. I slept

359
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,800
Learned how to hold the camera at what fps

360
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,120
Aperture Balancing Rule of Thirds All the

361
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,680
Technicalities That Only Videographers Know

362
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,519
is what I learned there I also learned how

363
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,920
How to Edit in Premiere Pro

364
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,120
used to sit and they were so old like those

365
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,480
machines was so old ranvir to render a 15

366
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,360
second clip it would take us like 3 hours

367
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,560
we would put that on render go out have tea

368
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,199
have dinner then come back from plate so i learnt

369
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,680
Through the hard way that how do you edit? how do

370
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,079
you put the camera and then we were sent on

371
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,519
Ground. so during that time there was a

372
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,480
Protest happening in Mumbai wherever they are

373
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,120
Clearing the R A Forest. i spend a

374
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,120
month later documenting just the journey of the

375
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,920
Tribals who were living there. who's life was

376
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,040
Going to get affected.

377
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,680
so skip to now when a lot of people

378
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,920
Comment saying this was true journalism is

379
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,800
it comes because of my education in guys

380
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,040
Areas. when i was breaking down this

381
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Podcast with a friend don't be a big fan. V

382
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,959
both came to conclude that you are very good

383
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,040
With people. and that's what helps you in

384
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,240
Your Content Creation Journey. like you're able to

385
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,919
Connect very easily to people. Right? Or. I

386
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,079
Think I am and like anyone. anybody in this

387
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,480
Life is a combination of their parents.

388
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,520
Right? like a lot of you is defined by who

389
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,319
Your parents are. my mother has been a teacher

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,679
For the Past 25 Years. every day i have seen

391
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,319
That woman who goes to school at 7:00 am. Less

392
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,200
Back at 4:00 p.m. again teach for two hours

393
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,919
Tuition in home. and then at night check

394
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Papers and then repeat that. for 25 years

395
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,400
She has been teaching the same subject. End

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,880
My father is the complete opposite. he will do

397
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,520
The Bare Minimum in His Office. he loves to

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,559
Travel. Am I the one who loves to talk to people. he is

399
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,799
The One Who Most Likes Fathers to Say in Your Social

400
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,320
Friends are your biggest currency. nothing

401
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,360
Everything Else Matters in Life. so i am a

402
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,960
Combination of my mother. who knows hard

403
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,039
work. who knows everyday doing the same thing

404
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,039
Again and again till you have perfected it.

405
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:05,440
And then doing it in some way other than that.

406
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,640
And my father is a very social person likes

407
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,080
to travel get new

408
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,000
Experiences. So Brilliant Parenting

409
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,400
bro do they will understand what you are

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
Doing it completely? they don't even understand

411
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,520
one thing that has been happening in my

412
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,120
Journey but they have been the biggest supporter.

413
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,760
My Mother Understands Business. even two hum

414
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,080
There are hills. I had never thought that at 27

415
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,240
years of my age i would leave my job, do

416
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,280
My own business, I have a private limited at

Is Telling and Getting Views, in the Long

423
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,400
Form at 10 million, it's unimaginable.

424
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,880
So, of course, it's unimaginable for them

425
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Also. are parents also we have to be a

426
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,720
Little kind to them. They are a generation

427
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,600

hmm but yet why i say my parents

432
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,960

Just Learning Evolving Try to Know New

443
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:56,480
Things Anytime Our Followers Grow By

444
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,880
When two of 100 is 2.1. Two of 2.2

Screenshot sending it to the group.

Congratulations. Let's have a party. My

450
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,720
Father Recently Took Me to His Boss and Said

451
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,880
This is my daughter. She is Forbes 30 Under 30.

452
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,880
he didn't know what forbes 30 under 30

453
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,559
Means. But he still said it to his boss. Give

454
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,120
You are very very proud, excited, loving

455
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,760
Parents. you know, i am asking you this

456
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,480
Question? because i actually feel you saw the

457
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,000
Realities of our country, considering the

458
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Places You Visit for Your

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,440
Documentaries. and you also meet

460
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,600
People in South Bombay, South Delhi etc.

461
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,679
keeping all those audiences in mind, what

462
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,760
Do You Think Is the Future of Content Creation

463
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,799
In our country. You think it keeps growing?

464
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,559
Content will always stay, the format might

465
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:00,320
Differ, the Platform Might

466
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:03,039
Differ. When there was only newspaper,

467
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,280
TV came, people started consuming there

468
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,919
News from TV. earlier there were only

469
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Books, Mobiles Came, People Started

470
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,640
Consuming their books from mobiles.

471
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
We are in a very interesting space in the format

472
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
People should look at the content on Instagram

473
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
The algorithm itself changes every month

474
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,400
It remains, it will keep on changing

475
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Smart Creators Know How to Evolve

476
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,840
change their hooks change their personality

477
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,799
change their way of speaking going slow

478
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,000
going fast telling about life telling

479
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,799
about business

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,840
But Creators Will Evolve to What It Is

481
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,559
That the audience wants smart creators

482
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
Those will evolve to that. I genuinely think

483
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,360
My personal belief is that regional local

484
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,840
Creators will grow a lot. i see that with

485
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,080
The series that OTTs are offering. For

486
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,400
Example Black Warren type which is a series

487
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,320
The actors in it, the stories in it

488
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
it is being told or it is of the double paisa type which

489
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
This is a series that tells very local stories

490
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
Are going. Or you can look at this

491
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,120
YouTube is offering dubbing feature.

492
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,520
It's a small thing. But still the kind of growth

493
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,600
That it will see is massive. mr beast joe

494
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,280
Now those are our own videos, those are 15

495
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
It is being dubbed in 16 languages. My

496
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,799
Whenever I see the video of Mr. Beast

497
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,320
is it plays in hindi. so and that has been seen

498
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,960
A 10% 10% increase in his viewership. So

499
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,600
Local Regional Stories Formats Content Will

500
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,919
Grow is what I think. also because of

501
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
AI dubbing. Yes. let me ask you a very

502
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
Like a straight question. Feel Free to Answer

503
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,080
However you want. Why is your YouTube

504
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,840
Channel Working So Well in 2025? because i

505
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,760
Think a lot, people don't attempt it for long

506
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,600
Form thinking that there is no more future

507
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
In long form. and then you see kavya r

508
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,120
Getting 10 million views on videos. So

509
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,000
What do you think you are doing right. Hmm.

510
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,320
A I am doing what no one else is doing.

511
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,799
be i am doing something which is

512
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,280
Well it makes no sense. Sustainability Makes It

513
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,559
No sense. Financially it makes no sense.

514
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,320
Safety wise it makes no sense. so it's

515
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,320
Very difficult to do what I am doing.

516
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
It's not easy being a woman to go to

517
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,520
India's Hottest Place, Wettest Place,

518
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,559
Biggest dumping ground, it's not easy. So

519
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,200
it's just very different from what the

520
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,520
The kind of content that YouTube has. seconds,

521
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,240
I am doing it very-very systematically.

522
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,240
Like I have studied all the Ranveer, you

523
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
All the studio tours, all the content,

524
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,440
Creator, Podcast You Had I Studied

525
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Them all. I literally have notes from all the

526
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,840
Podcast That You Have Done. and i have done it

527
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,679
This is for all foreign creators. I have done it

528
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:43,760
This is for all Indian creators.

529
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:47,440
Third, I work a lot with data. Till From

530
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,440
Day one till today, I have noted myself

531
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,799
Down number of views, number of likes, number

532
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,919
of comments, etsetra. Fourth, I have a

533
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,360
Very strong team. like even do you only

534
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,000
see me on screen my fiancée is the one who

535
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,480
make sure that everyone is safe we ​​have the best

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,559
Talents My Best Friend Is The One Who Makes

537
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,720
Sure that I don't have to talk to any brand

538
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,360
that our finances are taken care of I

539
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,679
I only worry about creative creativity

540
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,240
only worry about videos so to have a

541
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,120
Strong team is very fifth eye also

542
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,440
think i did it at the right time when the need was there

543
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,840
The Need Was More Than Positive Content

544
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,880
of complex next content like depth

545
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,400
depth very in depth talking to people showing

546
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,679
Realities Which Have Not Been Seen I Also

547
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,000
think that people think that this is an overnight

548
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
Success

549
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,640
but in some way or the other I have been working

550
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,480
with the format of media and video and

551
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,200
Optimization for Very Long Like In

552
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,360
School I did National School of Drama then

553
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,360
I did theater in college then I was working

554
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,840
For a lot of internships just writing

555
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Vlogs handling seos. I New

556
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,000
The There Is No One Video Editing

557
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,520
software which i have

558
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Not practiced on myself. and above all

559
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,600
Of this I think I love making videos.

560
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,520
like videos at the end of the day, if i have

561
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,919
to tell you ranvir that this is how you get the

562
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Maximum CTR. this is how you obtain

563
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
For retention, this is what thumbnail works,

564
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,960
This Is What the Title Works. nothing will

565
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,840
Matter if you don't love videos. like i just

566
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,080
Want stories to be told. for years

567
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,240
Years. like even today tomorrow if i retire

568
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,400
I will still be clicking nice videos of

569
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,120
My partner putting them out. I love

570
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,120
Videos. I'm gonna recap everything you

571
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,440
Sed. Ok? first and foremost

572
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,440
Originality Creating Content That's YouTube

573
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,840
Not seen yet. which is a very very

574
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,600
Difficult skill because this is built out of

575
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,520
Observational skills. you have to be very

576
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:57,120
Observe to understand this. Second, you are

577
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,600
Studying Other Content Creators Who Have Been

578
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,679
Around before you in detail. so you can learn

579
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,200
From the experiences and mistakes. I slept

580
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
Think it's a very active part of content

581
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,720
Creation. Next, give is the saying that the

582
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,559
The best kind of content is the one where the

583
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,520
Content creator is taking up the efforts

584
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,360
In the place of the audience. i also want to

585
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
No what Dharavi ends with dumping round.

586
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,559
But I am nimble, let me go. Yeah. and i am seeing

587
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,240
It is through your efforts. ah so i think you

588
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,480
Putting in the diet one extra act of

589
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
Effort as well as risk. Yes. putting that

590
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,679
Risk in the content. next you head

591
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
Education related to media. you understand

592
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,600
Documentary Film Making. You

593
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,600
Understand the theory of content creation.

594
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,640
people do this over a three year course but in

595
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,480
Truth. only learn it through practical

596
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,120
Exposure. Ah and finally, I think of you

597
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,240
Enjoy it, right? Yeah. then also the team

598
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,039
also the time being right yes team number se

599
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,039
like playing a team game having a vision yes

600
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,760
So treating it with a little business angle

601
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,919
at least yes yes I also ask my team

602
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,480
members before coming here what is our

603
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,200
mote what is it that is our USP what

604
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,440
makes a stand apart my teammate shyamvi

605
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,679
said that a lot of the times when her cousins

606
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,279
come back home they are tired they are cribbing

607
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,559
About their company. she said that for her it

608
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,520
Feels like the work she is doing is hers.

609
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,240
Like she is doing it for herself. It

610
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,159
Feels personal. it feels like what she is

611
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,159
Doing is making a difference to this entire

612
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,000
World. even two she is not even in front of

613
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,760
The Camera. She is not even going on ground,

614
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,600
She is a community manager. she is just

615
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:43,720
Answering 200, 300 comments a day. and if she

616
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,360
Said that's what it means, yah.

617
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,000
something is happening which people feel

618
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,799
connected to hmm my reading this is as a

619
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,559
Content Creator I Feel You Can Go To A

620
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,399
Place and capture the essence very well and

621
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,080
translate it into screen now i don't

622
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,240
what to call this skin i will tell you

623
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,159
What to call this script before going

624
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,919
too like i was saying making one video

625
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:10,799
takes us a month and a half 45 days to make

626
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:13,200
One Video We Allocate 1.5 Lakh Per Video One

627
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,360
It costs Rs 1.5 lakh to make the video.

628
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,880
Accept Salaries, Accept Equipments,

629
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,159
Accept any other thing. Ok? Now we the people

630
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,320
20 Days Is Just Prey Before Going There

631
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,000
work. Research Yes Research Where People

632
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,240
think about video no the problem that came

633
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,600
have with most creators is that they only

634
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,080
Think about data, innovation etcetera. i have a

635
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,039
Strong Mentality if you are on YouTube

636
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,840
Think Visually. so we already have 50

637
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,200
Visuals in Mind. Story Boarding

638
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,080
Story Boarding Which We Want to Take and End

639
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,320
Out of those 50 visuals if five are my

640
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,720
must have i tell my producers that

641
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,360
If These Five Visuals Are Not There We Are

642
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,720
not doing this video so my producer

643
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,720
who has now spent 20 days in just writing

644
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,960
Writing the Perfect Title the Perfect

645
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,760
Introduction Writing the P Giving Me the

646
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,760
Best Visuals Writing The Perfect We Even

647
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
Right, who are the people that we can interview?

648
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,520
What are the kinds of questions that we can ask

649
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,760
ask dum so like before the podcast you

650
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,559
You do research on that thing in every video, right?

651
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,440
We have done it before as well. then after that we

652
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,159
The producer talks to all the NGOs who are

653
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,880
Working on the ground. all the ngos that

654
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,960
have worked in dharavi we have talked to end

655
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,520
then when we are on the ground we are on the

656
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
Ground for not one day Ranveer we are not on

657
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,320
The Ground for Two Days. we are on the ground

658
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,640
For Seven Days and Entire Week at 12 Hours

659
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,679
Day we are on the ground. just three people but

660
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,039
12 Hours on the Ground is a Lot. Specially

661
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,799
Imagine we are doing a video. Indian i

662
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,919
Making a video of the biggest desert.

663
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,320
literally the temperature said 50 degrees and we

664
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,799
War on the ground. we worked on videos

665
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Which are like the wettest place. let it Rain

666
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,840
It is complete. Nothing is visible

667
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,000
Front. Still we are on the ground. Hour

668
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,679
Cameras R

669
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,360
Rolling. I would love to tell you about it. V

670
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,520
Will do that in the Hindi segment

671
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,799
Where We Talk About the Stories That Have Come

672
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:11,600
On from the ground. but what you said that

673
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,880
you said that I have the art of translating

674
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,640
Stories from Ground to Video Its

675
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,240
Meticulously plucked soul of the place soul of

676
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,279
the place yes and and very very small

677
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,679
things that will be the visual what

678
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,159
will be the angle we plan that also like

679
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,159
angle in the sense that if you want to make that

680
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,840
person feel small we will shoot from top if

681
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,600
you want to make them feel big we will shoot

682
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,960
from the bottom so all of those things are

683
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,080
Matic Sully Plunged Out and Then We Came Back

684
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,399
We make four versions of the same video and

685
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,200
then i sit with it my teammates think i

686
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,559
I'm crazy they're not sustainable at all

687
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,480
It's just crazy to be working with me

688
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,720
hmm but yes it's good it you need to be

689
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
It's a good idea to grow a little crazy

690
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,840
Content Creator I'll tell you my end

691
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,360

692
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:11,000
of 15 full time employees four of them took

693
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,960
their first flight in life because of ours

694
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,320
Videos. there is a

695
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,720
Person who sits in Rajasthan. she is one of

696
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,120
The Best Thumbnail Makers in India. she is

697
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,760
One of the people I work with Sri Ganganagar

698
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,000
There is a place. Sitting there he is my prisoner.

699
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,840
He is now forming a team of four people. End

700
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,760
She is the one who is making thumbnails for us.

701
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,880
Third Eye had a deep mental breakdown. I

702
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,240
said to one of my producers, he

703
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,279
Listen, after being beaten I don't think we

704
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,000
should be continuing this. i don't want my

705
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,320
Teammates to be at risk. She Said to Me,

706
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,960
Kavya give me one day, I will figure out a solution

707
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,880
Out. and she got me the number of the NGOs

708
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,640
And then we went again. We were able to go

709
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,679
Again because of the talent that she had. The People

710
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,080
that she could contact and get us on the

711
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,600
Ground. Protection. And we speak

712
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,279
Boys protect. hey our brother

713
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,159
Meet the girls. He is nothing less

714
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,159
your boys

715
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:14,640
From. End

716
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,120
like one day someone shared a handbook that

717
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Mr. Beast has been created. Ok? this is a

718
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,880
hand one of my producer has worked with

719
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,360
mr beast in some of the in some capacity

720
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,080
and he had the hand that mister

721
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Beast gives to every new joinee. So, he

722
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,880
Shared that on the group. the next day

723
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,279
every member of that of our team had come

724
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,720
After reading it. no one had told them to

725
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,080
Read it. no one but they had come they red it end

726
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,640
Then they came. r videographer got beaten for

727
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,120
As a friend. what will you take? And what else will you take? Any

728
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,279
Does he give his beating, who comes, friend?

729
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,080
Is it the same guy was outside? no this is a

730
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,519
Freelancer we have taken. but the person is

731
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,279
Ankit Bishad. He is also a hill

732
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,840
Is. So

733
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,679
but and i think it's the magic that when you

734
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,200
Are a small team that gets the vision

735
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,840
translated that

736
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,480
Energy Energy Gets Translated a Lot to You

737
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,600
Learn from each other a lot. Very Key

738
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,799
Question. Ok? before you move on into the

739
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,720
Next conversation with me.

740
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,320
The

741
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,320
Question

742
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,000
is what makes a great title in thumbnail

743
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,240
In 2025 I Love That Question I Can Talk

744
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,120
about that question so many thumbnails and

745
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,120
titles change with time so what's what

746
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,360
The Best Kind of Thumbnails and Titles

747
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,960
now got it so I would say that for me I

748
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,919
can you talk about me i can't talk about

749
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,480
Any Other Category 2.5 Million Views in 24

750
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:52,360
Hours 24 Hours 2.5 Million Views Yes

751
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,320
How I Look at Thumbnails is to Study

752
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,240
Outliers. what do we mean by

753
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,080
Outliers? this is a very technical term but

754
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,440
this is a very very important term for

755
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,039
anybody who is now going to become a

756
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,559
Youtuber. Whenever you're scrolling through

757
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,079
your feed and you find a video by a

758
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,720
Creator who you usually don't follow. and yet

759
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,280
that has more views than their average number of

760
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,960
Views. Just Screenshot That Thumbnail and

761
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,720
Keep it.

762
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,000
As Your Inspirational What I Call It Is It

763
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,399
as an inspirational database because something

764
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,200
happened in that video where usually a

765
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,079
Creator Would Get 2000 Views But That Gave Them

766
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,079
100k views that's an outlier video so

767
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,839
something happened in their title or thumbnail

768
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,679
that work so i have a huge bank of just

769
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,679
Inspirational Board Now From My

770
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,440
Inspirational Board What I Have Noticed

771
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:48,079
is in titles keep it 50 words max 50

772
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,960
Characters Max Doesn't Try To Be

773
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,440
Clickbaity Do Not Try To Be Following Anyone

774
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,679
sort of format give them what that

775
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,320
The video is genuinely about which you can be

776
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,040
able to which you will be able to do justice

777
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,359
to and do that justice within the first 30

778
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,520
Seconds for example if I say that I am

779
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,960
Going to the hottest place in the first

780
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,880
frame it myself i'll show the temperature the heat

781
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,000
my shoe is melting the moment some animal dies

782
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,000
Will show it in the first. So Be Truthful In

783
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,040
What the title and the thumbnail is. Thumbnails

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,880
I think that for me what

785
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,599
works is when i show myself in that

786
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,800
Space. only three aspects should be only

787
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,320
Three components should be in your thumbnail. Do

788
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,040
Not over crowded it. think about

789
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,440
Contrast, Think About

790
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,440
colors. A Lot of Times Creators Make This

791
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
The Mistake That They Want to Templatize

792
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,119
Things. Yes, sure that makes your job easy.

793
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,160
so just keep it as simple and as

794
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,160
As Impactful as Possible. Study I

795
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,280
can a lot of creators have already made

796
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,119
Courses have done a lot of YouTube videos

797
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,599
Are out on what makes a great title,

798
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,480
What makes a great thumbnail. there are a

799
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,720
Lots of also strategies like Paddy Galloway

800
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,040
is the one who works with mr beast and

801
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Who Works With Ryan Rehn. he talks a lot

802
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,680
About This on His Twitter. there is also

803
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,320
Colin and Samir who do a lot of podcasts

804
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,920
With very-very famous creators to follow

805
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,160
Them. am john yusufi is a channel name who is a

806
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,320
Person who worked with YouTube for 15 years.

807
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,800
And now he has become a full time creator

808
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,920
Makes content for creators. so follow

809
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,599
Creators like that. and it's a very sad

810
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,560
Reality to say but 30% of your time should be

811
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,960
Spend just the title and thumbnail in a

812
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,680
Video. No matter how beautiful that story is

813
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,079
is, if people don't click it, what's the

814
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,839
Point. we have too many documentaries in

815
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
India, which are not accessible. and they

816
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,800
Good documentaries. Great

817
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,640
Documentaries, Amazing Stories

818
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,119
But people do not sell themselves, yes.

819
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,119
The pizza box matters as much as a pizza.

820
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,839
Agree, Agree the Packaging Matters as Much

821
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,440
S the thing inside it. At the end of the day,

822
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,520
what i am doing here right now is

823
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,040
Telling Myself. no one can predict

824
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,400
What will happen in the next five years.

825
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
but i think you can predict what happens

826
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
In the next six to 12 months. Yes. So

827
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,680
What will happen in the next six to 12

828
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,119
Month. Interesting. On Instagram? All three.

829
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,880
Let's, let's take one at a time. Yes.

830
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,880
Let's take one at a time. On

831
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,240
Instagram. here is what i think what

832
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,160
will it happen on

833
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,480
Instagram? Relatability will always be the

834
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,040
The Key for Instagram Relatability is the key.

835
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,200
now i don't mean that relatability has to

836
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,280
Have a set form format. Relatability

837
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,119
Can

838
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,960
B Very Meta Conversation. but i will tell you

839
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,119
you in the any time we have had content in

840
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,119
This country. there are some things that have

841
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,880
Always worked. I will tell you why.

842
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,640
we play with nostalgia it's always on

843
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,960
Is. Why are Cred ads trending these days?

844
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,440
Because he said Alka

845
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,560
He brought Yaganek along. Ok? So

846
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,800
The nostalgia will always last. Nostalgia Cain

847
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,000
Be when you talk about things which you

848
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,240
Had in your childhood. for example i

849
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,920
had lunch break at xxx

850
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,920
Time. And that is a shared relatable

851
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,079
The Experience That We Have and Also Has

852
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,480
Nostalgia attached to it. Ok?

853
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,680
Second state pride will last forever because

854
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,000
of the people who connect to their nation and

855
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,240
connect to their state and connect to

856
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,960
whatever dal baati chokha if you say so

857
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,440
So Bihari people will come friend. If you

858
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,680
If you say Bangalore then people will say Bangalore instead of Bengaluru

859
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,960
will come

860
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Buddy. If you say Kannada, people will come, friend. So

861
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,040
Your Nostalgia One Format Which Also

862
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,280
The works is mythbreaking. For

863
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:51,440
For example, South Indians only eat Idly

864
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,240
Dosa. Break that myth. tell me something else

865
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,480
story. All of these are relatable. This

866
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,400
How will you make it relatable? Do this. to me this

867
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,560
Looks like these buckets will last. these buckets

868
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,079
Are the ones that you talk about. Your Shed

869
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,800
The Identity of Being a Submissive Boyfriend.

870
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,280
or your identity of being a woman with shot

871
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Hair. or your identity of being the elder

872
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,960
sister. that elder sisters are crazy

873
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,520
About their younger siblings, elder

874
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,079
Sisters are parents. and you talk about

875
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,920
Being an army kid. you dids shared

876
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,240
Realities You Have to Figure Out and Make That Happen

877
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,079
Relatable content etcetera. So these shared

878
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Figure out the realities. Inside him I

879
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,960
Gave five-six buckets. go play with it

880
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,079
Will go. Ok? Second, I think that

881
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,280
Very good short form films will come out

882
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,320
Off Instagram. Have you seen the soham d yes.

883
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,119
I love him. He does that brilliantly. Like,

884
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,079
I would call them proper films. Or, or.

885
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,000
Right? he is the most talented young

886
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,240
Director We Have in the Country. Agreed.

887
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,160
And I have seen some professional film

888
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,000
Directors and he is better than them. Yes.

889
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,960
Guys like that need to be given a chance.

890
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,720
Agreed. Bollywood will save itself. The Soham

891
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,079
Is given a chance. i also think like a

892
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,760
lot of these rj, harshi,princy,what

893
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,320
they are doing with just one camera are telling

894
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,119
Full all. It feels like you are watching a movie

895
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,760
I am there in 1 minute. so, even if it will

896
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,160
Continue to be Continue to stay short

897
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,960
form and it will continue to be done at a

898
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,520
Much lower budget and much more frequency. but the

899
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,320
The quality will be so refined on Instagram.

900
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,880
I genuinely think so. Third I think

901
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Yes the pace will come down a bit. Like Slower

902
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,960
Content slower content means like

903
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,119
Content with feels Content with feels

904
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,079
I will feel connected, that means that once upon a time

905
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,240
when there were subtitles

906
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:42,880
This is how those times used to come, people wanted it

907
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,680
pasta not mail puri yes now they have them in my

908
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,000
Papa says cook food on low flame

909
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,520
so that's what we are going to do now

910
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,520
we will move towards i also think on

911
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,560
Instagram Monetarily Brands Won't Work

912
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,319
So much with bigger creators as much as they

913
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Will work with Nano creators with very

914
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,319
Specific niche. or my reading and this is

915
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,520
A From Conversation I Had With The Boys

916
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,079
and monkey

917
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,359
ah i think people at the absolute top,

918
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,359
Bindwai will always get work. Second run,

919
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,000
It's gonna be a little difficult. Agreed End

920
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,160
Then it goes get democratised. because

921
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,920
Everyone becomes a content creator. Agreed. But

922
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,480
you still need to be of a certain quality

923
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,720
Even if democratized. I look at it this

924
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:32,800
like either you are the top

925
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,839
0.1% and you are great anything below you will

926
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,359
be struggling and the once below will find

927
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:44,680
Some and the other sort of work. what is

928
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:48,280
0.1% now? Neel Mohan The Guy of YouTube

929
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:52,240
CEO himself gave this data in one of his

930
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:56,400
Releases 1% of yours get a million views

931
00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:00,400
in a month in life time oh so imagine like

932
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,119
anyone has a profile right even

933
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,040
the people who are commenting have a profile to

934
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,200
So many people are claiming to be creators.

935
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,599
Out of that, one million people

936
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:18,319
have been. 0.1% Ranveer who are the 1% I think

937
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:21,359
0.1% are the ones who have been in this game for

938
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,839
a certain amount of years who have been in

939
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,040
this game for at least three four

940
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:32,640
Years. point 1% are also those who have been

941
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,319
True to their morals. like they haven't

942
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,839
Worked with waiting apps and they haven't

943
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,000
Worked with scams, schemes. Sense Of

944
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,400
Long term branding yes. a sense of longing

945
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,720
Term branding. Third is people who are

946
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,160
Conscientiously Innovating

947
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,079
Like I think Tanmay Bhat

948
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:55,200
is god in the indian

949
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:57,760
The ecosystem where he was, he had this IP

950
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,079
which is so low effort high rewarding will

951
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,280
he will get

952
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:05,920
funny friends of his and just do a live

953
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,079
Stream reacting to memes. Convert That

954
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,560
into a video.

955
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,200
The perfect amazing format that he has

956
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,920
Cracked. he also did vogs he also did

957
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,160
AI stuff with Varun Maya he also head

958
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,800
Some I Think Podcast with Big Basket

959
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,240
etsetra and he also has moonshine which

960
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,520
is the agency which produces a lot of the

961
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,119
AIDS That We Now See on TV. So Innovation

962
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,960
In so many levels this has happened. and we

963
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,520
also need creators who know when to say

964
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,839
No. because as soon as you are 100 type

965
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,599
what do you become in this field of yours

966
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,079
So many opportunities come your way.

967
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,119
Make a course, make merchandise. Hour

968
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,599
Focus. yes, you need to be focused on what

969
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,359
Is it that you want to do? and the other

970
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,319
Things How You Can Delegate and Build Up

971
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,800
Systems which can do this for you without you

972
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:01,520
You having to take that earn. Hmm. where

973
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,839
Where is the future of YouTube going? YouTube,

974
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,160
S, let's talk about YouTube. what do you

975
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,280
Think you've been in this for so long. how

976
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,520
Persia does YouTube change? how has it changed

977
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,040
Over the years? I think YouTube had become a

978
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,839
Podcasting Platform for the Last Two

979
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,800
Three years. so and you are one of the first

980
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,560
people who are breaking

981
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,000
That. The other alternative to podcast was

982
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,480
Dhruvarati charming Mars. That genre.

983
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,200
I think it's going to be this two Jonas.

984
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,400
Deep Infotainment and Deep Experiential

985
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,480
Content that will grow a lot.

986
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,960
but i do think that both require a lot of

987
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,560
Skills. so if someone wants to crack the

988
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,880
The YouTube game they're going to have to upskill you

989
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,720
Lot. Like you need to know writing. you need

990
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,520
The Editing You Need to Know How to Use AI

991
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,760
Tools Efficiently. ah too many things that

992
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,200
Play. so i think it is going to be hard

993
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,520
But for people who are skilled. it's going to

994
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,760
Be a smooth process. if they are willing to

995
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,200
put themself in the diet position and I

996
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,359
Feel that you need originality. now like like

997
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,000
In the podcasting space we see that a lot of

998
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,160
people copy each other because there is that man that

999
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,480
Happens to any YouTube space but in

1000
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:13,839
what's going to happen now

1001
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:16,800
ah i think copying wont be possible i think

1002
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,960
I Completely Agree or I Completely Agree

1003
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,319
I think what the next future of

1004
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,040
YouTube is there it is going to be the

1005
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,079
Creators who stand out are going to be

1006
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,480
So different in one thing. either it is

1007
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,880
Research, whether it's the way they're editing,

1008
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,880
Here It's the Way That They're Going On

1009
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,520
Ground, or else it is the camera skills

1010
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,920
That they have. out of all these things something

1011
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,200
they are going to master so much that it's not

1012
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,599
Replicable et al. and only when you are

1013
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,240
with in

1014
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,800
doz, set highest of doz creators is

1015
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,960
When you will be able to be the benchmark,

1016
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,280
otherwise you are lost in the midst of

1017
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,520
Everything. Yeah. I feel like not just for

1018
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,920
podcast. The over saturation has happened in

1019
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,359
All Categories. Weather It Is Vlogging, Weather

1020
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,000
It is entertainment, weather it is news,

1021
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,480
Wether it is geopolitics, do you remember

1022
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,880
Three years ago when Covid hit.

1023
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,240
Geopolitics was really a buzzword. End

1024
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,119
Finance and finance was such a buzzword. For

1025
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,839
Short form finance so much. we saw so many

1026
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,400
Finance Creators Coming Up and Then SEBI

1027
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,800
did whatever they had to do and then

1028
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,280
Finance Creators Found It Very Difficult

1029
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,280
Two

1030
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,800
Sustain. I Feel Like What I Do Is Not

1031
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,760
It's all replicable. because it requires

1032
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,240
A lot of time. be it requires a lot of

1033
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,319
Economical sustainability to do. see it

1034
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,240
Requirements

1035
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:49,280
Your own mental, physical, emotional

1036
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,000
Presence. how long am I going to do it

1037
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,520
for god knows but to replicate that I think

1038
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,480
is very difficult and that's why it

1039
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,400
also stands out till little bit or i

1040
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,720
Think I had this conversation with Ganesh

1041
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,720
from thing school and some version of this

1042
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,040
conversation with nitish bhai as well nitish

1043
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,440
Rajput basically uncomprehending content is what

1044
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,839
will flourish in the next face yes because

1045
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,400
YouTube has seen so much I also think

1046
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,880
Audiences Use YouTube from a Perspective

1047
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,440
of wanting something different and wanting to

1048
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,680
Be Challenged Internally. i think up till now

1049
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,480
The Last 10 Years It Was Mainly, He Let Me

1050
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,319
Gather Information. which ended in this hole

1051
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,960
Podcasting Wave. now there is so much

1052
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,800
Information in everyone's heads is what people want

1053
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,040
To be challenged now. they don't just want to

1054
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,960
Absorb. A I think your content is very

1055
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,520
Challenging content. it challenges you to think

1056
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,079
About your life. Yes. i also think that

1057
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:44,880
For a long time, Indian creators thought

1058
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:47,920
Of their audience dumb. like they thought of them as

1059
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,359
an audience that needs to be spoon fed and

1060
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,839
needs to be talked about in the words we are

1061
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:57,760
very important for either by hyperbole tell

1062
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:01,319
Or will you treat me like a child and talk to me?

1063
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,920
I will over explain everything to them

1064
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:06,160
I think our audience is now very

1065
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,680
smart like they know the basics of what is

1066
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,440
Happening in the country they can get that

1067
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,040
Infection from Twitter because Twitter has

1068
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,800
also became a news platform they also

1069
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,240
Get that information from Instagram because

1070
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Instagram has also become a news

1071
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,200
Format. Like, they are getting the news very

1072
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,720
Easily from other formats. so now what

1073
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,319
YouTube Long Form Will Require Is Too

1074
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,559
build upon that a layer which is not

1075
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,599
Available easily in other formats.

1076
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,880
Perspective Perspective. give them something

1077
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,119
that they can share with them

1078
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,440
Friends after words. Like But One

1079
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,920
the question i was asking from you was how did you

1080
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,280
Use short form? how did you use reels,

1081
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,839
Instagram, Shorts to Get People to Watch

1082
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,800
Long Format Es Well? the way i look at

1083
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,200
Short Content Each short content piece has to

1084
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,359
Be Treated as Its Own Spectacle and You

1085
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,400
Do the best with that. there four they will get

1086
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,040
The Max Algorithmic Reach. and then that

1087
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
Algorithmic Reach Trans May Be Translates

1088
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,520
To your long form. i don't think everyone

1089
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,280
Who sees all your short content pieces

1090
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,960
Transitions into Watching the Long Form

1091
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,559
Grind. Hmm. ah and i do think that's the man

1092
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,240
purpose we are doing podcasting in the

1093
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,960
Modern Days to Actually Hack Everyone

1094
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,280
Short Content Algorithms. hmm i think

1095
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,359
Podcasting as a skill is very difficult

1096
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,240
To Crack In The Long Term People Think It's

1097
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,119
easy that just sit but when u put al social

1098
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,319
Media Logic Intuit It. it's not i think

1099
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,359
Content Always Works on Demand and

1100
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:33,200
Supply as a situation. Right Now the Supply

1101
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,240
of podcasts is more than the demand of

1102
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,640
podcast. so all the top people will keep

1103
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,480
Getting Views and Will Keep

1104
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:46,599
Growing. the problem they are facing is that

1105
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,599
We are running out of guests in India?

1106
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,119
How Many People Are Actually Podcast

1107
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,760
Material. so many people are getting over

1108
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,760
Exposed. So here you go global. and you

1109
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,760
Continue a podcasting game. and you play some

1110
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,319
Another game. and at least what I have seen

1111
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,240
Over the last decade of YouTube being. I

1112
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,400
always think it's place of more play a new

1113
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,319
game. like it's just what they're keeping

1114
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,760
Reinvention is too important in the long run

1115
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:12,000
Term. So that's just what I think. Got

1116
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,720
It. and i am curious to see what

1117
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,359
What happens in the next phase? Got it. Now

1118
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,359
how do you build

1119
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,839
Fathom? In the Next Year, How Do You Build

1120
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:27,839
Fathom? I was talking to the YouTube partner

1121
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,920
manager and she gave me an inside which made

1122
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,559
I am very sad.

1123
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:38,000
it is like the views that we only get some 10

1124
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,359
15% off it are recurring views. so even two

1125
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,160
there are great views the recurringness of it

1126
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:46,640
It is very less. and i think that's that number

1127
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,359
Needs to increase. People Need to Keep Coming

1128
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,280
Back. Keep coming back, keep coming back. But

1129
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:54,640
for a category like ours it's very

1130
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,160
Difficult because to a large extent people

1131
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,280
are watching what i am creating basis the

1132
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,319
topic like they are interest they are very

1133
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,480
Clickbaited by that intriguing thumbnail

1134
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,920
the image in that thumbnail that title the

1135
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,520
Introduction Versus When People Are Watching

1136
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,640
Vlogs they are so deeply involved that

1137
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,800
Everyday they will just watch us for 15 minutes

1138
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,640
what happened in her life what happened in

1139
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,680
His Life Is the Same When It's Just a Talk

1140
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,920
show where people are talking about it or else

1141
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,920
react videos if or if

1142
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,119
If gaming happens then there is very little effort in it

1143
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,559
it seems you are doing this with the intention of loving it

1144
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,800
Most of the views I am getting are from

1145
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,440
The views are coming

1146
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:42,079
are from new

1147
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,640
audiences and I think what changes that is

1148
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,640
When I Build a Community Where I Am

1149
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,920
also talking to them like what i will

1150
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,559
what to try to do in the coming one year is i will

1151
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,480
try to take up topics which are being

1152
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,480
Suggested by my comments section. I will

1153
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,119
Give them a shout out in the video itself. I

1154
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,359
Will there be some people on the ground.

1155
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,359
By the way we have amazing people we work with

1156
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,359
On ground. like most of the people that

1157
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,839
Follow us we reached out to them only. Give

1158
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:13,119
Become our on ground producers. so to

1159
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,359
Build up a human connection like that. And

1160
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,319
To come on more lives, to be just more

1161
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:21,760
Authentic like to just be more present,

1162
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,760
Real, Authentic That's What I Think Needs to Be

1163
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,480
Figure it out. For example, what I mean by

1164
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,440
that is in a way whatever you are creating

1165
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,839
It needs to have a vlog element into it.

1166
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,040
Even like a podcast doesn't have a vlog.

1167
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,480
like a

1168
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,319
unscripted you are not being put into a

1169
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,760
Raw situation. Which is out of your control.

1170
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,760
This is a very controlled environment.

1171
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,800
That is where the vulgarity of it comes. So

1172
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,520
You need to bring some runes, some reality into you

1173
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,000
Your content to build fandom. I feel you

1174
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,280
Think Vlogs Will Survive Long Term? No

1175
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,200
No? no i think vlog style

1176
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,440
Documentary Might Self. Yes. I think

1177
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,720
That's the new genre. but you know, there is

1178
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,520
Lots of channels which analyse. Yes. So,

1179
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,440
I think this is just an attempt. I C

1180
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,720
sony channels have 200k and 100k

1181
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,079
Analyzing why a YouTuber had a

1182

The Downfall Why Bollywood Is Falling Or You Need To

1183
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,359
be in a position of authority to put that out

1184
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,680
Kind of Content and Those Are Just Opinions

1185
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:35,359
That is what you feel that is not the gospel

1186
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,440
truths yes i think that there needs to be

1187
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,599
Sum Sort

1188
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:42,720
Off

1189
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:46,200
ingenuity greatness uniqueness rawness that

1190
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,200
you need to bring whatever it is through to

1191
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,040
yours how you are handling the camera how you are

1192
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,359
Telling the Story How You're Putting the

1193
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,119
thumbnail whatever there are so many things

1194
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,040
That goes into making a YouTube video

1195
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,040
Grab one of those things and use it your way

1196
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,480
do it differently and do it the best

1197
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,880
It's possible that I think I'll survive in a way

1198
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,200
Like for example if we have to say we see

1199
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,359
Apuvaa growing so much right there is

1200
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:14,480
No genius videography in it there is no

1201
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,960

1205
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,800
the end that story has to be told in a way

1206
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,319
that people get written till the end and then she

1207
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,640
Crack That vs There Are a Lot

1208
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:36,720
Of Ranveer Singh there are 40-40 million views on

1209
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,119
The videos that people from the South are making

1210
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,280
And there are full-fledged films they feel like

1211
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,359
Films on YouTube and They Have Cracked

1212
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,520
Cinema Dev Cracked The Story Telling. So

1213
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,760
That works. What we have cracked is an

1214
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,000
on ground journalistic on ground

1215
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,760
Vlogging is a sort of category which might

1216
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,400
work. on ground documentary which

1217
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,319
Might work. so, whatever you can fit into

1218
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,400
In that narrative will work.

1219
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,920
Little random question. Please tell. are in touch

1220
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:11,200
With your college friends? Yes. yes, i am in

1221
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,599
Touch With. And you are 97 all, right. So 27

1222
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,680
Years old. 27. So When You Meet Yours

1223
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,359
College friends, do they understand how much

1224
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,280
Are you changing? and the second question is

1225
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,280
what are the changes because of all this

1226
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,880
Experience. Like on a human level,

1227
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,440
When you are going to Dharavi, when you

1228
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,720
going to that -60 degrees place in the

1229
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,520
Hills, wherever, ah how have you

1230
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,160
Changed on a human level? every video

1231
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:41,040
changes me, when I come back from a

1232
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:44,559
Shoot, I'm a different person, every time.

1233
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,000
I feel that it gives me the strength to not

1234
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:51,520
worry about my worries because my worries are

1235
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,559
nothing. hum we live in a country ranveer ware

1236
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,319
The Reality Is Very

1237
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:59,920
Bad. I do get comments. We people

1238
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:02,799
a video whenever we release any video the

1239
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,720
Majority of the comments we get is I used

1240
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,880
to think my life is difficult but this is

1241
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,599
Crazy. Perspective Building Content.

1242
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,280
changes your reality completely shifts all

1243
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,640
together but to answer your question of when

1244
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,000
i meet my friends what do they think

1245
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,839
recently i met a school

1246
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,160
friend and she was saying to me that if

1247
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,640
anyone from our school could be doing this

1248
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,760
we knew it was

1249
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:34,000
you because you know these over achiever kids in

1250
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,960
Schools who would be participating be

1251
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,599
Everywhere I Was

1252
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:42,559
that even in my college i got the best in

1253
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,680
Dramatics Award. I was the topper in my

1254
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,000
Class while doing dramatics. even in

1255
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:52,319
My Masters I was the best student.

1256
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,040
and so people new i just fear that there

1257
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,680
there will be a day where everything will break

1258
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,000
Down. in the sense i fear that i will have a

1259
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,839
Massive breakdown. and then i will be

1260
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,640
Paralyzed to not work at all. and that's

1261
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:10,559
a deep fear i have because i drive a lot

1262
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,880
of my sense of identity from my work

1263
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:17,880
and it's a bad thing to say but I derive a

1264
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,880
Lots of dopamine from the views I get |

1265
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:26,240
From the comments that I get | and its

1266
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:29,040
Not bad friend, it's fine. yes i mean

1267
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,400
who feels it is necessary or you know when this

1268
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
controversy when i could not create

1269
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,359
content because sc head told not to

1270
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,520
Create what? I was what would you do? I

1271
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,839
Vaj take some sleep. I was so low not because we

1272
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,799
creating vert just because i wasn't

1273
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:46,000
Working. I'm very used to being at

1274
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,680
work. Keeping my mind active. Yes. I

1275
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,599
think that was the saddest i've been in 10

1276
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,359
Years. Because I have my hands towards you. Eye Kudnant

1277
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,040
Release Anything Couldn't Work. and also

1278
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,839
When You're Not Releasing Things, You're Not

1279
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,760
In touch with where your audience is. so i felt

1280
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,520
like as an island alone and some plane head to

1281
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,119
Come in like rescue. That was the feel. how

1282
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,520
did you feel when you put that first

1283
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,640
Video out after the controversy? it's

1284
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:10,160
Thinking about the second video.

1285
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,640
I get that. Putting Intensity Ends Two

1286
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,079
thinking because also it was true it was true

1287
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,680
Weird situation, man. you know like, we are

1288
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,000
Not PR professionals. I am N

1289
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,240
Engineering Grad. I live life like an

1290
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,200
Engineer. So I had to engineer the situation.

1291
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,760
and honestly it was a bill back like so much

1292
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,160
has been lost. Feels very tough and dry

1293
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,520
Now. now i'm just going to create the

1294
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,359
Content That I Really Really Want How Do You

1295
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,599
What do you think journalists feel about you? I I have a

1296
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:41,200
Lots to Say Likes About How Journalists Feel

1297
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,440
about me which I got to know at last

1298
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:47,680
Three Months and I Think People Who Can Read

1299
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,920
Between the lines understand what happened.

1300
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:55,040
Yes. I know no matter how correct I am. Annie

1301
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,160
Day can come where I'll become a headline. Gate

1302
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:01,680
tossed around my image will be in all the

1303
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,480
News Memes Pages Etc No Matter How

1304
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,200
correct i am you ready for that reality

1305
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,920
yes and if I'm in this field I have to

1306
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,359
be mentally anybody who is in this field ranvir

1307
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,640
you will know this has to have

1308
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:20,799
That Very Strong Army Mama Mindset

1309
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,920
that come at me bro come at me what people

1310
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,799
don't understand come at me but having said

1311
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:30,079
that's that i also do a lot of background

1312
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,400
Work on Any Sentence That We Say Have to Have

1313
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,559
Three fact check sources. any information

1314
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,799
that we put out has to cross certain

1315
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:42,799
Systems and Procedures and I Can't

1316
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:44,960
be untrue and unauthentic to the audience that

1317
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:47,599
I am talking to you. we have very strong

1318
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,720
Systems to ensure that. a lot of the time

1319
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:54,240
We get a lot of sponsorship deals by

1320
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,240
very big business houses and then that nay

1321
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,559
And we have worked also but then the narrative

1322
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,119
has to be there way we have to tell the story

1323
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:04,079
That they have to tell I love YouTube I think

1324
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,200
YouTube is the way forward for any format

1325
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:10,720
of Content Weather It Is Podcast Weather It Is

1326
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:13,440
Radio Weather It Is TV There Is I Think

1327
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,760
Now in the US there is 50% off YouTube

1328
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:20,960
Being consumed on television isn't that

1329
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:23,280
beautiful like we have seen when we make

1330
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,760
Beautiful Videos of the Ones That Have Drones

1331
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,200
Shots and Talks About Positivity

1332
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:33,200
Viewership is more on TV than on mobile

1333
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:37,040
phones and that was unbelievable for me but

1334
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,760
now it is true i also think that people you

1335
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,880
no why i am

1336
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,280
saying journalists should learn from

1337
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,559
me is

1338
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:53,000
because people will pay me in our last video

1339
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:57,280
we got ₹1 lakh just super thanks us

1340
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:00,160
People gave ₹40 each but which other creator

1341
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:04,640
in india is getting direct pay for there

1342
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:08,000
Content Accept Kunal Kambra When When

1343
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:10,240
he puts stuff on youtube again what you

1344
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,079
said no that you need a little mamba mentality

1345
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,079
Tiger Mentality in Content I Think Most

1346
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,920
Content creators have it that's how they do it

1347
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,920
Reach that point. Family Usually Don't

1348
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,440
Understand. The family get very scared.

1349
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:29,440
Yes. I think that we are at this junction in

1350
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,520
Content creation where any media other than

1351
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,599
YouTube, Instagram are against content

1352
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,079
Creators. I am jealous. Content Creators

1353
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,559
How are you getting so many views? Utters

1354
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,720
How are you getting these views? so one one

1355
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:46,160
there is jealousy and there is a there is like

1356
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:49,200
Traditional Media Is Looking for Ways to

1357
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,599
Jump on Any Controversy That Happens For

1358
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,040
Any Sort of Content Creator and the Minute

1359
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:58,160
anything happens all of them will use the faces

1360
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,480
of the content creators and will try there

1361
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,559
TRAI wants their TRP to increase. Whether he

1362
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,880
The smallest thing will become the biggest thing

1363
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,160
It will be. do you think it's a combination of

1364
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,880
Jealousy as well as a clickbait. because when

1365
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,640
You have a famous content face, yes. you just

1366
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,720
Get More Click. I think there are three things.

1367
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,119
One is jealousy, one is clickbait and

1368
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,839
The third thing is that now the creators are so

1369
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,480
It has become important, right? what does that mean?

1370
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:26,119
what that means is my video is getting

1371
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,440
More Views Than Any News Traditional News

1372
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:32,799
Channel. what that means is there was before

1373
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,240
Dec. It happened only once when with AIB

1374
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:38,000
The scene happened. Isn't it? when they

1375
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,839
It was sent to the legal court. Before this

1376
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,920
Content creators are not that relevant

1377
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,000
Were. what is happening now that you

1378
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,160
all

1379
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,040
which if your prime minister is going to a

1380
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,520
Content Creator and Giving a Podcast That

1381
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:54,400
Means something. that means this is the form

1382
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:58,079
Of distribution that people are wanting.

1383
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,240
your idolizing earlier the idols were your

1384
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,000
Shahrukh Khan, Your Salman Khan, Big Screen

1385
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,640
People and your Virat Kohli and your

1386
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,680
Cricketers they are there but a second level of

1387
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,640
worshiping has also begun which is your

1388
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,119
Content creators. They are accessible content

1389
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:18,000
Creators. Like I can be like him. I

1390
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,000
Feel like this is very good till the time. I

1391
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,520
Am seeing you in a particular way. you are

1392
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,920
Dressing the Way. The way I want you to dress

1393
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:27,680
The Things I Want You To Say. The Minute You Say

1394
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,720
something which doesn't really match what they

1395
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,280
The general sentiment of the public is they will hate

1396
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,160
on you they will spit on you they will leave anyone

1397
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,319
and that can happen any time hmmm so

1398
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,559
Content creation has become important

1399
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,720
Now people come to attack him. Do

1400
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,960
you look at yourself as one of the countries

1401
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,200
best journalist because that's how a lot of

1402
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,440
People are looking at you. journalism is a

1403
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,920
Very heavy word. but don't you think what you

1404
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,839
Doing is journalism? Ok. here is what

1405
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,200
I think. When you study in a media

1406
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:00,160
school i studied in a media school we were

1407
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,839
That's a particular definition of journalism.

1408
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,839
What It Means to Be a Journalist Is

1409
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,839
When You're Not Putting Your Reality, Your

1410
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,839
experiences, your truths in to the

1411
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:10,240
The stories you are telling. but that's not

1412
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,240
Possible. That's not possible. Exactly,

1413
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,640
That's not possible. So, in the conventional

1414
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,760
Definition of what journalism means, what

1415
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,160
Documentary Means, I'm Not That

1416
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:22,319
conventional i do not match those conventional

1417
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,160
Definitions of journalism and of

1418
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,200
Documentary. but a new form

1419
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,559
Documentary, New New Age Journalism.

1420
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,720
yes i think that is what i am doing

1421
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,039
Journalist should be doing. what are media

1422
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,920
Houses should be doing. i am doing it in a

1423
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,760
Much Smarter Way. many more people are watching

1424
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,240
what i am doing then most of the

1425
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,400
Journalist in this country. I think your

1426
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,039
Works Actually Impacting the Country. I

1427
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,200
Agree Its

1428
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:54,160
Impacting a Young Girl in Class Third Hus

1429
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,480
Parents are behind her to leave education

1430
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,799
Get married. I am inspiring that girl.

1431
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,760
I am inspiring an aspirant who is

1432
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:04,880
About to give up on his journey of SSC.

1433
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,359
I am inspiring any MBA female

1434
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,440
Graduate who wants to take up business. hh

1435
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:12,000
is thinking of being a female solo

1436
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,640
the entrepreneur who does not come from

1437
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,160
Entrepreneur.

1438
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,400
Background I'm inspiring a lot of

1439
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,520
people and my existence is very

1440
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,160
Inspiring. I do think that.

1441
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,799
i also think that you said that my content

1442
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,000
Feels Like Journalism. i also look at

1443
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:33,039
My content s on ground podcast. or or

1444
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,240
In the sense that human stories yes. Like

1445
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:39,200
What you ask your guess in a room. My

1446
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,440
Guests are on the ground. Yeah. and my

1447
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,240
Guess might not be the biggest CEOs, biggest

1448
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,160
Creators, the biggest brand builders. But

1449
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,680
they have stories of their own that they are

1450
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,680
Waiting to tell. And you love it Ranveer. when

1451
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,079
you go on ground, the minute you just put a

1452
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:56,920
mic in front of people

1453
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:59,240
You will very nice stories. yes, very nice

1454
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,240
story.

1455
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,000
hmm ya, this if I'm saying, you know, I

1456
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,400
I want to make you sit down and just learn

1457
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,319
From you. Hmm. a i also feel that more

1458
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,160
People Need to Take Up Long Form Content in

1459
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:14,400
The Country. This Is Where You Can Actually

1460
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:19,119
Create an impact. Yes. like some numbers i

1461
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:22,400
would want to share we released a video on

1462
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:26,240
The Biggest Dumping Ground. in one day it

1463
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:29,680
Had 2.5 million views. A 20 minute video.

1464
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:33,520
Who would have imagined? so the point that there

1465
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:36,799
is an audience if you are able to find an ish

1466
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:39,280
Which is different and find the smart way

1467
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:42,480
of doing it there is an audience and i would

1468
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:46,480
Let's find out less than you've ever studied

1469
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:50,039
Apuwas Content Yes She Is A Great Writer

1470
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:53,680
yes and her audience is a lot younger

1471
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:56,640
Girls what is your audience on YouTube or

1472
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,440
Instagram both overall very different on both

1473
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,760

of audiences of Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai,

01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,680
Very tier one audience. Instagram is this

1480
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:23,200
Premiere Wants to Watch the Best Quality

1481
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:26,640

1482
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,920

01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:43,799
Patna. even two the content is the same we have

1488
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,160
Long Format on YouTube not on

1489
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:48,480
Instagram. I love to talk about this.

1490
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,119
Instagram in general is a page which is a

1491
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,039
Share page. like right you watch something on

1492
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,680
Instagram You Instantly Send It To A

1493
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,559
Friend because you relate to it. you think oh

1494
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,480
he is a there some joke that you had running

1495
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,240
Between the two of you. will be able to relate

1496
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,119
To it. I will share. I will share I will

1497
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,440
share. On YouTube you can't share stuff. You

1498
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:11,119
Have to click share, copy that link, go to

1499
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:13,280
WhatsApp, paste that link. Not happening.

1500
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,960
Instagram is also a social media

1501
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,880
The Platform Where You Are Connecting With

1502
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,120
Friends, people who you are talking to

1503
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:23,120
Everyday. YouTube is not that. YouTube is

1504
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:27,040
More of a search engine platform. a so you

1505
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:29,279
Have to tailor the content on YouTube from a

1506
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,239
Retention point of view. means that you have to

1507
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,719
make sure that you get the people you make them

1508
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:37,120
Stick Versus On Instagram It's More Like

1509
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:40,480
what you do. Personal Stories, Relatable

1510
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:44,600
Content, Emotional Content, Getting the Hook Right

1511
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:47,799
And then ah being true, authentic etcetera.

1512
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:51,920
Ah yes. i also think

1513
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:55,040
what apuva does brilliantly she doesn't just

1514
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:58,799
She Has Viewers She Has Fans

1515
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:01,440
like everybody will know her catch phrases hello

1516
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:06,159
Little red flags is something that I will

1517
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:08,640
feel proud of in associating with or

1518
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:11,440
Kalishi is a word that she will keep on

1519
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,600
repeating | so that's one layer deeper right

1520
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,319
Where You Are Not Just the Building Views You Are

1521
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,239
Also Building Fandom | hum hum how do you

1522
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:22,199
Build fandom? how do we do

1523
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:25,440
Yes good question. I

1524
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:29,040
think there is a type of content which will

1525
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:32,560
get you views and i think 70% off your

1526
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,560
The content has to be that. but then 30% is for

1527
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,880
Two things. either you build your brand through

1528
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,719
It. Like you talk about how to get views?

1529
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,400
How can you become the next best editor?

1530
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,279
How can you become the next best

1531
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,640
Youtuber? and then 10 20% is also yours

1532
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:49,839
Personal story. believe me ranveer every time

1533
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,080
I don't do educational stuff I do stuff like

1534
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:54,159
Why is my hair short? this my guy

1535
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:57,840
Is. This is my best friend. this is my team

1536
01:09:54,159 --> 01:10:01,679
Going to do. that works even more than indian

1537
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:04,239
The audience is more realistic in the truest sense.

1538
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,159
Everything Bigg Boss. Yes. everything is big

1539
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:09,679
Boss. That's why vlogs work. thats

1540
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:11,760
Why Ah Reality TV Works. because give

1541
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,480
Want to know what do I eat? what do i

1542
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,440
Drink? Who am I sleeping with? who am I

1543
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,080
are you my friends? And that's important.

1544
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,440
because if you don't show that then those people will

1545
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:26,480
get that same content from someone else

1546
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:28,159
well. but if you have got them through your 70%

1547
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,120
Of the content which you have made. you have now

1548
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:34,239
Gotta get them. But to retain them. to tell them

1549
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:36,719
Your human side also. which i also

1550
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:39,920
Think is the barrier to entry for a lot of

1551
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,239
Women because doing what isn't easy. Hmm

1552
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,159
telling about your family, telling about

1553
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:48,719
Your Relationship, Telling About Your Team

1554
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:53,320
takes a level of comfort which is not

1555
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:56,120
Which Not a Lot of Creators Are Okay With

1556
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:58,400
then you know there is this

1557
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,640
There's a problem in our country and it's been a

1558
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,000
problem for the last 10 years for sure

1559
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,840
Because 10 years is how long I've been

1560
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,159
Around? But content creation is kind of

1561
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,920
Started five years before me. so for the

1562
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:11,040
The problems in the country in the last 15 years

1563
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,360
Been That Only Men Take Up Content Creation

1564
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,120
in the long term and I've had so many

1565
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,760
Conversations with Guys Where They'd Like Why

1566
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,280
arent girls doing it i also want to know

1567
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,520
this from a girl's perspective of course i

1568
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,320
love to talk about that i think from a

1569
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,080
Business Stands But There Is a Lot More Money

1570
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,760
To be made if you are a female content

1571
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,840
Creator because there are many more females

1572
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,600
Friendly Brands But I've Never Seen One

1573
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,520
Understood Why the Girl Content Creators

1574
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,520
in our country don't take up youtube full

1575
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,679
The time is the way you have done it and you are adding

1576
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,280
That feminine touch to all your videos. What

1577
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:44,239
My question to the bigger audience is would you

1578
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:47,800
Consume female content creators? Like

1579
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:52,080
it's been across industries

1580
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:54,719
Always, will you consume a missing lady's age

1581
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:57,360
Much as you consume a Salman Khan film. Will

1582
01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:00,080
You should be as comfortable flying in a flight

1583
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,719
Where the female is a pilot versus a male is

1584
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,640
A pilot. you have to be okay with listening to

1585
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,199
R stories also. so, you have to be okay

1586
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,120
with letting go of some of the traditional

1587
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,719
Stories That Have Been Told Again and Again

1588
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,640
and again and listen to a perspective

1589
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,480
which is

1590
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,800
Different. when you say that there is much more

1591
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,800
To Earn for a Female Content Creator. Income 

1592
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,960
wouldn't you also say that there is much more to lose

1593
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,760
For a female content creator. The Scrutiny

1594
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:27,520
That we face in our common section is much higher

1595
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:31,520
Then what. in my opinion is much higher than

1596
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,679
What a man Bill. If I were mine if the neck

1597
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,000
The line of my clothes is a little deeper i

1598
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,679
Will get 10 comments on that. if i look at

1599
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
little fatter in a video i will get 10

1600
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,760
Comments on that. If I See My Tattoos Show Me

1601
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,239
Will get 10 comments on that. and then that

1602
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,800
makes me feel he even do i am making

1603
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,760
Content which is much more educational in nature

1604
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,320
and yet that is what is what you are

1605
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:55,840
Seeing I'll be more fine than I won't

1606
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:59,440
Be comfortable in putting that on. but my

1607
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:03,280
Dream My overall dream is to create regional

1608
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:06,400
Female creators who bring out stories of

1609
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:09,040
there places of their experiences that

1610
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:12,800
Will be amazing | I feel that you all are the

1611
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,360
Flag Bearers of New Age Long Form

1612
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Content Creation. I remember telling a lot

1613
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,360
Of my female content creator friends

1614
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,840
that's a very hotspace to be in

1615
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,000
Three years ago. but i didn't see people

1616
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,840
Executing in such direction. Butt Do

1617
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,679
You think what I am saying is correct? And

1618
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,480
I do think what you are saying is correct? I

1619
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,960
also think that to advise anyone and

1620
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,000
Everyone wants to be a content creator

1621
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,840
very just advice to take because you don't

1622
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,560
think ranvir that content creation is very

1623
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:45,679
Physically, Mentally, Emotionally Demanding Age

1624
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,600
A profession. It's like Liborius. Yes. End

1625
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:49,840
It's not short term. like if you have to

1626
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,840
Do it, you have to do it for 20 years.

1627
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,640
Like to be a name and face in that category

1628
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,040
You have to do it for 10 15 20 years. it's

1629
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:03,440
not like ek reel nikla di 10 million views

1630
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:07,679
Have come. Great. No it's not that. so do we

1631
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:10,000
Want women to take that up? I don't know.

1632
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:13,280
Like tell me this. Yes. tell me tell me the

1633
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,400
Girl perspective on this. Yes. I think

1634
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:21,120
What I face as a female very small thing.

1635
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,520
I like colouring my hair but I have done that

1636
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,239
Because when I go on the field people will feel

1637
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,280
Alienated by it.

1638
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:33,159
as it is the presence of a woman in most

1639
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:36,640
Fields on ground are very threatening.

1640
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:39,040
Secondarily short hair again threatening. in that

1641
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,120
If you colour it too then it will be even more threatening

1642
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,199
Will go. A Lot of Times When We Go On

1643
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,159
Field, people will look at my producers

1644
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:49,920
Eyes not my eyes. it's a cow it's a cow

1645
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:53,040
And women men in our country only are not

1646
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,320
Very Comfortable Talking to Women Eye to Eye

1647
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:59,120
, or i mean you know as a guy when you

1648
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,400
Growing up, especially in our country, you don't

1649
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:05,040
think of a girl's reality unless you have a

1650
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,120
sister you understand a little bit but then

1651
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,520
When You Have a Serious Relationship in Your

1652
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,120
20s and You Have Intellectual Conversation

1653
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,520
and break down things then you realise as

1654
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:16,560
a guy in our country that guy it's not the

1655
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:20,080
Same for girls and guys agrade a lot of

1656
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:23,320
The Times You've Gone on the Field and People Have

1657
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,159
face to face said to us don't record the

1658
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:31,159
women don't record our women don't

1659
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:35,679
Record them without their pallu on don't

1660
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:37,320
record our female kid is that also i

1661
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,640
think this field requires a lot of

1662
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,280
Networking Where I Can't Do This Alone

1663
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:46,320
Being a Content Creator is After All Certain

1664
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,480
The point is there is no solo system. you need a

1665
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,920
Team, you need a great team. to build a

1666
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,320
Great team, you need some core

1667
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,960
Supporters. for that to happen, you need a

1668
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,800
A Little Bit of Masculine Energy Around You

1669
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,600
And you need men to get that job done. it's

1670
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,600
Not when we think of content, we think of

1671
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,199
Most people. I know you don't think about it.

1672
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,199
Because you have so much experience. You Know

1673
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:11,120
This already. people think that being a

1674
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:14,320
Creator is about creativity. I Wood Se

1675
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:16,400
It's only 20% creativity. it's so many

1676
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:19,360
More things. It's so many more things. It

1677
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,640
Has time has to match. Your core team has to

1678
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:27,600
have someone who is the goonda of

1679
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:29,600
Your thing. Your strategies should match. So

1680
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,679
Even when there is lack of women content

1681
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,800
Creator Conversations Are Happening, It

1682
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,239
Happens in one of two ways. There will be a cow here

1683
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,480
Sitting in front of me. who is kind of

1684
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:41,040
Anti women. Yes. but there also guys who are

1685
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:44,000
Just if Ganesh and me are city it's always

1686
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,640
in a place of what can we do to further

1687
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That change hires more female creators in your

1688
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:54,560
Team That's It Like Representation Comes

1689
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,679
From within I think skill house has a

1690
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,440
female lead right | Mahima Mahima is amazing

1691
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,440
, mahima i have seen most of mahimas

1692
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,400
videos and she is doing a great work and

1693
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,280
That I am sure will motivate more females

1694
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:12,040
editors to also apply to this

1695
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:15,120
position i also think creation in general r

1696
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:17,280
Tasks Require Fields Like Editor

1697
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,760
we need videographer we need all of

1698
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:24,360
These are traditionally looked at as male jobs

1699
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:28,239
right is that really

1700
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:31,040
Wrong may not be an editor but with videography

1701
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:34,000
Considering our country and the dangers that

1702
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,560
like i'm sure you want sometimes you need

1703
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,679
that guy onset

1704
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,640
to just be the warden of other men bro i will

1705
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:44,560
Share an Instance With

1706
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:47,520
you and this is a long instance so bare

1707
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,640
With me a little bit okay all of Delhis

1708
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:54,080
Waste is dumped in three dumping grounds

1709
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:56,960
One of them we visited for a video 600

1710
01:17:54,080 --> 01:18:00,960
Trucks of waste is dumped in that single

1711
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:03,520
place it's as tall as 20 floors

1712
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,480
Building is ok and there are lack of people

1713
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,640
Living Around Here Around There and Then

1714
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,360
that is the place which is delhi's biggest

1715
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,199
Vegetable Market, Delhi's Biggest Flower Mandi,

1716
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,679
The Delhi is the biggest vegetable market and

1717
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,440
Delhi is biggest dairy farm. Ok? so all

1718
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,199
Or milk in Delhi is coming from there.

1719
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:22,120
We didn't know that. we just went and we

1720
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:25,920
shooting started in the dairy wala

1721
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:28,239
Area. five men came to the phone from my

1722
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,120
Hand. started deleting all the videos

1723
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:33,040
and started beating the shoot out of my

1724
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:35,600
Videographer. This is really a sheath. when did you do it

1725
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,480
This happen? This happened 2 months ago

1726
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,800
garbage mafia yes this was the dairy mafia

1727
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,960
Delhi we have that audio recorded you can

1728
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,719
pull that out and i was shouting

1729
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,600
screaming asking them to stop they were

1730
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:50,320
not stopping they beat the shed after coming out of

1731
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,880
that man i had to physically come in the

1732
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,040
middle of the two and be like that stop it

1733
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:59,199
and they stopped because i was a female if this

1734
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:01,600
there were two men it would have

1735
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:04,239
stopped and head heaped bean a female

1736
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:08,400
virographer they wouldn't have hit

1737
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:11,280
So the perspective of a male energy is

1738
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:14,480
Required to Ward Off Evil if the Female

1739
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:16,159
you are smart enough they can and you are right you

1740
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,800
are you right i'm just complicating that

1741
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,880
thought a little bit that this was my

1742
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,360
Experience is also what I have learned

1743
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,280
Over 10 Years of Team Building in Our

1744
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,560
The Industry That You Always Need a Combination

1745
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,880
Yes of men and women yes for the best

1746
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,520
creative work to come up i was reading this

1747
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,320
book the other day which talks about how the

1748
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,199
Society around us has been different for males.

1749
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:42,159
Ok? The seat belts in our cars have only

1750
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:45,440
Bean Tested on Male Dummies.

1751
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:47,440
usually the aces and all are studios will

1752
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,800
Be at a temperature which is suitable for you

1753
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:54,880
Male body is not for a female body. Design Of

1754
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:56,560
the world is true that women are not

1755
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,120
Taking like a second class citizen.

1756
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,679
Exactly. All over the world. Exactly.

1757
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:05,120
So ok. And periods are going on brother

1758
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,600
months if men are having periods

1759
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,440
if it were there then by now there must have been a

1760
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,560
remedy for it and there must have been a

1761
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,560
Solve for it? do you you you you you you you

1762
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,840
Think things are getting better? of course give

1763
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:18,719
R. of course i think representation is

1764
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,679
Your solution to anything and everything. Do

1765
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,320
You see more KK creates in five years

1766
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:28,080
Time? Definitely. I think not five years.

1767
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,920
I think they are already there. i also

1768
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,760
Think When We Think of Content Creation We

1769
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:35,440
should not be thinking about big creators

1770
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:40,480
So much. I feel like the future is in Nano

1771
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:44,239
Localized regional authentic creators. Like

1772
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:47,600
Fine how many superstars will you have? You

1773
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:49,600
Also need some artistic stuff. you also

1774
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,719
Need some indie stuff. you also need some

1775
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,880
Bhojpuri stuff. you also need some hyderabadi

1776
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,520
Stuff. so there are so many content

1777
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,600
Creators, Females Who Are Making Things

1778
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:03,040
in their regional language telling their local

1779
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:06,800
Stories Which Need to Come Out More Rather Than

1780
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:08,960
Top superstars in this industry. I

1781
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,440
here you and i agree with what you are

1782
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,600
Saying. but i feel like when you see a kk

1783
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,520
Create at that top level that is the superstar

1784
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,280
The Level It Inspires

1785
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,679
too many girls and its problem

1786
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,239
Inspires a much larger number of girls

1787
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:25,120
Then the artisanal creators. I do I do

1788
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:27,840
I agree to that. But you know, like people say

1789
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:31,360
Isn't it true that behind a successful man there is a woman

1790
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:34,960
it occurs. For me it's the opposite. to me

1791
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:38,280
My backbone opinion is always my

1792
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:42,000
Partners are my best friends.

1793
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:44,719
currently the person who is my producer is

1794
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Also my partner in real life. Mother

1795
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,400
Fionnasse in real life. so you only see me

1796
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,960
In front of the camera. so, he has given me

1797
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,280
That space. He has made all the provisions. only

1798
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,600
kept me safe and gave me that camera

1799
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,000
Space. so the man also can take a little

1800
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,080
absolutely off a back seat and let the woman in

1801
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,159
Their Lives, Female Friends in Their Lives

1802
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,159
To support them. the person who looks at

1803
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:10,080
Monetization for us. Mother

1804
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:12,960
Manager. he joyed us two years ago when i

1805
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:15,520
Was barely making ₹10,000 a month. No

1806
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,320
The brand was coming to us. now he has taken

1807
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,520
Our business to a place where we are 50%

1808
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:23,760
Profitable while having a team of 20

1809
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:27,840
Ficus religiosa. he is ready to leave his government

1810
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,520
Job. That man is AIR All India Rank 20

1811
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,040
doing a government job, he is going to

1812
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:36,239
Leave it for me. hmm so, you need strong

1813
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,040
The Supportive Man in Your Life to Be Able to

1814
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:39,920
For the women to also come forward. do you

Scrutiny. they get a lot of don't go out

1819
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:53,040
After 7:00 p.m. Don't do this with this guy.

1820
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,800
I also think my parents are to thank

1821
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:00,800
For it. They allowed me to stay out with

1822
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:03,600
Boys. they allow me to you won't believe it

1823

01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,760

Same goes for Twitter and Lindin this is a

1847
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,960
The Kind of Content That’s Every Successful

1848
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:16,960
Content creator watches at the beginning or at

1849
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:19,280
There's an intermediate stage. remember even if

1850
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,679
you are disenchanted with the process of social

1851
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,080
Media. Social media is one of two

1852
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,400
Ecosystems and Environments Where You Are

1853
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:29,120
Get to decide your own faith. you get to

1854
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,600
Decide your own results. and it will

1855
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:34,480
always boiled down to your own effort and

1856
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,040
Your own sense of learning. that's why we

1862
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:52,000
About the subject of social media. that was

1863
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,679
