I have seen you in your Long videos, short videos. On Instagram, on YouTube. I have seen you Creating a Space for Influencers Marketing. I have seen you also train Young talents as your courses. so you have Just done everything. you have also been a Part of a lot of memes. been a part of Channel hacking. But Juv Sted. So, means a Lot to be here. thank you so much for calling me here. genuinely very happy to have you here. ah i have to tell you this at the Start of this podcast to be watched by an indian audience in india while you are Doing Hindi content is some other level of a Social Media Achievement So For Anyone Who Is Not Seen your channel I love for you to explain In short what you try covering and why you think that some of the most rich and Powerful people in the country actually Consuming your content. Thank You for Giving Me that question. in one line if i describe what kk created does that is We make the most viewed videos on social Realities of India. we do that across Across Platforms and We Do That Formats. Weather it is long or short, Weather it's Instagram and YouTube. what do I mean when I say that we try to talk about social realities is that sin Childhood, what we have been taught is very Grey is very black and white. Sins Childhood: What We've Been Taught Is Very Black and white. there is a good kid and a Bad kid. There's a boy, there's a girl. Pink is for girls, blue is for boys. there is there is rich and there is poor there is right the ideology there is left ideology but my education my the people i got surrounded will told me that the world is Not that black and white world is so grey what i want to do with my channel is that I want to cover each and every district of india give the mic to the people in those Districts and Let Them Tell There Stories like for example one of the Videos That We Made Which Has Now 10 Million plus plus views which is insane to Think about to have in this category that does many number of views in just two months of It's releasing. We went to dharavi which Is the world's biggest slum. We Spend Five days there and every day we realize that there are so many stories to be told here. There is a story of a woman who has come from a village and living in this big House. Literally this big house. and there are 20 People Living With Her in This Bigger House. imagine like this studio which is i think three times the size of this woman The house is one third the size and there are 20 People Living in That House. That's Dharavi For you. but dharavi is also india's Biggest leather producing market. it's also the biggest plastic recycling Industries of Mumbai. it's a lot of Rappers Are Born With. like gully boy The stories come from there. So What I want to do with my videos is Make the stories about the social realities of India, Culture of India, Geography of India. I should make it in such a way that everyone can see it. so you are right that our what we make is being consumed by people in Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi. but at the same time itâ€™s also being consumed by people in patna, In an Allahabad, in Hyderabad, in all the tears One and Tier Two City. it is being Consumed by people. it is being consumed Bye students who use their parents' phones You are watching our content from. it's Been consumed by teachers. it is being Consumed by aspirants. it is being Consumed by travel bloggers. Enjoying it I mean this is a very exciting journey. Or I told you this outside. but as a content Creator. I'm Inspired to Do the Kind of content you are doing. by actually Going out on the field. and i love this Medium. also i think it's got its own Ahhh Fruits. But I miss going out in the field, Recording the Real Experience of Real Human Beings. also as a content Creator I feel you are able to get the soul of Your place transferred into your videos. Hmm. I Wood Se Don't. I wouldn't say that. Like face trouble? Yes. there is no procedure when you go on Ground. there are so many factors that Can go that are not in your control. I Wanna say one thing before you. I Actually Think you are one of the most talented content Creators have seen it in the last 10 years of Being in this industry and you are hard Working along with the talent. because i have Seen a lot of talented content creators Not actually a take on the long form. and I don't think that's the average person understands how difficult it is to Create a 10, 15, 20 minute video, and keep it The Audience's Retention in the Age of Short Form content. so what are you doing is Very intric and its very real content And you are getting the views. so you are Hitting too many marks. i hope that everybody Content creation on the country sees this Episode. so you are the prototype that i present in front of a lot of young and Older content creators. So Figuring Long Form. ah but very few people are able to do this what you do. now i love you to break Down. perfect. so a lot of things to Break down late. it's only been two years Since I started content creation on my On. The first year was entirely focused on Short form. In 10 Months We Could Gain 1.2 Million Followers on Instagram Geography yes we focused around geography and second Year we pivoted we didn't pivot. Wee Broad Our Scope to Culture. hmm and thats it Exactly a year ago in March 2024 is When We Started Our YouTube Long Format. when i started i new for sure that there were 100 more than 100 people going to say that Short Form Creators Can't Do Long Form like if you are a shorts creator you can not do long format also the space was so saturated because there was already a lots of established figures who are sitting in their houses breaking anything that was Happening Weather It Is Geopolitical Weather it is a finance weather it is a anything in the news news people wood sill sit they had a team of 20 people already and they wood break down that same news after reading four five Six Research Papers. so when we begin YouTube I wanted to know that I wanted to do it in the education rail but i didn't want to To sit at home and do it. because there was so many people doing it Already. And when I vented out I saw a new eye new that this short haired girl is thin C will go to such tough places. this is peepal will think that this is itself an interesting story s well right like you are a character exactly i am the Character So Many Women So Many Men Also relate to that character then when so the the premise was decided that we would go to each Districts of India tell the story through my lens and while at the same time that was the basic thing everything we perfected dude like we spend so much till the The day I began two years ago on the day I came Begin till today. I have all the data fed by My own hands. How many views did you get on the first day? Pay? How many views did you get on the seventh day? How many? Did you get views on the 30th day? How many likes did you get, How many shares came? how many what comments type was it? what was the audience that was watching it? what was the ctr on the First day, seventh day, 30th day. I Come From a mother who is a maths teacher. we sleep That love for data, that love for analysis Comes from her. Yes. so, the second thing that We did respect the platform. So We Figure out the niche that we want to enter into And that's the way that we are going to enter into. The the second thing i did was we respected the Platform. What does YouTube want before Even if you make the best story you will give To get people to click on it. Right? Like as you also said, you still spend a lot of your time thinking about the thumbnail and the Title. i also spend a lot of my time Packaging It. then once they have clicked it the 15 Seconds You Have to Be the Best of your video till today i am the one who seats at the end of the day once the video has Been edited I still sit with it for three Days on my own editing table I spend full Three Days Without Sleeping and Thinking About It What is the 15 seconds. how are we making it the best 15 seconds Possible. And ah not just 15 seconds. 15 seconds This is the beginning of it. if you don't give something new for after every 30 seconds, You are going to lose your audience. and it Sounds very capitalistic. it sounds very scathing that Oh there are tricks and tricks of Detaining the audience. but it's important, Right? like these are stories that should reach so Many people. If we are spending so much money, So much time, so much energy in making those Stories. Why Not Spend Time in Making Sure people watch it. More and More People Watch It's over, people watch it till the end. I also think you are doing the job that journalists are Paid to do. For sure. we get so many Governments saying this is what I want Journalism to be. why is media houses Not covering it. a lot of people this is this Happened not by design. this happened i Think because of my education. what did you Study? ah i went to first a womans College. I did my bachelors from lady Shri Ram College. and Ranveer A Women's College is the best space to be for any female. Because that space is freeing. it freezes You up. you can dance walk talk in whatever the way you want Two. So I went to a women's college. i did My under graduation in english honours. But during those three years of being in a women's college, i was also involved In Theatre. for three years, every year we Wood Do 300 Performances on Ground. So, people think that this is an overnight success that i got 3 million subscribers in just A Year of Doing YouTube. no, i also did Three Years of Street Theatre Where We Were Writing our own scripts. We are the best Directing That Play. we were also Acting in it. We were also making the music of those who play and think about it This is the area where Imtiaz Ali has come From. this is the area where a lot of our Directors have come from. So The Talent There is very rich. and then i did my Masters from India's Best Social Science Institute. So Sir Ratan Tata has built This college called Tata Institute of Social Science which is in Mumbai only where I Learned how to make documentaries. I slept Learned how to hold the camera at what fps Aperture Balancing Rule of Thirds All the Technicalities That Only Videographers Know is what I learned there I also learned how How to Edit in Premiere Pro used to sit and they were so old like those machines was so old ranvir to render a 15 second clip it would take us like 3 hours we would put that on render go out have tea have dinner then come back from plate so i learnt Through the hard way that how do you edit? how do you put the camera and then we were sent on Ground. so during that time there was a Protest happening in Mumbai wherever they are Clearing the R A Forest. i spend a month later documenting just the journey of the Tribals who were living there. who's life was Going to get affected. so skip to now when a lot of people Comment saying this was true journalism is it comes because of my education in guys Areas. when i was breaking down this Podcast with a friend don't be a big fan. V both came to conclude that you are very good With people. and that's what helps you in Your Content Creation Journey. like you're able to Connect very easily to people. Right? Or. I Think I am and like anyone. anybody in this Life is a combination of their parents. Right? like a lot of you is defined by who Your parents are. my mother has been a teacher For the Past 25 Years. every day i have seen That woman who goes to school at 7:00 am. Less Back at 4:00 p.m. again teach for two hours Tuition in home. and then at night check Papers and then repeat that. for 25 years She has been teaching the same subject. End My father is the complete opposite. he will do The Bare Minimum in His Office. he loves to Travel. Am I the one who loves to talk to people. he is The One Who Most Likes Fathers to Say in Your Social Friends are your biggest currency. nothing Everything Else Matters in Life. so i am a Combination of my mother. who knows hard work. who knows everyday doing the same thing Again and again till you have perfected it. And then doing it in some way other than that. And my father is a very social person likes to travel get new Experiences. So Brilliant Parenting bro do they will understand what you are Doing it completely? they don't even understand one thing that has been happening in my Journey but they have been the biggest supporter. My Mother Understands Business. even two hum There are hills. I had never thought that at 27 years of my age i would leave my job, do My own business, I have a private limited at My name. Be Employing 27 Young Individuals in a Country Wear Employment is really a big issue. and be a Profitable. this is, and at the same time Tell stories. which no one in this country Is Telling and Getting Views, in the Long Form at 10 million, it's unimaginable. So, of course, it's unimaginable for them Also. are parents also we have to be a Little kind to them. They are a generation Went from Writing Letters to Then Getting telephone to then getting telephone to then getting 5G now child GPT then AI. they have seen A lot in these small years of being. hmm but yet why i say my parents supported me is because when i left my Job. my mother was the first one who said if you are going to do this do this seriously you Don't have to take anyone's approval, you will be Great at what you want to do and she hum log ne to Ranveer you started 10 Years Ago My Mother Had a YouTube Channel 12 Years ago she was teaching maths in her YouTube Channel My Mother in Her Job Uses AI my mother doesn't work anywhere fancy but she is Just Learning Evolving Try to Know New Things Anytime Our Followers Grow By When two of 100 is 2.1. Two of 2.2 It happens. They are the first one. Whether he It is 12:00 o'clock or 1:00 in the night. they are the first one who will be clicking a Screenshot sending it to the group. Congratulations. Let's have a party. My Father Recently Took Me to His Boss and Said This is my daughter. She is Forbes 30 Under 30. he didn't know what forbes 30 under 30 Means. But he still said it to his boss. Give You are very very proud, excited, loving Parents. you know, i am asking you this Question? because i actually feel you saw the Realities of our country, considering the Places You Visit for Your Documentaries. and you also meet People in South Bombay, South Delhi etc. keeping all those audiences in mind, what Do You Think Is the Future of Content Creation In our country. You think it keeps growing? Content will always stay, the format might Differ, the Platform Might Differ. When there was only newspaper, TV came, people started consuming there News from TV. earlier there were only Books, Mobiles Came, People Started Consuming their books from mobiles. We are in a very interesting space in the format People should look at the content on Instagram The algorithm itself changes every month It remains, it will keep on changing Smart Creators Know How to Evolve change their hooks change their personality change their way of speaking going slow going fast telling about life telling about business But Creators Will Evolve to What It Is That the audience wants smart creators Those will evolve to that. I genuinely think My personal belief is that regional local Creators will grow a lot. i see that with The series that OTTs are offering. For Example Black Warren type which is a series The actors in it, the stories in it it is being told or it is of the double paisa type which This is a series that tells very local stories Are going. Or you can look at this YouTube is offering dubbing feature. It's a small thing. But still the kind of growth That it will see is massive. mr beast joe Now those are our own videos, those are 15 It is being dubbed in 16 languages. My Whenever I see the video of Mr. Beast is it plays in hindi. so and that has been seen A 10% 10% increase in his viewership. So Local Regional Stories Formats Content Will Grow is what I think. also because of AI dubbing. Yes. let me ask you a very Like a straight question. Feel Free to Answer However you want. Why is your YouTube Channel Working So Well in 2025? because i Think a lot, people don't attempt it for long Form thinking that there is no more future In long form. and then you see kavya r Getting 10 million views on videos. So What do you think you are doing right. Hmm. A I am doing what no one else is doing. be i am doing something which is Well it makes no sense. Sustainability Makes It No sense. Financially it makes no sense. Safety wise it makes no sense. so it's Very difficult to do what I am doing. It's not easy being a woman to go to India's Hottest Place, Wettest Place, Biggest dumping ground, it's not easy. So it's just very different from what the The kind of content that YouTube has. seconds, I am doing it very-very systematically. Like I have studied all the Ranveer, you All the studio tours, all the content, Creator, Podcast You Had I Studied Them all. I literally have notes from all the Podcast That You Have Done. and i have done it This is for all foreign creators. I have done it This is for all Indian creators. Third, I work a lot with data. Till From Day one till today, I have noted myself Down number of views, number of likes, number of comments, etsetra. Fourth, I have a Very strong team. like even do you only see me on screen my fiancÃ©e is the one who make sure that everyone is safe we â€‹â€‹have the best Talents My Best Friend Is The One Who Makes Sure that I don't have to talk to any brand that our finances are taken care of I I only worry about creative creativity only worry about videos so to have a Strong team is very fifth eye also think i did it at the right time when the need was there The Need Was More Than Positive Content of complex next content like depth depth very in depth talking to people showing Realities Which Have Not Been Seen I Also think that people think that this is an overnight Success but in some way or the other I have been working with the format of media and video and Optimization for Very Long Like In School I did National School of Drama then I did theater in college then I was working For a lot of internships just writing Vlogs handling seos. I New The There Is No One Video Editing software which i have Not practiced on myself. and above all Of this I think I love making videos. like videos at the end of the day, if i have to tell you ranvir that this is how you get the Maximum CTR. this is how you obtain For retention, this is what thumbnail works, This Is What the Title Works. nothing will Matter if you don't love videos. like i just Want stories to be told. for years Years. like even today tomorrow if i retire I will still be clicking nice videos of My partner putting them out. I love Videos. I'm gonna recap everything you Sed. Ok? first and foremost Originality Creating Content That's YouTube Not seen yet. which is a very very Difficult skill because this is built out of Observational skills. you have to be very Observe to understand this. Second, you are Studying Other Content Creators Who Have Been Around before you in detail. so you can learn From the experiences and mistakes. I slept Think it's a very active part of content Creation. Next, give is the saying that the The best kind of content is the one where the Content creator is taking up the efforts In the place of the audience. i also want to No what Dharavi ends with dumping round. But I am nimble, let me go. Yeah. and i am seeing It is through your efforts. ah so i think you Putting in the diet one extra act of Effort as well as risk. Yes. putting that Risk in the content. next you head Education related to media. you understand Documentary Film Making. You Understand the theory of content creation. people do this over a three year course but in Truth. only learn it through practical Exposure. Ah and finally, I think of you Enjoy it, right? Yeah. then also the team also the time being right yes team number se like playing a team game having a vision yes So treating it with a little business angle at least yes yes I also ask my team members before coming here what is our mote what is it that is our USP what makes a stand apart my teammate shyamvi said that a lot of the times when her cousins come back home they are tired they are cribbing About their company. she said that for her it Feels like the work she is doing is hers. Like she is doing it for herself. It Feels personal. it feels like what she is Doing is making a difference to this entire World. even two she is not even in front of The Camera. She is not even going on ground, She is a community manager. she is just Answering 200, 300 comments a day. and if she Said that's what it means, yah. something is happening which people feel connected to hmm my reading this is as a Content Creator I Feel You Can Go To A Place and capture the essence very well and translate it into screen now i don't what to call this skin i will tell you What to call this script before going too like i was saying making one video takes us a month and a half 45 days to make One Video We Allocate 1.5 Lakh Per Video One It costs Rs 1.5 lakh to make the video. Accept Salaries, Accept Equipments, Accept any other thing. Ok? Now we the people 20 Days Is Just Prey Before Going There work. Research Yes Research Where People think about video no the problem that came have with most creators is that they only Think about data, innovation etcetera. i have a Strong Mentality if you are on YouTube Think Visually. so we already have 50 Visuals in Mind. Story Boarding Story Boarding Which We Want to Take and End Out of those 50 visuals if five are my must have i tell my producers that If These Five Visuals Are Not There We Are not doing this video so my producer who has now spent 20 days in just writing Writing the Perfect Title the Perfect Introduction Writing the P Giving Me the Best Visuals Writing The Perfect We Even Right, who are the people that we can interview? What are the kinds of questions that we can ask ask dum so like before the podcast you You do research on that thing in every video, right? We have done it before as well. then after that we The producer talks to all the NGOs who are Working on the ground. all the ngos that have worked in dharavi we have talked to end then when we are on the ground we are on the Ground for not one day Ranveer we are not on The Ground for Two Days. we are on the ground For Seven Days and Entire Week at 12 Hours Day we are on the ground. just three people but 12 Hours on the Ground is a Lot. Specially Imagine we are doing a video. Indian i Making a video of the biggest desert. literally the temperature said 50 degrees and we War on the ground. we worked on videos Which are like the wettest place. let it Rain It is complete. Nothing is visible Front. Still we are on the ground. Hour Cameras R Rolling. I would love to tell you about it. V Will do that in the Hindi segment Where We Talk About the Stories That Have Come On from the ground. but what you said that you said that I have the art of translating Stories from Ground to Video Its Meticulously plucked soul of the place soul of the place yes and and very very small things that will be the visual what will be the angle we plan that also like angle in the sense that if you want to make that person feel small we will shoot from top if you want to make them feel big we will shoot from the bottom so all of those things are Matic Sully Plunged Out and Then We Came Back We make four versions of the same video and then i sit with it my teammates think i I'm crazy they're not sustainable at all It's just crazy to be working with me hmm but yes it's good it you need to be It's a good idea to grow a little crazy Content Creator I'll tell you my end love my teams you know we are right now a team of 15 full time employees four of them took their first flight in life because of ours Videos. there is a Person who sits in Rajasthan. she is one of The Best Thumbnail Makers in India. she is One of the people I work with Sri Ganganagar There is a place. Sitting there he is my prisoner. He is now forming a team of four people. End She is the one who is making thumbnails for us. Third Eye had a deep mental breakdown. I said to one of my producers, he Listen, after being beaten I don't think we should be continuing this. i don't want my Teammates to be at risk. She Said to Me, Kavya give me one day, I will figure out a solution Out. and she got me the number of the NGOs And then we went again. We were able to go Again because of the talent that she had. The People that she could contact and get us on the Ground. Protection. And we speak Boys protect. hey our brother Meet the girls. He is nothing less your boys From. End like one day someone shared a handbook that Mr. Beast has been created. Ok? this is a hand one of my producer has worked with mr beast in some of the in some capacity and he had the hand that mister Beast gives to every new joinee. So, he Shared that on the group. the next day every member of that of our team had come After reading it. no one had told them to Read it. no one but they had come they red it end Then they came. r videographer got beaten for As a friend. what will you take? And what else will you take? Any Does he give his beating, who comes, friend? Is it the same guy was outside? no this is a Freelancer we have taken. but the person is Ankit Bishad. He is also a hill Is. So but and i think it's the magic that when you Are a small team that gets the vision translated that Energy Energy Gets Translated a Lot to You Learn from each other a lot. Very Key Question. Ok? before you move on into the Next conversation with me. The Question is what makes a great title in thumbnail In 2025 I Love That Question I Can Talk about that question so many thumbnails and titles change with time so what's what The Best Kind of Thumbnails and Titles now got it so I would say that for me I can you talk about me i can't talk about Any Other Category 2.5 Million Views in 24 Hours 24 Hours 2.5 Million Views Yes How I Look at Thumbnails is to Study Outliers. what do we mean by Outliers? this is a very technical term but this is a very very important term for anybody who is now going to become a Youtuber. Whenever you're scrolling through your feed and you find a video by a Creator who you usually don't follow. and yet that has more views than their average number of Views. Just Screenshot That Thumbnail and Keep it. As Your Inspirational What I Call It Is It as an inspirational database because something happened in that video where usually a Creator Would Get 2000 Views But That Gave Them 100k views that's an outlier video so something happened in their title or thumbnail that work so i have a huge bank of just Inspirational Board Now From My Inspirational Board What I Have Noticed is in titles keep it 50 words max 50 Characters Max Doesn't Try To Be Clickbaity Do Not Try To Be Following Anyone sort of format give them what that The video is genuinely about which you can be able to which you will be able to do justice to and do that justice within the first 30 Seconds for example if I say that I am Going to the hottest place in the first frame it myself i'll show the temperature the heat my shoe is melting the moment some animal dies Will show it in the first. So Be Truthful In What the title and the thumbnail is. Thumbnails I think that for me what works is when i show myself in that Space. only three aspects should be only Three components should be in your thumbnail. Do Not over crowded it. think about Contrast, Think About colors. A Lot of Times Creators Make This The Mistake That They Want to Templatize Things. Yes, sure that makes your job easy. so just keep it as simple and as As Impactful as Possible. Study I can a lot of creators have already made Courses have done a lot of YouTube videos Are out on what makes a great title, What makes a great thumbnail. there are a Lots of also strategies like Paddy Galloway is the one who works with mr beast and Who Works With Ryan Rehn. he talks a lot About This on His Twitter. there is also Colin and Samir who do a lot of podcasts With very-very famous creators to follow Them. am john yusufi is a channel name who is a Person who worked with YouTube for 15 years. And now he has become a full time creator Makes content for creators. so follow Creators like that. and it's a very sad Reality to say but 30% of your time should be Spend just the title and thumbnail in a Video. No matter how beautiful that story is is, if people don't click it, what's the Point. we have too many documentaries in India, which are not accessible. and they Good documentaries. Great Documentaries, Amazing Stories But people do not sell themselves, yes. The pizza box matters as much as a pizza. Agree, Agree the Packaging Matters as Much S the thing inside it. At the end of the day, what i am doing here right now is Telling Myself. no one can predict What will happen in the next five years. but i think you can predict what happens In the next six to 12 months. Yes. So What will happen in the next six to 12 Month. Interesting. On Instagram? All three. Let's, let's take one at a time. Yes. Let's take one at a time. On Instagram. here is what i think what will it happen on Instagram? Relatability will always be the The Key for Instagram Relatability is the key. now i don't mean that relatability has to Have a set form format. Relatability Can B Very Meta Conversation. but i will tell you you in the any time we have had content in This country. there are some things that have Always worked. I will tell you why. we play with nostalgia it's always on Is. Why are Cred ads trending these days? Because he said Alka He brought Yaganek along. Ok? So The nostalgia will always last. Nostalgia Cain Be when you talk about things which you Had in your childhood. for example i had lunch break at xxx Time. And that is a shared relatable The Experience That We Have and Also Has Nostalgia attached to it. Ok? Second state pride will last forever because of the people who connect to their nation and connect to their state and connect to whatever dal baati chokha if you say so So Bihari people will come friend. If you If you say Bangalore then people will say Bangalore instead of Bengaluru will come Buddy. If you say Kannada, people will come, friend. So Your Nostalgia One Format Which Also The works is mythbreaking. For For example, South Indians only eat Idly Dosa. Break that myth. tell me something else story. All of these are relatable. This How will you make it relatable? Do this. to me this Looks like these buckets will last. these buckets Are the ones that you talk about. Your Shed The Identity of Being a Submissive Boyfriend. or your identity of being a woman with shot Hair. or your identity of being the elder sister. that elder sisters are crazy About their younger siblings, elder Sisters are parents. and you talk about Being an army kid. you dids shared Realities You Have to Figure Out and Make That Happen Relatable content etcetera. So these shared Figure out the realities. Inside him I Gave five-six buckets. go play with it Will go. Ok? Second, I think that Very good short form films will come out Off Instagram. Have you seen the soham d yes. I love him. He does that brilliantly. Like, I would call them proper films. Or, or. Right? he is the most talented young Director We Have in the Country. Agreed. And I have seen some professional film Directors and he is better than them. Yes. Guys like that need to be given a chance. Agreed. Bollywood will save itself. The Soham Is given a chance. i also think like a lot of these rj, harshi,princy,what they are doing with just one camera are telling Full all. It feels like you are watching a movie I am there in 1 minute. so, even if it will Continue to be Continue to stay short form and it will continue to be done at a Much lower budget and much more frequency. but the The quality will be so refined on Instagram. I genuinely think so. Third I think Yes the pace will come down a bit. Like Slower Content slower content means like Content with feels Content with feels I will feel connected, that means that once upon a time when there were subtitles This is how those times used to come, people wanted it pasta not mail puri yes now they have them in my Papa says cook food on low flame so that's what we are going to do now we will move towards i also think on Instagram Monetarily Brands Won't Work So much with bigger creators as much as they Will work with Nano creators with very Specific niche. or my reading and this is A From Conversation I Had With The Boys and monkey ah i think people at the absolute top, Bindwai will always get work. Second run, It's gonna be a little difficult. Agreed End Then it goes get democratised. because Everyone becomes a content creator. Agreed. But you still need to be of a certain quality Even if democratized. I look at it this like either you are the top 0.1% and you are great anything below you will be struggling and the once below will find Some and the other sort of work. what is 0.1% now? Neel Mohan The Guy of YouTube CEO himself gave this data in one of his Releases 1% of yours get a million views in a month in life time oh so imagine like anyone has a profile right even the people who are commenting have a profile to So many people are claiming to be creators. Out of that, one million people have been. 0.1% Ranveer who are the 1% I think 0.1% are the ones who have been in this game for a certain amount of years who have been in this game for at least three four Years. point 1% are also those who have been True to their morals. like they haven't Worked with waiting apps and they haven't Worked with scams, schemes. Sense Of Long term branding yes. a sense of longing Term branding. Third is people who are Conscientiously Innovating Like I think Tanmay Bhat is god in the indian The ecosystem where he was, he had this IP which is so low effort high rewarding will he will get funny friends of his and just do a live Stream reacting to memes. Convert That into a video. The perfect amazing format that he has Cracked. he also did vogs he also did AI stuff with Varun Maya he also head Some I Think Podcast with Big Basket etsetra and he also has moonshine which is the agency which produces a lot of the AIDS That We Now See on TV. So Innovation In so many levels this has happened. and we also need creators who know when to say No. because as soon as you are 100 type what do you become in this field of yours So many opportunities come your way. Make a course, make merchandise. Hour Focus. yes, you need to be focused on what Is it that you want to do? and the other Things How You Can Delegate and Build Up Systems which can do this for you without you You having to take that earn. Hmm. where Where is the future of YouTube going? YouTube, S, let's talk about YouTube. what do you Think you've been in this for so long. how Persia does YouTube change? how has it changed Over the years? I think YouTube had become a Podcasting Platform for the Last Two Three years. so and you are one of the first people who are breaking That. The other alternative to podcast was Dhruvarati charming Mars. That genre. I think it's going to be this two Jonas. Deep Infotainment and Deep Experiential Content that will grow a lot. but i do think that both require a lot of Skills. so if someone wants to crack the The YouTube game they're going to have to upskill you Lot. Like you need to know writing. you need The Editing You Need to Know How to Use AI Tools Efficiently. ah too many things that Play. so i think it is going to be hard But for people who are skilled. it's going to Be a smooth process. if they are willing to put themself in the diet position and I Feel that you need originality. now like like In the podcasting space we see that a lot of people copy each other because there is that man that Happens to any YouTube space but in what's going to happen now ah i think copying wont be possible i think I Completely Agree or I Completely Agree I think what the next future of YouTube is there it is going to be the Creators who stand out are going to be So different in one thing. either it is Research, whether it's the way they're editing, Here It's the Way That They're Going On Ground, or else it is the camera skills That they have. out of all these things something they are going to master so much that it's not Replicable et al. and only when you are with in doz, set highest of doz creators is When you will be able to be the benchmark, otherwise you are lost in the midst of Everything. Yeah. I feel like not just for podcast. The over saturation has happened in All Categories. Weather It Is Vlogging, Weather It is entertainment, weather it is news, Wether it is geopolitics, do you remember Three years ago when Covid hit. Geopolitics was really a buzzword. End Finance and finance was such a buzzword. For Short form finance so much. we saw so many Finance Creators Coming Up and Then SEBI did whatever they had to do and then Finance Creators Found It Very Difficult Two Sustain. I Feel Like What I Do Is Not It's all replicable. because it requires A lot of time. be it requires a lot of Economical sustainability to do. see it Requirements Your own mental, physical, emotional Presence. how long am I going to do it for god knows but to replicate that I think is very difficult and that's why it also stands out till little bit or i Think I had this conversation with Ganesh from thing school and some version of this conversation with nitish bhai as well nitish Rajput basically uncomprehending content is what will flourish in the next face yes because YouTube has seen so much I also think Audiences Use YouTube from a Perspective of wanting something different and wanting to Be Challenged Internally. i think up till now The Last 10 Years It Was Mainly, He Let Me Gather Information. which ended in this hole Podcasting Wave. now there is so much Information in everyone's heads is what people want To be challenged now. they don't just want to Absorb. A I think your content is very Challenging content. it challenges you to think About your life. Yes. i also think that For a long time, Indian creators thought Of their audience dumb. like they thought of them as an audience that needs to be spoon fed and needs to be talked about in the words we are very important for either by hyperbole tell Or will you treat me like a child and talk to me? I will over explain everything to them I think our audience is now very smart like they know the basics of what is Happening in the country they can get that Infection from Twitter because Twitter has also became a news platform they also Get that information from Instagram because Instagram has also become a news Format. Like, they are getting the news very Easily from other formats. so now what YouTube Long Form Will Require Is Too build upon that a layer which is not Available easily in other formats. Perspective Perspective. give them something that they can share with them Friends after words. Like But One the question i was asking from you was how did you Use short form? how did you use reels, Instagram, Shorts to Get People to Watch Long Format Es Well? the way i look at Short Content Each short content piece has to Be Treated as Its Own Spectacle and You Do the best with that. there four they will get The Max Algorithmic Reach. and then that Algorithmic Reach Trans May Be Translates To your long form. i don't think everyone Who sees all your short content pieces Transitions into Watching the Long Form Grind. Hmm. ah and i do think that's the man purpose we are doing podcasting in the Modern Days to Actually Hack Everyone Short Content Algorithms. hmm i think Podcasting as a skill is very difficult To Crack In The Long Term People Think It's easy that just sit but when u put al social Media Logic Intuit It. it's not i think Content Always Works on Demand and Supply as a situation. Right Now the Supply of podcasts is more than the demand of podcast. so all the top people will keep Getting Views and Will Keep Growing. the problem they are facing is that We are running out of guests in India? How Many People Are Actually Podcast Material. so many people are getting over Exposed. So here you go global. and you Continue a podcasting game. and you play some Another game. and at least what I have seen Over the last decade of YouTube being. I always think it's place of more play a new game. like it's just what they're keeping Reinvention is too important in the long run Term. So that's just what I think. Got It. and i am curious to see what What happens in the next phase? Got it. Now how do you build Fathom? In the Next Year, How Do You Build Fathom? I was talking to the YouTube partner manager and she gave me an inside which made I am very sad. it is like the views that we only get some 10 15% off it are recurring views. so even two there are great views the recurringness of it It is very less. and i think that's that number Needs to increase. People Need to Keep Coming Back. Keep coming back, keep coming back. But for a category like ours it's very Difficult because to a large extent people are watching what i am creating basis the topic like they are interest they are very Clickbaited by that intriguing thumbnail the image in that thumbnail that title the Introduction Versus When People Are Watching Vlogs they are so deeply involved that Everyday they will just watch us for 15 minutes what happened in her life what happened in His Life Is the Same When It's Just a Talk show where people are talking about it or else react videos if or if If gaming happens then there is very little effort in it it seems you are doing this with the intention of loving it Most of the views I am getting are from The views are coming are from new audiences and I think what changes that is When I Build a Community Where I Am also talking to them like what i will what to try to do in the coming one year is i will try to take up topics which are being Suggested by my comments section. I will Give them a shout out in the video itself. I Will there be some people on the ground. By the way we have amazing people we work with On ground. like most of the people that Follow us we reached out to them only. Give Become our on ground producers. so to Build up a human connection like that. And To come on more lives, to be just more Authentic like to just be more present, Real, Authentic That's What I Think Needs to Be Figure it out. For example, what I mean by that is in a way whatever you are creating It needs to have a vlog element into it. Even like a podcast doesn't have a vlog. like a unscripted you are not being put into a Raw situation. Which is out of your control. This is a very controlled environment. That is where the vulgarity of it comes. So You need to bring some runes, some reality into you Your content to build fandom. I feel you Think Vlogs Will Survive Long Term? No No? no i think vlog style Documentary Might Self. Yes. I think That's the new genre. but you know, there is Lots of channels which analyse. Yes. So, I think this is just an attempt. I C sony channels have 200k and 100k Analyzing why a YouTuber had a The Downfall Why Bollywood Is Falling Or You Need To be in a position of authority to put that out Kind of Content and Those Are Just Opinions That is what you feel that is not the gospel truths yes i think that there needs to be Sum Sort Off ingenuity greatness uniqueness rawness that you need to bring whatever it is through to yours how you are handling the camera how you are Telling the Story How You're Putting the thumbnail whatever there are so many things That goes into making a YouTube video Grab one of those things and use it your way do it differently and do it the best It's possible that I think I'll survive in a way Like for example if we have to say we see Apuvaa growing so much right there is No genius videography in it there is no Genius Thumbnail and Title No Retention Technics Etcetra She is Just Cracked How to Tell a Relatable Story in a Funny Story Manor and Keep Retaining Keep Retaining Till the end that story has to be told in a way that people get written till the end and then she Crack That vs There Are a Lot Of Ranveer Singh there are 40-40 million views on The videos that people from the South are making And there are full-fledged films they feel like Films on YouTube and They Have Cracked Cinema Dev Cracked The Story Telling. So That works. What we have cracked is an on ground journalistic on ground Vlogging is a sort of category which might work. on ground documentary which Might work. so, whatever you can fit into In that narrative will work. Little random question. Please tell. are in touch With your college friends? Yes. yes, i am in Touch With. And you are 97 all, right. So 27 Years old. 27. So When You Meet Yours College friends, do they understand how much Are you changing? and the second question is what are the changes because of all this Experience. Like on a human level, When you are going to Dharavi, when you going to that -60 degrees place in the Hills, wherever, ah how have you Changed on a human level? every video changes me, when I come back from a Shoot, I'm a different person, every time. I feel that it gives me the strength to not worry about my worries because my worries are nothing. hum we live in a country ranveer ware The Reality Is Very Bad. I do get comments. We people a video whenever we release any video the Majority of the comments we get is I used to think my life is difficult but this is Crazy. Perspective Building Content. changes your reality completely shifts all together but to answer your question of when i meet my friends what do they think recently i met a school friend and she was saying to me that if anyone from our school could be doing this we knew it was you because you know these over achiever kids in Schools who would be participating be Everywhere I Was that even in my college i got the best in Dramatics Award. I was the topper in my Class while doing dramatics. even in My Masters I was the best student. and so people new i just fear that there there will be a day where everything will break Down. in the sense i fear that i will have a Massive breakdown. and then i will be Paralyzed to not work at all. and that's a deep fear i have because i drive a lot of my sense of identity from my work and it's a bad thing to say but I derive a Lots of dopamine from the views I get | From the comments that I get | and its Not bad friend, it's fine. yes i mean who feels it is necessary or you know when this controversy when i could not create content because sc head told not to Create what? I was what would you do? I Vaj take some sleep. I was so low not because we creating vert just because i wasn't Working. I'm very used to being at work. Keeping my mind active. Yes. I think that was the saddest i've been in 10 Years. Because I have my hands towards you. Eye Kudnant Release Anything Couldn't Work. and also When You're Not Releasing Things, You're Not In touch with where your audience is. so i felt like as an island alone and some plane head to Come in like rescue. That was the feel. how did you feel when you put that first Video out after the controversy? it's Thinking about the second video. I get that. Putting Intensity Ends Two thinking because also it was true it was true Weird situation, man. you know like, we are Not PR professionals. I am N Engineering Grad. I live life like an Engineer. So I had to engineer the situation. and honestly it was a bill back like so much has been lost. Feels very tough and dry Now. now i'm just going to create the Content That I Really Really Want How Do You What do you think journalists feel about you? I I have a Lots to Say Likes About How Journalists Feel about me which I got to know at last Three Months and I Think People Who Can Read Between the lines understand what happened. Yes. I know no matter how correct I am. Annie Day can come where I'll become a headline. Gate tossed around my image will be in all the News Memes Pages Etc No Matter How correct i am you ready for that reality yes and if I'm in this field I have to be mentally anybody who is in this field ranvir you will know this has to have That Very Strong Army Mama Mindset that come at me bro come at me what people don't understand come at me but having said that's that i also do a lot of background Work on Any Sentence That We Say Have to Have Three fact check sources. any information that we put out has to cross certain Systems and Procedures and I Can't be untrue and unauthentic to the audience that I am talking to you. we have very strong Systems to ensure that. a lot of the time We get a lot of sponsorship deals by very big business houses and then that nay And we have worked also but then the narrative has to be there way we have to tell the story That they have to tell I love YouTube I think YouTube is the way forward for any format of Content Weather It Is Podcast Weather It Is Radio Weather It Is TV There Is I Think Now in the US there is 50% off YouTube Being consumed on television isn't that beautiful like we have seen when we make Beautiful Videos of the Ones That Have Drones Shots and Talks About Positivity Viewership is more on TV than on mobile phones and that was unbelievable for me but now it is true i also think that people you no why i am saying journalists should learn from me is because people will pay me in our last video we got â‚¹1 lakh just super thanks us People gave â‚¹40 each but which other creator in india is getting direct pay for there Content Accept Kunal Kambra When When he puts stuff on youtube again what you said no that you need a little mamba mentality Tiger Mentality in Content I Think Most Content creators have it that's how they do it Reach that point. Family Usually Don't Understand. The family get very scared. Yes. I think that we are at this junction in Content creation where any media other than YouTube, Instagram are against content Creators. I am jealous. Content Creators How are you getting so many views? Utters How are you getting these views? so one one there is jealousy and there is a there is like Traditional Media Is Looking for Ways to Jump on Any Controversy That Happens For Any Sort of Content Creator and the Minute anything happens all of them will use the faces of the content creators and will try there TRAI wants their TRP to increase. Whether he The smallest thing will become the biggest thing It will be. do you think it's a combination of Jealousy as well as a clickbait. because when You have a famous content face, yes. you just Get More Click. I think there are three things. One is jealousy, one is clickbait and The third thing is that now the creators are so It has become important, right? what does that mean? what that means is my video is getting More Views Than Any News Traditional News Channel. what that means is there was before Dec. It happened only once when with AIB The scene happened. Isn't it? when they It was sent to the legal court. Before this Content creators are not that relevant Were. what is happening now that you all which if your prime minister is going to a Content Creator and Giving a Podcast That Means something. that means this is the form Of distribution that people are wanting. your idolizing earlier the idols were your Shahrukh Khan, Your Salman Khan, Big Screen People and your Virat Kohli and your Cricketers they are there but a second level of worshiping has also begun which is your Content creators. They are accessible content Creators. Like I can be like him. I Feel like this is very good till the time. I Am seeing you in a particular way. you are Dressing the Way. The way I want you to dress The Things I Want You To Say. The Minute You Say something which doesn't really match what they The general sentiment of the public is they will hate on you they will spit on you they will leave anyone and that can happen any time hmmm so Content creation has become important Now people come to attack him. Do you look at yourself as one of the countries best journalist because that's how a lot of People are looking at you. journalism is a Very heavy word. but don't you think what you Doing is journalism? Ok. here is what I think. When you study in a media school i studied in a media school we were That's a particular definition of journalism. What It Means to Be a Journalist Is When You're Not Putting Your Reality, Your experiences, your truths in to the The stories you are telling. but that's not Possible. That's not possible. Exactly, That's not possible. So, in the conventional Definition of what journalism means, what Documentary Means, I'm Not That conventional i do not match those conventional Definitions of journalism and of Documentary. but a new form Documentary, New New Age Journalism. yes i think that is what i am doing Journalist should be doing. what are media Houses should be doing. i am doing it in a Much Smarter Way. many more people are watching what i am doing then most of the Journalist in this country. I think your Works Actually Impacting the Country. I Agree Its Impacting a Young Girl in Class Third Hus Parents are behind her to leave education Get married. I am inspiring that girl. I am inspiring an aspirant who is About to give up on his journey of SSC. I am inspiring any MBA female Graduate who wants to take up business. hh is thinking of being a female solo the entrepreneur who does not come from Entrepreneur. Background I'm inspiring a lot of people and my existence is very Inspiring. I do think that. i also think that you said that my content Feels Like Journalism. i also look at My content s on ground podcast. or or In the sense that human stories yes. Like What you ask your guess in a room. My Guests are on the ground. Yeah. and my Guess might not be the biggest CEOs, biggest Creators, the biggest brand builders. But they have stories of their own that they are Waiting to tell. And you love it Ranveer. when you go on ground, the minute you just put a mic in front of people You will very nice stories. yes, very nice story. hmm ya, this if I'm saying, you know, I I want to make you sit down and just learn From you. Hmm. a i also feel that more People Need to Take Up Long Form Content in The Country. This Is Where You Can Actually Create an impact. Yes. like some numbers i would want to share we released a video on The Biggest Dumping Ground. in one day it Had 2.5 million views. A 20 minute video. Who would have imagined? so the point that there is an audience if you are able to find an ish Which is different and find the smart way of doing it there is an audience and i would Let's find out less than you've ever studied Apuwas Content Yes She Is A Great Writer yes and her audience is a lot younger Girls what is your audience on YouTube or Instagram both overall very different on both The Platforms on Instagram I Have Five The states that are watching me is Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. So very tier one sort of audiences of Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi and one more which I am forgetting, Very tier one audience. Instagram is this Premiere Wants to Watch the Best Quality and will only watch things which they can Share easily. We are YouTube is your auto Drivers, Rickshaw Drivers, Students Watching from their parents fuss. so on YouTube The City That Is The The City That Is The Highest Is Patna. even two the content is the same we have Long Format on YouTube not on Instagram. I love to talk about this. Instagram in general is a page which is a Share page. like right you watch something on Instagram You Instantly Send It To A Friend because you relate to it. you think oh he is a there some joke that you had running Between the two of you. will be able to relate To it. I will share. I will share I will share. On YouTube you can't share stuff. You Have to click share, copy that link, go to WhatsApp, paste that link. Not happening. Instagram is also a social media The Platform Where You Are Connecting With Friends, people who you are talking to Everyday. YouTube is not that. YouTube is More of a search engine platform. a so you Have to tailor the content on YouTube from a Retention point of view. means that you have to make sure that you get the people you make them Stick Versus On Instagram It's More Like what you do. Personal Stories, Relatable Content, Emotional Content, Getting the Hook Right And then ah being true, authentic etcetera. Ah yes. i also think what apuva does brilliantly she doesn't just She Has Viewers She Has Fans like everybody will know her catch phrases hello Little red flags is something that I will feel proud of in associating with or Kalishi is a word that she will keep on repeating | so that's one layer deeper right Where You Are Not Just the Building Views You Are Also Building Fandom | hum hum how do you Build fandom? how do we do Yes good question. I think there is a type of content which will get you views and i think 70% off your The content has to be that. but then 30% is for Two things. either you build your brand through It. Like you talk about how to get views? How can you become the next best editor? How can you become the next best Youtuber? and then 10 20% is also yours Personal story. believe me ranveer every time I don't do educational stuff I do stuff like Why is my hair short? this my guy Is. This is my best friend. this is my team Going to do. that works even more than indian The audience is more realistic in the truest sense. Everything Bigg Boss. Yes. everything is big Boss. That's why vlogs work. thats Why Ah Reality TV Works. because give Want to know what do I eat? what do i Drink? Who am I sleeping with? who am I are you my friends? And that's important. because if you don't show that then those people will get that same content from someone else well. but if you have got them through your 70% Of the content which you have made. you have now Gotta get them. But to retain them. to tell them Your human side also. which i also Think is the barrier to entry for a lot of Women because doing what isn't easy. Hmm telling about your family, telling about Your Relationship, Telling About Your Team takes a level of comfort which is not Which Not a Lot of Creators Are Okay With then you know there is this There's a problem in our country and it's been a problem for the last 10 years for sure Because 10 years is how long I've been Around? But content creation is kind of Started five years before me. so for the The problems in the country in the last 15 years Been That Only Men Take Up Content Creation in the long term and I've had so many Conversations with Guys Where They'd Like Why arent girls doing it i also want to know this from a girl's perspective of course i love to talk about that i think from a Business Stands But There Is a Lot More Money To be made if you are a female content Creator because there are many more females Friendly Brands But I've Never Seen One Understood Why the Girl Content Creators in our country don't take up youtube full The time is the way you have done it and you are adding That feminine touch to all your videos. What My question to the bigger audience is would you Consume female content creators? Like it's been across industries Always, will you consume a missing lady's age Much as you consume a Salman Khan film. Will You should be as comfortable flying in a flight Where the female is a pilot versus a male is A pilot. you have to be okay with listening to R stories also. so, you have to be okay with letting go of some of the traditional Stories That Have Been Told Again and Again and again and listen to a perspective which is Different. when you say that there is much more To Earn for a Female Content Creator. Income wouldn't you also say that there is much more to lose For a female content creator. The Scrutiny That we face in our common section is much higher Then what. in my opinion is much higher than What a man Bill. If I were mine if the neck The line of my clothes is a little deeper i Will get 10 comments on that. if i look at little fatter in a video i will get 10 Comments on that. If I See My Tattoos Show Me Will get 10 comments on that. and then that makes me feel he even do i am making Content which is much more educational in nature and yet that is what is what you are Seeing I'll be more fine than I won't Be comfortable in putting that on. but my Dream My overall dream is to create regional Female creators who bring out stories of there places of their experiences that Will be amazing | I feel that you all are the Flag Bearers of New Age Long Form Content Creation. I remember telling a lot Of my female content creator friends that's a very hotspace to be in Three years ago. but i didn't see people Executing in such direction. Butt Do You think what I am saying is correct? And I do think what you are saying is correct? I also think that to advise anyone and Everyone wants to be a content creator very just advice to take because you don't think ranvir that content creation is very Physically, Mentally, Emotionally Demanding Age A profession. It's like Liborius. Yes. End It's not short term. like if you have to Do it, you have to do it for 20 years. Like to be a name and face in that category You have to do it for 10 15 20 years. it's not like ek reel nikla di 10 million views Have come. Great. No it's not that. so do we Want women to take that up? I don't know. Like tell me this. Yes. tell me tell me the Girl perspective on this. Yes. I think What I face as a female very small thing. I like colouring my hair but I have done that Because when I go on the field people will feel Alienated by it. as it is the presence of a woman in most Fields on ground are very threatening. Secondarily short hair again threatening. in that If you colour it too then it will be even more threatening Will go. A Lot of Times When We Go On Field, people will look at my producers Eyes not my eyes. it's a cow it's a cow And women men in our country only are not Very Comfortable Talking to Women Eye to Eye , or i mean you know as a guy when you Growing up, especially in our country, you don't think of a girl's reality unless you have a sister you understand a little bit but then When You Have a Serious Relationship in Your 20s and You Have Intellectual Conversation and break down things then you realise as a guy in our country that guy it's not the Same for girls and guys agrade a lot of The Times You've Gone on the Field and People Have face to face said to us don't record the women don't record our women don't Record them without their pallu on don't record our female kid is that also i think this field requires a lot of Networking Where I Can't Do This Alone Being a Content Creator is After All Certain The point is there is no solo system. you need a Team, you need a great team. to build a Great team, you need some core Supporters. for that to happen, you need a A Little Bit of Masculine Energy Around You And you need men to get that job done. it's Not when we think of content, we think of Most people. I know you don't think about it. Because you have so much experience. You Know This already. people think that being a Creator is about creativity. I Wood Se It's only 20% creativity. it's so many More things. It's so many more things. It Has time has to match. Your core team has to have someone who is the goonda of Your thing. Your strategies should match. So Even when there is lack of women content Creator Conversations Are Happening, It Happens in one of two ways. There will be a cow here Sitting in front of me. who is kind of Anti women. Yes. but there also guys who are Just if Ganesh and me are city it's always in a place of what can we do to further That change hires more female creators in your Team That's It Like Representation Comes From within I think skill house has a female lead right | Mahima Mahima is amazing , mahima i have seen most of mahimas videos and she is doing a great work and That I am sure will motivate more females editors to also apply to this position i also think creation in general r Tasks Require Fields Like Editor we need videographer we need all of These are traditionally looked at as male jobs right is that really Wrong may not be an editor but with videography Considering our country and the dangers that like i'm sure you want sometimes you need that guy onset to just be the warden of other men bro i will Share an Instance With you and this is a long instance so bare With me a little bit okay all of Delhis Waste is dumped in three dumping grounds One of them we visited for a video 600 Trucks of waste is dumped in that single place it's as tall as 20 floors Building is ok and there are lack of people Living Around Here Around There and Then that is the place which is delhi's biggest Vegetable Market, Delhi's Biggest Flower Mandi, The Delhi is the biggest vegetable market and Delhi is biggest dairy farm. Ok? so all Or milk in Delhi is coming from there. We didn't know that. we just went and we shooting started in the dairy wala Area. five men came to the phone from my Hand. started deleting all the videos and started beating the shoot out of my Videographer.

And periods are going on brother months if men are having periods if it were there then by now there must have been a remedy for it and there must have been a Solve for it? do you you you you you you you Think things are getting better? of course give R. of course i think representation is Your solution to anything and everything. Do You see more KK creates in five years Time? Definitely. I think not five years. I think they are already there. i also Think When We Think of Content Creation We should not be thinking about big creators So much. I feel like the future is in Nano Localized regional authentic creators. Like Fine how many superstars will you have? You Also need some artistic stuff. you also Need some indie stuff. you also need some Bhojpuri stuff. you also need some hyderabadi Stuff. so there are so many content Creators, Females Who Are Making Things in their regional language telling their local Stories Which Need to Come Out More Rather Than Top superstars in this industry. I here you and i agree with what you are Saying. but i feel like when you see a kk Create at that top level that is the superstar The Level It Inspires too many girls and its problem Inspires a much larger number of girls Then the artisanal creators. I do I do I agree to that. But you know, like people say Isn't it true that behind a successful man there is a woman it occurs. For me it's the opposite. to me My backbone opinion is always my Partners are my best friends. currently the person who is my producer is Also my partner in real life. Mother Fionnasse in real life. so you only see me In front of the camera. so, he has given me That space. He has made all the provisions. only kept me safe and gave me that camera Space. so the man also can take a little absolutely off a back seat and let the woman in Their Lives, Female Friends in Their Lives To support them. the person who looks at Monetization for us. Mother Manager. he joyed us two years ago when i Was barely making â‚¹10,000 a month.

That man is AIR All India Rank 20 doing a government job, he is going to Leave it for me. hmm so, you need strong The Supportive Man in Your Life to Be Able to For the women to also come forward. do you you you you you you you think this is aspiring Content Creator Girls Don't Get That?
