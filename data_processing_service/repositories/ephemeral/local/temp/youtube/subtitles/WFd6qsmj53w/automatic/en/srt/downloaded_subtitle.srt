00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879

00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,850
[MUSIC] What's the difference between the cheapest and the most expensive IPL tickets

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,860

4
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,639
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,960
[APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:16,240
?  Six of my teammates went to watch IPL matches.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,240
Delhi, Kolkata and

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,279
[music]

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,240
Bengaluru.  Three out of six people

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,320
went for the cheapest tickets but the remaining three went for the most

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,199
expensive.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,920
[ __ ].  We wanted to compare everything in these stadiums.

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
Come on brother, see what I

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,399
do now.  We will compare five things for each ticket.

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,280
Ticket booking experience

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,399
finally.  So the ticket is here.  Seats and Views

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,399
Seats are kind of here.  The view is

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
good but hopefully people will vacate it

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,800
later.  Eat?  Ok.  I don't have a sweet

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,760
tooth.  Butt Gulab Jamun, Ulala.  Condition of the toilets.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,239
So the wash experience is a little better

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,960
actually.  What is the extremely dirty washroom and

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,680
most importantly, what are the vibes like and for

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,080
all these things we will give a rating out

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,560
of five.  Some people got box seats with

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,960
lounge access.  It was crazy-crazy.   The

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
other poor souls had to sit on concrete.  The

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
people sitting in front are

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,720
not sitting on any seats.  They are sitting on the floor below.

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,280
So let's cover IPL

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,640
experience from ₹1000 to ₹1 lakh

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,000
experience.  First, let us understand

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,400
what the setup is.  The setup is that I have divided my six

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
team

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,640
members into two parts.

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,759
Girls will get the most expensive

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,400
tickets and boys will get the cheapest ones and

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,840
they have to show their experience of that match.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,840
Why this gender divide?  [ __ ] #shittag mens

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
rights.  No friend, I think you will realise

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
why I took this decision?  You

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
also know what civic sense is like

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,799
and I did not want to send a female team

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,119
member for a ₹700 ticket and something bad

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
happens.  It won't matter if it happens with the boy.

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,079
Uncle you are wrong.  But

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
anyway let's come back to the video.  So

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,640
first let's talk about the ticket booking

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,479
experience for the RCB vs Rajasthan

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,720
Royals match.  Which was attended by

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,720
Antara and Am.  But the problem arose right in the beginning

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
because

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,280
you can buy RCB tickets only from the official website.

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,599
Not from any third party vendor like

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
Paytm or District.  My

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,160
objective was to buy the most expensive ticket.  But

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,160
brother, these tickets are not available on the official website.

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
We had to go to a travel agency.

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,280
And you know what he

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,360
told us, a box ticket worth ₹42,000 will be

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,519
available in black for

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,519
₹19,000.

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Antara asked why are the tickets in black so

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
expensive?  So the travel

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,959
operator said that you will

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,000
not get online tickets.  Such tickets are sold through us only.

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,560
Because everyone knows

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,680
that the demand is very high.  Whatever the

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,599
price, be it 500, 1 lakh or 2 lakh people will

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
buy it.  And you know

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,800
what else he said.  This trick is very important to

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,400
save tax.  So let's decide

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,640
that we will buy the ticket of GR Vishwanath Stand for

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,879
₹109,000.  But as soon as

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,560
we decided this the tickets got sold.  Then

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
we said okay give me the second most expensive one,

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,950
that too got sold.  So finally we

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,389
got Rahul Dravid Lawn

79
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,389
[Music]

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,000
ticket from Qatar Airways whose official price is

81
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,319
₹27,000 and we got it for ₹69,000.  what a

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,120
deal bro.  So now I bought the most expensive ticket

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,560
from Chaswami.  Now buy the cheapest

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,760
ticket.  So we bought the cheapest ticket for ₹2300, but

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,760

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,159
got the cheapest ticket in black for ₹6500 and

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,280
got the most expensive one available as well.  Now

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,239
we had to get the tickets in hand.  So,

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
a day before the match, Am and

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,360
Antara went to Rajaji Nagar Metro Station to get tickets.  He

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,760
said that we meet at the metro station at Rajaji Nagar.

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
Where we did not find the dealer

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,879
but found the dealer's friend who would give us the ticket.

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,200
Now I did not know whether he would give it or not.

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,640
We were just going on trust.  But

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,640
finally I got the ticket.  Yes finally.  Finally.

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,400
So the ticket is here.  Now the ticket booking

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,919
experience was so crazy that is why people

99
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,000
say that I want to watch the match from home.

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,919
But there are many restrictions at home also

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,880
depending upon your broadcast.

102
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,960
And that's why I want to talk about today's sponsor, VPA.

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,720

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,560
Through Not VPN you can watch many things which are

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
not available in India.  Like movies or

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,600
many different sports.  There are many TV shows

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
on Netflix, DNS Plus and HBO which are

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,120
not available in India.  I usually

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
use a VPN when I

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,759
travel because the

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,600
shows I want to watch might not be available at my destination.

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
And this is also good

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
for security if you want to hide your

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
IP.  Especially when you are using public Wi-Fi

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,759

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
in airports, cafes or hotels.  If you want to check out a VPN

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,759
go on vpn.com, you will

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
get a great discount on the 2 year plan and you will also get 4 months free

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,000
and there is a 30 day money back guarantee, so

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
try it, if you don't like it then cancel it, the

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
link is in the description, so check it

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
out and now let's come back to the video.  Now let us

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,639
go from Chinnaswamy Stadium

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,880
to Arun Jaitley Stadium.  Where Veena and Mohit

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,080
wanted to watch the match of Delhi Capitals

126
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
against KKR through the District app.  But

127
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,800
as soon as he logged in, 750 people were

128
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
standing there.  There were same clear instructions for them also

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,520
that brother, we have to buy the cheapest and the

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
most expensive tickets.  But friend, I could

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,440
n't find both of them on the District app.  Both were

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,960
sold out.  So we got the second

133
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,880
cheapest one and the mid tier one for Rs 7,500.  So it was

134
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120

135
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,440
difficult to buy tickets in Delhi and Bangalore.  But the

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
ticket booking experience for Eden Gardens in Kolkata was

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,560
actually very smooth.  Adriya got a mid

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,919
year premium ticket without drama

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,280
on Book My Show and cheap tickets were easily available on Adi

140
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,160
and the price was just ₹900. This was the

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
cheapest ticket in all the three stadiums.

142
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
Now tickets were definitely available in black outside Eden Gardens

143
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,680
but we had no problem.

144
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,400
So now we have got tickets for all three matches.

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,199
Antara and Amay will go to Chinswami

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Adi and Adraja to Eden Gardens and Mohit and

147
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,360
Veena to Arun Jaitley Stadium.  Now let's talk about

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
match day.  Who has Let's See?

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
Am.  Letts C.  In which it was

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
very easy to reach Swami.  Amma took the metro, Antara took the

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,360
auto.

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,039
Reaching the stadium was easy but

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,120
entering inside the stadium was another challenge.   There is

154
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,759
no way to enter at the train gate.  I

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,160
almost got killed.  It is very crowded.  There were so

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,199
many policemen but the crowd management was

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
very bad.  Now Antara and Am were

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,120
going to watch a cricket match for the first time so they did

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
not know what they could carry and

160
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
what they could not.  They are not even allowing banks

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
inside.  I have two phones.  There is a power bank.

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,720
I have my wallet.  Where should I put it

163
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,280
inside now?  And there are no lockers there either.

164
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Dev just hung the bags.  Security is a little

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,560
lax here in the locker room.

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Actually there isn't even a rocker room.  Someone has

167
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,479
put up a temporary tent here.

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,960
₹1 and open locker.

169
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,080
After dropping their luggage, both of them headed towards their gate.  We have to

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,160
go to this gate

171
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,319
in intake.  And there's a lot of trash here, friend.   The

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
smell is also very bad.  And look at this line.  The

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,520
line is also very long.  Now, you will

174
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,880
have to wait in line.  He checked me a total of four times.

175
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,120
Ok?  While going inside.   There is

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,759
no four times checking even at the airport.

177
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,840
Antara's entry was the smoothest.  There

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,000
is no need for any waiting.  My gate?   The

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,560
red carpet was laid out for him.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Obviously brother, if ₹70,000 have been given then the red

181
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,599
carpet should also be laid.  I will reach in 20 minutes.

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,759
7:30 p.m.  So

183
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,919
I have reached the stadium.  Our gate number is 15.   The

184
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
entry of both Mohit and Veena was very smooth

185
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,639
and Veena was very crazy excited

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,720
because this was her first cricket match going to be

187
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,599
live.  This is my first experience of

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,000
watching such a match in the stadium.  So let's see how

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,400
wood goes.  Mohit was

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,479
roaming around telling his taxi driver that it is

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
so difficult to get IPL tickets.  Look, to

192
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
buy this ticket, just three-four days

193
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
ago I had said that it would be Rs 1200 but it gets

194
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,319
sold out very quickly.  Now, I had

195
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
already scared them that nothing is allowed

196
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
inside the stadium.  So

197
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,879
pack properly and reach early so that there is no

198
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,919
problem in entry.

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,840
I have to enter from main gate 17 in front of Delhi Gate number five

200
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,000
and you can see that I have

201
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,719
reached gate number 17.  The place was very

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,680
crowded but the security check was easy.   The

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760

204
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839

205
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,000
experience of Adi and Adrishya at Eden Gardens was very smooth compared to Bengaluru and Delhi.  Now Eden is located

206
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,240
in Esplanade area of ​​Kolkata which is

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,640
considered to be the busiest area of ​​Kolkata so it is

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
easily available to get public transport and

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,120
as there is a lot of security and sign

210
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,519
boards it is also easy to get the gate.

211
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,080
Both Adi and Adraja meet

212
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,320
at Gate 3 where Adraja was about to enter.

213
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,399
This is the entrance to Gate Number Three

214
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,519
from where I am going to enter.

215
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,600
But Adi's gate was Gate 11 and the poor guy got

216
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,560
killed there.  Its been 15 minutes so far.  The gate was

217
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,720
not found.  Where is gate number 11?  Ojit here.

218
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,279
I discovered that it has a completely opposite side.

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,240
Gate number 11, can we go from here?  That

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,560
poor guy kept wandering here and there for 30 minutes.

221
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,760
But no policeman knew

222
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,959
where Gate 11 was.  It took him half an hour.  Then go and make

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,120
his entry.

224
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,560
But the experience has just begun, etc.  The

225
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,800
ticket is for ₹900 and he had to climb the mountain to

226
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
reach his seat.  These are the

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
stairs of the stadium.  Now I have to

228
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,839
climb to the top.  The poor guy kept climbing the stairs to

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
reach his seat.  The seating

230
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,839
line was so narrow that one had to push others to get in and out.

231
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,880

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,760
And these seats are a bit too narrow.  But

233
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,360
poor Adi's view was absolutely useless.

234
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,839
He says that he had no idea what was

235
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,920
happening on the pitch.  The

236
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,720
game is going on behind but more than the game, you

237
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,640
can see the Ganga behind.  So I will give 21.5 for the season.

238
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,040
 

239
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,200
Now it is obvious that brother, if you have

240
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
got the cheapest ticket, then you will have to suffer a little.

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,320
What is the story of Amey who paid ₹300 extra?   The

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,839
seeds that were there were concrete steps, they were

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
not normal steps, they were slightly bigger

244
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,320
steps, but they were directly bolted on them.  The

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,240
seating was like sitting knees up

246
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
and the seats were plastic.

247
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,920
No one was very comfortable.

248
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,920
Now the seats were useless but the view of the am was absolutely

249
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
crazy.

250
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,920
My view was honestly very

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,000
good because

252
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,279
I was sitting perpendicular to the pitch, I was sitting on the side of square leg

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,160
or point on point.  The

254
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,399
bonus was that

255
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Virat Kohli was fielding right down in the second innings.

256
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
That means, wherever I was sitting,

257
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,079
right below me, he was

258
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,079
fielding like this.  People are crazy for Kohli.

259
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,850
Virat Kohli looked so good.  Because of that

260
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,760
I would give it four out of five.

261
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,480
[Praise]

262
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,480
Am's experience was better.  Does this logic

263
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,800
apply to Mohit as well?  All set

264
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,800
for the match.

265
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,399
When he reached the third floor of the West Stand

266
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,399
, he got a big surprise.

267
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,959
Brother this is for sale.  It's free.  Thank you

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,600
so much.  I am going to the third floor.  But right now

269
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,839
I got a free jersey down there.  I thought

270
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
they were selling it.  So I asked and

271
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
they said no it is free to show your

272
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
support for the team and I also got flags.

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,720
So I took both things.  And there was a

274
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,279
completely panoramic view from his seat.  Wow this

275
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,519
looks cool.  The

276
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:50,240
view of the ground was crazy but the

277
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
view of the stadium was absolutely ugly.  You can see that there is already

278
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,680
no crowd yet but

279
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,240
people have started spreading the smell.

280
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,480
Now the view was okay but so many people were standing

281
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,920
that I couldn't see, poor

282
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Mohit was not feeling very comfortable

283
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,519
but it was okay for 3 hours, I guess the

284
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,519
view is good for one minute but hopefully people will vacate it

285
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,399
later and when he once sat on the seat

286
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,000
he realized that brother, these are very

287
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,800
bad seats, friend, the seats are okay comfortable, it will be fine for

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,639
3 hours but I guess it is

289
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040

290
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,839
not that comfortable for long duration, but when he once sat on the seat

291
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,519
he said that friend, not bad for ₹100.  My

292
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,720
initial reaction was that the seats were

293
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
uncomfortable because they looked

294
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
uncomfortable.  Actually it

295
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,519
is not that uncomfortable.  So overall I would

296
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,320
give the seat three out of five.  The shocking thing was

297
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
that Veena spent ₹7500 but her

298
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,079
experience was not much different from Mohit's.

299
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,079
 

300
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,839
The view is

301
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,480
phenomenal as you can see right here on the

302
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,959
ground we are singing right here

303
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,660
Veena was sitting behind the cheer leaders and she

304
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,399
got the full IP package

305
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,360
[Music]

306
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,240
crazy crowd so much excitement and people are

307
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,040
dancing and singing with the view

308
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I feel it is going to be a full package

309
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,440
because I am very close to

310
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,760
the pitch so for this I would like to

311
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,959
give it a rating of four out of five and out of Adraja's

312
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,600
15,000 tickets I think if there is any one

313
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,160
highlight of my seat then it was the view from my seat.  The

314
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,200
view was so beautiful that as soon as I

315
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,440
sat down, I was shocked that I would be able to see such a beautiful view and the

316
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,839
pitch so clearly; this was

317
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,839
not my expectation.  And on top of that, such a

318
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
nice breeze was blowing that there was no

319
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
issue of heat.  So the view and seating were

320
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
absolutely high class for me.  But still

321
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,200
I would give it a rating of four out of five

322
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,440
because the seats were a bit narrow.  But otherwise

323
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,320
maybe that was my highlight and that's why

324
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,480
I enjoyed the match so much.  But

325
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
right now the experience is not that crazy.

326
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,680
Adraja got a very premium experience for the ₹15,000 ticket.

327
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,680
Chair leaders,

328
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,160
robots and Preity Zinta were also seen.  The

329
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,800

330
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,199
owners sit just behind where Adriya was sitting and usefully Shahrukh Khan is

331
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,440
there.  Now unfortunately

332
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,760
Shahrukh Khan did not come that day.  Otherwise Adraja would have gone

333
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
mad.  The guy who was sitting next to Adiraja

334
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,720
said that he

335
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,120
is not a fan of KKR but a fan of Shahrukh Khan.

336
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,920
But Antara got the queen-like treatment

337
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,920
for whose seat I spent ₹70,000.   The

338
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 

339
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,399
entry way to the lounge was very classy.

340
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,320
I did not feel at all that I had

341
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
come to watch a cricket match.  Because I had

342
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
always heard from cricket fans that the

343
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
stadium experience is very

344
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
bad.  It is very crowded and very

345
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
hot too.  But here I

346
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,440
also got a wet towel at the entry.

347
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,480
Like I've been to a spa.  Every seat had

348
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,279
an RCB flag and scoreboard.

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
Honestly my seats were quite comfortable.   It was the

350
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,880
usual plastic one but there was

351
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,959
much gap between two days.  So one could

352
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,560
easily sit comfortably for 2 to three

353
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,959
hours.  But then the question is, was

354
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,680
my experience worth the Rs 27,000 ticket?  The

355
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,519
straight answer is no.  Firstly the seats were

356
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,920
fine and the view was also there, meaning I could see the pitch as well.

357
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,320
But I was sitting so far away that

358
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,279
I could not understand what was

359
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,079
happening on the field.  And and I was completely

360
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,360
relying on this TV which was in my area and there was

361
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,399
a TV in front of me.  So after

362
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,959
considering both these things I would give

363
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,399
my seating and view three tasks.  I think

364
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,600
BCCI can do better.  Now the view was not so crazy that

365
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,920
one had to watch it on TV to

366
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,160
understand the match.  But the excitement was very

367
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,639
crazy.  But at least Antara was

368
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,120
getting AC.  So now all six team members have

369
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,360
sat on their respective seats.  It's been

370
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,480
an hour or two since the match.  Now everyone is feeling

371
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,360
hungry.  First of all Mohit went to eat food.

372
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,079
How much does a samosa cost, brother?  This is one for 50 and give me one for 100. Surprise surprise,

373
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,079

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,959
everything was expensive and of

375
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,920
poor quality. Vegetarian burger was

376
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,680
₹200 and there was a markup of ₹20 on everything,

377
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,240
because of which the cost of the cold drink was also

378
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,880
₹100.  How much does it cost?

379
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,519
This small bottle costs ₹100.  Cold

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,839
drink option.

381
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,680
Well, this is expected.  The main problem was

382
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,759
that Mohit was not getting water.   There

383
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,759
was no free water.  One had to go very far

384
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
and even there one had to buy water.

385
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,880
Brother, how much does a Bisleri bottle cost?  There

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,759
is a bottle.  Is it not allowed?  There is glass.

387
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,600
How much is that glass?  It is for 20 rupees.  Now

388
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,240
Mohit took a cold drink to extinguish the fire

389
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,959
but he could not find the dustbin anywhere.

390
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,759
Also ate a samosa worth ₹50.  But Mohit got the biggest surprise

391
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,360
when he went to the toilet.  Going to the washroom.

392
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,360
So let's see how the washroom is.

393
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,799
ONE ETERNITY LATER OH MY GOD.  Finding the washroom

394
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,400
itself is a scene.  How is your

395
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
experience so far brother?  In number one.

396
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,199
How do you like the facilities etc.?

397
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,199
Facility great shoot.   It was

398
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,480
such a bad experience, what can I even

399
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,440
describe.  God the washrooms were so dirty.

400
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
Very dirty washroom.  What can I say,

401
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,559
you have seen it.  It was pathetic.  It

402
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,200
was very dirty.  And this toilet experience is of the

403
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,919
cricket stadium of the country's capital, a

404
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,320
sport that the country is crazy about.  Honestly the

405
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
toilet is so dirty that I

406
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
want to give negative marks.  But since that is

407
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,960
not allowed I will give it zero out of

408
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
five.  Adi and Am also had a similar experience.

409
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,360
I literally can't open my mouth.   The

410
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,679
bathroom stings so much.  And because the

411
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,559
half ticket was the cheapest.  Nothing was

412
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,039
complimentary.  There was no water and

413
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,240
everything was overpriced.  To be honest,

414
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,360
I found the momos to be okay.  It was fresh and

415
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,080
hot too.  So for food I will give

416
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,799
four out of five.  The only thing is that you will

417
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,640
have to buy it and eat it.  I was also very bothered

418
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,840
by the food.  There was access to food between matches.  Don't go there, there were

419
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,640
people roaming who were selling food but

420
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,160
everything was overpriced, ice cream worth Rs. 45 was being

421
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:36,000
sold for Rs. 100, popcorn worth Rs. 50 was being

422
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,280
sold for Rs. 200. There were options, I mean there was a

423
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,080
problem when it came to subway, there were decent options, but I would say there were

424
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,200
not that many, but the

425
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,300
biggest problem was for Ammi. Water for ammi. 1

426
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,280
sec 1 sec 1 sec 1 sec

427
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:54,400
[Music] It was

428
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,400
as if a war had broken out for water. There was

429
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
only one water dispenser for the entire stand

430
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,880
and no one was serving it. To get

431
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,559
water in the stands, you had to go

432
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,760
down and drink water wherever you were sitting. And

433
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,640
what about Adraaj and Antara

434
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,080
who bought tickets worth thousands of rupees. And

435
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,960
this is the washroom, the ticket price is Rs.

436
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,440
11,000, we had to pay almost Rs. 15,000.

437
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,280
For this price,

438
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
it is not as neat and clean as you would expect a neat and clean washroom.

439
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,480

440
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,720
I don't see any supply here.   There are

441
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,520
no things like tissues and sanitary napkins

442
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,840
in this toilet and it smells very bad.  Brother,

443
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,400
he has bought a premium ticket by paying thousands of rupees.

444
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,919
Why are clothes hanging outside the washroom

445
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,919
?  This is the entrance to the washroom.  This is quite

446
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:47,360
a sharp place and we

447
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,280
can also see some clothes drying here.  Now

448
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,760
thankfully his ticket included a

449
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,919
complimentary meal with

450
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,320
unlimited supply of water and cold drinks from

451
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
7:00 pm to 11:00 pm.  The buffet experience was

452
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,960
absolutely splendid for me.  So

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,679
many food options and such tasty food.   It

454
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,160
was a complete full course meal.  So here

455
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,320
five out of five is made by closing the eyes.

456
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,480
Now let us come to our Queen's

457
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,080
experience.  Antara who

458
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,280
paid ₹70,000 for premium lounge access.   There was

459
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120

460
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,600
a staircase right next to my seat that

461
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,200
went up to the upper lounge, where there were lots of

462
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,320
snacks and beverages.

463
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,520
Including there was also a beer counter.  But the

464
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,840
best part of that lounge was that the AC was on full

465
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,559
blast as it was very

466
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,440
hot in the bore that day.  Another interesting thing that

467
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,400
caught my eye was that on the big

468
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,200
wall at the back, there were framed jerseys of all the players who have

469
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,559
played for RCB till date.

470
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,760
And everyone was

471
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,240
standing with those jerseys and taking photos.  There was

472
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,480
also a jersey of Virat Kohli.  And it was a

473
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
good experience.

474
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
She could also see the field from the lounge.

475
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,679
She was so happy that she immediately made a video call

476
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,919
to Ame who was sitting in a cheap ticket.

477
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,120
Antara then went to another lounge

478
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,640
where delicious snacks were available.

479
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,600
Dinner buffet opens at 7:30.  Honestly this food

480
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,480
was quite decent.  There were plenty of options to eat in the lounge

481
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,640
once the buffet was open.  There was veg as

482
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,960
well as non veg.  But the most

483
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,720
disappointing part of the food was the masala

484
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,559
dosa.  Because I did

485
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,520
not expect such a disgusting masala dosa after coming to Bangalore.  And all

486
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,840
in all I think for food I would give it 3.5

487
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,080
stars out of five.

488
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,600
After destroying the Masala Dosa, Antara

489
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,240
went to visit the toilet.  This is the washroom and it

490
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,480
smells really good.  The toilet was under

491
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,400
construction but there was no smell.

492
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,120
But Antara's experience became better after

493
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,679
talking to the staff member there.  So I had to

494
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,919
use the washroom.  But my hands

495
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,919
were full.  I had a phone, a wallet and on

496
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,559
top of that, there was also an RCB flag.  And there was no

497
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,720
place to keep anything in the washroom.

498
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,720
But there was a lady

499
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,360
helper sitting outside the washroom.  Who after seeing all this

500
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,440
told me that you go, I will handle it.

501
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,760
And he kept one of my phones and the RCB

502
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
flag with himself.  And I could use

503
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,200
the washroom.  And it was a very sweet thing that

504
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,320
she did.  But brother Veena did not enjoy it that much.

505
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,840
In this category in which I am, everyone

506
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,520
gets a free food box and

507
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,320
beside it, as I had shown you earlier, there is

508
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,880
drinking water.  But that's a little too far from the

509
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,440
seed but let's see what's in the food box.

510
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,840
But right now I would

511
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
like to give it a rating of three out of five.  And

512
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,120
Veena also said that the washroom cleanliness was

513
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,919
just average.  So the wash experience

514
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,440
seems to be a little better than actually

515
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,320
it's actually clean and the expectations for this are

516
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,520
very low.  It is average clean but

517
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,640
it is clean.  Now all this was fine.  The crazy

518
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,159
thing happened when Veena had to go back to her seat.

519
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,600
 

520
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,280
And crowd management is actually bad.  It was

521
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,640
half time and it seemed like there was a

522
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,640
stampy situation here.

523
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,159
Manoj Changla, who had come from Ajmer to watch the match,

524
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,559

525
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,640
watched the entire match standing.  This is a crowd management shop.  The seat is

526
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,520
not available.  Those who

527
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,799
had tits, they are already seated in the crowd.  So

528
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
we are not able to sit on that seat.  We are

529
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,799
standing and watching.  Leave this matter aside,

530
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,840
Veena's lunch box was also

531
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,480
lying on the ground.  And when it was becoming clear

532
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,360
that Delhi was losing, the atmosphere became

533
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,000
completely useless.  After half time, the

534
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,400
whole vibe of this

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,720
area changes and the people have changed.  The people who were

536
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,320
sitting around me before half time are

537
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,880
not visible and the new

538
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,760
crowd is now standing on their seats.

539
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:01,000
Racist comments can also be heard and people are

540
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,000
shouting.  I have made him an uncle.

541
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,440
So the overall vibe has gone down a lot

542
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,240
after half time and

543
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,720
that is why the vibe rating is 2.5 out

544
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,400
of five.  People started leaving early and the

545
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,400
stadium became a garbage dump.

546
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,400
And this was not just Veena's experience.

547
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
Mohit also complained about the same thing.

548
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,559
Friend, one thing that is very frustrating

549
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,480
while watching a match is the lack of civic sense.

550
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
People who take beverages and snacks on the seats

551
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,320
, throw them there.   There are

552
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,760
dustbins everywhere, friend.  Go and

553
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
throw it in the dustbin.

554
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,240
This thing is very unnoticing.  Now regarding the garbage,

555
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,480
both Mohit and Veena agree.  But

556
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
Mohit said one thing which I

557
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,400
felt while watching the match today.  It’s that there is

558
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
n’t a very passionate home crowd.

559
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Unusually home crowds in sports stadiums are

560
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,799
very die hard and passionate types.

561
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
But there is a very mixed crowd here.

562
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,120
You can see in my stand also, there are many

563
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,120
KKR fans.  And like if KKR is

564
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,600
hitting fours and sixes then everyone is

565
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,919
celebrating.  Same thing is happening in Delhi also.

566
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,000
So it doesn't feel fiercely

567
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,480
competitive.  The vibe is

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
not a very competitive sporty vibe.   It

569
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
means a bit like a fair.  It

570
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
is like a festival.  People are taking selfies, dancing.  There

571
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,080
is nothing wrong in this.  People are

572
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,400
enjoying and I have also come to enjoy.   It was

573
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,400

574
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,240
clear to Mohit that it was

575
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,400
not the case that people in Delhi were completely biased

576
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
towards Delhi.  He has just come to have fun.  Look

577
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
how funny this is.  This brother who is

578
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
sitting behind me.  He supported Delhi throughout the match.  Was

579
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,520

580
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,600
wearing Delhi jersey.  And now

581
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Delhi is losing.  He has taken off his jersey.

582
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,679
And now they are supporting KKR.

583
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,919
So that's it.  This is what I was saying,

584
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,520
that people like this are not very hardcore

585
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,799
supporters.  Have come to have fun.

586
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,799
having fun.  Which is great.

587
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,799
[MUSIC]

588
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,720
He also spoke to a father and son, Kamal and Dev.  Will

589
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,159

590
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,600
you tell the people who will watch this video on TV that they

591
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
should come to the stadium to watch it?   It

592
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,440
is worth it, it is worth it.  You must gain experience.

593
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,159
You have that different thing that you will bury in your life.  One should

594
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,559

595
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,559
have this kind of experience once.

596
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,520
But there was no unbiased crowd in Bengaluru.  It

597
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:38,559
is on the side.  In the second innings,

598
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,039
Rajasthan Royals were being completely roasted.

599
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,080
Now Antara is not a crazy cricket

600
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,039
fan.  But I understood one thing.  The

601
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,919
craze for RCB in the city is no joke,

602
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:54,559
brother.  But the experience was

603
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,559
very energetic.  It was crazy crazy.   The

604
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,840
crowd would go silent with every four and six,

605
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,000
and go crazy after every wicket.

606
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,120
In the second innings it seemed that

607
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,960
Rajasthan would win.  But at the end

608
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,919
RCB was winning the match and in the last over they

609
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,400
needed 13 runs from just one ball.  Everybody became absolutely silent.

610
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,400
Just waiting for RCB to win the

611
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
match.

612
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,500
[Praise]

613
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,360
And a similar experience was seen in Kolkata also.

614
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,360

615
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,660
[Applause]

616
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,579
[Music]

617
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,679
KKR fans were enjoying this experience a lot.

618
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,919
Even if Punjab hit sixes and fours.

619
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,919

620
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:10,279
But brother, garbage is one thing that unites us all.

621
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,279
He sees that

622
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,840
when the match is over, people move towards the exit.

623
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,520
Now the exit was smooth for Amay and Antara.  The

624
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,679
commute was very easy.  That means

625
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,480

626
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,360
this Chinoswami is situated just next to the Cubbon Park Metro Station.  Yes, the metro

627
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,520
closes at 11:00 clock or 11:30.

628
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,480
But especially for the match

629
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,799
they kept a metro till ah late night 12:30.

630
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,240
Mohit said that exiting from Delhi was

631
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,240
actually a bit uncomfortable.  The

632
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:49,520
exits in Delhi were not disabled friendly.

633
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,320
A disabled man had to

634
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,000
go down three floors on his own.  Poor guys Adi and Adraja had

635
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,000
a spoilt spot

636
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,360
as it started raining and the match got

637
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,240
over early.

638
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,240
Everybody is coming inside now because of the rain.   The

639
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,840
premium exit was very smooth but

640
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,240
for the poor guy who came with the cheaper ticket, the

641
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,360
exit was very bad and

642
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,919
they stopped people for 30 minutes

643
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,559
[music].  In

644
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,440
fact, Adi said that many women were

645
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,600
also feeling unsafe.

646
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,559
A woman actually even complained

647
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,880
that a man was misbehaving with her.

648
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,520
But thankfully the police stopped that thing.   The

649
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
overall summary is that the vibes are

650
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,080
unmatched.  You will know that only in the stadium.

651
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,640
But the world's richest cricket

652
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,960
board is running one of the richest leagues in the world.

653
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,200
And most people don't have proper seats.  There

654
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,760
is no free water.  The toilets

655
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,320
are absolutely useless.  Come on BCCI I think we can

656
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,559
fix that.
