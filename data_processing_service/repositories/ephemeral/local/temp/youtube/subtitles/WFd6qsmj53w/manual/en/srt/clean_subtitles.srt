[MUSIC] What's the difference between the cheapest and the most expensive IPL tickets [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] ?  Six of my teammates went to watch IPL matches. Delhi, Kolkata and [music] Bengaluru.  Three out of six people went for the cheapest tickets but the remaining three went for the most expensive. [ __ ].  We wanted to compare everything in these stadiums. Come on brother, see what I do now.  We will compare five things for each ticket. Ticket booking experience finally.  So the ticket is here.  Seats and Views Seats are kind of here.  The view is good but hopefully people will vacate it later.  Eat?  Ok.  I don't have a sweet tooth.  Butt Gulab Jamun, Ulala.  Condition of the toilets. So the wash experience is a little better actually.  What is the extremely dirty washroom and most importantly, what are the vibes like and for all these things we will give a rating out of five.  Some people got box seats with lounge access.  It was crazy-crazy.   The other poor souls had to sit on concrete.  The people sitting in front are not sitting on any seats.  They are sitting on the floor below. So let's cover IPL experience from ₹1000 to ₹1 lakh experience.  First, let us understand what the setup is.  The setup is that I have divided my six team members into two parts. Girls will get the most expensive tickets and boys will get the cheapest ones and they have to show their experience of that match. Why this gender divide?  [ __ ] #shittag mens rights.  No friend, I think you will realise why I took this decision?  You also know what civic sense is like and I did not want to send a female team member for a ₹700 ticket and something bad happens.  It won't matter if it happens with the boy. Uncle you are wrong.  But anyway let's come back to the video.  So first let's talk about the ticket booking experience for the RCB vs Rajasthan Royals match.  Which was attended by Antara and Am.  But the problem arose right in the beginning because you can buy RCB tickets only from the official website. Not from any third party vendor like Paytm or District.  My objective was to buy the most expensive ticket.  But brother, these tickets are not available on the official website. We had to go to a travel agency. And you know what he told us, a box ticket worth ₹42,000 will be available in black for ₹19,000. Antara asked why are the tickets in black so expensive?  So the travel operator said that you will not get online tickets.  Such tickets are sold through us only. Because everyone knows that the demand is very high.  Whatever the price, be it 500, 1 lakh or 2 lakh people will buy it.  And you know what else he said.  This trick is very important to save tax.  So let's decide that we will buy the ticket of GR Vishwanath Stand for ₹109,000.  But as soon as we decided this the tickets got sold.  Then we said okay give me the second most expensive one, that too got sold.  So finally we got Rahul Dravid Lawn [Music] ticket from Qatar Airways whose official price is ₹27,000 and we got it for ₹69,000.  what a deal bro.  So now I bought the most expensive ticket from Chaswami.  Now buy the cheapest ticket.  So we bought the cheapest ticket for ₹2300, but got the cheapest ticket in black for ₹6500 and got the most expensive one available as well.  Now we had to get the tickets in hand.  So, a day before the match, Am and Antara went to Rajaji Nagar Metro Station to get tickets.  He said that we meet at the metro station at Rajaji Nagar. Where we did not find the dealer but found the dealer's friend who would give us the ticket. Now I did not know whether he would give it or not. We were just going on trust.  But finally I got the ticket.  Yes finally.  Finally. So the ticket is here.  Now the ticket booking experience was so crazy that is why people say that I want to watch the match from home. But there are many restrictions at home also depending upon your broadcast. And that's why I want to talk about today's sponsor, VPA. Through Not VPN you can watch many things which are not available in India.  Like movies or many different sports.  There are many TV shows on Netflix, DNS Plus and HBO which are not available in India.  I usually use a VPN when I travel because the shows I want to watch might not be available at my destination. And this is also good for security if you want to hide your IP.  Especially when you are using public Wi-Fi in airports, cafes or hotels.  If you want to check out a VPN go on vpn.com, you will get a great discount on the 2 year plan and you will also get 4 months free and there is a 30 day money back guarantee, so try it, if you don't like it then cancel it, the link is in the description, so check it out and now let's come back to the video.  Now let us go from Chinnaswamy Stadium to Arun Jaitley Stadium.  Where Veena and Mohit wanted to watch the match of Delhi Capitals against KKR through the District app.  But as soon as he logged in, 750 people were standing there.  There were same clear instructions for them also that brother, we have to buy the cheapest and the most expensive tickets.  But friend, I could n't find both of them on the District app.  Both were sold out.  So we got the second cheapest one and the mid tier one for Rs 7,500.  So it was difficult to buy tickets in Delhi and Bangalore.  But the ticket booking experience for Eden Gardens in Kolkata was actually very smooth.  Adriya got a mid year premium ticket without drama on Book My Show and cheap tickets were easily available on Adi and the price was just ₹900. This was the cheapest ticket in all the three stadiums. Now tickets were definitely available in black outside Eden Gardens but we had no problem. So now we have got tickets for all three matches. Antara and Amay will go to Chinswami Adi and Adraja to Eden Gardens and Mohit and Veena to Arun Jaitley Stadium.  Now let's talk about match day.  Who has Let's See? Am.  Letts C.  In which it was very easy to reach Swami.  Amma took the metro, Antara took the auto. Reaching the stadium was easy but entering inside the stadium was another challenge.   There is no way to enter at the train gate.  I almost got killed.  It is very crowded.  There were so many policemen but the crowd management was very bad.  Now Antara and Am were going to watch a cricket match for the first time so they did not know what they could carry and what they could not.  They are not even allowing banks inside.  I have two phones.  There is a power bank. I have my wallet.  Where should I put it inside now?  And there are no lockers there either. Dev just hung the bags.  Security is a little lax here in the locker room. Actually there isn't even a rocker room.  Someone has put up a temporary tent here. ₹1 and open locker. After dropping their luggage, both of them headed towards their gate.  We have to go to this gate in intake.  And there's a lot of trash here, friend.   The smell is also very bad.  And look at this line.  The line is also very long.  Now, you will have to wait in line.  He checked me a total of four times. Ok?  While going inside.   There is no four times checking even at the airport. Antara's entry was the smoothest.  There is no need for any waiting.  My gate?   The red carpet was laid out for him. Obviously brother, if ₹70,000 have been given then the red carpet should also be laid.  I will reach in 20 minutes. 7:30 p.m.  So I have reached the stadium.  Our gate number is 15.   The entry of both Mohit and Veena was very smooth and Veena was very crazy excited because this was her first cricket match going to be live.  This is my first experience of watching such a match in the stadium.  So let's see how wood goes.  Mohit was roaming around telling his taxi driver that it is so difficult to get IPL tickets.  Look, to buy this ticket, just three-four days ago I had said that it would be Rs 1200 but it gets sold out very quickly.  Now, I had already scared them that nothing is allowed inside the stadium.  So pack properly and reach early so that there is no problem in entry. I have to enter from main gate 17 in front of Delhi Gate number five and you can see that I have reached gate number 17.  The place was very crowded but the security check was easy.   The experience of Adi and Adrishya at Eden Gardens was very smooth compared to Bengaluru and Delhi.  Now Eden is located in Esplanade area of ​​Kolkata which is considered to be the busiest area of ​​Kolkata so it is easily available to get public transport and as there is a lot of security and sign boards it is also easy to get the gate. Both Adi and Adraja meet at Gate 3 where Adraja was about to enter. This is the entrance to Gate Number Three from where I am going to enter. But Adi's gate was Gate 11 and the poor guy got killed there.  Its been 15 minutes so far.  The gate was not found.  Where is gate number 11?  Ojit here. I discovered that it has a completely opposite side. Gate number 11, can we go from here?  That poor guy kept wandering here and there for 30 minutes. But no policeman knew where Gate 11 was.  It took him half an hour.  Then go and make his entry. But the experience has just begun, etc.  The ticket is for ₹900 and he had to climb the mountain to reach his seat.  These are the stairs of the stadium.  Now I have to climb to the top.  The poor guy kept climbing the stairs to reach his seat.  The seating line was so narrow that one had to push others to get in and out. And these seats are a bit too narrow.  But poor Adi's view was absolutely useless. He says that he had no idea what was happening on the pitch.  The game is going on behind but more than the game, you can see the Ganga behind.  So I will give 21.5 for the season. Now it is obvious that brother, if you have got the cheapest ticket, then you will have to suffer a little. What is the story of Amey who paid ₹300 extra?   The seeds that were there were concrete steps, they were not normal steps, they were slightly bigger steps, but they were directly bolted on them.  The seating was like sitting knees up and the seats were plastic. No one was very comfortable. Now the seats were useless but the view of the am was absolutely crazy. My view was honestly very good because I was sitting perpendicular to the pitch, I was sitting on the side of square leg or point on point.  The bonus was that Virat Kohli was fielding right down in the second innings. That means, wherever I was sitting, right below me, he was fielding like this.  People are crazy for Kohli. Virat Kohli looked so good.  Because of that I would give it four out of five. [Praise] Am's experience was better.  Does this logic apply to Mohit as well?  All set for the match. When he reached the third floor of the West Stand , he got a big surprise. Brother this is for sale.  It's free.  Thank you so much.  I am going to the third floor.  But right now I got a free jersey down there.  I thought they were selling it.  So I asked and they said no it is free to show your support for the team and I also got flags. So I took both things.  And there was a completely panoramic view from his seat.  Wow this looks cool.  The view of the ground was crazy but the view of the stadium was absolutely ugly.  You can see that there is already no crowd yet but people have started spreading the smell. Now the view was okay but so many people were standing that I couldn't see, poor Mohit was not feeling very comfortable but it was okay for 3 hours, I guess the view is good for one minute but hopefully people will vacate it later and when he once sat on the seat he realized that brother, these are very bad seats, friend, the seats are okay comfortable, it will be fine for 3 hours but I guess it is not that comfortable for long duration, but when he once sat on the seat he said that friend, not bad for ₹100.  My initial reaction was that the seats were uncomfortable because they looked uncomfortable.  Actually it is not that uncomfortable.  So overall I would give the seat three out of five.  The shocking thing was that Veena spent ₹7500 but her experience was not much different from Mohit's. The view is phenomenal as you can see right here on the ground we are singing right here Veena was sitting behind the cheer leaders and she got the full IP package [Music] crazy crowd so much excitement and people are dancing and singing with the view I feel it is going to be a full package because I am very close to the pitch so for this I would like to give it a rating of four out of five and out of Adraja's 15,000 tickets I think if there is any one highlight of my seat then it was the view from my seat.  The view was so beautiful that as soon as I sat down, I was shocked that I would be able to see such a beautiful view and the pitch so clearly; this was not my expectation.  And on top of that, such a nice breeze was blowing that there was no issue of heat.  So the view and seating were absolutely high class for me.  But still I would give it a rating of four out of five because the seats were a bit narrow.  But otherwise maybe that was my highlight and that's why I enjoyed the match so much.  But right now the experience is not that crazy. Adraja got a very premium experience for the ₹15,000 ticket. Chair leaders, robots and Preity Zinta were also seen.  The owners sit just behind where Adriya was sitting and usefully Shahrukh Khan is there.  Now unfortunately Shahrukh Khan did not come that day.  Otherwise Adraja would have gone mad.  The guy who was sitting next to Adiraja said that he is not a fan of KKR but a fan of Shahrukh Khan. But Antara got the queen-like treatment for whose seat I spent ₹70,000.   The entry way to the lounge was very classy. I did not feel at all that I had come to watch a cricket match.  Because I had always heard from cricket fans that the stadium experience is very bad.  It is very crowded and very hot too.  But here I also got a wet towel at the entry. Like I've been to a spa.  Every seat had an RCB flag and scoreboard. Honestly my seats were quite comfortable.   It was the usual plastic one but there was much gap between two days.  So one could easily sit comfortably for 2 to three hours.  But then the question is, was my experience worth the Rs 27,000 ticket?  The straight answer is no.  Firstly the seats were fine and the view was also there, meaning I could see the pitch as well. But I was sitting so far away that I could not understand what was happening on the field.  And and I was completely relying on this TV which was in my area and there was a TV in front of me.  So after considering both these things I would give my seating and view three tasks.  I think BCCI can do better.  Now the view was not so crazy that one had to watch it on TV to understand the match.  But the excitement was very crazy.  But at least Antara was getting AC.  So now all six team members have sat on their respective seats.  It's been an hour or two since the match.  Now everyone is feeling hungry.  First of all Mohit went to eat food. How much does a samosa cost, brother?  This is one for 50 and give me one for 100. Surprise surprise, everything was expensive and of poor quality. Vegetarian burger was ₹200 and there was a markup of ₹20 on everything, because of which the cost of the cold drink was also ₹100.  How much does it cost? This small bottle costs ₹100.  Cold drink option. Well, this is expected.  The main problem was that Mohit was not getting water.   There was no free water.  One had to go very far and even there one had to buy water. Brother, how much does a Bisleri bottle cost?  There is a bottle.  Is it not allowed?  There is glass. How much is that glass?  It is for 20 rupees.  Now Mohit took a cold drink to extinguish the fire but he could not find the dustbin anywhere. Also ate a samosa worth ₹50.  But Mohit got the biggest surprise when he went to the toilet.  Going to the washroom. So let's see how the washroom is. ONE ETERNITY LATER OH MY GOD.  Finding the washroom itself is a scene.  How is your experience so far brother?  In number one. How do you like the facilities etc.? Facility great shoot.   It was such a bad experience, what can I even describe.  God the washrooms were so dirty. Very dirty washroom.  What can I say, you have seen it.  It was pathetic.  It was very dirty.  And this toilet experience is of the cricket stadium of the country's capital, a sport that the country is crazy about.  Honestly the toilet is so dirty that I want to give negative marks.  But since that is not allowed I will give it zero out of five.  Adi and Am also had a similar experience. I literally can't open my mouth.   The bathroom stings so much.  And because the half ticket was the cheapest.  Nothing was complimentary.  There was no water and everything was overpriced.  To be honest, I found the momos to be okay.  It was fresh and hot too.  So for food I will give four out of five.  The only thing is that you will have to buy it and eat it.  I was also very bothered by the food.  There was access to food between matches.  Don't go there, there were people roaming who were selling food but everything was overpriced, ice cream worth Rs. 45 was being sold for Rs. 100, popcorn worth Rs. 50 was being sold for Rs. 200. There were options, I mean there was a problem when it came to subway, there were decent options, but I would say there were not that many, but the biggest problem was for Ammi. Water for ammi. 1 sec 1 sec 1 sec 1 sec [Music] It was as if a war had broken out for water. There was only one water dispenser for the entire stand and no one was serving it. To get water in the stands, you had to go down and drink water wherever you were sitting. And what about Adraaj and Antara who bought tickets worth thousands of rupees. And this is the washroom, the ticket price is Rs. 11,000, we had to pay almost Rs. 15,000. For this price, it is not as neat and clean as you would expect a neat and clean washroom. I don't see any supply here.   There are no things like tissues and sanitary napkins in this toilet and it smells very bad.  Brother, he has bought a premium ticket by paying thousands of rupees. Why are clothes hanging outside the washroom ?  This is the entrance to the washroom.  This is quite a sharp place and we can also see some clothes drying here.  Now thankfully his ticket included a complimentary meal with unlimited supply of water and cold drinks from 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm.  The buffet experience was absolutely splendid for me.  So many food options and such tasty food.   It was a complete full course meal.  So here five out of five is made by closing the eyes. Now let us come to our Queen's experience.  Antara who paid ₹70,000 for premium lounge access.   There was a staircase right next to my seat that went up to the upper lounge, where there were lots of snacks and beverages. Including there was also a beer counter.  But the best part of that lounge was that the AC was on full blast as it was very hot in the bore that day.  Another interesting thing that caught my eye was that on the big wall at the back, there were framed jerseys of all the players who have played for RCB till date. And everyone was standing with those jerseys and taking photos.  There was also a jersey of Virat Kohli.  And it was a good experience. She could also see the field from the lounge. She was so happy that she immediately made a video call to Ame who was sitting in a cheap ticket. Antara then went to another lounge where delicious snacks were available. Dinner buffet opens at 7:30.  Honestly this food was quite decent.  There were plenty of options to eat in the lounge once the buffet was open.  There was veg as well as non veg.  But the most disappointing part of the food was the masala dosa.  Because I did not expect such a disgusting masala dosa after coming to Bangalore.  And all in all I think for food I would give it 3.5 stars out of five. After destroying the Masala Dosa, Antara went to visit the toilet.  This is the washroom and it smells really good.  The toilet was under construction but there was no smell. But Antara's experience became better after talking to the staff member there.  So I had to use the washroom.  But my hands were full.  I had a phone, a wallet and on top of that, there was also an RCB flag.  And there was no place to keep anything in the washroom. But there was a lady helper sitting outside the washroom.  Who after seeing all this told me that you go, I will handle it. And he kept one of my phones and the RCB flag with himself.  And I could use the washroom.  And it was a very sweet thing that she did.  But brother Veena did not enjoy it that much. In this category in which I am, everyone gets a free food box and beside it, as I had shown you earlier, there is drinking water.  But that's a little too far from the seed but let's see what's in the food box. But right now I would like to give it a rating of three out of five.  And Veena also said that the washroom cleanliness was just average.  So the wash experience seems to be a little better than actually it's actually clean and the expectations for this are very low.  It is average clean but it is clean.  Now all this was fine.  The crazy thing happened when Veena had to go back to her seat. And crowd management is actually bad.  It was half time and it seemed like there was a stampy situation here. Manoj Changla, who had come from Ajmer to watch the match, watched the entire match standing.  This is a crowd management shop.  The seat is not available.  Those who had tits, they are already seated in the crowd.  So we are not able to sit on that seat.  We are standing and watching.  Leave this matter aside, Veena's lunch box was also lying on the ground.  And when it was becoming clear that Delhi was losing, the atmosphere became completely useless.  After half time, the whole vibe of this area changes and the people have changed.  The people who were sitting around me before half time are not visible and the new crowd is now standing on their seats. Racist comments can also be heard and people are shouting.  I have made him an uncle. So the overall vibe has gone down a lot after half time and that is why the vibe rating is 2.5 out of five.  People started leaving early and the stadium became a garbage dump. And this was not just Veena's experience. Mohit also complained about the same thing. Friend, one thing that is very frustrating while watching a match is the lack of civic sense. People who take beverages and snacks on the seats , throw them there.   There are dustbins everywhere, friend.  Go and throw it in the dustbin. This thing is very unnoticing.  Now regarding the garbage, both Mohit and Veena agree.  But Mohit said one thing which I felt while watching the match today.  It’s that there is n’t a very passionate home crowd. Unusually home crowds in sports stadiums are very die hard and passionate types. But there is a very mixed crowd here. You can see in my stand also, there are many KKR fans.  And like if KKR is hitting fours and sixes then everyone is celebrating.  Same thing is happening in Delhi also. So it doesn't feel fiercely competitive.  The vibe is not a very competitive sporty vibe.   It means a bit like a fair.  It is like a festival.  People are taking selfies, dancing.  There is nothing wrong in this.  People are enjoying and I have also come to enjoy.   It was clear to Mohit that it was not the case that people in Delhi were completely biased towards Delhi.  He has just come to have fun.  Look how funny this is.  This brother who is sitting behind me.  He supported Delhi throughout the match.  Was wearing Delhi jersey.  And now Delhi is losing.  He has taken off his jersey. And now they are supporting KKR. So that's it.  This is what I was saying, that people like this are not very hardcore supporters.  Have come to have fun. having fun.  Which is great. [MUSIC] He also spoke to a father and son, Kamal and Dev.  Will you tell the people who will watch this video on TV that they should come to the stadium to watch it?   It is worth it, it is worth it.  You must gain experience. You have that different thing that you will bury in your life.  One should have this kind of experience once. But there was no unbiased crowd in Bengaluru.  It is on the side.  In the second innings, Rajasthan Royals were being completely roasted. Now Antara is not a crazy cricket fan.  But I understood one thing.  The craze for RCB in the city is no joke, brother.  But the experience was very energetic.  It was crazy crazy.   The crowd would go silent with every four and six, and go crazy after every wicket. In the second innings it seemed that Rajasthan would win.  But at the end RCB was winning the match and in the last over they needed 13 runs from just one ball.  Everybody became absolutely silent. Just waiting for RCB to win the match. [Praise] And a similar experience was seen in Kolkata also. [Applause] [Music] KKR fans were enjoying this experience a lot. Even if Punjab hit sixes and fours. But brother, garbage is one thing that unites us all. He sees that when the match is over, people move towards the exit. Now the exit was smooth for Amay and Antara.  The commute was very easy.  That means this Chinoswami is situated just next to the Cubbon Park Metro Station.  Yes, the metro closes at 11:00 clock or 11:30. But especially for the match they kept a metro till ah late night 12:30. Mohit said that exiting from Delhi was actually a bit uncomfortable.  The exits in Delhi were not disabled friendly. A disabled man had to go down three floors on his own.  Poor guys Adi and Adraja had a spoilt spot as it started raining and the match got over early. Everybody is coming inside now because of the rain.   The premium exit was very smooth but for the poor guy who came with the cheaper ticket, the exit was very bad and they stopped people for 30 minutes [music].  In fact, Adi said that many women were also feeling unsafe. A woman actually even complained that a man was misbehaving with her. But thankfully the police stopped that thing.   The overall summary is that the vibes are unmatched.  You will know that only in the stadium. But the world's richest cricket board is running one of the richest leagues in the world. And most people don't have proper seats.  There is no free water.  The toilets are absolutely useless.  Come on BCCI I think we can fix that.
