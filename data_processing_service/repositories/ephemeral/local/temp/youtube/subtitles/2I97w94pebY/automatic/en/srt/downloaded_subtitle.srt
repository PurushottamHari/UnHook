00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello Friends.  Friends, again late last

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,480
night a big war was seen between Iran and Israel.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,720
Here you

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,840
can see that this time Israel has

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,920
gone deep inside Iran's capital, Tehran, and

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
burnt it.  Their oil depot has been

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,320
burnt here.  And because of this, the Defense

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
Minister of Israel says that

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
Tehran is burning.  So here,

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,359
along with the oil depot, the headquarters of Iran's Ministry of

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
Defense was also

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
attacked.  So, we will know about it in

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,880
overall detail.  But at the same time let

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,960
me also tell you that Pakistan has

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
now given full support to Iran here.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
So what does Pakistan have to say here

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,440
?  We will know in the overall contest.  Let's

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
move on.  But friends, before that let me

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
tell you all that today is the last date of our

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239

you will get its link in the comment section.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
Let's get started.  First of all, let me

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
tell you here what exactly has just happened

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,520
?  See, this operation of Israel is

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,440
basically a strike carried out very deep into Iran.  It is being

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
reported here

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,720
that Israel has launched a major air offensive

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,600

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
inside Iran's capital Tehran and high value targets have been

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
attacked.  First of all, here

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
you can see that there

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
is a district called Shahran on the North Western side of Tehran.

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
I will show it to you here.

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,119
You will get to see this capital of Tehran

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,799
and if you look at its North Western side,

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,080
this district is

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,560
Shahran, there was a very big oil facility there,

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,880
it was attacked due to which it was

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
completely burnt to ashes.

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,280
Apart from this, here on the southern side of Tehran,

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
that is, if you look towards the bottom, there is

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
another facility here.  That too has been struck very badly

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
by Iran.  Sorry from Israel and again

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,119
in this picture you can see what kind of

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,079
fireball like thing you can see here.

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,240
Meaning

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,479
this type of strike has been carried out by Israel inside Iran's capital in Tehran.

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,159

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,479
And it becomes important because

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
this depot, the oil facility that I told you about, is

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,719

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,479
very crucial for the local fuel supply of Tehran and

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
it is a big part of the oil distribution network of the Iran Government.  So,

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
because of this attack, the

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,840
entire infrastructure in Tehran has been

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
destroyed.  Not only

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,599
this, apart from this you can see that the

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
Israeli missiles also struck the headquarters of the Iranian

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
Ministry of Defense

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,080

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,400
and along with this, SPAD, that

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,800
is Organization of Defensive Innovation and

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Research which is related to nuclear weapon research, was

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
also targeted and

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,760
some reports say that many

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,760
senior personnel have been killed in this.

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
Apart from this, it is also being told here

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,800
that yesterday, Israel destroyed Iran's

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
radar installations and surface to air

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
missile units surrounding Tehran, that is,

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,440
all the surface to air missiles that were fired here to protect Tehran, were hit

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
here.

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Why were they hit,

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
if you see from the beginning, Israel's

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
planning has always been that they should first

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,080

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
break Iran's entire defensive system, air defense system, here and after that, the

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,959
fighter jets should be allowed to enter here

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
so that they can go there and do bombing.

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
This type of strategy will be seen.

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Meaning, whenever Iran's air

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,920
defense system becomes weak, the Israeli

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,840
fighter jets enter Iran

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
and

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,599
start bombing.  And because of this, if

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
you see, it is

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,519
also being said by Iran that the third

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Israeli F35 stealth fighter jet was shot

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,560
down here.  Look, till yesterday the news was coming

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,480
that two F35s had been shot down here.

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,840
But just a few hours ago, the latest

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,680
news has come that the third Israeli F35 fighter jet has

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
also been shot down.  But again there is

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
no proof of this being true.

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
This was said by Iran. Iran has in fact also said

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
that we have captured the pilot as well.

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
Now we have to see what happens next regarding this.

106
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,760
But here we need to understand,

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,480
why does the type of strike that was carried out yesterday become so critical inside Tehran

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,280
?  Because see, if Israel

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
attacks Iran's oil facilities, then

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,599
somewhere or the other Iran's domestic fuel

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,319
logistics gets crippled.

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,239
This could increase internal dissent and

114
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,320
undermine Tehran's confidence in its air defense system.

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,479
Secondly, the way in which

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
SPAD and Ministry of Defence building were

118
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,040
attacked, Israel wants

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,840
that Iran's nuclear weapon programme should be

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
disrupted and at the same time, the important

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,240
scientists and planners should be

122
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,560
neutralised.   In

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,440
a way, you can understand that Israel is currently waging

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,960
a massive psychological warfare.  What I

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,639
mean to say is that the

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
Defense Minister of Israel says that

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,919
Tehran is burning.  so what does that mean?

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,720
His message for Iran is that you are

129
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,720
vulnerable.  We can also attack your capital.  An

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,840
effort is also being made to send a message to our Israeli citizens that we are

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
retoaliating.  Because keep in mind that

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,000
whenever Israel attacks here,

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
Iran also attacks Israel on a large scale

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
and Israel also suffers

136
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
a lot of damage.  I will tell you further.

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,440
But at the same time, a

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
signal has also been given to the global powers that we are

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
not going to wait for diplomacy.

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,639
If our existential threat is questioned,

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,800
we will destroy Iran.  So

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,039
here now you can see

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,400
what response came from Iran.  Here you will see

144
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,039
that again Iran has fired 150 ballistic

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,039
missiles on Israel.

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
More than 100 drones have been sent there.  And

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,080
many important cities of Israel have

148
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,880
become Talvib, Hafa, Tamra.

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,960
You will see this bad effect in many Israeli cities.

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,039
Aldo, it is being told that

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,479
Israel's defense system, Air Defense

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,160
System Arrow Three, Iran Iron Dome, have

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,840
intercepted the missiles here,

154
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
but obviously if you

155
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,080
launch ballistic missiles on such a large scale, then

156
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
many of them will

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,320
directly hit your city

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,360
and because of this you can see that at

159
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,880
least the news that has come is that seven Israelis have

160
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
died here, including a child,

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
more than 100 people have been injured.   In

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
fact, I was seeing that there is a BBC

163
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
report, they were

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,240
reporting directly from Israel and the kind of

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,800
scene that was visible, you can see that

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
in many cities of Israel entire

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
buildings have been reduced to ashes, this

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
kind of destruction all around has been

169
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
said in the BBC report, but what does it

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,759
mean, will Israel stop here?

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,319
No, here Israel is saying

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,720
that this is just a beginning, you have no

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,199
idea what is coming, meaning whatever is going to come next,

174
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
it is going to be even more dangerous than this, in

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
fact a statement was given by Netan Yahoo.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
You can see this is what he says.

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
He has, in a way, given a

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,440
very big warning and said that what the Iranian

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,319
regime has felt so far is nothing compared

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,639
with what they will be handed in the coming

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,199
days.  Meaning, whatever has happened till now is nothing.

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,680

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,160
You can't even imagine what will happen in the days to come.  This is what

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
PM Benjamin Netan Yahoo says.  This

185
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
statement is, in some way,

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,639
giving a signal that the current operation is just

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,960
a beginning.  The multiphase military campaign will be

188
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,120
run from here.  Israel is getting ready for a larger

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,759
and more destructive strike here.

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,720
Especially if Iran escalates from here.

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,520
So, in a way, an attempt is being made to

192
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,000
deter Iran and its allies so that

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,759
they do not retaliate.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
If you do this, we will cause even more

195
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,240
destruction.  So now the question is

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,960
that what Benjamin Netan Yahoo says that

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,960
what is coming means something big is going to come in the future, so

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,199
what could that be?  Look, the

199
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,440
first thing is that probably

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,319
Israel is trying to destroy Iran's

201
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,560
four-two enrichment site.

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
Because look, you must have heard about Nathans and many other

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,319
nuclear sites.  In

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
fact, some news also came yesterday

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
that the International Atomic Energy Agency had

206
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
also sent a report

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,319
to USAC saying that internal leak of radioactive

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,720
material was also seen here.

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,039
But it needs to be understood that the

210
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,280
most powerful and most protected

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
site in Iran is the nuclear site

212
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,319
because from the mountain you can see

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,479
80 to 90 meters below ground, so it will

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960

215
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,120
not be easy to destroy it and that is the most important for

216
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,599
Iran, so it is possible that in future Israel may

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,080
destroy this enrichment site, it

218
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,720

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
can hit the Arak heavy water reactor, the aim is to destroy and [ __ ] the

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,280
entire nuclear infrastructure of Iran

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
here in the coming days.  Apart from

222
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,520
this, the

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
IRGC leadership here should again be destroyed by precision strikes in Tehran

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,879
, Qom, Mashhad and many other cities.

225
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
Israel's aim is to destroy the capacity of the

227
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Iranian military planning that is going on here.

228
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719

229
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Along with this,

230
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,120
this entire campaign can become more wide in the coming days.

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,959
Missile depots, air bases, radar

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,040
installations will also be hit.   It is

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,480
already being said that the Israeli unit number

234
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,640
8200 is already carrying out cyber warfare.

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,320
Meaning, they are targeting Iranian defense and energy

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
grids.

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Blackouts, disinfection, all these things.  So

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
you will get to see things from every angle here.

239
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,519
But amidst all these things,

240
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,839
you all know, there is a country which

241
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,080
tries to jump in again and again.  And that is

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
Pakistan.  Again, if you see, Pakistan has

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
now come in full support of

244
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
Iran.  And here you will see

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
Mohammad Asif.  He made a very big

247
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
statement in his National Assembly

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
Parliament.  And he

249
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,560
described the Israeli air strikes as

250
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,560
illegal and unproven aggression.  And

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
he declared that we stand

252
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
behind our Iranian brothers in every way.

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
If we remain silent today, tomorrow it may be our turn.

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
So in a way, as always,

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
Pakistan tries to play the religion card

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,640
and here also it

257
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,519
said that all the Muslim nations should

258
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,000
unite and fight against Israel

259
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,080
in a collective way.  Apart from this, the

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
Foreign Minister of Pakistan also

261
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,480
said here that this is a bridge violation and it

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,519
can have potential regional and global consequences.  See here

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,360
Pakistan wants an emergency

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
OIC meeting to be called.  There is Organization

266
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,760
of Islamic Cooperation, in which there are around

267
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
60 countries.  So an emergency summit should be

268
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,399
called.  A unified position should be taken

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,880
against Israel and

270
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,839
sanctions and diplomatic measures should be taken against Israel

271
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,000
and all kinds of ties

272
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
with Israel should be cut.  In a way,

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you need to understand that through this,

274
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,560
Pakistan is

275
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
also criticizing UAE, Bahrain, Morocco.

276
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
Because here

277
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,640
Arab normalization was being talked about.

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
Basically, as you all know, under the Abraham Accord,

279
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,800
Israel has improved its relations

280
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,640
with UAE, Bahrain and Morocco.

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,640
So in a way Pakistan is

282
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
criticizing it that

283
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
how can you improve your relations with Israel here

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
when other Muslim countries are being

285
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,279
attacked.  So you will

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,120
see this situation.  Well, apart from this, the

287
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
public sentiment in Pakistan

288
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,680
also started to flare up.  The religious

289
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,600
parties like Jamaat Islami also came

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
and they also started saying that

291
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
Pakistan should also take action.  Nation

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
wide protests were seen.  Israeli

293
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,279
flags were torn.

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
You will get to see such overall things.

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,839
Stand with Iran Stop Israeli Terror in Pakistan's social media.

296
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,200
Such hashtags are trending continuously.

297
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
So let's see

298
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
what ultimately happens next regarding this.

299
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,720
I will tell you whatever update happens related to this.

300
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
And before I go, a very

301
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,360
interesting question.  Look, can you tell that

302
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,920

303
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,079
because of the Islamic Revolution that happened in Iran in 1979, the

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,640
Iran that we see today, I mean, was

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,480
established in 1979

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
through the Islamic Revolution, I made a video about this this

307
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
morning itself. I want to tell you and

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,959

topper suggested but nothing work for me.  I was

like it, it won't happen, let's leave it.   If it is

354
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,560
