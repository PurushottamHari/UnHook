Hello Friends.  Friends, again late last night a big war was seen between Iran and Israel. Here you can see that this time Israel has gone deep inside Iran's capital, Tehran, and burnt it.  Their oil depot has been burnt here.  And because of this, the Defense Minister of Israel says that Tehran is burning.  So here, along with the oil depot, the headquarters of Iran's Ministry of Defense was also attacked.  So, we will know about it in overall detail.  But at the same time let me also tell you that Pakistan has now given full support to Iran here. So what does Pakistan have to say here ?  We will know in the overall contest.  Let's move on.  But friends, before that let me tell you all that today is the last date of our Great Learning Festival, under which if you take the course of UPSC 2026, then you will get an extra discount here till 12:00 pm tonight and for this you have to subscribe by using this code Ankit Live and you will get its link in the comment section. Let's get started.  First of all, let me tell you here what exactly has just happened ?  See, this operation of Israel is basically a strike carried out very deep into Iran.  It is being reported here that Israel has launched a major air offensive inside Iran's capital Tehran and high value targets have been attacked.  First of all, here you can see that there is a district called Shahran on the North Western side of Tehran. I will show it to you here. You will get to see this capital of Tehran and if you look at its North Western side, this district is Shahran, there was a very big oil facility there, it was attacked due to which it was completely burnt to ashes. Apart from this, here on the southern side of Tehran, that is, if you look towards the bottom, there is another facility here.  That too has been struck very badly by Iran.  Sorry from Israel and again in this picture you can see what kind of fireball like thing you can see here. Meaning this type of strike has been carried out by Israel inside Iran's capital in Tehran. And it becomes important because this depot, the oil facility that I told you about, is very crucial for the local fuel supply of Tehran and it is a big part of the oil distribution network of the Iran Government.  So, because of this attack, the entire infrastructure in Tehran has been destroyed.  Not only this, apart from this you can see that the Israeli missiles also struck the headquarters of the Iranian Ministry of Defense and along with this, SPAD, that is Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research which is related to nuclear weapon research, was also targeted and some reports say that many senior personnel have been killed in this. Apart from this, it is also being told here that yesterday, Israel destroyed Iran's radar installations and surface to air missile units surrounding Tehran, that is, all the surface to air missiles that were fired here to protect Tehran, were hit here. Why were they hit, if you see from the beginning, Israel's planning has always been that they should first break Iran's entire defensive system, air defense system, here and after that, the fighter jets should be allowed to enter here so that they can go there and do bombing. This type of strategy will be seen. Meaning, whenever Iran's air defense system becomes weak, the Israeli fighter jets enter Iran and start bombing.  And because of this, if you see, it is also being said by Iran that the third Israeli F35 stealth fighter jet was shot down here.  Look, till yesterday the news was coming that two F35s had been shot down here. But just a few hours ago, the latest news has come that the third Israeli F35 fighter jet has also been shot down.  But again there is no proof of this being true. This was said by Iran. Iran has in fact also said that we have captured the pilot as well. Now we have to see what happens next regarding this. But here we need to understand, why does the type of strike that was carried out yesterday become so critical inside Tehran ?  Because see, if Israel attacks Iran's oil facilities, then somewhere or the other Iran's domestic fuel logistics gets crippled. This could increase internal dissent and undermine Tehran's confidence in its air defense system. Secondly, the way in which SPAD and Ministry of Defence building were attacked, Israel wants that Iran's nuclear weapon programme should be disrupted and at the same time, the important scientists and planners should be neutralised.   In a way, you can understand that Israel is currently waging a massive psychological warfare.  What I mean to say is that the Defense Minister of Israel says that Tehran is burning.  so what does that mean? His message for Iran is that you are vulnerable.  We can also attack your capital.  An effort is also being made to send a message to our Israeli citizens that we are retoaliating.  Because keep in mind that whenever Israel attacks here, Iran also attacks Israel on a large scale and Israel also suffers a lot of damage.  I will tell you further. But at the same time, a signal has also been given to the global powers that we are not going to wait for diplomacy. If our existential threat is questioned, we will destroy Iran.  So here now you can see what response came from Iran.  Here you will see that again Iran has fired 150 ballistic missiles on Israel. More than 100 drones have been sent there.  And many important cities of Israel have become Talvib, Hafa, Tamra. You will see this bad effect in many Israeli cities. Aldo, it is being told that Israel's defense system, Air Defense System Arrow Three, Iran Iron Dome, have intercepted the missiles here, but obviously if you launch ballistic missiles on such a large scale, then many of them will directly hit your city and because of this you can see that at least the news that has come is that seven Israelis have died here, including a child, more than 100 people have been injured.   In fact, I was seeing that there is a BBC report, they were reporting directly from Israel and the kind of scene that was visible, you can see that in many cities of Israel entire buildings have been reduced to ashes, this kind of destruction all around has been said in the BBC report, but what does it mean, will Israel stop here? No, here Israel is saying that this is just a beginning, you have no idea what is coming, meaning whatever is going to come next, it is going to be even more dangerous than this, in fact a statement was given by Netan Yahoo. You can see this is what he says. He has, in a way, given a very big warning and said that what the Iranian regime has felt so far is nothing compared with what they will be handed in the coming days.  Meaning, whatever has happened till now is nothing. You can't even imagine what will happen in the days to come.  This is what PM Benjamin Netan Yahoo says.  This statement is, in some way, giving a signal that the current operation is just a beginning.  The multiphase military campaign will be run from here.  Israel is getting ready for a larger and more destructive strike here. Especially if Iran escalates from here. So, in a way, an attempt is being made to deter Iran and its allies so that they do not retaliate. If you do this, we will cause even more destruction.  So now the question is that what Benjamin Netan Yahoo says that what is coming means something big is going to come in the future, so what could that be?  Look, the first thing is that probably Israel is trying to destroy Iran's four-two enrichment site. Because look, you must have heard about Nathans and many other nuclear sites.  In fact, some news also came yesterday that the International Atomic Energy Agency had also sent a report to USAC saying that internal leak of radioactive material was also seen here. But it needs to be understood that the most powerful and most protected site in Iran is the nuclear site because from the mountain you can see 80 to 90 meters below ground, so it will not be easy to destroy it and that is the most important for Iran, so it is possible that in future Israel may destroy this enrichment site, it can hit the Arak heavy water reactor, the aim is to destroy and [ __ ] the entire nuclear infrastructure of Iran here in the coming days.  Apart from this, the IRGC leadership here should again be destroyed by precision strikes in Tehran , Qom, Mashhad and many other cities. Israel's aim is to destroy the capacity of the Iranian military planning that is going on here. Along with this, this entire campaign can become more wide in the coming days. Missile depots, air bases, radar installations will also be hit.   It is already being said that the Israeli unit number 8200 is already carrying out cyber warfare. Meaning, they are targeting Iranian defense and energy grids. Blackouts, disinfection, all these things.  So you will get to see things from every angle here. But amidst all these things, you all know, there is a country which tries to jump in again and again.  And that is Pakistan.  Again, if you see, Pakistan has now come in full support of Iran.  And here you will see Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif.  He made a very big statement in his National Assembly Parliament.  And he described the Israeli air strikes as illegal and unproven aggression.  And he declared that we stand behind our Iranian brothers in every way. If we remain silent today, tomorrow it may be our turn. So in a way, as always, Pakistan tries to play the religion card and here also it said that all the Muslim nations should unite and fight against Israel in a collective way.  Apart from this, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan also said here that this is a bridge violation and it can have potential regional and global consequences.  See here Pakistan wants an emergency OIC meeting to be called.  There is Organization of Islamic Cooperation, in which there are around 60 countries.  So an emergency summit should be called.  A unified position should be taken against Israel and sanctions and diplomatic measures should be taken against Israel and all kinds of ties with Israel should be cut.  In a way, you need to understand that through this, Pakistan is also criticizing UAE, Bahrain, Morocco. Because here Arab normalization was being talked about. Basically, as you all know, under the Abraham Accord, Israel has improved its relations with UAE, Bahrain and Morocco. So in a way Pakistan is criticizing it that how can you improve your relations with Israel here when other Muslim countries are being attacked.  So you will see this situation.  Well, apart from this, the public sentiment in Pakistan also started to flare up.  The religious parties like Jamaat Islami also came and they also started saying that Pakistan should also take action.  Nation wide protests were seen.  Israeli flags were torn. You will get to see such overall things. Stand with Iran Stop Israeli Terror in Pakistan's social media. Such hashtags are trending continuously. So let's see what ultimately happens next regarding this. I will tell you whatever update happens related to this. And before I go, a very interesting question.  Look, can you tell that because of the Islamic Revolution that happened in Iran in 1979, the Iran that we see today, I mean, was established in 1979 through the Islamic Revolution, I made a video about this this morning itself.
