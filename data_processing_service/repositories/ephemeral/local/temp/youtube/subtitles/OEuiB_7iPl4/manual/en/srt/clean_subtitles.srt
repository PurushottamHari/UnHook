10 Km  The sound of the explosion was heard far away and pieces flew up to 400 metres away.  Whichever soldier was using the mobile phone at night, he got shot because the sniper was shooting by looking at the light.   A tunnel had been built beneath the entire area of ​​Kathua and Sama districts.  But Satyapal Malik complicated the matter by saying that no, I had said to get him airlifted from there.   I am messaging the police saying hi jaanu. Using two accounts from Pakistan, ₹1 lakh was transferred there. All those who crossed the border brought more than 20 kg of RDX on their backs. In the video of Adil, Adil was just talking.  Later it became known that someone else was speaking from behind. When the intimate photos of Insha and Umar were shown from inside the mobile, Shakir got shocked and revealed everything.   The soldier was standing with a gun on the border, not for his home land.

The link is in the description.  So let's come back to the topic.  See, due to the Kandahar hijacking incident on 31 December 1999, India had to leave Masood Azhar inside Afghanistan.  Now Masood Azhar was released in Afghanistan but after 2 months of his release, that is in March 200, he reached Bahawalpur in Pakistan and after reaching here, Pakistan's ISI gives a grand welcome to Masood Azhar. A rally was also taken out and standing in this rally, Masood Azhar officially launched Jaish-e-Mohammed and said that the people of Jaish-e-Mohammed will separate Kashmir from India. Now Jaish-e-Mohammed was launched and for the next 5 years after its launch, Jaish-e-Mohammed recruited Kashmiris.  Got training etc. from ISI etc. Many attacks were carried out and the Parliament attack etc. all happened within these 5 years.  And in the years to come, Jaish-e-Mohammed changed its model and its way of working from time to time in Kashmir.  But the only priority of Jaish-e-Mohammed was to hire young Kashmiris, train them and carry out attacks in India.  Because the message through it was that Kashmiris are standing against India and Pakistan has nothing to do with it. So in the coming years, Jaish-e-Mohammed had established its foothold in Kashmir. But after this, by the year 2015, something different happened.  Before this, those who became commanders etc. used to live in hiding inside Kashmir.  Used to keep a low profile. But at this time Burhan Wali showed his militancy in a new style. He was the first militant who, instead of hiding, posted openly on social media.   Used to challenge Indian forces.  He used to post before attacking.  And because of this, it became very famous in Kashmir within a very short time. And this pushed young Kashmiris towards militancy in a very short time. Now Burhanwani's way of working suited Jaish-e-Mohammed very much.  But before Jaish-e-Mohammed could think of anything, Burhanwani was killed by Indian forces on 8th of July 2016. And because of this the atmosphere inside Kashmir became very bad. And this was the time when Masood Azhar decided that this is the best time to launch more attacks inside Kashmir.  Now Masood Azhar was in Pakistan and inside Pakistan, Masood Azhar had five most trusted people.  Umar Farooq, Usman Haider, Talha Masood, Ismail Alvi who is also known as Lambu Bhai. and Abdul Rashid Ghazi.  So these five guys were great trustees of Masood Azar. And among these five, Talha, Usman and Umar were from Masood Ahar's family.  He had nephews.  So when Burhan Wani died, Masood Azhar sent Talha Masood from Pakistan to Kashmir in the beginning of the year 2017 and made him the commander of the South Division of Kashmir. Talha was given the task to get as many young Kashmiris as possible to join Jaish-e-Mohammed in this area and expand the network of OGWs. See, OGW means over ground worker. Jaish Mohammed had created a network of local people inside Kashmir.  These included those Kashmiris who did not want to take up arms openly against the Indian Forces. But providing shelter to the other terrorists in Kashmir who fought against the Indian forces , providing them the location and small intel about the Indian forces, handling logistics, arranging safe houses, all these tasks were done by OGWs. So Jaish-e-Mohammed wanted to expand this network further.  He used to play very important roles. Whenever the OGW network is strong, the attack becomes easier. And Jaish-e-Mohammed preferred to hire local drivers, people running shops in local markets as OGWs because it becomes easier to get OGWs to perform their tasks through such people and there is less suspicion on them.  Now see, Adildar enters in the same year i.e. in 2017. Which is the root of this entire Pulwama attack.  So see, there is a village in Kakapura area of ​​Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir. Gundibag.  There is a school here, Government Higher Secondary School, and Adildar was studying in 12th class in this school. At that time no one had thought that this boy studying in 12th was going to launch such a big attack in the future.  In this school, apart from Adil, he had two more friends.  Tausif and Wasim, out of these Tausif was completely brainwashed. His elder brother had also joined militancy.  Just a few days ago.  He too was shot by the Indian forces, so Tausif plays a very important role in influencing Adil and Wasim about how wrong the Indian Army is doing.  So, see, these three were studying in this school and what happens is that one day, Adil was coming from school and by mistake, the Indian forces pick him up in a stone pending case.  She keeps it for a few days and then leaves it.  Now there were many other reasons behind picking him up because when Burhan Wani was killed, Adil and his two friends used to go for protests daily and would pelt stones at Kakapura and Lethpura and then return home. So, in all this, they have been arrested several times for stone pelting and were put in jail and then released after some time. Similarly, one day Adil was shot in his leg and because of the bullet injury, he was on bed rest for several months and was admitted to the hospital and because of this he missed school as well. Now, after a few months, Adil's heart gets better but after recovery, he does two things.  One even drops out of school altogether.  The second Ansar comes in contact with Ghazwat ul Hind and joins it.  She also fights against the Indian Government and at the same time she had to run the household.  So what does Adil do? He had a neighbour.  He had a wood cutting mill in which wooden boxes were made.  So Adil started working here.  So ever since he came in touch with the people of Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind.  His entire mind had been washed. Now he worked in the wood mill for a few days and then one day when Adil was working inside this wood mill, there was an electrician named Mudasir Khan. Adil comes in touch with it. He was actually an OGW of Jaish-e-Mohammed. And this influences Adil and convinces him to join Jaish-e-Mohammed. And at that time, Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind was short of weapons and resources.  So because of this Adil joined Jaish-e-Mohammed. But when Adil joined Jaish-e-Mohammed, the same day Mudasir had told the commanders of Jaish-e-Mohammed that Adil could be very useful for our mission.  He is a very genuine boy and is filled with anger towards the Indian Forces.  Now all these things were going on and a few days later, i.e. on the sixth of November 2017, the Indian forces made Talha, who was sent by Masood Azhar, the commander, and killed him in an encounter. Now this thing which had happened was Masood's nephew and Masood was very frustrated about this.  When this incident happened, in the midst of this incident, Masood Azhar had also organized a rally etc. inside Pakistan. In which he had said in front of everyone that he will take revenge from the Indian Forces and will give a befitting reply.  And to take revenge for Talha, Masood called Usman and Umar from his four trustees and told them that now after Talha, you both have to go to Kashmir and take this fight forward and take revenge.  These Usman and Umar were the sons of Ibrahim Attar, the mastermind of the Qadaar hijacking. Both of them were also nephews of Masood.  So at this time they had decided that first Usman would cross the border and then Umar would go and whenever they crossed the border, they used to do it on the night of new moon, so on 11 January 2018, Usman was the first to cross the LOC from Hiragar Sector and reach Kashmir and after going to Kashmir, he became the commander of the South Kashmir area. This Usman who had arrived had one speciality.  He was a very good sniper. It could locate its target at night based on the mobile light. And as soon as Usman reached Kashmir, Indian forces noticed a pattern that those officers who were using mobile phones at that time were the ones who were shot at.  So, 3 months after Usman's arrival, on 13th April 2018, Masood Azar also sends Umar. You must remember this name, Umar. He is the mastermind of this entire Pulwama attack.  At that time these people used to cross the border wearing dark colours. So what does Omar do ?  Wearing a grey Calvin Klein T-shirt, he reaches Kashmir using a tunnel from Sukhmal side in Pakistan.  Now look, your question would be that how are these people crossing the LOC so easily and reaching Kashmir.  Is there no one to stop them?  So look, the entire area of ​​LOC is very complicated and in order to go from one side to the other, Jaish-e-Mohammed had built many 3 metre wide and 25 metre deep multiple tunnels below the LOC, no matter how many borders you build or fencing you do. These people used light cement in between while making it so that it does not get compressed and they used to plant trees etc. at the entry and exit points. So it would become very difficult to catch these tunnels. This is the border of Kathua and Sambha districts. In this entire area, Jaish-e-Mohammed had built many tunnels.  It was also very difficult to stop this.  And when these tunnels were caught, Pakistani products were also found inside these tunnels where terrorists used it.  Once a bottle of Fanta from Gujranwala, Pakistan was also found.  So using these tunnels, Umar reaches Bainula in Kashmir. And as soon as Umar reaches there there was an OGW Ashaq Ahmed Naingr.  He was already waiting there with a truck.  There were sacks of flour inside this truck and he was waiting with them so that he could hide among those sacks.  There was one Mahajan Flour Mill. From there he got all these sacks of flour filled.  So in this way, Umar and Usman both reach Kashmir. At that time there was an OGW named Abbas Rather in Kashmir. Its purpose is to arrange safe houses for terrorists inside Kashmir. It had a very big network.  And whenever Jaish-e-Mohammed used to send any terrorist from PoK, it was Abbas who was responsible for stopping them and whatever arrangement was made for changing their safe house from time to time, Abbas used to look after it all.  So he was the one who had made the arrangements for Usman and Umar also. Umar used to change two-three safe houses after a few days but after that there was a Kashmiri named Shakir Basar.   He makes his house a safe house and stays there for a long time.   The entire planning happens here.  Everything etc gathers here.  He will come forward now. Now when Umar was changing safe houses, once there was this man named Peer Tariq Ahmad. When his house was made a safe house and he stayed there, then as per the rule, the safe house has to be changed after every some time. But what happened was that Umar fell in love with Insha, the daughter of Pir Tariq.  So he starts staying here more often.  Umar also gave Insha a Redmi Note 5 Pro mobile. And at this time, all the phones he had bought were bought from Gulshan Mobile Shop in Bilal Badgam.  And after some time, these people also included Insha in their mission.  This is his photo from that time.  Now, on the other hand, Adil had also joined Jaish-e-Mohammed and what Jaish-e-Mohammed does for a major attack is that Adil and with him were 70 other young Kashmiris.  They call them for training in POK and their training is held in Balakot and Bahawalpur. Now as soon as this thing happens, after this on March 19, 2018, Adil and all his school friends disappear from their homes. Adil's family searches for him for many days.  But when it is not found, a report is filed at Kakapura police station in Pulwama district.  And everyone was searching for him for about 10-15 days. And then in the first week of April, Adil's photo suddenly appears on social media in which Adil is standing with an AK-47 and in it he announces that he has now joined Jaish-e-Mohammed and also tells his code name as Waqas Commando of Gundibag. Now when this image came, the Indian forces did not take it seriously and put it in the C category list of terrorists. Those in A category are more dangerous. Those in C category are less dangerous than that. But this Adil of C category was going to make a big splash in the future. Now after this, Adil and his friends reach PoK.  And after reaching PoK, their specialized training starts.  And when this entire training was going on, his trainer at that time was Abdul Rashid Ghazi.  And whenever the training started, it was their choice as to which category you want to select.  There are two categories one ist shaadi and the other is inggi masi. In this department, one gets training to be a suicide bomber and in Ingmasi, all the work of suicide fighters etc. is done. Adil had selected this marriage category. Here I was taught how to make this etc. Driving with a loaded RDX was taught and the entire training was completed here.  And when the entire training was going on, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was their trainer, liked Adil the most because he had more hatred for the Indian Forces than the others.  Secondly, he was even ready to sacrifice his life.  And Adil was a local from the place where Jaish-e-Hamad 's leadership was planning to attack. So he knew every inch of it. So when Adil's training is completed, he also crosses the Jammu Sambha Sector border and comes back to Kashmir.  Now from here, Usman, Umar, Adil all had reached Kashmir and now after this the attack was about to happen. Well, there was one more thing in this, all the people who were coming after crossing the border, NIA has also mentioned this in its charge sheet that these people were bringing with them in small quantities in their bags, military grade RDX, which is not available in the open market, around 20 to 25 kg. For example, when Umar had come, he had brought 25 kg of RDX with him and all this was at different locations inside R Kashmir, the OGWs used to handle it and all these things that I am telling you, you will find the link of it in the description, I am not telling anything out of my own will and see, now after this comes the date 30th October 2018 and on this day Usman who was a sniper and used to attack by seeing the light of the mobile was killed by the Indian Forces.  Now when he was killed by Indian forces, it was a big turning point due to which the planning of Pulwama attack got further triggered.  Masood Ahar's two most important family members.  The first one, Talha and the second one, Usman, both of them were killed.  And as soon as Masood Azar comes to know about this thing, Masood was very angry that day and he also sends a recorded message of 3 minutes 49 seconds to Umar.  This voice note basically says that there is no need to wait anymore.  Revenge must be taken as soon as possible.  And on top of the voice note itself he named this entire operation as ‘ Kiss Operation’.  Meaning a revenge operation.  And then after this, Masood Azhar, after talking to Umar, sends his close trusted bodyguard Mohammad Ismail, also known as Lambu Bhai, to Kashmir.  He also carries 11 to 12 kg of RDX on his back and reaches Kashmir.  And Masood Azhar gets approval for a VBID vehicle borne improvised explosive device based Fida. Look, all the militants etc. who enter Kashmir, it is in their hands to fire a bomb or if there is an informer of an Indian agency and they want to kill him, then they do not need approval for that. They can take on the spot decisions themselves.  But whenever a major military attack has to be carried out on a large convoy, approval is required from the leadership of Jaish-e-Mohammed and Pakistan's ISI as well.  So as soon as this plan gets approved, all these people who had reached Kashmir, start planning for VBID based Fida. And Adil Dar is selected to execute this entire attack and the money needed for this entire attack is deposited by Masood Azar in two bank accounts Alt Bank and Meezan Bank with Rs 10 lakh which reaches Umar through hawala. Some more transactions had taken place during the investigation. This cheque book which was seized is a copy of that. The money which they had transferred and circulated through the chat is the original copy of that WhatsApp chat.  So according to the plan, Adil would use the car to launch a VVID attack on the army convoy and for this, these people started collecting all the material so that a bomb could be made.  The attack had to be bigger.  So for so many days, they were bringing RDX from PoK in small quantities to different places in Kashmir, and Umar started collecting it at one place through his handlers.  And what do they do along with it?  Pulwama, Kuno, Avantipura, Lethpura had cement mines where gelatin sticks were used. These are basically a commercial explosive.  These also are very less in number when there is a need to make a blast. So what do these people do?  They take help from local OGWs and collect 500 gelatine sticks in batches of 5 to 10 kg by smuggling them. The sticks he had collected had ' Super Power 90' written on them and along with these he also collected other things like 30 kg silver aluminium powder, weighing machine, 80 kg ammonium nitrate and a blue coloured plastic drum from Kakapura market. They ordered ammonia through Amazon and when all the things had arrived, these people had to decide where it would be assembled.  So Umar mainly used to stay at Shakir's house or go to Insha's house.  So Umar decided to make a bomb at Shakir's house. And whatever stuff they had brought for him, there was a store on the roof of Shakir's house. Started collecting it right there. And along with this, Shakir was there on whose roof they were collecting all these things. It also had a furniture store above the highway. So Umar made Shakir sit at the furniture shop and he was given the task to note down the movement of all the army convoys coming on the highway in a notebook on a daily basis and pass on the information about everything. So this is what Shakir Daily used to do.  He used to note down everything and occasionally he would go to nearby areas on his scooter.  He used to make videos there and within a very short time, Shakir had remembered everything. He had found out that the blue truck with khaki trapulins carried luggage. Officers are in white gypsies. Soldiers travel in blue buses. And along with this, when Cornvoy is about to arrive, the ROP team arrives.  He had noted down everything and used to send every detail to Umar.  So one day on 27th January 2019, Shakir sends a video of the location of NH 44 highway to Umar.  And Umar would have loved this location as it also had an empty service lane around it.  There was less barricading.  So here it was very easy to take any unknown car on the highway. So these people fix this location so that whenever anyone comes to this place, they will attack.  Well, while they were doing all these things here, on the other hand the Indian intelligence agencies were getting back to back intelligence.  The first input came on January 2, 2019.  What mission is Jaish-e-Mohammed going to work on in South Kashmir?  This entire information was sent to the Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police and Inspector General of Police the same day. But nothing happened that day. Next day again Indian agencies prepared a complete report named Impending Danger.  In this he had mentioned that some big attack could happen in the CRPF camp. Then after 4 days, input came that local youths were going to attack using some IEDs. In this way, on January 18, input came that 20 terrorists had reached Avantipura and were about to attack.  Similarly, on January 21, January 24, even a day before the day the attack was to take place, an input had come.  In this way, a total of 11 intelligence reports came that a major attack was about to happen. You can pause the screen and read what was exactly written in those intelligence reports.  But no action takes place.  Now after this all the material was collected. But a car was also needed for the attack.  So in the last week of January, Umar was an OGW named Sajjad.  He gives him the task to buy a car in which two large containers can fit. What does Sajjad do?  He buys a 2011 model PL Blue Eco car with registration number JK03C186 for ₹1,85,000 and immediately after purchasing it, he erases the chassis number of the car.  He takes it to Shakir's house where the entire assembly was to take place and parks it there. Now what happens next is that Umar comes to know from one of his sources that a large convoy of CRPF is going to arrive on the Sixth of February 2019. So whatever these people were making, they sped up the whole process a lot.  Umar was the one who was making this entire bomb because Umar had taken training in making VBID in Sangin, Afghanistan.  So Umar himself assembled the entire bomb.  Everyone else there was helping.  So after this, he started coating ammonium nitrate gelatin sticks with ammonium powder, layer by layer, in a blue container and an orange container and adding them to the container layer by layer.  A total of 200 kg of explosives was prepared and 40 kg was put into an orange container and 160 kg was put into a blue container and fitted in the middle seat of the car and the main switch which operated it was placed near the steering wheel of the car.  Now the entire car was ready.  Now these people were just waiting for the exact date of the CRPF convene and said that they would do it on the day they would know. They had no regrets during the time they were making it. He was not scared at all, in fact he even had fun while making it.   While making the film, they used to apply silver aluminium powder on their hair, face and clothes and then get their photographs taken.  This is his original photo.  While this whole process was going on, these people were also mentally preparing Adil so that Adil does not back out at the last moment.  And in case Adil backs out, he had kept a man named Yawar Ahmed Nazar ready as a backup.  They had to show this entire track in such a way that the youth of Kashmir is doing this because they are fed up with the Indian Government.  Pakistan has no role in this.  And for this reason they had already decided that they would get a video made from Adil in advance and release it after the attack.  So what they do for this is that on 27th January 2019, Umar takes Adil to Insha's house.  He gives a script to Adil that a video has to be made and after reading this script he has to speak like this.  Adil is made ready.  The M4 rifle is handed over.  A banner of Jaish-e-Mohammed is put up at the back. And after that the video making starts again. This is that image. You will also find the full video on YouTube.  But a problem arises while making the video. Adil was not able to speak the script that is in the video. When Adil is unable to speak even after trying a lot. So these people keep Adil in the video and put someone else's voice over. That's why Adil was just talking in the video.  The script was read by someone else.  So this was going on here on this side. What was happening on the other side was that when soldiers go on holiday, after coming back they gather at the transit camps and then go to their respective postings through the convoy.  Similarly, this Jammu Transit Camp is situated behind the Jammu Railway Station.  Here the CRPF jawans who were returning from holidays were gathering and it was decided that after arriving here, in the first week of February, their convoy would be sent towards Srinagar via NH 44 Highway. They had to go towards Srinagar from Jammu Transit Camp. This Jammu transit camp, where soldiers were gathering, had a capacity of 1000 soldiers.  But he was stopped here.  There were many reasons for that. Firstly, intelligence reports were coming in that Cornway could be attacked.  Secondly, there were some sensitive dates at this time also.  Like Fifth of February.  Kashmir Solidarity Day is celebrated on this day. And then, on 9th and 11th February, the death anniversaries of Maqbool Bhatt and Afzal Guru were coming, these were very sensitive dates.  So at this time the chances of attack increases significantly.  So due to this, they were being stopped and it was being decided on which date they should be sent.  But the problem was that due to the delay, the soldiers present at the Jammu transit camp were gathering beyond their capacity. So after multiple meetings it was decided that the CRPF convoy will be sent on Sixth of February 2019.  There will be no further waiting.  And then as soon as this date is decided on the Fourth of February 2019, heavy snowfall starts on this very day and the snowfall does not stop even on the next day i.e. Fifth of February and because of this the NH 44 highway gets blocked.  Secondly, on the same day i.e. on Fifth of February 2019, Masood Azhar held a rally in Peshawar, Pakistan.  In that also he talked about an attack in Pulwama. This cornboy had to pass through the same area. So after seeing all these things the convoy was stopped and the number of soldiers at Jammu transit camp was increasing.  Now when this situation was happening, the then Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satyapal Malik, had later said in an interview that at that time he had told the government to get the airlift done.  But he said that the government did not listen to him.  Now after this the snowfall stops and by 13th of February the NH 44 highway is cleared. And then when there is no option left, the date is fixed that on 14th of February 2019, the CRPF convoy will leave from Jammu Transit Camp. And when all this is finalised, then on the same day, 13th of February 2019, the CRPF unit is also informed that your convoy has to leave at 3:30 in the morning the next day. This convoy had CRPF soldiers in 78 buses.  Which is 271 Km through NH 44 highway.  Had to complete the journey of. Normally the cornvoys are not so big but for so many days, because of the wait, the crowd had become very large.  So that is why permission was granted for this big convoy.  Now on the next day i.e. on 14th February 2019 at 3:30 in the morning, CRPF buses, 15 trucks, two ITBP buses, a spare bus, recovery van, ambulance and at the end, the head assistant commandant of the convoy started getting ready to leave in his white gypsy. And just before this convoy left, two things happened.  In this convoy, bus number five, which was blue in colour and had the number HR 490637, was going to be attacked later. Head Constable Kripal Singh was to drive it and as his daughter was getting married, he had applied for leave.  So everyone was discussing that if by mistake there is snowfall again then they might miss their daughter 's wedding.  So at such a time Jaimal Singh said to himself that I will drive the bus in his place.  You should not take the risk of your daughter's marriage.  Secondly, in the same bus number five, CRPF constable Thaka Belkar from Ahmednagar, Maharashtra was also going to get married after 10 days.  So he had taken leave.  So their leave gets approved just before the convoy departs. So at the last moment they got off from bus number five and this coincidence was such that later both their lives were saved.  Now the CRPF convoy had to leave from here in some time. Whenever a convoy leaves, before it leaves, as per the rules, there are anti-sabotage checks which are done by the road opening parties i.e. the accused. What happens in this is that soldiers are sent on the convoy route. First the accused checks the entire route and secures that there is no issue etc. After the accused says okay, the convoy leaves.  So when this convoy also had to leave, the team of the accused went out to check the NH 44 highway. This team of the accused had been investigating the 10 Km area of ​​NH 44 till Hathi Mod on the highway for years. It had to be checked from 262.2 milestone to 272.2 milestone.  So the accused 's team checks this route and takes position at a total of 10 points. And one point which Laddu Board had at 272 milestone. Here Assistant Sub Inspector Mohan Lal was seated with his team at 7:15 so that if any suspicious activity is seen then immediate action can be taken.  Now this was going on here.  On the other hand, Umar had got his vehicle ready and was waiting for the CRPF convoy to arrive on NH 44.  Then what happens is that Shakir Basir who was doing Reiki etc. from his furniture shop.  When its sight falls on NH 44, it sees that the accused is being deployed. Seeing the accused he understands that the convoy is going to arrive today. He immediately calls Umar from there and tells him to get ready and immediately Umar and all his people get ready.  Now the convoy starts moving from here and after some time the convoy crosses the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Tunnel and reaches Peera.  There was no problem till now. Earlier, in the area called Peera, the convoy used to stop here and have lunch etc.  But so much intelligence input had come.  So considering it a prone area, those who used to stop here for lunch did not stop here.  Now when this convoy was moving, the local traffic around it was also moving along.  This happened long before the fact that when the cornvoy was on, local traffic was not allowed due to security reasons.  But in 2003, the Jammu and Kashmir Government strongly opposed this and the traffic used to travel on the entire road due to the cornvoy.  So this rule was removed at that time. So that's why the local traffic was also moving around the buses of Cornvoy. Because at that time, the more important thing than the lives of the soldiers was that people should not be late.  Now after this, at 2:02, the convoy turns left from the highway and reaches Kazigund Transit Camp.  There was no problem even here. After reaching the Qazigund transit camp, the CRPF soldiers who were posted in Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian areas disembark there.  Now after this, the rest of the convoy had to move ahead and the area ahead was very sensitive.  The history of this area has been that most of the attacks have taken place on Cornvoy.  Therefore, a rule was already made that whenever the cornboy passes through this area, he will travel only in a semi-bullet proof bus, otherwise he will not go.  But the problem was that there was only a 15 cm bullet proof bus and the crowd was very large. So for this, normal buses were also allowed to go ahead. Bus number five was not bullet proof.  And while we were leaving this Qazigund transit camp, another thing happened.  When the convoy started moving forward from here, the CRPF constable Surendra Yadav, who was sitting in bus number five, his friend was forcefully calling him from behind and asking him to come near him and he too got annoyed and got down and went to his friend. He had no idea at that time that his life was going to be saved by this one thing because within a few moments everything in this bus number five was going to be destroyed and after Surendra Yadav got down, there were 39 soldiers inside this bus. Now at 2:42 the convoy had left Qazigund transit camp.  Someone was listening to a song.  A soldier was on a video call and some people were talking among themselves and at the same time, the accused's team was supporting the entire convoy at different strategic points and both sides of the highway were standing on alert and the convoy was moving ahead.  Now, on the other hand, Umar sends Adil away in the car that was with Shakir. And after walking a little further, when Hajibal Bridge arrives, Shakir hugs Adil here and Adil takes off his watch and gives it to Shakir as a token that when I die, this will remind you of me. And then after this, Adil drives alone from Hajibal Bridge to attack.  Let me explain the entire map to you once. This entire area is within Pulwama district.  This is the complete NH 44 highway here.  The CRPF convoy was moving from this side, from Jammu Transit towards Srinagar. Next to it, there is a road which was connected to NH 44 from here.  This point is called Laddu turn. ASI was here and the other road was coming here from Hajibal Bridge. Now Adil moves across this bridge.  On the other hand, the CRPF convoy was moving on NH 44.  Now from here Adil moves ahead on this road.  But further ahead it can see the police barricading etc.  So it takes a U-turn and here the entry from Ladu turn takes the direction towards NH 44.  By then one or two CRPF buses had left.  I had told you in the beginning that ASI Mohan Lal was sitting at the Laddu turn point and monitoring it.  So as soon as they see a car, they get alert and they notice that this car, which is Adil's, is moving forward at a very abnormal speed and is trying to enter the convoy and the style in which the car was moving makes them suspicious of this car. At 2:50, after seeing the car, a coded message 44 starts flashing on the wireless frequency and CRPF walkie-talkie. This is a high alert signal. Everybody becomes alert.  ASI Mohan Lal immediately stops him by blowing the whistle. But Adil doesn't stop the car, instead he speeds it up.  While chasing the car, ASI Mohan Lal also started firing at it.  And as soon as the firing starts, this car leaves bus number three and hits bus number five. Then he starts moving left and right and at 3:15 he reaches the 272 milestone.  If I talk about the exact location, it hits near Ledpura village in Pampore tehsil of Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir. The attack was so massive that bus number five was completely destroyed.  The buses in front and behind also get damaged.  When the explosion happened, 10 Km.  The sound of the explosion was heard from a distance. Pieces of the bus and body parts of soldiers fell up to a distance of 500 to 600 meters. I cannot tell you much. From the photo of the bus you can guess what might have happened to the soldiers sitting inside.  39 CRPF jawans and one ASI Mohan Lal who were pursuing the attackers; total 40 soldiers were martyred and more than 20 were injured.  This was not a normal thing.  This was a very big attack.  Now as soon as this happens in Pulwama, the rescue team, Counter Terrorism Tactics, CTT, local CRPF, CFSL, Central Forensic Science Laboratory from Chandigarh and Delhi, all these teams reach the location to find out how it happened and who did it, nothing was left, everything had turned into small pieces.  Now when the search operation started, the CFSL team at that time found the crankshaft of a car. They immediately called the expert team of Maruti company which does technical inspection, so that it could be found out to whom Maruti had sold the car. At the same time, lab results also revealed what material was used.  What type of person was I?  Everything had come to the fore.  And what did the spokesperson of Jaish-e-Mohammed do after some time on the same day, 14th February 2019 at 4:30 pm?  There is a news agency in Srinagar named Global News Service. Sent him a video on WhatsApp. He sent the same video of Adil and this video started going viral very fast. This video also reaches the security forces.  As soon as the Indian forces saw the video, they understood that Adil was in the video because they had arrested him several times before and had kept him in the C category list.  When we got the full report, we found out that he had also crossed the border and gone to PoK.   I have also taken training etc.  Everything about him becomes known, how much he has brought into Kashmir.  This entire case was being led by Manipur cadre IPS Rakesh Palwal.   The video was not getting synced and because of this they were doubting whether the attack was carried out by someone else from Pakistan and they just got the video made by Adil from Kashmir so that it appeared that the attack was carried out by a Kashmiri youth. So after this the video was sent to the FBI of America on the same day and the FBI helped in this and told that the WhatsApp account from which Adil's video was sent belongs to a lady in Kashmir, Jameela, there was a SIM issue on her ID and along with this it also came to light that voice over has been done in this video.  Now the Indian agency arrived to look for Jameela. So it came to light that he had already died.  The FBI tracked the location of the WhatsApp account user.  So this location turned out to be Muzaffarabad, across the LoC, and it also came to light that those who planned Pulwama were in touch with him, and from here, for the first time, we get a small official proof that Pakistan is also involved in this.  Now as soon as the name of Pakistan came up, Pakistani actors and singers were banned.  India stopped trading.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of G7 nations has put Pakistan in the grey list.  And the leaders of different political parties of India used their Brahmastra which caused maximum damage. He condemned it in strong words.  Now, when all these things were being investigated, Maruti people also sent the report of the crankshaft in which the number was erased from many places, but even after that, they were able to find it and the engine number was also found out. You can see it on the screen.   The car used in the attack was bought and sold seven times.  And what do Indian agencies do?  I started catching the wires of the car along with the line and when I reached the last wire, I found out that Danish Rashid had sold this car through Sajjad Maqbool Bhatt and had taken a commission of ₹ 15,000.  Now when Sajjad's name came up and the Indian agency went to arrest him, he was missing from his house and he too had posted a photo on social media with an AK-47 in Burhanwani style and had gone towards PoK.  Now when Sajjad is also not found, the investigation stops again.  There was a lot of anger all over India.  The agencies had to catch him in a very short time and it was not possible just by taking the name of Pakistan.  Solid proofs also had to be collected. Now after this, Rakesh Balwal of NIA thought that a search operation should be started in the areas around the place where this incident took place. Maybe we can find something in it.  But the problem here was that this area was a little sensitive.  Whenever such search operations are carried out here, stone pelting etc. starts. But Rakesh Balwal takes special permission from Delhi and then on 20 January 2019, 100 NIA officers and 400 CRPF soldiers take him with them and start the search operation and this thing works.  The key to a car was found in the snow next to the Jhelum River, 250 metres from where the incident took place. 10261 was written on it and some bone pieces were found next to it. Rakesh Balwal immediately matches those bone pieces with the DNA of Adil's father and it matches.  So this confirms that this attack was carried out by Adil and the details of the car through which it was done had already been revealed.  But it could not be ascertained which mastermind from Pakistan was involved in this. Because it was not known at all where the RDX came from.  Because RDX is not found in such fields that some local Kashmiri takes it and blows up the car.  So the most important task was to find out who were the people from Pakistan behind this. Umar, who had done all this, changed his location and disappeared. Rest of this search operation and investigation was going on here.  At the same time, the Air Force entered Pakistan and struck the Khyber Pakhtun area of ​​Balakot where terror camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed were operating. There were air strikes etc. also there.  So what happens after this is that inside Kashmir, Indian forces are encountering the handlers of Jaish-e-Mohammed one after the other. Meanwhile, on June 18, 2019, Sajjad Bhatt, who had arranged the Eco car, was also found.  He is also killed in Marhama Bijhara area. But as you already know the main guy behind this was Umar.  He was still alive.  And the manner in which Umar was killed is a big coincidence in itself.  What actually happened was that Umar had been threatening the policemen several times before this attack.  Umar from Random Number was once a police officer in Pulwama long ago.  I sent him a message on WhatsApp. So an emoji of a pistol was made in it and below it was written, Hi jaanu, I will come to your house and kill you.  And after sending this message this number was switched off. So that police officer had saved this number with 'Hi Jaanu' and got it tracked by the cyber cell. And this message that Umar had sent later on proves to be costly for him. Because after this attack, Umar needed the numbers to talk urgently. So what did Omar do? After the attack, i.e. on 27 March 2019, Umar opens his 'Hi Jaanu' number and as soon as the number opens, the message 'Hi Jaanu' gets reflected in the monitoring system of the cyber cell and Umar's location, which was Sutsu Kalan, South West of Nowgam, was detected towards Batgam and then Umar is killed at this location. Now Umar was killed but the Indian forces had no idea that they had accidentally killed the mastermind of Pulwama. Because Umar's name in Indian records was Idrish Bhai and he had created a fake ID in the same name. When he was encountered, an M4 rifle and iPhone Samsung Note S9 Plus were recovered from him.  But he had broken both these phones before the encounter took place. So the police did not take this encounter seriously.  Everyone's focus was on finding the mastermind of Pulwama. And the broken mobile phones etc. that were found with Umar were kept as is at the Jammu and Kashmir Police Station.   Didn't even get any check done.  So what I mean to say is that at this time the Indian agencies were searching for the person who had already been killed. Searched for it for many months. But when nothing was found, then in July 2019, NIA head Rakesh Balwal, fed up, said that nothing was being found like this.  Let's open old cases. Maybe we can get some lead from that.  Now after this all the old cases start getting opened. But Rakesh Balwal's attention goes towards this 'Hai Jaanu' case of Idrish.  They feel that this Idrish Bhai could be a big fish. And they say this because when his encounter took place, an M4 rifle was recovered from him.  Which is generally used by the leadership of Jaish-e-Mohammed.  The rest of them carry AK-47 and he also wore clothes like Addas T-shirt etc.  So they think that this person could definitely be a big commander. Now when the case was reopened, Rakesh Balwal sent the phones found at the time of Umar's encounter to India's top computer forensic and cyber security agency CERT-IN for analysis.  The team of CertainTeed worked hard for several days to extract each and every detail of the phone and while they were extracting these details , they seemed to have hit a huge jackpot. Before breaking these mobiles, Umar had deleted all the data but as soon as we buy a new mobile, he fetches the data of the old mobile from the cloud.  So the same thing happened in this case also. In this way, Certain's team obtained more than 100 GB of data from 2014 till date. 16 hours of voice notes related to the planning of Pulwama, text messages, videos of the reconnaissance of the location, everything was found.  And as soon as this comes to light, the NIA team reaches there and analyses all the data for the next 14 hours and then they find out that Idrish Bhai is none other than the nephew of Pulwama mastermind Masood Azhar and the mastermind behind the hijacking of the plane is his son Umar who made it and then got the attack done by Adil, this is his Pakistani ID card and this is a photocopy of his cheque book. Was RDX used? Through which route was the RDX collected? How was the entire attack coordinated? 100 calls were also received at the time of this attack.   When NIA traced these numbers, it was found that these numbers were being used in different cities of Pakistan and coordination was going on from the same numbers at that time also. A voice note was also found in which someone was coordinating with Umar at the time of the attack and was also asking him to destroy the mobile and make a video.  NIAO thought it was the Roff Python uncle from Pakistan. So NIA matched this voice sample with the voice sample of Rauf Chacha available in open source. So it was an exact match.  And this became a big proof of Pakistan's involvement.  Along with this, intimate photos of the mastermind Umar with Insha in Kashmir were also found inside this mobile.  When he was making it, he used to get himself photographed with silver etc. applied on his face. I found those photos. Another photo was found in which the car from which the attack took place was parked in front of a house.  That was Shakir Basir's house where it was prohibited.  So the NIA team reaches his house.  The location of his house was Kausar Colony Bahawalpur and on 7 December 2019, Shakir Basir was arrested. And there were many photos of Umar and Insha in the mobile. So the NIA team reaches Insha's house and when they reach Insha's house, the NIA finds a red-black colored wooden almirah.  The same almirah which was seen under the Jaish-e-Mohammed banner in Adildar's video. So NIA arrests Insha and her father Peer Tariq Shah on 3 March 2020.  Similarly, 19-year-old Owais Ul Islam, who was preparing for NEET through Amazon account, was also arrested on March 7, 2020. Who was providing all the goods from Amazon account. Similarly, Mohammad Abbas, who had a huge network of safe houses, was caught.  Bilal Kuchhe was caught through Gulshan Mobile Shop. He, who used to work with Adil, had also gone to PoK.   In this way, all the people who were involved in Kashmir were caught and then they were made to reveal every single thing. Initially Insha was calling Umar her brother and was refusing. But when NIA showed the photos and voice notes, Insha also had to accept all these things and she told each and every thing.  Shakir was the toughest among all these people.  He was not telling anything.  But what does Rakesh Balwal do after some time? Shows Shakir the intimate photo of Umar and Insha. So Shakir was very shocked about this thing. Because he considered Umar to be very good.  Umar was married. So Shakir was so hurt by this thing that after some time he told the whole planning to NIA. And then on 25th of August 2020, NIA decodes the whole case and files a charge sheet of 13,800 pages in the NIA court and there is a crackdown all over Kashmir. And everyone who was involved in this gets punished.
