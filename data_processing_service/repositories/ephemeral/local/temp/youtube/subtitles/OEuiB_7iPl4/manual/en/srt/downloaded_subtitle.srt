1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
10 Km  The sound of the explosion was heard far away

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,759
and pieces flew up to 400 metres away.  Whichever

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,920
soldier was using the mobile phone at night, he got

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,120
shot because the sniper was

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,120
shooting by looking at the light.   A

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,279

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
tunnel had been built beneath the entire area of ​​Kathua and Sama districts.  But Satyapal

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,720
Malik complicated the matter by saying that no,

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,720
I had said to get him airlifted from there.   I am

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,760
messaging the police saying hi jaanu.

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,800
Using two accounts from Pakistan, ₹1 lakh was

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,280
transferred there.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,360
All those who crossed the border brought more than 20 kg of RDX on their backs.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,280
In the video of Adil, Adil was

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,320
just talking.  Later it became known

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,480
that someone else was speaking from behind.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
When the intimate photos of Insha and Umar were shown from inside the mobile,

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Shakir got shocked and

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,640
revealed everything.   The

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,500
soldier was standing with a gun on the border, not for his home land.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,359
[Music]

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,519
See,

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,920
in today's time, along with physical health, it is also important to take care of oral health.

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,799
And your teeth come first in oral health.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,280
If your teeth are crooked

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,600
or have gaps between them, food gets

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,680
stuck in them and is not easily cleaned.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,240
Due to which, the

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
risk of cavities and gum diseases increases due to the increase in bacteria

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,479
and sometimes

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
your confidence also remains low due to crooked teeth.  Now the

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,759
best solution to this problem is Tootsie teeth

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,880
aligners.  These aligners fix your misaligned teeth in 6 to 12 months.   It is

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,119

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
very comfortable to wear and is

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,159
completely invisible.  And the best part is

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,960
that these aligners are removable.  So no food

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,600
restrictions.  Take off the aligners, eat whatever you want

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,600
and wear them back.  The

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,560
process of ordering these aligners is also quite simple.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,520

Your aligners are delivered to your home a few days after the scan.

free teeth scan and doctor consultation.  The

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,920
link is in the description.  So let's

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,480
come back to the topic.  See,

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,040
due to the Kandahar hijacking incident on 31 December 1999,

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,720
India had to leave Masood Azhar

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,480
inside Afghanistan.  Now Masood Azhar was

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
released in Afghanistan

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
but after 2 months of his release, that is

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,680
in March 200, he reached

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
Bahawalpur in Pakistan and after reaching here,

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,160
Pakistan's ISI gives a grand welcome to Masood Azhar.

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,959
A rally was also taken out and

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,120
standing in this rally, Masood Azhar

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
officially launched Jaish-e-Mohammed

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
and said that the people of Jaish-e-Mohammed will

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
separate Kashmir from India.

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Now Jaish-e-Mohammed was launched

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,840
and for the next 5 years after its launch,

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
Jaish-e-Mohammed

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,160
recruited Kashmiris.  Got training etc. from ISI etc.

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,160
Many attacks were carried out and the

73
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,000
Parliament attack etc. all

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
happened within these 5 years.  And

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,480
in the years to come, Jaish-e-Mohammed

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,319

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
changed its model and its way of working from time to time in Kashmir.  But the only priority of Jaish-e-Mohammed was to

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
hire young Kashmiris, train them and carry out

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,319
attacks in India.  Because the

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
message through it was that Kashmiris are

83
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,360
standing against India and

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,200
Pakistan has nothing to do with it.

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
So in the coming years, Jaish-e-Mohammed had established

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
its foothold in Kashmir.

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,400
But after this, by the year 2015, something

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,959
different happened.  Before this, those who

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,040
became commanders etc. used to

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,440
live in hiding inside Kashmir.  Used to keep a low profile.

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,959
But at this time Burhan Wali

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,599
showed his militancy in a new style.

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,080
He was the first militant who, instead of hiding,

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,560
posted openly on social media.   Used to

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
challenge Indian forces.  He used to

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,799
post before attacking.  And because of this,

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
it became very famous in Kashmir within a very short time.

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
And this pushed

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,799
young Kashmiris towards militancy in a very short time.

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,799
Now

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,720
Burhanwani's way of working

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
suited Jaish-e-Mohammed very much.  But

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,680
before Jaish-e-Mohammed could think of anything, Burhanwani was killed

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
by Indian forces on 8th of July 2016.

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
And because of this the

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,360
atmosphere inside Kashmir became very bad.

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,519
And this was the time when Masood Azhar

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
decided that this is the best time to launch

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
more attacks inside Kashmir.  Now Masood Azhar

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,040
was in Pakistan and

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
inside Pakistan, Masood Azhar had five most trusted

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,320
people.  Umar Farooq, Usman Haider, Talha

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,720
Masood, Ismail Alvi who is also known as Lambu Bhai.

114
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,040
and Abdul Rashid Ghazi.  So these

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
five guys were great trustees of Masood Azar.

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
And among these five, Talha,

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,600
Usman and Umar were from Masood Ahar's

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
family.  He had nephews.  So when

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,560
Burhan Wani died, Masood Azhar

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,960
sent Talha Masood from Pakistan to Kashmir in the beginning of the year 2017

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,880
and made him the commander of the South Division of Kashmir.

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,800
Talha was given the task to get as

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
many young

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Kashmiris as possible to join Jaish-e-Mohammed in this area

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,320
and expand the network of OGWs.

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,720
See, OGW means over ground worker.

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Jaish Mohammed had

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
created a network of local people inside Kashmir.  These

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,919
included those Kashmiris who did

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
not want to take up arms openly against the Indian Forces.

132
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520
But providing shelter to the

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
other terrorists in Kashmir who fought against the Indian forces

134
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,680
, providing them the

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,639
location and small intel about the Indian forces,

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,360
handling logistics, arranging safe houses,

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,759
all these tasks were done by OGWs.

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
So Jaish-e-Mohammed

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
wanted to expand this network further.  He used to play very important roles.

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
Whenever the OGW network is

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
strong, the attack becomes easier.

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
And Jaish-e-Mohammed preferred to

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,919

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
hire local drivers, people running shops in local markets as OGWs because it becomes easier to get OGWs to perform their tasks through such people

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600

147
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,000
and there is less suspicion on them.  Now

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
see, Adildar enters in the same year i.e. in 2017.

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Which

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
is the root of this entire Pulwama attack.  So see, there is

151
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,759

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,919
a village in Kakapura area of ​​Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir.

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
Gundibag.  There is a school here, Government

154
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,080
Higher Secondary School, and

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
Adildar was studying in 12th class in this school.

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,080
At that time no one had thought that

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,280
this boy studying in 12th was going to launch

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,520
such a big attack in the future.  In

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,639
this school, apart from Adil,

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,720
he had two more friends.  Tausif and Wasim, out

161
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
of these Tausif was completely brainwashed.

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
His elder brother had also

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
joined militancy.  Just a few

164
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
days ago.  He too was shot by the Indian forces,

165
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
so Tausif

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,039
plays a very important role in influencing Adil and Wasim about

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,240
how wrong the Indian Army is doing.  So, see, these three were

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
studying in this school and

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
what happens is that one day, Adil was coming from school

171
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,280
and by mistake, the

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Indian forces pick him up in a stone pending case.  She

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,600
keeps it for a few days and then

174
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,840
leaves it.  Now there were many other reasons behind picking him up

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,479
because when Burhan Wani was killed,

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
Adil and his two friends used to go for

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,520
protests daily and would pelt

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
stones at Kakapura and Lethpura and then

179
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,919
return home. So, in all this,

180
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,759
they have been arrested several times for stone pelting and were

181
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,360
put in jail and then

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,280
released after some time.

183
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
Similarly, one day Adil was shot in his leg

184
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,199
and because of the bullet injury,

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,880
he was on bed rest for several months and was

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,880
admitted to the hospital and because of this he

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
missed school as well. Now, after a few months,

188
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,520
Adil's heart gets better but

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,240
after recovery, he does two things.  One even drops

190
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,120
out of school altogether.  The second

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Ansar comes in contact with Ghazwat ul Hind

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,280
and joins it.  She also

193
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,199
fights against the Indian Government and at the same time she had to

194
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
run the household.  So what does Adil do?

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
He had a neighbour.  He had a wood cutting mill

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,080
in which wooden boxes were made.  So

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,720
Adil started working here.  So ever since he

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560

199
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
came in touch with the people of Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind.  His entire mind had been washed.

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Now he worked in the wood mill for a few days

201
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
and then one day when Adil was working inside this wood mill, there was

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,120
an

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,520
electrician named Mudasir Khan.

204
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,720
Adil comes in touch with it.

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,560
He was actually an OGW of Jaish-e-Mohammed.

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
And this influences Adil and

207
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,879
convinces him to join Jaish-e-Mohammed.

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
And at that time, Ansar Ghazwat ul

209
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,680
Hind was short of weapons and

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,080
resources.  So

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
because of this Adil joined Jaish-e-Mohammed.

212
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
But when Adil joined Jaish-e-Mohammed, the

213
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,160
same day Mudasir had

214
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,160
told the commanders of Jaish-e-Mohammed

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
that Adil could be very useful for our mission.  He is a

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
very genuine boy

217
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,080
and is filled with anger

218
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
towards the Indian Forces.  Now all these

219
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,280
things were going on and a few days later, i.e. on the

220
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
sixth of November 2017, the Indian

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
forces made Talha, who was sent by Masood Azhar, the

222
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,120
commander, and killed him in an encounter.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,599
Now this thing which had happened was Masood's

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
nephew and Masood was

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
very frustrated about this.  When this incident

226
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839
happened, in the midst of this incident,

227
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,760
Masood Azhar had also organized a rally etc. inside Pakistan.

228
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
In which he had said in front of everyone

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,920
that he will take revenge from the Indian Forces

230
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,880
and will give a befitting reply.  And to

231
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
take revenge for Talha, Masood

232
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,000

233
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
called Usman and Umar from his four trustees and told them that

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
now after Talha, you both have to

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
go to Kashmir and take this fight forward and

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,839
take revenge.  These Usman and Umar were the

237
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,240

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
sons of Ibrahim Attar, the mastermind of the Qadaar hijacking.

239
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
Both of them were also nephews of Masood.  So at this time

240
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,519
they had decided that first

241
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Usman would cross the border and

242
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,760
then Umar would go and whenever they

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
crossed the border, they used to do it on the night of new moon, so on

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,800
11 January 2018, Usman was the first to

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
cross the LOC from Hiragar Sector and

246
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
reach Kashmir and after going to Kashmir, he became the

247
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
commander of the South Kashmir area.

248
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,959
This Usman who had arrived had

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,200
one speciality.  He was a very good sniper.

250
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,519
It could locate its target at night based on the mobile light.

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,680
And as soon as

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,760
Usman reached Kashmir, Indian

253
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
forces noticed a pattern that those

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,560
officers who were using mobile phones at that time were the

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,839
ones who were shot at.  So,

256
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
3 months after Usman's arrival, on 13th April 2018,

257
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,640
Masood Azar also sends Umar.

258
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,640
You must remember this name, Umar.

259
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,680
He is the mastermind of this entire Pulwama attack.  At

260
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,760
that time these people used to cross the border wearing dark colours.

261
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,320
So what does Omar do

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,800
?  Wearing a grey Calvin Klein T-shirt, he reaches

263
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,440
Kashmir using a tunnel from Sukhmal side in Pakistan.  Now

265
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,360
look, your question would be that how are

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
these people crossing the LOC so easily and

267
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
reaching Kashmir.  Is there no one to stop

268
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
them?  So look, the

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
entire area of ​​LOC is very

270
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,680
complicated and in order to go from one

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,399
side to the other, Jaish-e-Mohammed had built many 3

272
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,360

273
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,959

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,959
metre wide and 25 metre deep multiple

275
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,800
tunnels below the LOC, no matter how many borders you build or fencing you do.

276
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,600
These people used light cement in between while making it so that

277
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,360
it does not get compressed and they used to plant trees etc. at the entry and exit points.

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,279
So it would become

279
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,279
very difficult to catch these tunnels.

280
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,200
This is the border of Kathua and Sambha districts.

281
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,680
In this entire area,

282
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,519
Jaish-e-Mohammed had built many tunnels.  It was

283
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,680
also very difficult to stop this.  And

284
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
when these tunnels were caught,

285
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,519
Pakistani products were also found inside these tunnels

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,560
where terrorists used it.  Once a

287
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,560
bottle of Fanta from Gujranwala, Pakistan was

288
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
also found.  So using these tunnels,

289
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,279
Umar reaches Bainula in Kashmir.

290
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,880
And as soon as Umar reaches there there

291
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,560
was an OGW Ashaq Ahmed Naingr.  He was already

292
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,120
waiting there with a truck.  There were

293
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,040
sacks of flour inside this truck and he was

294
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
waiting with them so that

295
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
he could hide among those sacks.  There was one Mahajan Flour Mill.

296
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
From there he got all these sacks of flour

297
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,240
filled.  So in this way, Umar and Usman

298
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,320
both reach Kashmir.

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,720
At that time there was an OGW named Abbas Rather in Kashmir.

300
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
Its purpose is to

301
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,480
arrange safe houses for terrorists inside Kashmir.

302
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,959
It had a very big network.  And

303
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,040
whenever Jaish-e-Mohammed used to send any terrorist from PoK, it

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,040
was Abbas who was responsible

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
for stopping them and whatever arrangement was made for changing their safe house from time to time,

306
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,640

307
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
Abbas used to look after it all.  So

308
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,600
he was the one who had made the arrangements for Usman and Umar also.

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,360
Umar used to change two-three safe houses

310
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,720
after a few days but

311
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,800
after that there was a Kashmiri named Shakir Basar.   He

312
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
makes his house a safe house

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,040
and stays there for a long time.   The

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
entire planning happens here.  Everything etc

315
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,200
gathers here.  He will come forward now.

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,440
Now when Umar was changing safe houses,

317
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
once there was this man named Peer Tariq Ahmad.

318
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
When his house was made a safe house and he stayed there, then

319
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,839
as per the rule, the safe house has to be

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,920
changed after every some time.

321
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,639
But what happened was that Umar fell in

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,320
love with Insha, the daughter of Pir Tariq.  So he

323
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,720
starts staying here more often.  Umar

324
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,720
also gave Insha a Redmi Note 5 Pro mobile.

325
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,920
And at this time, all the phones he had

326
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,320
bought were

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,560
bought from Gulshan Mobile Shop in Bilal Badgam.  And

328
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
after some time,

329
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,240
these people also included Insha in their mission.  This

330
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,839
is his photo from that time.  Now, on the other hand, Adil had

331
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
also joined Jaish-e-Mohammed

332
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
and

333
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,959
what Jaish-e-Mohammed does for a major attack is that Adil and

334
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,880
with him were 70 other young Kashmiris.  They

335
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,880
call them for training in POK

336
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,399
and their training is

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,399
held in Balakot and Bahawalpur.

338
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,160
Now as soon as this thing happens, after this on

339
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,079
March 19, 2018, Adil and all his school friends

340
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,920
disappear from their homes.

341
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,839
Adil's family

342
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
searches for him for many days.  But when it is not found,

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,760

344
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,240
a report is filed at Kakapura police station in Pulwama district.  And

345
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,800
everyone was searching for him for about 10-15 days.

346
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,440
And then in the first week of April,

347
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,399
Adil's photo suddenly appears on social media

348
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
in which Adil is standing with an AK-47 and in it

349
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,920
he announces that he has now

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,279
joined Jaish-e-Mohammed and

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,519
also tells his code name as Waqas Commando of Gundibag.

352
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,839
Now when this image came, the Indian forces did

353
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,920
not take it seriously and

354
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,920
put it in the C category list of terrorists.

355
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
Those in A category are more dangerous.

356
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,760
Those in C category are less dangerous than that.

357
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
But this Adil of C category was going to

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,920
make a big splash in the future.

359
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,920
Now after this, Adil and his friends

360
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
reach PoK.  And

361
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,680
after reaching PoK, their specialized

362
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,920
training starts.  And when this entire

363
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,560
training was going on, his trainer at that time

364
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,160
was Abdul Rashid Ghazi.  And

365
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
whenever the training started, it was their

366
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,160
choice as to which category you want to

367
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,480
select.  There are two categories one ist

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,880
shaadi and the other is inggi masi.

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,839
In this department, one gets training to be a suicide bomber

370
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,920
and in Ingmasi, all the work of suicide fighters etc. is done.

371
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
Adil had

372
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
selected this marriage category.

373
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,279
Here I was taught how to make this etc.

374
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,199
Driving with a loaded RDX was

375
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,639
taught and the entire training was completed

376
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,399
here.  And when the entire

377
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
training was going on, Abdul Rashid

378
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,399
Ghazi, who was their trainer, liked Adil the

379
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
most because he had

380
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
more hatred

381
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,480
for the Indian Forces than the others.  Secondly, he was even

382
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
ready to sacrifice his life.  And Adil was a local from the place where Jaish-e-Hamad

383
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,199
's leadership was planning to attack.

384
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
So he knew every inch of it.

385
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,680
So when Adil's training is completed,

386
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
he also crosses the Jammu Sambha Sector

387
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,600
border and

388
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,399
comes back to Kashmir.  Now from here,

389
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,480
Usman, Umar, Adil all had reached Kashmir

390
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,320
and now after this the attack was about to happen.

391
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
Well, there was one more thing in this, all the

392
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,720
people who were coming after crossing the border, NIA has

393
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
also mentioned this in its charge sheet

394
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
that these people were bringing with them in

395
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,959
small quantities in their bags, military grade RDX,

396
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,880
which is not available in the open market,

397
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,720
around 20 to 25 kg. For example,

398
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
when Umar had come, he had brought 25 kg of RDX with him

399
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
and all this was at

400
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
different locations inside R Kashmir, the

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
OGWs used to handle it and all these

402
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,240
things that I am telling you,

403
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
you will find the link of it in the description, I am

404
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
not telling anything out of my own will and see, now

405
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,120
after this comes the date 30th October

406
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,680
2018 and on this day Usman who was a sniper and used to

407
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
attack by seeing the light of the mobile was

408
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,519
killed by the Indian Forces.  Now when he was

409
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
killed by Indian forces, it

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,839
was a big turning point due to which the

411
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,240
planning of Pulwama attack got further

412
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,639
triggered.  Masood Ahar's two most

413
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
important family members.  The first one, Talha and the

414
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,040
second one, Usman, both of them were killed.  And

415
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
as soon as Masood Azar comes to know about this thing,

416
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
Masood was very angry that day and

417
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,160
he also sends a recorded message of 3 minutes 49 seconds

418
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,399
to Umar.  This voice note basically

419
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
says that there is no need to wait anymore.  Revenge must be

420
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
taken as soon as possible.  And on top of the voice note

421
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,639
itself he named this entire operation as ‘

422
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,959
Kiss Operation’.  Meaning a revenge

423
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,759
operation.  And then after this, Masood Azhar,

424
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,000
after talking to Umar, sends his close

425
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,320
trusted bodyguard Mohammad Ismail,

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
also known as Lambu Bhai,

427
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
to Kashmir.  He also carries 11 to 12 kg of

428
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,320
RDX on his back and

429
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,920
reaches Kashmir.  And Masood Azhar gets approval for a

430
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,399
VBID

431
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,880
vehicle borne improvised explosive

432
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,639
device based Fida.

433
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,199
Look, all the militants etc. who

434
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,519
enter Kashmir, it is in their hands to fire a bomb or if there is

435
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,279
an informer of an Indian agency and they want to

436
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,279
kill him, then they do not need approval for that.

437
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,120
They

438
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,440
can take on the spot decisions themselves.  But whenever a major

439
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,360
military attack has to be carried out on a large convoy,

440
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,759

441
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,519

442
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
approval is required from the leadership of Jaish-e-Mohammed and Pakistan's ISI as well.  So as soon as

443
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
this plan gets approved, all these

444
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,240
people who had reached Kashmir,

445
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,800
start planning for VBID based Fida.

446
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,399
And Adil Dar is

447
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
selected to execute this entire attack

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
and the

449
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,920
money needed for this entire attack is deposited by Masood

450
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,640
Azar in two bank accounts Alt Bank and Meezan

451
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
Bank with Rs 10 lakh which

452
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
reaches Umar through hawala.

453
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
Some more transactions had taken place during the investigation.

454
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,240
This cheque book which was seized is a

455
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
copy of that. The money which they had

456
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
transferred and circulated through the chat is the

457
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,720
original copy of that WhatsApp chat.  So

458
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,360
according to the plan, Adil would

459
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,039
use the car to launch a

460
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,280
VVID attack on the army convoy and

461
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
for this, these people started collecting all the material

462
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,440
so that a bomb could be made.  The

463
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,600
attack had to be bigger.  So for so many

464
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,679
days, they were bringing RDX from PoK in small quantities to

465
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,799
different places in Kashmir, and

466
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,799
Umar

467
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,559
started collecting it at one place through his handlers.  And

468
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,559
what do they do along with it?  Pulwama,

469
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,640
Kuno, Avantipura, Lethpura had cement

470
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,559
mines where gelatin sticks were used.

471
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
These are basically a commercial

472
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
explosive.  These also are very less in number when there is a need to make a blast.

473
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840

474
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,400
So what do these people do?  They take help from local OGWs

475
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,799
and collect 500 gelatine sticks in batches of 5 to 10 kg by

476
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
smuggling them.

477
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,919
The sticks

478
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
he had collected had '

479
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,039
Super Power 90' written on them and along with these

480
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,720
he also collected other things like 30 kg silver

481
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,280
aluminium powder, weighing machine, 80 kg ammonium

482
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
nitrate and a blue coloured plastic drum from Kakapura market.

483
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880

484
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,720
They ordered ammonia through Amazon and when

485
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
all the things had arrived, these people had to decide

486
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,039
where it would be assembled.  So

487
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,280
Umar mainly used to stay at Shakir's house

488
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
or go to Insha's house.  So

489
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,919
Umar decided to make a bomb at Shakir's house.

490
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
And whatever stuff they had brought for him, there was

491
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,480
a store on the roof of Shakir's house.

492
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
Started collecting it right there.

493
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,480
And along with this, Shakir was there

494
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,880
on whose roof they were collecting all these things.

495
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,440
It also had a furniture store above the highway.

496
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
So Umar made Shakir sit at the furniture shop

497
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,600
and he was given the task to

498
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760

499
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240

500
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,360
note down the movement of all the army convoys coming on the highway in a notebook on a daily basis and

501
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,360
pass on the information about everything.

502
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,200
So this is what Shakir Daily used to do.  He used to

503
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,120
note down everything and occasionally he would go to

504
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
nearby areas on his scooter.  He used to

505
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,360
make videos there and within a very short time,

506
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,600
Shakir had remembered everything.

507
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,559
He had found out that the blue truck with

508
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,720
khaki trapulins carried luggage.

509
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,520
Officers are in white gypsies.

510
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,600
Soldiers travel in blue buses.

511
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,240
And along with this, when Cornvoy is about to arrive, the

512
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,080
ROP team arrives.  He had

513
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,000
noted down everything and used to

514
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,600
send every detail to Umar.  So one day on

515
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,760
27th January 2019, Shakir

516
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,240
sends a video of the location of NH 44 highway

517
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
to Umar.  And Umar would have loved this location

518
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,880
as it also had an empty service lane around it.  There

519
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,360
was less barricading.  So here it was

520
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,440
very easy to take any unknown car on the highway.

521
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,919
So these people fix this location

522
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,160
so that whenever anyone comes to this place, they will

523
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,720
attack.  Well, while they were

524
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
doing all these things here, on the other hand the Indian

525
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,240
intelligence agencies were getting back to

526
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,200
back intelligence.  The first input

527
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,760
came on January 2, 2019.  What mission is Jaish-e-Mohammed going to

528
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,720
work on

529
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,640
in South Kashmir?  This entire information was sent to the Jammu

530
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,559
and Kashmir Director General of Police and

531
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,799
Inspector General of Police the same day.

532
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,960
But nothing happened that day.

533
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,880
Next day again Indian agencies

534
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
prepared a complete report named

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
Impending Danger.  In this he had mentioned

536
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
that some big attack could happen in the CRPF camp.

537
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,720
Then after 4 days, input came

538
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,640
that local youths were going to attack using some IEDs.

539
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,280
In this way, on January 18,

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,520
input came that 20 terrorists had reached Avantipura

541
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,400
and were about to attack.  Similarly, on

542
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,159
January 21, January 24, even

543
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,320
a day before the day the attack was to take place, an

544
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,080
input had come.  In this way, a total of 11 intelligence

545
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,840
reports came that a major attack was about to happen.

546
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,360
You can pause the screen and read

547
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,960
what was exactly written

548
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,799
in those intelligence reports.  But no

549
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
action takes place.  Now after this

550
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,400
all the material was collected.

551
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,039
But a car was also needed for the attack.  So

552
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,679
in the last week of January, Umar was

553
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,440
an OGW named Sajjad.  He gives him the task to

554
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,760
buy a car in which

555
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,080
two large containers can fit.

556
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,760
What does Sajjad do?  He buys

557
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,679
a 2011 model PL Blue Eco car with registration

558
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,159
number JK03C186 for ₹1,85,000

559
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,400
and immediately after purchasing it,

560
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,480
he

561
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
erases the chassis number of the car.  He takes it to Shakir's house where the entire

562
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
assembly was to take place and parks it there.

563
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Now what happens next is that Umar comes to

564
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,000
know from one of his sources that

565
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,320
a large convoy of CRPF is going to arrive on the Sixth of February 2019.

566
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
So whatever these people were

567
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,960
making, they sped up the whole process

568
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,880
a lot.  Umar was the one who was making this entire

569
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,840
bomb because Umar had taken

570
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,760

571
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,919
training in making VBID in Sangin, Afghanistan.  So Umar himself

572
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
assembled the entire bomb.  Everyone else there was

573
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,960
helping.  So after this,

574
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,919
he started coating

575
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,320
ammonium

576
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,799
nitrate gelatin sticks

577
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,280
with ammonium powder, layer by layer, in a blue container and an orange container and adding them to the container layer by layer.  A

578
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,000
total of 200 kg of

579
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,039
explosives was prepared and 40 kg was

580
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,440
put into an orange container and 160 kg was

581
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,039
put into a blue container and fitted in the middle seat of the car

582
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,919
and the main

583
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,000
switch which operated it was

584
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,559
placed near the steering wheel of the car.  Now the entire car was

585
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,640
ready.  Now these people were just

586
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,120
waiting for the exact date of the CRPF convene and said

587
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,360
that they would do it on the day they would know.

588
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,440
They had no regrets during the time they were making it.

589
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,720
He was not scared at all, in fact he

590
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,360
even had fun while making it.   While

591
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,280
making the film, they used to apply silver aluminium powder

592
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,120
on their hair, face and clothes and then get their

593
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
photographs taken.  This

594
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,320
is his original photo.  While this whole process was going on,

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,080
these people were also mentally

596
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
preparing Adil so that Adil does

597
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,640
not back out at the last moment.  And in case

598
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,280
Adil backs out,

599
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,280
he had kept a man named Yawar Ahmed Nazar

600
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,440
ready as a backup.  They had to show this entire track in

601
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,679
such a way that the youth of Kashmir is

602
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,360

603
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
doing this because they are fed up with the Indian Government.  Pakistan has

604
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,520
no role in this.  And for this reason they had

605
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,520
already decided that they would

606
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,919
get a video made from Adil in advance and

607
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,480
release it after the attack.  So

608
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,120
what they do for this is that on 27th January 2019,

609
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,120
Umar takes Adil to Insha's house.  He

610
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
gives a script to Adil that a

611
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,559
video has to be made and after reading this script he has to

612
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,799
speak like this.  Adil is made ready.  The

613
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,480
M4 rifle is handed over.  A

614
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,919
banner of Jaish-e-Mohammed is put up at the back.

615
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
And after that the video making starts again.

616
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,360
This is that image.

617
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
You will also find the full video on YouTube.  But

618
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,760
a problem arises while making the video.

619
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,600
Adil was not able to speak the script that is in the video.

620
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,600

621
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,520
When Adil is unable to speak even after trying a lot.

622
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
So these people keep Adil in the video

623
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,000
and put someone else's voice over.

624
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,159
That's why Adil was just talking in the video.  The

625
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,240
script was read by someone else.  So

626
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,000
this was going on here on this side.

627
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,320
What was happening on the other side was that when soldiers go

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,159
on holiday, after coming back

629
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,840
they

630
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
gather at the transit camps and then

631
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000

632
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,919
go to their respective postings through the convoy.  Similarly, this

633
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
Jammu Transit Camp is

634
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
situated behind the Jammu Railway Station.  Here the

635
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,159
CRPF jawans who were returning from holidays were

636
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,559
gathering and it was decided

637
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,799
that after arriving here,

638
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,960
in the first week of February, their convoy would be

639
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,279
sent towards Srinagar via NH 44 Highway.

640
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,200
They had to go towards Srinagar from Jammu Transit Camp.

641
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,360
This Jammu transit camp,

642
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,919
where soldiers were gathering, had a

643
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,840
capacity of 1000 soldiers.  But he

644
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,080
was stopped here.  There were many reasons for that.

645
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,720
Firstly, intelligence reports were coming in that

646
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,720
Cornway could be attacked.  Secondly, there were

647
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,360
some sensitive dates at this time also.  Like

648
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,919
Fifth of February.  Kashmir Solidarity Day is celebrated on this day.

649
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,039

650
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,120
And then, on 9th and 11th February, the

651
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,120
death anniversaries of Maqbool Bhatt and Afzal Guru were coming, these were

652
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,279
very sensitive dates.  So at

653
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,960
this time the chances of attack

654
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,799
increases significantly.  So due to this, they were being

655
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
stopped and it was being decided on which

656
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,279
date they should be sent.  But the problem was that

657
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,360
due to the delay, the soldiers present at the Jammu transit camp were

658
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,600
gathering beyond their capacity.

659
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,919
So after multiple meetings

660
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,400
it was decided that the

661
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,159
CRPF convoy will be sent on Sixth of February 2019.  There will be

662
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
no further waiting.  And

663
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,440
then as soon as this date is decided on the Fourth

664
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,360
of February 2019, heavy snowfall starts on this very day

665
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,840
and the

666
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,760
snowfall does not stop even on the next day i.e. Fifth of February

667
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,919
and because of this the NH 44 highway gets

668
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,880
blocked.  Secondly, on the same day i.e. on

669
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,919
Fifth of February 2019,

670
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,159
Masood Azhar held a rally in Peshawar, Pakistan.  In that

671
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,720
also he talked about an attack in Pulwama.

672
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,960
This cornboy had to pass through the same area.

673
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,039
So after seeing all these things the convoy was

674
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,120
stopped and the number of soldiers at Jammu transit

675
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,120
camp was increasing.  Now when

676
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,000
this situation was happening, the then Governor of Jammu and Kashmir,

677
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,919
Satyapal Malik, had

678
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,840
later said in an interview that at

679
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
that time he had told the government to get the

680
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,279
airlift done.  But he

681
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
said that the government did not listen to him.  Now

682
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,240
after this the snowfall stops and by 13th of

683
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,080
February the NH 44 highway is cleared.

684
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,320
And then when there is no option

685
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,679
left, the date is fixed that on

686
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,679
14th of February 2019, the CRPF

687
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,000
convoy will leave from Jammu Transit Camp.

688
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,919
And when all this is finalised,

689
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,600
then on the same day, 13th of February 2019, the CRPF

690
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,039
unit is also informed that

691
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,840
your convoy has to leave at 3:30 in the morning the next day.

692
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,720
This convoy had

693
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,600
2547

694
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,279
CRPF soldiers in 78 buses.  Which is

695
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,440
271 Km through NH 44 highway.  Had to complete the journey of.

696
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
Normally the cornvoys are

697
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
not so big but for so many

698
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,559
days, because of the wait, the crowd had become very

699
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
large.  So that is why

700
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,000
permission was granted for this big convoy.  Now on the

701
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,279
next day i.e. on 14th February 2019 at

702
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,760
3:30 in the morning, CRPF buses, 15

703
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,320
trucks, two ITBP buses, a spare bus,

704
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,039
recovery van, ambulance and at the end, the

705
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,520
head assistant commandant of the convoy

706
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,760
started getting ready to leave in his white gypsy.

707
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,240
And just before this convoy left,

708
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,960
two things happened.  In this convoy, bus

709
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,440
number five, which was blue in colour and had the number

710
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,919
HR 490637, was going to be

711
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,320
attacked later.

712
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,480
Head Constable Kripal Singh was to drive it

713
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,799
and as his daughter was getting married, he had

714
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,559
applied for leave.  So everyone was

715
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,559
discussing that if by mistake there is

716
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
snowfall again then they might miss their daughter

717
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,400
's wedding.  So at such a time

718
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Jaimal Singh said to himself that

719
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,720
I will drive the bus in his place.  You should not

720
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,799
take the risk of your daughter's marriage.  Secondly, in the same bus

721
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,279
number five,

722
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,279
CRPF constable Thaka Belkar from Ahmednagar, Maharashtra was also going to get

723
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,840
married after 10 days.  So he had

724
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,679
taken leave.  So

725
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,520
their leave gets approved just before the convoy departs.

726
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,679
So at the last moment they got

727
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,840
off from bus number five and this coincidence was such that

728
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,400
later both their lives were saved.  Now the

729
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,640
CRPF convoy had to leave from here in some time.

730
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,279
Whenever a convoy leaves,

731
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,559
before it leaves, as per the rules, there are

732
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:53,640
anti-sabotage checks which are done by the road

733
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,640
opening parties i.e. the accused.

734
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,919
What happens in this is that

735
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,799
soldiers are sent on the convoy route.

736
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,880
First the accused checks the entire route and secures

737
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,600
that there is no issue etc.

738
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,600
After the accused says okay, the convoy

739
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,720
leaves.  So when this convoy also had to leave, the

740
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,640
team of the accused went out to check the NH 44 highway.

741
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,520
This team of the accused had been investigating the

742
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,240

743
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,559
10 Km area of ​​NH 44 till Hathi Mod on the highway for years.

744
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,880

745
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,039
It had to be checked from 262.2 milestone to 272.2 milestone.  So the accused

746
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,039
's team checks this route and takes position at a total of 10 points.

747
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,080
And one point

748
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,120
which Laddu Board had at 272 milestone.

749
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,799
Here Assistant Sub Inspector Mohan

750
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
Lal was seated with his team at 7:15

751
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,960
so that if any suspicious activity is seen then

752
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
immediate action can be taken.  Now this was going on here.  On the

753
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,320
other hand, Umar had got his vehicle ready and was

754
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,120
waiting for the CRPF

755
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,279
convoy to arrive on NH 44.  Then what happens is

756
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,520
that Shakir Basir who was

757
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,919
doing Reiki etc. from his furniture shop.  When its sight falls on NH 44,

758
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,679
it sees that the accused is being

759
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,240
deployed.

760
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,480
Seeing the accused he understands that the convoy is going to arrive today.

761
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,720
He immediately calls Umar from there and tells him to

762
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
get ready and immediately Umar and

763
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,480
all his people get ready.  Now the

764
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,880
convoy starts moving from here and

765
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,120
after some time the convoy crosses the Shyama Prasad

766
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,600
Mukherjee Tunnel and reaches Peera.  There

767
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,080
was no problem till now.

768
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Earlier, in the area called Peera, the convoy used to stop here and have

769
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,919
lunch etc.  But so much

770
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,000
intelligence input had come.  So considering it a prone

771
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,760
area, those who used to stop here for lunch did

772
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,919
not stop here.  Now when this convoy was

773
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
moving, the local traffic around it was

774
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,840
also moving along.  This happened long

775
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,919
before the fact that when the cornvoy was on,

776
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,559
local traffic was not allowed due to security

777
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,399
reasons.  But in 2003, the Jammu and Kashmir

778
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,480
Government strongly opposed this and the

779
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,159

780
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,320
traffic used to travel on the entire road due to the cornvoy.  So this rule was removed at that time.

781
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,559
So that's why the local

782
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,159
traffic was also moving around the buses of Cornvoy.

783
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,159
Because at that

784
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,760
time, the more important thing than the lives of the soldiers was that people should

785
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,399
not be late.  Now after this, at 2:02, the

786
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,399
convoy turns left from the highway and reaches Kazigund Transit

787
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,640
Camp.  There was no problem even here.

788
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,120

789
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,080
After reaching the Qazigund transit camp, the CRPF soldiers who were

790
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,399
posted in Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian

791
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,360
areas disembark there.  Now

792
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,840
after this, the rest of the convoy had to

793
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,240
move ahead and the area ahead was very

794
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,919
sensitive.  The history of this area has

795
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,760
been that most of the attacks have taken place on

796
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,080
Cornvoy.  Therefore, a rule was already

797
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,799
made that whenever the

798
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,640
cornboy passes through this area, he will travel only in a semi-bullet proof bus,

799
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,039
otherwise he will not go.  But the

800
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
problem was that there was only a 15 cm bullet

801
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,480
proof bus and the crowd was very large.

802
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,880
So for this, normal buses were also allowed to go ahead.

803
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,799
Bus number five was

804
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,799
not bullet proof.  And while we were leaving this Qazigund

805
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,200
transit camp, another

806
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,440
thing happened.  When the convoy started moving forward from here, the

807
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,840
CRPF constable Surendra Yadav, who was sitting in bus number five,

808
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
his friend was

809
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
forcefully calling him from behind and asking him to come

810
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,159
near him and he too got annoyed and got

811
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,520
down and went to his friend.

812
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,760
He had no idea at that time

813
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,159
that his life was going to be saved by this one thing

814
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,880
because within a few moments everything in this bus number five was going to be

815
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,760
destroyed and

816
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,000
after Surendra Yadav got down, there were 39 soldiers inside this bus.

817
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,480
Now at 2:42 the convoy had

818
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,640
left Qazigund transit camp.  Someone was

819
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,360
listening to a song.  A soldier was on a video call

820
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,159
and some people were talking among themselves and at the same

821
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,240
time, the accused's team was supporting the entire convoy at

822
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,480
different strategic points

823
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,559
and both sides of the highway were standing on alert

824
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,120
and the convoy was moving ahead.  Now, on the

825
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,600
other hand, Umar sends Adil away in the

826
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,159
car that was with Shakir.

827
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,600
And after walking a little further,

828
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,080
when Hajibal Bridge arrives, Shakir

829
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,559
hugs Adil here and Adil takes

830
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,320
off his watch and gives it to Shakir as a token that

831
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,640
when I die, this will remind you of me.

832
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,360
And then after this,

833
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,600
Adil drives alone from Hajibal Bridge to attack.  Let

834
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,200
me explain the entire map to you once.

835
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,840
This entire area is

836
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,559
within Pulwama district.  This

837
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,279
is the complete NH 44 highway here.  The CRPF convoy was moving from this

838
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,919
side, from Jammu Transit towards Srinagar.

839
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,279

840
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,039
Next to it, there is a road which was connected to NH 44

841
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
from here.  This point is called Laddu turn.

842
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,760
ASI was here and the

843
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,840
other road was coming here from Hajibal Bridge.

844
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,640
Now Adil moves across this bridge.  On the

845
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,440
other hand, the CRPF convoy was

846
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,440
moving on NH 44.  Now from here Adil

847
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,200
moves ahead on this road.  But further ahead it

848
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279

849
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,840
can see the police barricading etc.  So it takes a U-turn and here the

850
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,399
entry from Ladu turn

851
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,399
takes the direction towards NH 44.  By then one or two

852
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,120
CRPF buses had left.  I had

853
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,279
told you in the beginning that ASI Mohan Lal was

854
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200

855
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,200
sitting at the Laddu turn point and monitoring it.  So as soon as they

856
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,640
see a car, they get alert

857
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
and they notice that this car, which is

858
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,679
Adil's, is moving forward at a very abnormal speed

859
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,000
and is

860
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,159
trying to enter the convoy and the

861
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,279
style in which the car was moving makes them suspicious of this car.

862
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,000
At 2:50, after seeing the car,

863
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,120

864
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,039
a coded message 44 starts flashing on the wireless frequency and CRPF walkie-talkie.

865
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,919
This is a high alert signal.

866
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,559
Everybody becomes alert.  ASI Mohan

867
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,039
Lal immediately stops him by blowing the whistle.

868
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,279
But Adil doesn't stop the car, instead he

869
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,880
speeds it up.  While chasing the car, ASI Mohan Lal

870
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,640

871
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,039
also started firing at it.  And as

872
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,080
soon as the firing starts, this car

873
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,159
leaves bus number three and hits bus number five.

874
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,159
Then he starts moving left and right

875
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,720
and at 3:15 he reaches the 272 milestone.  If I

876
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,880
talk about the exact location,

877
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,840

878
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,519
it hits near Ledpura village in Pampore tehsil of Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir.

879
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,840

880
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,240
The attack was so massive that bus number five was

881
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,640
completely destroyed.  The buses in front and behind

882
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,120
also get damaged.  When the explosion happened,

883
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,600
10 Km.  The sound of the explosion was heard from a distance.

884
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,679
Pieces of the bus and body parts of soldiers fell up to a distance of 500 to 600 meters.

885
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,240

886
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,240
I cannot tell you much.

887
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,960
From the photo of the bus you can guess

888
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,480
what might have happened to the soldiers sitting inside.  39

889
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,359
CRPF jawans and one ASI Mohan Lal who were

890
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,079
pursuing the attackers; total 40 soldiers were martyred

891
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,919
and more than 20 were injured.  This was

892
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,000
not a normal thing.  This was a very big attack.  Now

893
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,480
as soon as this happens in Pulwama, the

894
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,839
rescue team, Counter Terrorism Tactics,

895
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,399
CTT, local CRPF,

896
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,879
CFSL, Central Forensic Science Laboratory from Chandigarh and Delhi,

897
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,200
 

898
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,520
all these teams reach the location to

899
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,480
find out how it happened and who did it, nothing was

900
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,720
left, everything had

901
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,280
turned into small pieces.  Now when the search operation

902
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,679
started, the CFSL team at that time

903
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
found the crankshaft of a car.

904
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,760
They immediately called the

905
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,679
expert team of Maruti company which does technical inspection,

906
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
so that it could be found out to

907
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,359
whom Maruti had sold the car.

908
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,839
At the same time, lab results also revealed

909
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,000
what material was used.  What

910
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,280
type of person was I?  Everything had come to the fore.  And

911
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,280

912
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,200

913
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,280
what did the spokesperson of Jaish-e-Mohammed do after some time on the same day, 14th February 2019 at 4:30 pm?  There is a news agency in Srinagar

914
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,680
named Global News Service.

915
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,000
Sent him a video on WhatsApp.

916
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,079
He sent the same video of Adil and this

917
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
video started going viral very fast.

918
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280

919
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
This video also reaches the security forces.  As soon as the Indian forces

920
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,000
saw the video, they understood that

921
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,920
Adil was in the video because they had

922
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,079
arrested him several times before and had kept

923
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,960
him in the C category list.  When we

924
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,280
got the full report, we found out

925
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,359
that he had also crossed the border and gone to PoK.   I have

926
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,520
also taken training etc.  Everything about him becomes

927
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,440
known, how much he has brought

928
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,880
into Kashmir.  This entire case was being

929
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,440

930
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,440
led by Manipur cadre IPS Rakesh Palwal.   The

931
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,599
video was not getting synced

932
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
and because of this they were doubting whether the

933
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,280

934
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,760
attack was carried out by someone else from Pakistan and they just got the

935
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,839
video made by Adil from Kashmir so that

936
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,760
it appeared that the attack was carried out by a Kashmiri youth.

937
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,560
So after this the video was

938
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
sent to the FBI of America on the same day and the

939
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,280
FBI helped in this and told that the

940
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,079
WhatsApp account from which Adil's video was sent belongs to

941
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,160
a lady in Kashmir, Jameela, there was a

942
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
SIM issue on her ID and

943
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,520
along with this it also came to light that

944
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,000
voice over has been done in this video.  Now the Indian

945
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,000
agency arrived to look for Jameela.

946
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,839
So it came to light that he had already died.  The

947
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,920
FBI

948
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,920
tracked the location of the WhatsApp account user.  So this

949
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,920
location turned out to be Muzaffarabad, across the LoC,

950
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,400
and it also came to light that those who

951
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,560
planned Pulwama

952
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,640
were in touch with him, and from here, for the first time, we

953
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,960
get a small official proof that

954
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,280
Pakistan is also involved in this.  Now as soon as the

955
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,920
name of Pakistan came up, Pakistani

956
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,880
actors and singers were banned.  India

957
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,200
stopped trading.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of G7 nations has

958
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,720

959
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,800
put Pakistan in the grey list.  And the

960
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,720

961
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,880
leaders of different political parties of India used their Brahmastra

962
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,720
which caused maximum damage.

963
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
He condemned it in strong words.  Now,

964
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,880
when all these things were being investigated,

965
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,880
Maruti people also

966
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,560
sent the report of the crankshaft in which the number was

967
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,400
erased from many places, but even after that, they were able to

968
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,760
find it and the engine number was also found out.

969
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,720
You can see it on the screen.   The

970
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,800
car used in the attack was

971
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,119
bought and sold seven times.  And

972
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,680
what do Indian agencies do?  I

973
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,839
started catching the wires of the car along with the line

974
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,320
and when I reached the last wire, I

975
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,200
found out that Danish Rashid had

976
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,280
sold this car through Sajjad Maqbool Bhatt

977
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
and had taken a commission of ₹ 15,000.  Now when

978
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,760
Sajjad's name came up and the Indian agency

979
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,320
went to arrest him, he was missing from his house

980
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,640
and he too had

981
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,640
posted a photo on social media with an AK-47 in Burhanwani style and had

982
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,400
gone towards PoK.  Now when Sajjad is

983
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,160
also not found, the investigation

984
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,720
stops again.  There was a lot of

985
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,800
anger all over India.  The agencies had to catch him in a very short time

986
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,640
and it was

987
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
not possible just by taking the name of Pakistan.  Solid proofs also had to be collected.

988
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,960
Now after this, Rakesh Balwal of NIA

989
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,079
thought that a search operation should be started

990
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,160
in the areas around the place where this incident took place.

991
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,000

992
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,520
Maybe we can find something in it.  But the

993
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,839
problem here was that this area was a little

994
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,079
sensitive.  Whenever such search

995
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,079
operations are carried out here, stone pelting

996
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,760
etc. starts.

997
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,880
But Rakesh Balwal takes special permission from Delhi

998
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,480
and then on 20 January 2019,

999
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,720
100 NIA officers and 400 CRPF soldiers

1000
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,359
take him with them and start the search operation

1001
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,400
and this thing works.  The

1002
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:31,119

1003
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,880
key to a car was found in the snow next to the Jhelum River, 250 metres from where the incident took place.

1004
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,720
10261 was written on it and

1005
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,040
some bone pieces were found next to it.

1006
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,359
Rakesh Balwal immediately matches those bone pieces

1007
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,599
with the DNA of Adil's father and it

1008
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,920
matches.  So this confirms

1009
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,920
that this attack was

1010
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,520
carried out by Adil and the details of the car through which it was done had

1011
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,440
already been revealed.  But it

1012
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,599

1013
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,440
could not be ascertained which mastermind from Pakistan was involved in this.

1014
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,720
Because it was

1015
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,480
not known at all where the RDX came from.  Because

1016
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,480
RDX is not found in such fields that

1017
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,160
some local Kashmiri takes it and

1018
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,000
blows up the car.  So the

1019
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,400
most important task was to find out who were the people from Pakistan behind this.

1020
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,720
Umar, who had done all this,

1021
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
changed his location and disappeared.

1022
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,320
Rest of this search operation and

1023
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
investigation was going on here.  At the same time, the

1024
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,480
Air Force entered Pakistan and struck the

1025
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Khyber Pakhtun area of ​​Balakot where

1026
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,599
terror camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed were operating.

1027
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,760
There were air strikes etc. also there.  So

1028
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,599
what happens after this is that inside Kashmir,

1029
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,520
Indian forces are encountering the

1030
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
handlers of Jaish-e-Mohammed one after the other.

1031
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,960
Meanwhile, on June 18,

1032
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,359
2019, Sajjad Bhatt, who had arranged the Eco car, was

1033
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,240
also found.  He is also

1034
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,640
killed in Marhama Bijhara area.

1035
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,280
But as you already know the

1036
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,440
main guy behind this was Umar.  He

1037
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,440
was still alive.  And the manner in which Umar was killed is a

1038
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,920
big coincidence in itself.  What

1039
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,640
actually happened was that Umar had been

1040
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,040

1041
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,200
threatening the policemen several times before this attack.  Umar from Random Number was

1042
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,520
once a police officer in Pulwama long ago.  I

1043
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,280
sent him a message on WhatsApp.

1044
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,160
So an emoji of a pistol was made in it

1045
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,720
and below it was written, Hi jaanu, I will

1046
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,119
come to your house and kill you.  And

1047
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,200
after sending this message this number was switched off.

1048
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,920
So that police officer had saved this number

1049
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,240
with 'Hi Jaanu' and got it tracked by the cyber cell.

1050
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
And this message that Umar had

1051
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,640
sent later on proves to be costly for him.

1052
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,359
Because after this attack,

1053
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,839
Umar needed the numbers to talk urgently.

1054
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,800
So what did Omar do?

1055
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,359
After the attack, i.e. on 27 March 2019, Umar

1056
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,680
opens his 'Hi Jaanu' number and

1057
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,680
as soon as the number opens, the

1058
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,079
message 'Hi Jaanu' gets reflected in the monitoring system of the cyber cell

1059
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,200
and Umar's location, which was

1060
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,280
Sutsu Kalan, South West of Nowgam, was

1061
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,280
detected towards Batgam and then

1062
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,599
Umar is killed at this location.

1063
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,680
Now Umar was killed but the Indian

1064
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,880
forces had no idea that

1065
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,960
they had accidentally killed the mastermind of Pulwama.

1066
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,200
Because Umar's name

1067
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,200
in Indian records was Idrish Bhai

1068
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,839
and he had created a fake ID in the same name.

1069
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,680
When he was encountered, an

1070
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:08,319
M4 rifle and iPhone Samsung Note S9 Plus were

1071
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,079
recovered from him.  But he had broken both these phones

1072
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,000
before the encounter took place.

1073
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
So the police did

1074
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,079
not take this encounter seriously.  Everyone's focus was on

1075
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,480
finding the mastermind of Pulwama.

1076
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
And the broken mobile phones etc. that were found with Umar were

1077
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680

1078
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,599
kept as is at the Jammu and Kashmir Police Station.   Didn't

1079
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,640
even get any check done.  So what I mean to say is

1080
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,280
that at this time the Indian agencies were

1081
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,440
searching for the person who had already been killed.

1082
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,760
Searched for it for many months.

1083
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,040
But when nothing was found, then

1084
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,359
in July 2019, NIA head Rakesh

1085
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,920
Balwal, fed up, said that nothing was being found like this.  Let's

1086
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,760
open old cases.

1087
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,760
Maybe we can get some lead from that.  Now after this

1088
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,079
all the old cases start getting opened.

1089
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,960
But Rakesh Balwal's attention

1090
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,760

1091
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,400
goes towards this 'Hai Jaanu' case of Idrish.  They feel

1092
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,560
that this Idrish Bhai could be a big fish.

1093
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
And they say this

1094
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,040
because when his encounter took place, an

1095
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,040
M4 rifle was recovered from him.  Which is generally

1096
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,040

1097
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,440
used by the leadership of Jaish-e-Mohammed.  The rest of them

1098
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,839
carry AK-47 and he also

1099
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,920
wore clothes like Addas T-shirt etc.  So they

1100
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,240
think that this person could definitely be a big commander.

1101
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,240
Now when the case was reopened,

1102
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,960

1103
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,040
Rakesh Balwal sent the phones found at the time of Umar's encounter to

1104
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:28,240
India's top computer forensic and

1105
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,240
cyber security agency CERT-IN for analysis.  The

1106
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,720
team of CertainTeed

1107
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,720
worked hard for several days to extract each and every detail of the phone

1108
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,280
and while they were extracting these details

1109
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,520
, they seemed to have hit a huge jackpot.

1110
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200
Before breaking these mobiles, Umar had

1111
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,280
deleted all the data but

1112
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,359
as soon as we buy a new mobile,

1113
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,240

1114
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,359
he fetches the data of the old mobile from the cloud.  So the same thing happened in this case also.

1115
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,760
In this way, Certain's team obtained

1116
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,680
more than 100 GB of data from 2014 till date.

1117
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,319

1118
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,200
16 hours of voice notes related to the planning of Pulwama, text

1119
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,599
messages, videos of the reconnaissance of the location,

1120
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,680
everything was found.  And as soon as this comes to light, the

1121
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,400
NIA team reaches there and

1122
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,960
analyses all the data for the next 14 hours and

1123
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,160
then they find out that Idrish

1124
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,599
Bhai is none other than the

1125
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,480
nephew of Pulwama mastermind Masood Azhar and the

1126
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,200
mastermind behind the hijacking of the plane is

1127
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,440
his son Umar who made it and then

1128
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,440
got the attack done by Adil, this is his Pakistani

1129
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,839
ID card and this is a photocopy of his cheque book.

1130
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,079
Was RDX used?

1131
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,160
Through which route was the RDX collected?

1132
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,480
How was the entire attack coordinated?

1133
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,480
100 calls were also received at the time of this attack.   When

1134
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,200
NIA traced these numbers, it was found that these numbers were being

1135
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,119
used in different cities of Pakistan and

1136
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,040
coordination was going on from the same numbers at that time also.

1137
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,040
A voice note was also found in which

1138
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,520
someone was coordinating with Umar at the time of the attack

1139
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,680
and was also asking him to destroy the mobile and

1140
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,160
make a video.  NIAO

1141
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,640
thought it was the Roff Python uncle from Pakistan.

1142
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,880
So NIA matched this voice sample with the

1143
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,720
voice sample of Rauf Chacha available in open source.

1144
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,560
So it was an exact match.  And

1145
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,640
this became a big proof of Pakistan's

1146
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,040
involvement.  Along with this, intimate photos of the

1147
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,680
mastermind Umar

1148
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,400
with Insha in Kashmir were also

1149
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,319
found inside this mobile.  When he was

1150
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
making it, he used to get himself photographed with silver etc. applied on his face.

1151
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,040
I found those photos.

1152
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,119
Another photo was found in which the car from which the attack took place was

1153
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,280
parked in front of a house.  That

1154
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,440
was Shakir Basir's house where it was prohibited.  So the

1155
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,160
NIA team reaches his house.  The location of his house

1156
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,280
was Kausar Colony Bahawalpur and

1157
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,599
on 7 December 2019, Shakir Basir was arrested.

1158
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,160
And there were many photos of Umar and Insha in the mobile.

1159
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,160
So the NIA team

1160
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,040
reaches Insha's house and when they reach Insha's house, the

1161
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,000
NIA finds a red-black colored

1162
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,319
wooden almirah.  The same almirah

1163
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,400
which was seen under the Jaish-e-Mohammed banner in Adildar's video.

1164
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,520
So NIA

1165
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,079

1166
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,160
arrests Insha and her father Peer Tariq Shah on 3 March 2020.  Similarly,

1167
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,240

1168
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,880
19-year-old Owais

1169
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,040
Ul Islam, who was preparing for NEET through Amazon account, was also arrested on March 7, 2020.

1170
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,040
Who was providing all the goods from Amazon account.

1171
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,280
Similarly, Mohammad Abbas,

1172
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,920
who had a huge network of safe houses, was

1173
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,920
caught.  Bilal Kuchhe was caught through Gulshan Mobile Shop.

1174
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,319
He, who used to

1175
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,040
work with Adil, had also gone to PoK.   In

1176
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:20,160
this way, all the people who were involved in Kashmir were

1177
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,640
caught and then they were made to reveal every single thing.

1178
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,640
Initially Insha was

1179
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,440
calling Umar her brother and was refusing.

1180
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,520
But when NIA showed the photos and voice notes,

1181
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,560
Insha also had to accept all these things

1182
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,880
and she told each and every thing.  Shakir was the

1183
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,720
toughest among all these people.  He was

1184
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,200
not telling anything.  But

1185
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,599
what does Rakesh Balwal do after some time?

1186
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,599
Shows Shakir the intimate photo of Umar and Insha.

1187
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,520
So Shakir was very shocked about this thing.

1188
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,160
Because he considered Umar to be very

1189
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,200
good.  Umar was married.

1190
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,520
So Shakir was so hurt by this thing that

1191
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,560
after some time he told the whole planning to NIA.

1192
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,880
And then on 25th of August 2020,

1193
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,359
NIA decodes the whole case and

1194
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,680
files a charge sheet of 13,800 pages in the NIA court

1195
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,079
and there is a crackdown all over Kashmir.

1196
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,839
And everyone who was involved in this

1197
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,240
gets punished.  And in the end, let me tell you once again that whether it is

1198
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,800
crooked teeth or

1199
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,200
gaps between the teeth,

1200
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,200
you can fix every single teeth misalignment issue with the help of tooth aligners.

1201
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,280
That too in just 6 to 12 months.  Don’t

1202
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,800

1203
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,180

1204
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:44,369
