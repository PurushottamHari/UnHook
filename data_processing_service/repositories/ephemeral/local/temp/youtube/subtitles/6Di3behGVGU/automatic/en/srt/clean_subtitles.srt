Friends, look here, there is a little boy in this photograph, many of his friends are making fun of him. Actually, the person who is now the supreme leader of Iran, when he was three years old, he was very fond of Islamic education and when he turned 11, he had become a Maulvi and when his friends used to say that friend how come you have worn this Maulvi's dress whereas the other boys followed western culture, they used to wear jeans there, but Khamane was not Ayatollah Khamen, he had become a Maulvi by the age of 11. So strong was his attachment towards Islam. So you can imagine that a child since his childhood dreams that he will take Islam to great heights and then he did that.  He did not care that Western culture or people from Western countries were making fun of him.  So today we are going to talk about how the Islamic Revolution or we call it the Iranian Revolution separated it from the Islamic countries.  How Iran, what it was today, went on the back foot.  Earlier I was very forward.  Look, let me show you some pictures.  You will see that this girl is wearing jeans here. You are seeing a slightly modern trend.  Some people, some girls, you can also see them in hijab. Look at some more pictures and things will become clear.  Seeing these attires, you will not be able to assume that these are being worn in any Islamic country.  It seems as if it is some western country, Germany, France, Britain, Canada, America, these dresses are being worn there.  But this is a misunderstanding.  These women of Iran are wearing such dresses. You will see how the cultural activities of the people there match closely with Western culture. So before and after, I mean before 1979, before 1979, there was a lot of western culture there.  Now basically, let us assume that this person adopted the entire Western culture from 1941 to 1979. Reza Pahlavi is the name of this person.  Western countries wanted to indirectly capture all the oil fields in Iran. Especially with the help of America and Britain, he started controlling oil prices.  So Britain wanted to capture all the oil fields in Iran and also wanted to control the oil prices there. Now in 1941, they did some such coup d'Ã©tat there, they did something wrong and they placed one of their own puppets there in the form of this person and as soon as this person sat there, the western culture started coming into Iran, it started getting adopted, so till 1979, Reza Pahlavi improved the western culture very well, incorporated it there very well and completely removed the Islamic fanatics from there.   This 11 year old child was thinking this in his mind that how can I make our country Islamic. After that, as soon as the revolution happened in 1979, all the buildings etc. of Reza Pahlavi, whatever traces there were, everything was destroyed. Because the one who was a child had now grown up. Khamanai who had become a Maulvi within 11 years. You can imagine what it's like to dream about this much in advance. Friends, you must join this course of ours.  This is a great course.  If you guys are really addicted to it then you must join once and you must know how to take the challenge. So the topic we are going to talk about today is how the Islamic Revolution of 1979 isolated Iran from the Muslim world.  Meaning, somewhere or the other you will get to see the opposite.  So the revolution of 1979 was based on the fact that Western culture should be removed and Islamic culture should be adopted completely and Khomeini said this very well.  A message spread very widely at that time that USA is the devil.  USA is the devil and the same devil has imposed this culture on us here.  So where has the Iran that used to be modern come back to?  Traditional came into its own.  He adopted back the same things that were there before 1941. This is what Khamanai wanted at that time.  So Khamei, who was Ayatollah Khamei, wanted to spread Islam completely in Iran and this is exactly what he did. But while he was ruling in Iran, another person was flourishing in Iraq and that was Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a person who had nothing in the name of emotions. He was laughing even at the time he was hanged.  Even when the sentence was pronounced inside the court, he was laughing and was not listening to the judge. So Saddam Hussein and Khamenei were both parallel.  Once when Saddam Hussein attacked Iran, Iraq had hidden a bomb inside a radio and when Kham was listening to the radio, at that time there was a huge blast inside that radio and Khamanesh got very angry, friend, what happened to me, that radio reached me, how did Saddam Hussein control Kuwait very well, he controlled Kuwait very well and what was inside Kuwait ?  There were oil wells.  There were oil fields there and Britain had captured these oil fields. Now here, a huge war broke out between Iraq and Iran and you all must be aware of it.  But we are going to talk about why the Islamic countries ultimately broke their ties with Iran.  Today you will see that when Saudi Arabia speaks, it is speaking under the influence of USA. So the first conflict that emerges here is that between Shia and Sunni.  So if we consider majority in the whole world then you will find Sunni majority in Islam.  And the Sunnis are roughly 87 to 90%, which is 1.7 billion people, which you will see around the world. Then the Shias that we see are 10 to 13%.  And where is this Shia ?  That is inside Iran. And in the rest of the Islamic countries you will hear and see the majority.  Now, there is a little difference in the traditions, thoughts and views of both. One thing was done by Mohammed Saheb himself and the other one was his son-in-law who spread his teachings further. So those who followed the teachings of Prophet Mohammed, mainly followed Shia and it used to be a bit strict with them. But if we say a little liberal, then regarding Sunnis we can say that the tradition which was a little liberal started coming and the Sunnis adopted it well. So that is why their majority has increased considerably.  Now the Shias are mostly present in Iran. Now conflict starts between the two. You people should assume that this conflict is between Iraq and Iran.  It is the same for Shia and Sunni.  So there is always a conflict between Shia and Sunni.  If you look at Asia across the world, then whose total population is 23.3% in that population of Asia?  That belongs to the Muslims.  Then if you look inside Central Asia, who has around 81% of the total population?   It belongs to the Muslims.  Ok?  So you guys see 91.1% here. This percentage which you are seeing, if we look at the world population, where is 66.7% of the entire world's Muslims living in Asia?  It is within Asia.  So the thing is that ultimately that conflict escalated to a great extent.  Now let me take the story a little further. Like you listen to the example of Yemen.  We call Yemen the axis of resistance, whose is it?  Of Iran. And who brought the Houthi rebels in Yemen here?  By Iran. So Iran's IRGC, Revolutionary Guard, the Revolutionary Guard supported the Houthis in Yemen. But now the question was that who is opposing the same thing that Iran is supporting ?  Saudi Arabia is doing it.  So what Saudi Arabia did was that instead of supporting Houthis in Yemen, it supported the government there.  That is why conflict started between Saudi Arabia and Iran that what we are doing here is throwing out Western culture. But you are supporting here. That's why it got separated.  So gradually as we move inside Yemen, inside Syria, you will see that there is Hamas in the Gaza Strip, inside Palestine.  There 's Hezbollah here.  Like Iran supports them and rest of the Islamic countries oppose them.  That is why a condition of isolation was created between Iran and other Islamic countries. Also inside you will see the Axis of Resistance, which we were just talking about.  The Axis of Resistance was mainly created to control Israel because Israel was not a country that previously existed.  Later, gradually it started occupying that land and after Israel won the Six Day War in 1967 and defeated all the Arab countries, its dominance increased.  Now show us by defeating Israel.  Now Israel was being indirectly controlled by Western countries and the Western countries, especially America, wanted that Iran should not be able to make nuclear weapons. But America, being what it was, celebrated the treaty many times in 2016 and 2017, but nothing happened. So now they have used Israel to ask whom will Israel attack ?  Over Iran. But in order to stop Israel, Iran is creating and supporting its Axis of Resistance Hezbollah, Hatice, Hamas. Recently, at present, if I tell you where Khamanei is, where is Khamanei right now? He is inside a bunker. Donald Trump has said that no matter where he is hiding, we know where he is, so the day we have to kill him, we will kill him. Trump has said this to Khamanei. I believe that if this dispute continues for a little longer, the conflict between Iran and Israel continues for a long time, then what will happen?   Over a long period of time, 1945 could repeat itself.  America is ready for this.  At any time, he will drop an atomic bomb on Iran and prove that I have once again shown my leadership, my supreme leadership.  So all the conflicts that have taken place, whether it was between Shia and Sunni, or Iraq and Iran, or between Saddam Hussein and Khamenei, whatever it may have been, today it has separated Iran.  It has been isolated from other Islamic countries.  So Iraq was already separated, Saudi Arabia was already separated and Iran is now left alone. What is one advantage that Iran has ?  Iran has the advantage that it is a country surrounded by mountains on all sides.  There are hills all around it.  That is why it is very difficult to enter Iran by land easily. So the thing is that a three year old child started taking Islamic education and by the age of 11 he had become a Maulvi.   Just imagine how widespread it was.  He brought Islam into Iran so quickly because he did not like Western culture. What do you guys think, whether Iran did right or wrong, please tell me in the comment section.
