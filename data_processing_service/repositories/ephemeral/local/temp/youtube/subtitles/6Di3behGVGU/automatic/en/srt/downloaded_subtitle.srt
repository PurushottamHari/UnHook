1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Friends,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,160
look here, there is a little boy in this photograph,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,440
many of his friends are making fun of him.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,360
Actually, the

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,400
person who is now the supreme leader of Iran,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,400
when he was three years old, he was

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,600
very fond of Islamic education and when he turned 11,

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,720
he had become a Maulvi and when

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,760
his friends used to say that friend

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,239
how come you have worn this Maulvi's dress whereas the

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
other boys followed western culture,

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,360
they used to wear jeans there,

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,239
but Khamane was not Ayatollah Khamen,

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,200
he had become a Maulvi by the age of 11.

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,480
So strong was his attachment towards Islam.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,000
So you can imagine that a child

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,559
since his childhood dreams that he will

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
take Islam to great heights

19
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
and then he did that.  He did

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
not care that Western culture

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,479
or people from Western countries were making

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,360
fun of him.  So today we are going to talk about how the

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
Islamic

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,720
Revolution or we call it the Iranian

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,479
Revolution

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,759
separated it from the Islamic countries.  How

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,600
Iran, what it was today, went on the back foot.  Earlier I

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
was very forward.  Look, let me

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,200
show you some pictures.  You will see that this girl is

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,840
wearing jeans here.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,920
You are seeing a slightly modern trend.  Some

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
people, some girls, you can

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
also see them in hijab.

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,119
Look at some more pictures and things will

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,960
become clear.  Seeing these attires, you will

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
not be able to assume that these are being worn in any Islamic

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,119
country.  It

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
seems as if it is some western country,

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,960
Germany, France, Britain,

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Canada, America, these dresses are being

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
worn there.  But this is a misunderstanding.  These

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,360
women of Iran are wearing such dresses.

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,920
You will see

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
how the cultural activities of the people there

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,479
match closely with Western culture.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,560
So before and after, I mean

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:18,319
before 1979, before 1979, there was a lot of western culture

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,440
there.  Now basically, let us

49
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,280

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
assume that this person adopted the entire Western

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,000
culture from 1941 to 1979.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Reza Pahlavi is the name of this person.  Western

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
countries wanted to indirectly capture all the oil

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,800
fields in Iran.

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Especially

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,400
with the help of America and Britain, he

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
started controlling oil prices.  So

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Britain wanted to capture all the oil fields in Iran and

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,640
also wanted to control the oil prices there.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Now in 1941, they did

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,920
some such coup d'Ã©tat there, they did something wrong

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,319
and they placed one of their own

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,280
puppets there

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,319
in the form of this person and as soon as this person

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,640
sat there, the western culture

67
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,599
started coming into Iran, it

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,680
started getting adopted, so till 1979, Reza Pahlavi

69
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,920
improved the western culture very well,

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
incorporated it there very well

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,519
and

72
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,480
completely removed the Islamic fanatics from there.   This

73
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,440
11 year old child was thinking this

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,239
in his mind that

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,120
how can I make our country Islamic.

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,959
After that, as soon as the revolution

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,120
happened in 1979,

78
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,680
all the buildings etc. of Reza Pahlavi, whatever

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
traces there were, everything was destroyed.

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,760
Because the one who was a child had now grown up.

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,879
Khamanai who had become a Maulvi within 11 years.

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
You can imagine what it's like to dream about this much in advance.

83
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,560

84
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
Friends, you must join this course of ours.  This

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,319
is a great course.  If

86
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,080
you guys are really addicted to it then

87
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,920
you must join once

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,080
and you must know how to take the challenge.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
So the topic we are going to talk about today is

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,600

91
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,160
how the Islamic Revolution of 1979 isolated

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
Iran from the Muslim world.  Meaning,

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,800
somewhere or the other you will

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,280
get to see the opposite.  So the

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,479
revolution of 1979 was based on the fact that

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,560
Western culture should be removed and

97
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,600
Islamic culture should be adopted

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,400
completely and Khomeini

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,720
said this very well.  A message

100
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,199
spread very widely at that time that

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,160
USA is the devil.  USA is the devil

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,800
and the same devil has imposed this culture on us

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,000
here.  So

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,720

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
where has the Iran that used to be modern come back to?  Traditional

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,479
came into its own.  He adopted back the same things that were there

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,160
before 1941.

108
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,680
This is what Khamanai wanted at that time.  So Khamei, who was

109
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,199
Ayatollah Khamei, wanted to spread

110
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,440
Islam completely in Iran

111
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,520
and this is exactly what he did.

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,639
But while he was ruling in Iran,

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,560
another person was flourishing in Iraq

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,080
and that was Saddam Hussein.

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,120
Saddam Hussein was a person who had

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,759
nothing in the name of emotions.

117
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,759
He was laughing even at the time he was hanged.  Even when the

118
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,160
sentence was pronounced inside the court, he was

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,160
laughing and was not listening to the judge.

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,639
So Saddam Hussein and Khamenei were both

121
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:56,000
parallel.  Once

122
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,560
when Saddam Hussein

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,520
attacked Iran, Iraq had hidden a bomb inside a radio

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,240
and when Kham was listening to the radio, at

125
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,039
that time there was a huge blast inside that radio

126
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,160
and Khamanesh got very angry,

127
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,000
friend, what happened to me, that radio

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,880
reached me, how did Saddam Hussein

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,240
control Kuwait very well, he controlled Kuwait very well

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
and what was inside Kuwait

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,840
?  There were oil wells.  There were oil fields there

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,120
and Britain had captured these oil fields.

134
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,759
Now

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,919
here, a huge war broke out between Iraq and Iran

136
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840

137
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,919
and you all must be aware of it.  But

138
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,199
we are going to talk about why the

139
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,160
Islamic countries ultimately

140
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,120
broke their ties with Iran.  Today you will

141
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,120
see that when Saudi Arabia speaks, it is

142
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,520
speaking under the influence of USA.

143
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,240
So the first conflict that emerges here is that between

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,240
Shia and Sunni.  So

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
if we consider majority in the whole world then

146
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,599
you will find Sunni majority in

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Islam.  And the Sunnis are

148
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,680
roughly 87 to 90%, which is 1.7 billion

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,880
people, which you will see around the world.

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Then the Shias that we see are

151
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,520
10 to 13%.  And where is this Shia

152
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,840
?  That is inside Iran.

153
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,120
And in the rest of the Islamic countries

154
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,400
you will hear and see the majority.  Now, there is a

155
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,400

156
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,840
little difference in the traditions, thoughts and views of both.

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,360
One thing was done by Mohammed Saheb himself

158
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,720
and the other one was his son-in-law who

159
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,680
spread his teachings further.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
So those who

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,080
followed the teachings of Prophet Mohammed, mainly

162
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,199
followed Shia and it used to be a bit strict with them.

163
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,039
But if we say a little liberal, then

164
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
regarding Sunnis we can say

165
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,160
that the tradition which was a little liberal

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,919
started coming and the Sunnis adopted it well.

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
So that is why their majority has

168
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,840
increased considerably.  Now the Shias are mostly present in Iran.

169
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,000
Now conflict starts between the two.

170
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You people should assume that this conflict is between Iraq and Iran.  It

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,680
is the same for Shia and Sunni.  So there is always a

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
conflict between Shia and Sunni.  If

174
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,039
you look at Asia across the world, then

175
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,759

176
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,039

177
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,759
whose total population is 23.3% in that population of Asia?  That belongs to the

178
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,160
Muslims.  Then if you

179
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
look inside Central Asia, who has around 81% of the

180
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,919
total population?   It belongs to the

181
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,200
Muslims.  Ok?  So you guys

182
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,440
see 91.1% here.

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
This percentage which you are seeing,

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
if we look at the world population,

185
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,880

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,360

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,600
where is 66.7% of the entire world's Muslims living in Asia?  It is within Asia.  So the

188
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,720
thing is that ultimately that conflict

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
escalated to a great extent.  Now let

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
me take the story a little further.

191
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
Like you listen to the example of Yemen.  We

192
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,360
call Yemen the axis of resistance,

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,360
whose is it?  Of Iran.

194
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,680
And who brought the Houthi rebels in Yemen

195
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,720
here?  By Iran.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,680
So Iran's IRGC,

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Revolutionary Guard, the Revolutionary Guard

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,880
supported the Houthis in Yemen.

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,760
But now the question was that

200
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,080
who is opposing the same thing that Iran is supporting

201
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,440
?  Saudi Arabia is doing it.  So

202
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
what Saudi Arabia did was that

203
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,720
instead of supporting Houthis in Yemen, it

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,640
supported the government there.  That is why

205
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
conflict started between Saudi Arabia and Iran that what

206
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,640
we are doing here is

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,160
throwing out Western culture.

208
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
But you are supporting here.

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,760
That's why it got separated.  So

210
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,560
gradually as we move inside Yemen,

211
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,040
inside Syria, you will see that there is

212
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Hamas in the Gaza Strip, inside Palestine.  There

213
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
's Hezbollah here.  Like Iran

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
supports them and rest of the Islamic countries oppose

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,800
them.  That is why a

216
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,240
condition of isolation was created between

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,120
Iran and other Islamic countries.

218
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,959
Also inside you will see the Axis

219
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,920
of Resistance, which we were just talking about.  The

220
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,320
Axis of Resistance was mainly created to

221
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,279
control Israel

222
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,079
because Israel was not a country that previously

223
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,040
existed.  Later,

224
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,680
gradually it started occupying that land

225
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,720
and after

226
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,200
Israel won the Six Day War in 1967 and defeated all the Arab

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,839
countries, its

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,040
dominance increased.  Now

229
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,880
show us by defeating Israel.  Now Israel was being

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,200
indirectly controlled

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,839
by Western countries and the Western countries,

232
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,880
especially America, wanted that Iran should

233
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,519
not be able to make nuclear weapons.

234
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
But America, being what it was, celebrated the treaty many times in

235
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,440
2016 and 2017,

236
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
but nothing happened.

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
So now they have used Israel

238
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,160
to ask whom will Israel attack

239
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,160
?  Over Iran.

240
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,240
But in order to stop Israel, Iran is creating and supporting its

241
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,040
Axis of Resistance Hezbollah, Hatice, Hamas.

242
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,000

243
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,000
Recently, at present, if

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,200
I tell you where Khamanei is, where is

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,279
Khamanei right now? He is

246
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,440
inside a bunker. Donald Trump has said

247
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,839
that no matter where he is hiding, we

248
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,800
know where he is, so the day we have to kill him,

249
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,920
we will kill him. Trump has said this to Khamanei.

250
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:41,360
I believe that if this

251
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,920
dispute continues for a little longer, the conflict between Iran and Israel

252
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,440
continues for a long time, then what will happen?   Over a

253
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,920
long period of time, 1945

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,120
could repeat itself.  America is ready

255
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,160
for this.  At any time, he will drop an atomic bomb

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,120
on Iran and prove that

257
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,200
I have once again shown my leadership, my

258
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,360
supreme leadership.  So all the

259
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
conflicts that have taken place, whether it was between Shia and Sunni, or

260
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
Iraq and Iran, or between Saddam Hussein and

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,279
Khamenei, whatever it may have been, today

262
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
it has separated Iran.  It has been isolated

263
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
from other Islamic countries.  So

264
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,680
Iraq was already separated, Saudi Arabia was already separated

265
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
and Iran is now left alone.

266
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,240
What is one advantage that Iran has

267
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,639
?  Iran has the advantage that

268
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
it is a country surrounded by mountains on all sides.  There

269
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,480

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
are hills all around it.  That is why it is

271
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,360
very difficult to enter Iran by land easily.

272
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240

273
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,720
So the thing is that a three year old child

274
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,519
started taking Islamic education and

275
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,639
by the age of 11 he had become a Maulvi.   Just

276
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,399
imagine how widespread it was.  He

277
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
brought Islam into Iran so quickly

278
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,839
because he did not like Western culture.

279
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
What do you guys think, whether

280
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,720
Iran did right or wrong,

281
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,639
