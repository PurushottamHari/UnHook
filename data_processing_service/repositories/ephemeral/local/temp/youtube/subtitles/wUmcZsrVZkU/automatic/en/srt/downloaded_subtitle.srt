00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000
welcome to

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
hard talk i'm stephen sack thanks to the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,040
internet and this

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,519
the mobile phone our ability to inform

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,720
communicate and persuade has never been

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
greater and yet

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,400
public debate seems more toxic more

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
divisive than ever before so what's

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,320
happening are

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,960
intolerance and extremism winning out

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
over

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,840
reasoned debate well my guest today is

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
the american

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,800
neuroscientist philosopher and podcaster

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,879
sam harris he goes into intellectual

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,840
territory where few others

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
dare tread on race and religion he

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:59,840
generates

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:59,840
lots of heat what about light

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
sam harris in california welcome to hard

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
talk

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
happy to be here thanks stephen sam you

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,000
have an extraordinarily popular

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,960
podcast in which you talk with

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,439
leading intellectuals across the world

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,560
but you

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,159
also express your own trenchant opinions

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
in a host of books that you've written

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
which is more important more meaningful

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
to you

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
the conversation or expressing your

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
strong

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
opinion uh good question i think i

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,119
kind of split the difference there

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,040
because as i as you know i don't do

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
much in the way of standard interviews

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
i'm really i'm really trying to have a

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
conversation

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
every time i do a podcast so i take up

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,200
probably 40 percent of

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
the bandwidth in any in any interview so

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
it really is it's you know i get to hear

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,119
myself talk to my heart's content

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
and perhaps to the exasperation of

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,119
certain guests when you choose guests

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,960
for the making sense podcast which is

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,840
listened to by millions of people across

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
the world

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
do you like to bring people in with whom

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,800
you

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,239
know you disagree and disagree really

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
quite profoundly

53
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
occasionally yeah i mean you know a

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
little of that

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
goes a long way i mean depending on how

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,599
profound

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,400
the disagreements are but uh

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,560
i you know i think what's important is

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,920
to be able to talk about

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
substantial issues and significant

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,519
differences of opinion

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
in a way that's civil and that converges

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
on some kind of

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
solution i mean i think the only tool we

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
have for making

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,360
intellectual and moral progress is

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
conversation and it's persuasion if we

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,599
can't persuade one another

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,360
based on argument and evidence we really

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,440
i mean in the end we have no appeal but

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
to force you know or force of numbers or

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
you know i mean it's just

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,239
it really you know we shed the the

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,280
veneer of

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,640
of civilization pretty quickly and so i

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,840
i really do

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,840
view conversation as a kind of sacred

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
tool i'm just wondering why you have

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
such faith in conversation and dialogue

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,040
when it seems to me we live in an era of

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,680
digital communication where where

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
frankly

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,280
exchange of views and information is

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
easier than ever before and

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
everybody can put their opinion out

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,959
there on a platform and yet

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,760
far from easing uh humanity's ability to

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,040
get along

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,000
it seems to be polarizing dividing and

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,599
creating an ever

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
more toxic environment so your faith in

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,239
conversation may be misplaced

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
yeah we i didn't say i was an optimist

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
uh

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
i'm not i mean i just think i see no

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,400
alternative right i think it's the only

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,720
literally the only tool we have

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,640
uh i mean there's there is simply no

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
other way to influence the

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
the thoughts and opinions and behaviors

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,920
and intentions

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
of other human beings and so yeah but i

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
you know i'm quite worried that we have

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
created a

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,879
a kind of psychological experiment you

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
know that we've run

107
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,280
on all of humanity or most of humanity

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,599
all at once without anyone's consent

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
wherein we've created these a

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,120
circumstance where people can

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,840
be successfully isolated with respect to

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
to certain kinds of dogmas they can

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,720
pursue

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
any crazy idea to their hearts content

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
you know for

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,600
year after year and find support for it

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
online the internet is having this dual

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
function of

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
allowing us to get access to really the

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
totality of human knowledge

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,840
instantaneously but it's also allowing

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,960
our our sense-making to shatter

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
and and our epistemology to allow for a

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,840
kind of balkanization

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
of thought i want to turn to perhaps one

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
of the most

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,400
contentious debates frankly tearing

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,520
america apart right now that is

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,680
race and racism and how to

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,919
respond to what many people appears to

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,720
be the clear evidence

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,000
of discrimination at every level in

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
american society including

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,880
policing and the justice system you have

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,840
spoken out against

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,479
black lives matter you seem to regard it

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
as a

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,919
form of identity politics which you say

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,039
is a poison a poison in america today

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,960
why do you say that

141
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
well first let me say that i i

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,320
acknowledge that racism is still a

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,360
a tremendous problem in certain parts of

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,320
american society and you know globally

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
uh and that racism is is something that

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
we

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,160
absolutely have to oppose and

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,759
and criticize and i mean you know it is

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
a problem for which there is a remedy

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
and we have been

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,720
you know pursuing this remedy for for

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,639
many many decades

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
in the u.s but we've made a lot of

154
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
progress right and we're now living at a

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,639
moment

156
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,280
where we are having a kind of uh

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,080
moral panic advertised to us and and

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,680
black lives matter is one of the the

159
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
names of this movement and one of the

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,720
you know the the groups

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
you know it's a very loose group but

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,919
it's one of the groups that is

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,680
is um uh

164
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,680
making the most noise on this topic at

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
the moment and it it's as though we have

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
made no progress it's as though

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
this moment in american history

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,440
exemplifies the worst

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,600
uh symptoms of racism and uh

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
that's quite delusional i mean obviously

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
we've made a tremendous amount of

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
progress obviously this is one of the

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,400
least racist moments

174
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,319
in human history uh generally globally

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,919
and in in american history and um

176
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,680
but but but may i stop you yeah just to

177
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,000
point out that

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
the obvious that you sit with me we're

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
both

180
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
you know let's be honest white uh

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
middle-class

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
comfortable educated people who

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
represent

184
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,400
perhaps the the dominant uh grouping

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,039
in our respective societies and and who

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,599
are you

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,599
in the end to tell black americans

188
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,759
how they should feel right now because

189
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
so many of them look around the reality

190
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
of their own

191
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
lives their children's lives and see a

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,319
system which is systemically

193
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
racist not least when it comes to the

194
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,000
police and they feel

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
it is their right and their duty to

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,639
express

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,199
a level of anger frustration

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
and an unwillingness to accept that

199
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,960
which is surely understandable

200
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,599
well it's in part understandable but

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,639
what is really understandable is that

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,199
there's a lot of misinformation and

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,319
misunderstanding being amplified so so

204
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,759
if you're going to be

205
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,120
outraged over the

206
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,720
uh racist behavior of racist cops

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
or the racist consequences of systems

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,199
that that promulgate racism whether

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
there's any actual living racists around

210
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,280
to

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,280
to uh implement those systems uh well

212
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,840
it's not a choice is it we we are we are

213
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,960
surely duty bound to be no of course

214
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
right

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
i'm as concerned and as outraged as as

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,520
anyone

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,240
is about those things but i'm doubly

218
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,720
or additionally concerned that we not

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
find racists where they don't exist

220
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
right that would if you're going to find

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
racists everywhere you're you're going

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
to find the real racists

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,640
nowhere right i mean you're and you're

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,839
going to do an immense immense harm

225
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,760
uh in the process and so

226
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
to take you know the variable of police

227
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,959
violence it's very important if you're

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,760
going to worry about

229
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,600
uh the consequences of racism and the

230
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,720
way it's causing

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,279
black men preferentially to get shot and

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,120
killed

233
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,320
in america you have to find out whether

234
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
in fact that's happening

235
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
right whether in fact black men are

236
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
being shot

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
in greater numbers right in proportion

238
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
to uh

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,720
the numbers of encounters they have with

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
police officers and whether they're

241
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
whether they're if they're having more

242
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
encounters with police officers per

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
capita

244
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
there's any explanation for that other

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,120
than racism

246
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,760
right my concern currently in america is

247
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,760
that

248
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,839
any disparity you find whether it's with

249
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,560
respect to police violence or

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
employment or wealth or any any variable

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,240
of interest

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
and of great social importance currently

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
on the left

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,360
anywhere you go left of center

255
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,200
politically the only explanation that is

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,760
acceptable and this really does have the

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
the kind of the quality of a kind of

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
blasphemy test in a religion

259
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
the only explanation that is that is

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,279
acceptable this moment

261
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,360
is white racism or or systemic racism

262
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
now on the point of police violence it

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,560
just so happens

264
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,680
that the only data we have suggests

265
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,880
that while while african americans

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
have more encounters with the police uh

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,519
and there's there you know i think there

268
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,760
are obvious reasons for that

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
and they're actually in fact roughed up

270
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,680
by the police

271
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,440
more than than white americans are um

272
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
they're not killed more in fact they're

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
killed less than

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
than white americans are per encounter

275
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,440
which is to say that if you come under

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,880
the attention

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,640
of the police in america and uh they

278
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,120
draw their guns on you

279
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,360
uh your chances of being shot appear to

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
be slightly higher if you're white

281
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
at the moment but hang on it breaks

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
everyone's expectations this is

283
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
fascinating because it gets to the heart

284
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
of

285
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
your intellectual approach to lots of

286
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
things you know you are

287
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
i think a self-proclaimed rationalist

288
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,360
you say that you are

289
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
determined to be driven by the evidence

290
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,360
by data by the science not by

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,839
emotion and still less by things like

292
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,880
religion or any other faith-based

293
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
knowledge uh

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,040
belief system so so evidence matters but

295
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
if you look across the piece it's

296
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,680
you've relighted on one piece of

297
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,040
evidence but surely there's an

298
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,640
overwhelming tract of evidence about

299
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,480
incarceration rates what happens to

300
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
black kids in schools

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
what happens to black people in

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
employment how many jobless black people

303
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
there are

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,519
there is clearly a story in america

305
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,720
of systemic discrimination which black

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
people are saying

307
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
right now they will no longer tolerate

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,120
without expressing

309
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,800
their anger and when you make the point

310
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
you've just made it it does sound to

311
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
some like you're you're sort of lacking

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
a level of

313
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,160
compassion or even emotional

314
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
intelligence or ability to empathize

315
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
with the situation

316
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
of the other well well no the

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
first of all it shouldn't because i'm

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,040
concerned about the real suffering of

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
real people but the

320
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,120
we have to acknowledge that we compound

321
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,399
that suffering

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,639
when we give false notions

323
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
about its actual causes right so if

324
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
you're going to look at

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
and again and and i'm you know i'm on

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,639
record every time i touch this topic

327
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,639
acknowledging that uh we still need

328
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,440
criminal justice reform and the war on

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
drugs

330
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
in the united states in particular has

331
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,880
been a disaster and it's especially been

332
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,120
a disaster for the black community

333
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
all of those things uh should go without

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
saying and and there are changes that

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
need to be made there

336
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,920
but if you're going to again if you're

337
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
going to to ascribe

338
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
the status quo across the board the fact

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
that

340
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,480
that um uh there's the kind of wealth

341
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
inequality and equal inequality with

342
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,160
respect to

343
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,000
crime and violence in american society

344
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
that breaks along racial lines

345
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
if you're going to ascribe that to white

346
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,000
racism

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,560
or or white racist or policies that

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
white

349
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,200
that white people are not changing

350
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,880
because they advantage them right

351
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,880
you will continually stumble upon

352
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
errors of great consequence right it's

353
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
simply not the case

354
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,079
that there are white racists

355
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,480
with their racism producing the level of

356
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,600
violence we see in the black community

357
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
in the inner city in a place like

358
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
chicago the point that many black

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
americans are making right now and i'm

360
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
going to quote to you

361
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,959
the words of just ones his sincere

362
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
carabao who works as the social justice

363
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
coordinator at the american humanist

364
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,440
association he's addressed

365
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,720
your uh podcasts on this issue your

366
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
interviews with other people on this

367
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
issue and he says

368
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
sam harris's definition of racism places

369
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,959
an underlying emphasis on intention and

370
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
he says

371
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,839
that's how sam harris defines the number

372
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
of white people who are racist as a tiny

373
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,800
tiny minority however

374
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,720
says mr carabo when discussing racism

375
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
it is important to remember it isn't

376
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
about intent

377
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
it's about impact and in that sense it

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
involves

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
a far greater proportion of the white

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
community

381
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,639
well as stated i wouldn't necessarily

382
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,399
disagree with that intention isn't the

383
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
only thing that matters obviously if

384
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,399
there are

385
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,360
policies that in effect create racist

386
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
outcomes

387
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,360
whether anyone intends it or not we

388
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
should figure out what those policies

389
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,279
are and we should change them right so

390
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,199
that's

391
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,199
you know that is what people tend to

392
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,560
mean by systemic race to racism or

393
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,880
institutional racism

394
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,079
and i'm i'm completely on board with the

395
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
project of

396
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
discovering that and correcting for it

397
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,800
right but what

398
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,480
we have now in american society are

399
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,279
allegations of racism or

400
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,880
or uh the experience that people are

401
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,880
having millions of people are having

402
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,360
simultaneously of watching a video of

403
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,079
let's say a police shooting you know you

404
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,839
know in the

405
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
prototypical case it'll be a you know

406
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
white cop shooting

407
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
we don't have to imagine it sam we we

408
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
see it right now we're watching over and

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
over

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
jacob blake being shot in wisconsin you

411
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,639
know we don't have to use our

412
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,199
imagination

413
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,920
i would tell you that that that that

414
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,320
video

415
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,320
is not evidence in and of itself that

416
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
video is not evidence of racism right

417
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
you can be you can see videos of white

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,120
people being shot in precisely the same

419
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,079
circumstances

420
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
and um i mean we have a massive problem

421
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
of guns in our society

422
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,760
we have a massive problem of poorly

423
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,040
trained cops i mean that that video in

424
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,279
particular

425
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,040
against several of these problems one is

426
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,000
that that when someone

427
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,760
rushes to their car uh in defiance of

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
police commands and opens the door and

429
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,519
reaches in

430
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
in american society unlike in the uk it

431
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,480
is only rational

432
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
for the cops to assume that that person

433
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
is retrieving a gun

434
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
so he can turn around and start shooting

435
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
cops in the face which

436
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,360
which happens right and every cop knows

437
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
this to move on from race to

438
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
religion you're very well known for

439
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,000
having written a book end of faith that

440
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,839
espoused your belief that religion was

441
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
essentially preposterous but

442
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,759
amongst your believe views on religion

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,959
is a clear feeling that

444
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,839
islam is a more malign a more dangerous

445
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,199
set of beliefs than many other religions

446
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
and i just want to quote you something

447
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,480
you said

448
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,279
actually a number of years ago almost 14

449
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,680
years ago where you talked about

450
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
muslims in europe and you said muslim

451
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
immigrants show little

452
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,399
inclination to acquire the secular and

453
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
civil values of host countries

454
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
they exploit the values of those

455
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
countries to the utmost they demand

456
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
tolerance for their backwardness

457
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,279
misogyny their anti-semitism and their

458
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,000
genocidal hatred

459
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,720
preached in their mosques i i just

460
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
wonder again

461
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
if you're looking for calm considered

462
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,040
rational conversation

463
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
do you think your own words there are

464
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
helping

465
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,800
yeah well as you acknowledge that had

466
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,480
the kind of topspin one one

467
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
wrote with in the immediate aftermath of

468
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
september 11th right i mean this is this

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
is

470
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,800
my conversation my style of conversation

471
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,920
about islam has moved on from there i

472
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,360
wrote a book with

473
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,279
majid nawaz a fellow brit who used to be

474
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
a muslim extremist who is now

475
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
as rational and secular a person as you

476
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,759
could ever hope to find and we had a

477
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,519
kind of

478
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,880
debate uh that that that um

479
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,000
uh converged on a on a really a happy

480
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,440
conversation and a friendship

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
that became this book islam and the

482
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,279
future of tolerance so people can

483
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
get my my most recent framing of the

484
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
issues there

485
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,720
but you know i mean to your to your

486
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,440
fundamental point yes it is taboo

487
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,640
to say wherever you happen to stand in

488
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
culture whether you're secular or

489
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
whether you're religious

490
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,839
that religions are different with

491
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,520
respect to almost any variable we

492
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,280
we care about where they you know they

493
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,600
they claim different things

494
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,959
they emphasize different things uh there

495
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,880
are different points in

496
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
in in their history and their engagement

497
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,959
with modernity

498
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,160
and yes islam is it's not an accident

499
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
that jihadism

500
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,360
is a phenomenon in islam and it's not a

501
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,320
phenomenon in anglicanism or mormonism

502
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
or scientology i mean these i want to

503
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
know in the real world what this means

504
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
for you sam does that mean that when

505
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,600
donald trump

506
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,160
uh back in 2017 imposed that travel ban

507
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,720
which

508
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,799
was quite clearly aimed at muslims and

509
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
he listed i think it was seven

510
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,440
muslim majority countries which for

511
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,640
security reasons he said could no longer

512
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,880
travel to the united states

513
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
were you cheering him on on my on my

514
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
behalf my point is that you characterize

515
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
muslim immigrants

516
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,000
as a group of people within which there

517
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,480
will be a small minority you say

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,880
who are statistically going to be

519
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,840
jihadists which is precisely what donald

520
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,640
trump would say

521
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
yeah okay but the so yes hence the need

522
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,400
to vet

523
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,160
immigrants and refugees and have you

524
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
know honest conversations about

525
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
what we're looking for we're looking for

526
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,520
people who believe

527
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,520
specific things about martyrdom and

528
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
apostasy and blasphemy and the rights of

529
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
women and whether it makes

530
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,799
moral sense to hurl homosexuals off of

531
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,200
rooftops right and

532
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,200
people who are recruiting for isis are

533
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
happy to join isis or people who in your

534
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
own country will

535
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
drop out of medical school for the

536
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
pleasure of of going to to live in syria

537
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
so they might be able to martyr

538
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,000
themselves for isis right this is a

539
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,520
phenomenon of contagious ideas that we

540
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
have to speak honestly about

541
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,880
and it's not it's only happening in one

542
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,200
religion now

543
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,320
in addition to i mean the reasons why i

544
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
didn't agree with with

545
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,640
donald trump's travel ban is that one it

546
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,559
was completely incoherent because it was

547
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,600
not even targeting the countries that

548
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,520
posed the greatest

549
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
ideological risk at that point or that

550
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
were the the worst reservoirs of this

551
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,240
kind of jihadism

552
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,880
but two i i you know i have long said

553
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,280
that the most

554
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,960
valuable people on earth with respect to

555
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,240
dealing with this problem people we

556
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,440
most want in our societies are

557
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,520
secular muslims and moderate muslims and

558
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
and people who can actually bridge the

559
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,440
gap between

560
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,520
the you know the the non-muslim

561
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,400
community and the secular community

562
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,039
and the religious extremists who are who

563
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
are

564
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,080
albeit a minority but still a problem

565
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,160
within the muslim community so we need

566
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,200
people like majid nawaz and ayan hirsi

567
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,520
ali and

568
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
and you know dozens of other secularists

569
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,039
and

570
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
and moderates uh and apostates who i've

571
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,240
supported

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
and we need them to figure out how to

573
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,720
midwife this

574
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,200
this uh renaissance and within

575
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
the muslim community where in something

576
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
like enlightenment values take hold in

577
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,039
the widest possible way

578
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
uh it's obvious that i'm not going to

579
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,240
accomplish that it

580
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,120
requires somebody who's in the community

581
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,919
to do that generally people i think

582
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,679
associate you particularly with a a a

583
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,440
very strong brand of

584
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120
atheism and there was that famous time

585
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
you debated with chris hitchens and

586
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,000
richard dawkins and you

587
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,320
you all of you said you know religion

588
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,320
is extremely corrosive and damaging

589
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,840
somebody then asked about spirituality

590
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
and while the others didn't really bite

591
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,679
you said actually no there is room

592
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,720
for spirituality in my life and i'm just

593
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,799
wondering

594
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
what that means for you ultimately

595
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,480
despite everything you say about

596
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,360
science and evidence and rationality

597
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
do you believe in some sort of higher

598
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,280
power

599
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,880
some non-human force at work well it's

600
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
not a matter of believing in a higher

601
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
power it's a matter of

602
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,360
experiencing the fact that that

603
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,600
consciousness

604
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
is intrinsically mysterious and it's

605
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,640
it's the context in which

606
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,720
all of our most wonderful

607
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,400
experiences appear right and it's always

608
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,919
the context of all of our suffering

609
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
and the mechanics of that is something

610
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,960
we can understand more and more

611
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,880
and and uh change our lives for the

612
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
better but it's also the context in

613
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,520
which

614
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,520
um human life can get better and better

615
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,039
and i think some some classically

616
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,120
spiritual values like

617
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
self-transcendence and unconditional

618
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,760
love right

619
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,600
are at the core of any movement in the

620
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
direction of of greater and greater

621
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,240
human well-being and should be at the

622
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,480
core of any

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,320
ethics we use to talk about those

624
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,159
possibilities so yeah i mean so

625
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,320
i have no doubt that it's possible to

626
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
become something like

627
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,640
the historical person of jesus whoever

628
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
that was or buddha or any of these great

629
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
patriarchs and matriarchs of our

630
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
religion so there's a baby in the

631
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,640
bathwater there that i think we don't

632
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
want to throw out

633
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
as atheists but the question is do you

634
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
ever have to believe anything

635
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,600
irrational in order to explore those

636
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
possibilities in yourself or in

637
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
in society and i think the answer to

638
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
that is quite clearly no i'm just

639
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
remembering

640
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,679
close to the beginning of this interview

641
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
you gave a hollow laugh and said i'm not

642
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,120
telling you i'm an optimist so

643
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
when you tell me that you do believe in

644
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,919
transcendence and you believe

645
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
uh that we can all turn ourselves into

646
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
better

647
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,480
beings by looking within and pursuing

648
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,640
love and all of that we're not doing it

649
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
are we i mean that is just as we look

650
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
around the world and around our

651
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,400
societies right now that is not

652
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
happening

653
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
uh well we're not doing it well i would

654
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,120
certainly agree yeah i mean many of us

655
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,159
are trying

656
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,960
and that's all we can do is is try both

657
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,799
personally

658
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,960
and i think most importantly

659
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,679
protect norms that allow us to

660
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
live by our deeper wisdom even when we

661
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,080
are

662
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,320
personally liable to fail right so we

663
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,039
want laws and tax codes

664
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,960
and norms of discourse that that anchor

665
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,840
us to our better selves or our better

666
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
possible

667
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:59,039
selves or make it easier for even

668
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,919
mediocre and conflicted people to behave

669
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,640
better and better right and what we have

670
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
rather often

671
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
are systems of incentives that are set

672
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
up

673
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,799
to make even very ethical people you

674
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
know

675
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
behave unethically right or even fairly

676
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
honest people

677
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
to behave dishonestly and to just anchor

678
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,679
back to the the

679
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,200
beginning of our conversation what i'm

680
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,159
most worried about in our style of

681
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,799
discourse

682
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
around these charged issues like race is

683
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,320
that it is causing

684
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,840
even fairly scrupulous and honest people

685
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,840
and well-intentioned people

686
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,880
to be dishonest and sloppy and actually

687
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,679
um practice a kind of of

688
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
politics of personal destruction uh

689
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,159
where

690
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,600
they never and effectively to behave

691
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,600
like psychopaths

692
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,799
you know on social media and in print

693
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,840
and and in

694
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,159
various journalistic encounters um

695
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
where they never would do this if if the

696
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,360
incentives weren't aligned that way

697
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,799
right so i i would like to change our

698
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,720
incentives around

699
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,840
conversations of the sort we we have

700
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
today

701
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
um and uh we yeah but we have a lot of

702
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
work to do

703
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,520
to do that i would agree with that and

704
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,520
sam harris in the spirit of

705
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,440
a strong belief in conversation i thank
