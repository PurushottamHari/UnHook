1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,759
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,960
Friends, it has been more than 2 years since Manipur

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,040
and Manipur conflict.  Such a beautiful

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,800
state North East and yet Manipur and

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
Kukis are fighting among themselves.  So we will talk

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,279
but let me tell you that

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
our wonderful course on public speaking is recorded lectures.

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
Psychologist Dr. Mayurika Das

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
created it.  Want to do public speaking.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
Audience analysis, personal branding,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
body language how to subject?  Story

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
Language How to impress in interview,

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
group discussion.  So you can learn all this in this course.

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
Description

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,160
link is in the comment box.  This is the offer for today.  So brother, let us

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,280
see what the issue is after all?  The issue is

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,719
that the government has done

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,120
suspension of operation with cookies militants, now SOA agreement has been

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
made by Delhi government in New Delhi.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Now under this, whatever operations you are running

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,719
against India or if you are

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,680
involved in violent operations, then you should

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
suspend them.  You surrender and in return

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,719
we will consider your demands.  Is it okay

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,240
?  So the thing is that in

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,560
a way, the government is now

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,080
negotiating on the SOS agreement and this is a very good thing.

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,520
It is probably one of the finest

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,200
things that is happening right now.  Because this

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,119
conflict has gone on for too long now.

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
Many people have lost their lives.  Thousands of people have been

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,280
displaced.  Manipur is burning,

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,840
friends.  It is literally burning and the more

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
unstable a state remains, the more outsiders will get

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
involved.  ISI is involved in this.

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
Myanmar is involved in this.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,520
So we will have to look somewhere and

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
because now Bangladesh is also unstable and

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
today itself, friends, Bangladesh shares the biggest boundary,

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
meaning India shares the biggest boundary with

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
Bangladesh and today itself,

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,520
friends, the NSA of Bangladesh is saying

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
that we have to meet the ISI.

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,880
That is why the government will have to bring stability by doing whatever it takes.

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,640
Now on whom was the agreement ever made

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,200
?  Peace has not been completely restored yet.  The

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,880
agreement provides for free movement of people

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,680
and goods.  This was restricted.  This

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,399
was restricted.  So there is free movement

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,599
which means that whatever goods and people are there can go.

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,560
Ok?  In May 2023, you will remember May 5, 2023.

54
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,640
Mighty's and Cookies got into a fight over

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
an order.  And I have told this many times.  Let

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
me tell you again.   The

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
conflict started because the

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Mighties said that they were the original inhabitants of this place.

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
Friends, I have

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,440
taken dozens of lectures.  You can take a look but

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
right now I am just giving you an overview.   I will

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,959
not explain the entire conflict.  The lecture will

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,239
then turn in that direction.  So here it is

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
just that the Mighties are saying that we are the

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
natives here.  But still we have

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,760
not got the ST status and we

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
should get it.  The problem is that it's Hill

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,800
versus Valley.  These hills are very big.

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Now here, more than half of the powerful people, 50 to 60%,

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
live in the valleys.  Is it okay

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,120
?  And the rest of them are Kukis, Nagas,

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
in Will Hell they have got ST status.

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
So the Mighties say that we cannot buy land anywhere.

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,200
What is this rudeness and it's ours

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,920
and the cookies are already there, it means they are

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,720
not even natives of this place.  Cookies says

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
no no we are living here and

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
they have all the power in this Mighty.

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
They have more seats.

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
He has a government job.  They have the administration.   So

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,000
when the court said that the

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,599
powers of ST status will be reviewed,

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,879
then violence broke out.  A

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,480
lot of violence broke out.  Ok?  And now it's been 2

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,720
years, friends.  It's been more than 2 years.  It

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
started in May and July is about to come.

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,959
So let me tell you right now that the community that is

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
dominating the area is a no go zone.

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
You cannot go there.

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,879
Friends, in our country too, we have become separated somewhere despite living in the same country.

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,120
And movement of goods has

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,599
been quite difficult and the

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,400
common people have faced the biggest problem here.  President's

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,360
rule was imposed this February.  Look,

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
if India wants, it can correct this.

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
But that will involve a lot of bloodshed and India is never

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
in that favor.  Ok?  If we

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,440
send Indian Army there everything will be fine but we

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
never stay in this thing.  So the free

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,120
movement was first announced,

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040
Amit Shah had given the deadline of March 8.

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,519
But the Kuki groups opposed it

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,840
and opened fire on a State Transport bus that was coming. They thought,

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,920
how could it come like this

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,519
?  How could it come from the valley to the hill which was the

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,120
Kangpakki area.  So this initiative was

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,519
put on the back burner.  But now

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,359
after 3 months free movement happened because

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,080
cookies had problem with it.  So now we're

111
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,520
talking about cookies and this is step one.  The

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
primary goal of the centre is to

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
bring peace here and a

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,240
breakthrough may come very soon.  Meaning, you will see

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
that the status of both will become the same as before.

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
Now the matter that is under

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,560
discussion with SO Group suspension of

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,960
agreement suspension of operations.  There is an

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
agreement that we will be making very soon

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,040
with both Cookies and Mighty's and this is

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
very important for the people.  The Home

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Ministry official has said this.

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
Ok,

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
now let me tell you that ever since President's rule has been imposed,

125
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,479
aggression has been seen from both sides

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,960
and there is a lot of division as well.  You already know it.

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,240

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,160
An official, that is, the mighty group here, had

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
said that look,

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
we will give safe passage to the relatives of the cookies.

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,039
What actually happened?  In the Air

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
India crash that happened recently in Ahmedabad,

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,000
one of Cookie's relatives was also killed.

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,800
Isn't it?  The two women

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,680
here had said this, Mighties, I mean they

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,000
said that an appeal was made by the Mighty Group

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,680
that you are the relatives of SWAP PASSAGE, is that

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,840
okay?  You give them who was who were

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,560
among the two women who were

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,120
killed in Ahmedabad.  The plane that crashed.  So the

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,360
cookies didn't disrupt the moment.

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,039
So this is a good thing brother.  How much more will you

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:49,759
fight with each other and the mighty civilians who are there, even in the

144
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,320
Shay Lily Festival that just happened,

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,960
cookies mean that the movement here was

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,800
not disrupted.  So the sources said

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,880
that this is a positive response from both sides.  There

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,759
are now 14 SOO group camps.  Ok?

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,479
Which are spread in hill areas.  Some are

150
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,720
in the valley as well.  The Mighty Group says,

151
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
look, these camps launch

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,600
attacks on us.  In a way,

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
these attacks on us happen from these camps only.

154
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Now let's denounce these cookies.

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Ministry officials are saying that

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
many modalities are being discussed at this time.  The

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
first thing is to send them back to

158
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,080
where they came from.  And the second

159
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,120
thing is to club them with small camps.

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,199
Build a big camp.  So

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
government sources said, this is what Indian

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
Express has just published that right now look, the

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
mighty groups are not opposing

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,039
free movement because it is being said that the

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
mighty groups have

166
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,680
suffered the most, although the

167
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Kukis have also suffered but more damage has been caused to the

168
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,319
Mighties, now if we talk about today, the

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,319
mighty civilians

170
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
cannot go through the hill, they can go only by the road,

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
right, so the situation has become such that brother, there is a

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,000
way from every side, so

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,319
you should go only through the valley, which means if you

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
go to the Kuki area, then there might be a problem.  Because of which the

175
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,680
flow of goods has become a major problem.

176
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,160
Because, look, the valley is in the middle of the hill,

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
so the goods will come from that road only.  If that

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
cookie is dominated then it will create problems.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Now the mighty groups had

180
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
announced just now in March that

181
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,240
they will go to the Hill.  Ok?  We

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
will march to the hill.  So a

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
provocative step cookies said that

184
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,880
this is very wrong.  Due to which

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,720
bullets were fired on the bus.  Ok?  So the government is

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,039
now also building camps for UALF, which is the

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,360
oldest

188
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,919
militant group.  Is it okay?  United

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,759
Liberation Front in a way and the peace deal was

190
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,560
signed in November 2023,

191
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,560
so the ULF cadres will

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,960
stay in these camps.  So the process is

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,919
almost complete and this is

194
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,639
an initiative of the government.  So now look, this is step one.

195
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,960
Ok?  If people allow each other's movement

196
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
and each other's

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
movement happens, then there is no problem.

198
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
We have seen very horrific scenes from Manipur

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,759
and we all want that

200
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,479
peace returns to Manipur as soon as possible and people return to their work

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
so that the state can move forward

202
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,879
because step two definitely the Mightys and

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Kukis will be made to sit together and a peace

204
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
deal will be signed.  What do you

205
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
think, please tell me in the comment box.
