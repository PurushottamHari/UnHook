I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, it has been more than 2 years since Manipur and Manipur conflict.  Such a beautiful state North East and yet Manipur and Kukis are fighting among themselves.  So we will talk but let me tell you that our wonderful course on public speaking is recorded lectures. Psychologist Dr. Mayurika Das created it.  Want to do public speaking. Audience analysis, personal branding, body language how to subject?  Story Language How to impress in interview, group discussion.  So you can learn all this in this course. Description link is in the comment box.  This is the offer for today.  So brother, let us see what the issue is after all?  The issue is that the government has done suspension of operation with cookies militants, now SOA agreement has been made by Delhi government in New Delhi. Now under this, whatever operations you are running against India or if you are involved in violent operations, then you should suspend them.  You surrender and in return we will consider your demands.  Is it okay ?  So the thing is that in a way, the government is now negotiating on the SOS agreement and this is a very good thing. It is probably one of the finest things that is happening right now.  Because this conflict has gone on for too long now. Many people have lost their lives.  Thousands of people have been displaced.  Manipur is burning, friends.  It is literally burning and the more unstable a state remains, the more outsiders will get involved.  ISI is involved in this. Myanmar is involved in this. So we will have to look somewhere and because now Bangladesh is also unstable and today itself, friends, Bangladesh shares the biggest boundary, meaning India shares the biggest boundary with Bangladesh and today itself, friends, the NSA of Bangladesh is saying that we have to meet the ISI. That is why the government will have to bring stability by doing whatever it takes. Now on whom was the agreement ever made ?  Peace has not been completely restored yet.  The agreement provides for free movement of people and goods.  This was restricted.  This was restricted.  So there is free movement which means that whatever goods and people are there can go. Ok?  In May 2023, you will remember May 5, 2023. Mighty's and Cookies got into a fight over an order.  And I have told this many times.  Let me tell you again.   The conflict started because the Mighties said that they were the original inhabitants of this place. Friends, I have taken dozens of lectures.  You can take a look but right now I am just giving you an overview.   I will not explain the entire conflict.  The lecture will then turn in that direction.  So here it is just that the Mighties are saying that we are the natives here.  But still we have not got the ST status and we should get it.  The problem is that it's Hill versus Valley.  These hills are very big. Now here, more than half of the powerful people, 50 to 60%, live in the valleys.  Is it okay ?  And the rest of them are Kukis, Nagas, in Will Hell they have got ST status. So the Mighties say that we cannot buy land anywhere. What is this rudeness and it's ours and the cookies are already there, it means they are not even natives of this place.  Cookies says no no we are living here and they have all the power in this Mighty. They have more seats. He has a government job.  They have the administration.   So when the court said that the powers of ST status will be reviewed, then violence broke out.  A lot of violence broke out.  Ok?  And now it's been 2 years, friends.  It's been more than 2 years.  It started in May and July is about to come. So let me tell you right now that the community that is dominating the area is a no go zone. You cannot go there. Friends, in our country too, we have become separated somewhere despite living in the same country. And movement of goods has been quite difficult and the common people have faced the biggest problem here.  President's rule was imposed this February.  Look, if India wants, it can correct this. But that will involve a lot of bloodshed and India is never in that favor.  Ok?  If we send Indian Army there everything will be fine but we never stay in this thing.  So the free movement was first announced, Amit Shah had given the deadline of March 8. But the Kuki groups opposed it and opened fire on a State Transport bus that was coming. They thought, how could it come like this ?  How could it come from the valley to the hill which was the Kangpakki area.  So this initiative was put on the back burner.  But now after 3 months free movement happened because cookies had problem with it.  So now we're talking about cookies and this is step one.  The primary goal of the centre is to bring peace here and a breakthrough may come very soon.  Meaning, you will see that the status of both will become the same as before. Now the matter that is under discussion with SO Group suspension of agreement suspension of operations.  There is an agreement that we will be making very soon with both Cookies and Mighty's and this is very important for the people.  The Home Ministry official has said this. Ok, now let me tell you that ever since President's rule has been imposed, aggression has been seen from both sides and there is a lot of division as well.  You already know it. An official, that is, the mighty group here, had said that look, we will give safe passage to the relatives of the cookies. What actually happened?  In the Air India crash that happened recently in Ahmedabad, one of Cookie's relatives was also killed. Isn't it?  The two women here had said this, Mighties, I mean they said that an appeal was made by the Mighty Group that you are the relatives of SWAP PASSAGE, is that okay?  You give them who was who were among the two women who were killed in Ahmedabad.  The plane that crashed.  So the cookies didn't disrupt the moment. So this is a good thing brother.  How much more will you fight with each other and the mighty civilians who are there, even in the Shay Lily Festival that just happened, cookies mean that the movement here was not disrupted.  So the sources said that this is a positive response from both sides.  There are now 14 SOO group camps.  Ok? Which are spread in hill areas.  Some are in the valley as well.  The Mighty Group says, look, these camps launch attacks on us.  In a way, these attacks on us happen from these camps only. Now let's denounce these cookies. Ministry officials are saying that many modalities are being discussed at this time.  The first thing is to send them back to where they came from.  And the second thing is to club them with small camps. Build a big camp.  So government sources said, this is what Indian Express has just published that right now look, the mighty groups are not opposing free movement because it is being said that the mighty groups have suffered the most, although the Kukis have also suffered but more damage has been caused to the Mighties, now if we talk about today, the mighty civilians cannot go through the hill, they can go only by the road, right, so the situation has become such that brother, there is a way from every side, so you should go only through the valley, which means if you go to the Kuki area, then there might be a problem.  Because of which the flow of goods has become a major problem. Because, look, the valley is in the middle of the hill, so the goods will come from that road only.  If that cookie is dominated then it will create problems. Now the mighty groups had announced just now in March that they will go to the Hill.  Ok?  We will march to the hill.  So a provocative step cookies said that this is very wrong.  Due to which bullets were fired on the bus.  Ok?  So the government is now also building camps for UALF, which is the oldest militant group.  Is it okay?  United Liberation Front in a way and the peace deal was signed in November 2023, so the ULF cadres will stay in these camps.  So the process is almost complete and this is an initiative of the government.  So now look, this is step one. Ok?  If people allow each other's movement and each other's movement happens, then there is no problem. We have seen very horrific scenes from Manipur and we all want that peace returns to Manipur as soon as possible and people return to their work so that the state can move forward because step two definitely the Mightys and Kukis will be made to sit together and a peace deal will be signed.
