00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello Friends.  Friends,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
India's stand regarding the ongoing Israel-Iran war is

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,800

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
now being criticized by the opposition.  Sonia

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
Gandhi ji, you know, is the leader of the Congress Party.

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,200
He has written an open letter

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
in the newspaper and has heavily criticized

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
that the way India's foreign

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
policy is right now, it has lost its moral values

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
etc.  You can see

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,760
this news.  Sonia Gandhi's surrender of values

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,439
jab at centre over Iran Israel war.  We will

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,359
understand this in a little detail as to

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
what exactly has been said by him.  And

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,079
here what has been India's relationship

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,079
with Iran, with Israel,

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
what is the current situation,

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
I will tell you everything in detail.  First of all,

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
you all know the context that

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
there is a conflict going on between Israel and Iran.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,960
And the main reason behind this is that

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
Israel started bombing Iran first.

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,760
Israel says

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,680
that Iran is very close to

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,840
making its own nuclear weapons.  In fact, just a

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,640
while ago the news came that Israel has

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,039
said that we have set Iran back by two years,

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
meaning the way they have

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
attacked their nuclear sites,

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
Iran has been set back by two years. Now we have to see

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,680
what exactly is the truth, no, but I

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,680
hope you must be aware of this Israel-Iran war,

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
but

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,360
what is India's position, look, the Indian government has remained

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,759
publicly silent till now, meaning no

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,240

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
official statement has been given regarding Iran or Israel, neither have

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
we condemned nor

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
endorsed any particular site and

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,759
because of this,

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,000
if you see, Sonia Gandhi ji has written an op-ed here, which is an

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
opinion editorial,

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
written by her in the newspaper The Hindu newspaper

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,320
and look inside it, she has

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
expressed great concern that the way India's

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,799
foreign policy is being run

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
under the current government is not right.   The

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,439
government cannot remain silent at this time.  So

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,720
he in a way said that India's

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,280
silence is equal to moral failure.  Meaning

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
he criticized

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
why India has not issued any statement yet

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,920
?  Why didn't you take a moral position?

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Here he said that if you

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
look at the tradition in India's foreign

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
policy, it has always been moral and strategic.  What I

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,440
mean to say is that if any

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,000
type of attack takes place anywhere, a war crime takes place

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
, or there is an attack on sovrinity,

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
India definitely raises its voice against it.

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,120
So he said that India's silence today

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,400
is not neutrality.  It is a little loss of a

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
voice a surrender of values.  Meaning we have

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
lost our voice.  We have surrendered our values.

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
And it is a

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,480
dangerous sign of drift in our foreign

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,879
policy.  So in a way directly and

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,360
indirectly she was saying that the

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,599
way Israel attacked Iran was

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
not right.  We should have criticized it

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,959
because this has often been India's foreign

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,959
policy.  If we talk of historical ties, in

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
fact Sonia Gandhi

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,280
herself talked about India's ties with Israel and Iran

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,080
and said that

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,720
our deep civilizational bond will be seen with Iran

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,959
as well.  For example,

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,800
in 1994, when voting was taking place in the United Nations Human Rights

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
Council

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
regarding Kashmir, Iran supported India.   Apart from

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
this, he also

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
mentioned Israel and how India's defence

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
trade and intelligence links

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
with Israel are also growing here.  But

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
here he said that the

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
current policy of India and its diplomatic role is

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
not correct somewhere.  He said

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,280
that India has always supported the

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Palestinian cause.  Regarding non-aligned

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,239
movement.  You know Nehru ji had

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
started it.  Basically, the

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
non-aligned

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,799
movement had started under him and India's policy in the Middle East has been

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
balanced, our

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,519
diplomacy has been balanced, but

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,360
we have left all those things behind.  She

97
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,519
argued that India has always used its moral compass to

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,760
take decisions in West Asia.  That

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,720
means it has been our tradition that in a

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,040
way we go with the truth.

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,040
Raise your voice against whoever is doing wrong.  But

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
now we are not doing that.  And in

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,680
fact he directly

104
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,599
condemned the strike carried out by Israel.

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
She directly condemns Israel's

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,120
strike on Iranian installation.  He said that

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,239
what Israel has done is illegal,

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,040
escalatory and an attack on the sovrinity of any country.

109
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,120
He stated that a person who takes

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,280
premature military action is a

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,759
dangerous president.  There are always some

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,759
things that

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,840
can be resolved through dialogue and conversation.  But you

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,000
cannot attack any country directly.

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,080
He emphasized that the

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,440
way people are being killed here, bombing is

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,199
happening, this is against any international law.

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,080
The use of bombings and

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,199
targeted assassinations cannot be justified

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,520
in a rule-based global order.  You

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,440
can never give up on this.  In fact,

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
he even criticized Netan Yau's past

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,720
influences.

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
Now you know the

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
Prime Minister of Israel is Benjamin Netan Yahoo.

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,919
What actually happened?  In 1995, a

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
very good

128
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,400
peace process was going on between Israel and Palestine.  So here Sonia

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
Gandhi ji said that it is because of Netan

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Yew, a lot of mistrust has been created here.

131
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,400
And in 1995 the Israeli Prime Minister was

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
assassinated.  Assassination had taken place.

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
Because of which the entire peace effort

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,800
between Israel and Palestine broke down.

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,720
And you can see the situation as of today.

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
So Sonia Gandhi ji has directly

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,520
criticized Netan Yahoo also.

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,880
He then reminded how

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,639
55,000

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,320
Palestinians have been killed so far due to Israel's bombing in Gaza.  In

141
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
fact, you might know that Sonia

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
Gandhi's daughter Priyanka Gandhi had

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,880
brought a bag to the Parliament.

144
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,280
Right?  There was a Palestine flag on it and Palestine

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,680
written on it, I think.  So there was some controversy regarding that as well.

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,000
So here Sonia

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
Gandhi has said that look,

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,639
so many innocent people have lost their lives in Gaza and

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,039
a kind of humanitarian catastrophe like

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,280
famine like condition has arisen at present.

151
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
Here he also criticized the US

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,840
that firstly you will remember the agreement which was made

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
between Iran and the western countries, JCPOA,

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Joint Comprehensive Plan

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,479
of Action in 2015 during the time of Obama in which it was

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,240
decided that Iran will

157
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
not pursue its nuclear program and

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
America will remove the sanctions.  But

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,280
ultimately when Trump comes in 2018,

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
he backs out from this entire deal

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,600
due to which this entire situation has arisen today.  So

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
Sonia Gandhi also criticized the US.  In

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
fact, he

164
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,919
also wrote against Donald Trump in the article that Donald

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
Trump says one thing and does another.

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,400
Like here he was repeatedly saying

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
that America should not have been involved in the war that it has been doing for so many years.

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,479

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,400
Why are Americans going to other countries and fighting in wars?  Why are they

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
leaving?  Why is America wasting so much

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
money?  But on the contrary,

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
America is deliberately trying to jump into this war.

174
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,240
And he also reminded

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,800
how America entered Iraq in 2003

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
saying that Iraq had weapons of mass

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,199
destruction.  We want to put an end to that.

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,000
So the

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,759
US is

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
taking its decision by failing its own intelligence, and Donald Trump is

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
repeating the same thing.

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,680
This is what Sonia Gandhi ji said.  So

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
ultimately see what she is trying to say here

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,039
?  She is asking the Indian government to

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,520
speak up against the valorization of sovranity

186
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,160
by any state.  That means

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,880
you should speak against the action taken by Israel and

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,919
support Iran.  We assert India's role as a

189
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,759
diplomatic power.  This means that when India

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,000
uses its diplomatic power, it does so

191
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,319
with moral authority.  But you are

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,880
losing your moral authority.  So do

193
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,759
n't do this.  Promote dialogue and deescalation.

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,160
You cannot take up the flag of neutrality and say

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,319
that we will remain calm.  We will not

196
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
do anything.  If things are happening against someone here, then

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,960
you should speak out against it.  We must

198
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
reclaim our voice, uphold our values ​​and

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
act as a responsible regional power.

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,759
He has said so.  He stressed here

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,879
that silence has not been India's long

202
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,520
standing policy.  Our

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,360
long standing policy has been of a two-

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,120
state solution that there

205
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,520
should be Palestine and there should also be Israel.  So

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,520
we cannot tolerate silence in it.  We

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,000
should speak about that.  And he also said

208
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,560
that it is still not too late.  India must

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
speak clearly at the level of responsibility and

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
use every diplomatic channel

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,199
to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East.

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,520
Tensions should be

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
reduced there.  In fact,

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,520
just before Sonia Gandhi's letter which has come today,

215
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,840
if you look at it yesterday, the Deputy

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,639
Chief of Mission of the Israeli Embassy, ​​the Iranian

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
Embassy, ​​sorry, the

218
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,599
Deputy Chief of Mission of the Iranian Embassy in New Delhi, had

219
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
requested India and many

220
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
other countries to speak out against Israel, the

221
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,719
military aggression that Israel is carrying out is

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
not right.  So look overall

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,279
why does this matter now?  It matters because

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,440
here you see

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,680
a lot of discussion about PM Modi's foreign policy and not about

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
how we have kept things balanced.

227
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Especially now you must have seen that

228
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
Congress party

229
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,560
leader Shashi Tharoor himself has also praised the Russia-Ukraine war.

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
He said earlier that when the war was starting,

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
India was

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,040
playing the role of a neutral party.  So he had criticized it at that time.

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,880
But Shashi Tharoor now

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,040
said that see how today India can embrace the leaders of

235
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,600
both the US, sorry Russia and Ukraine.

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,279
So they are

237
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
praising him.  So in a way, here

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,560
you will see a huge challenge

239
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,399
regarding the foreign policy of PM Modi.

240
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,480
It also has global implications

241
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
as millions of India's workers

242
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
live in the Middle East.  Well now you have seen that

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
Operation Sindhu has been started

244
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,480
by the Indian Government, efforts are being made to bring back Indians stranded in Iran.  In

245
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,240

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
fact, I made a video today morning

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
where Iran made an exception for India

248
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,399
and opened its airspace which was

249
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
closed so that

250
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,720
flights could come to India from there.

251
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,360
Well, now the question here is, what is

252
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
India's policy and its relation

253
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,600
with Israel and Iran?

254
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
For this you will have to understand some things.

255
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Look, when we talk about Israel, it

256
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,480
is a close ally of Western countries.  It

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
is very close to the US.  It is

258
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
kind of a part of Western security architecture.

259
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,800
As far as Iran is concerned, it is just the

260
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,120
opposite.  It is anti-western.  It

261
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,279
is aligned with Russia and China.  So look here

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
it becomes difficult for India as to

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,120
whom to go with?  So India's

264
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,000
approach has been as a strategic partner.

265
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,079
With Israel since 1992.

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
We have strong relations with Israel.  As far as Iran is

267
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,720
concerned, if you look traditionally,

268
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
Iran in fact, which is now an Islamic

269
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
Republic, before this when Iran

270
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
was under the rule of the Pahlavi Dynasty, at that time India's

271
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,839
relations were very good.  The historical ties

272
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,600
with Iran were quite good.  If

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
we talk about strategic and defence cooperation, then

274
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
our defence cooperation with Israel is

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
very strong.  Be it

276
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
Barak Eight missile, UAV or

277
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,680
cyber security.  We

278
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,760
work with Israel in every aspect.  And it

279
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
is limited with Iran especially because of the

280
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,839
sanctions imposed by the US due to which the

281
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
relations are not that better and

282
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,480
if you look before 1990, at that time there used to be

283
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,640
very good defence ties

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,640
between India and Iran.  Apart from this, there

285
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
is a lot of intelligence sharing

286
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
between Israel and India.

287
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800
Not so much with Iran because the threat

288
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,000
perceptions of both are quite different.

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,680
Talking about military sales, India in a way

290
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,079

291
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,640
imports a lot of defence equipment etc. from Israel and

292
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
again because of sanctions against Iran,

293
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
things do not happen.  Joint ventures will also be

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,480
seen to a large extent between India and Israel

295
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,399
in DRDO and other things.  Well, if we

296
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
talk about economic and strategic ties,

297
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,720
our trade volume with Israel is 10

298
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,720
billion dollars.  With Iran you see it's

299
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
hardly $2 billion.  It used to be a lot earlier.

300
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,360
Specially because of the oil and

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,600
gas that we used to import but that used to be $13 billion

302
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,920
before the census.   What has happened

303
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,760
now is that because of the sanctions imposed here, the

304
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,600
trade with Iran has come to a halt to a great extent.

305
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,600
And you can also see other sectors like

306
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
Tech, Defence, Agriculture, Water, Innovation

307
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
are there.  Usually,

308
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
fertilizer, oil and gas, all these things will be

309
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
seen with Iran.  There is also Jawahar Port, though

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
if you see,

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,399
we do not have energy dependency with Israel,

312
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,640
but yes, we used to have energy dependency with Iran at one time, but

313
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
now it has reduced to a great extent.

314
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,600
Talking about connectivity projects, again there is

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,839
infrastructure project with Israel as

316
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
well, tech corridor, agritech hub

317
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
with Iran, so obviously there is Chawah Port, I

318
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
NCTC, basically we

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
want to bypass Pakistan in a way,

320
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
want to go to Central Asia, so

321
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,399
Chawah Port is like a gateway, so we have an

322
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,839
important role in this as well with Israel, you already

323
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
know that Israel will have an important role in the India Middle East

324
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
Corridor which is being built with Europe.

325
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600

326
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
So, as far as all these things related to diplomatic relations are

327
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,680
concerned, see, our full diplomatic

328
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,160
relations with Israel were set up

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,880
in 1992.  It has been with Iran right from the beginning.

330
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,519
When India became independent, Iran was

331
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,920
one of the first Muslim nations to

332
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
recognise India.  High level

333
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,920
visits take place.  Like PM Modi went

334
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
in 2017.  This was the first ever Prime Minister

335
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,839
visit to Israel.  Ah,

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
see, PM Modi has gone to Iran also.  Remember in 2016, there have been

337
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,079
historic visits before as well.

338
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
PM Nehru has also gone there.

339
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
So this has been going on for a long time.  And

340
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,560
you also get to see a bit of different public perception.

341
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,560
If you look at India, it

342
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
is divided.  There are many people who

343
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,680
support Israel.  There are many

344
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
people who support only Iran.

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
So, all this will be seen.  What do

346
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,519
you think

347
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,440
about the rest of this?  Regarding the matter, Israel and Iran,

348
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,800
please tell me in the comments and

349
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
before leaving, a very interesting

350
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,680
question.  Can you tell me where the Zaransh

351
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,399
Delaram Highway constructed by India is located

352
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,720
?  Which location is it at

353
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,639
?  I have to tell you this.

354
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,839
This entire highway was developed with Indian assistance.

355
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,600
You all know its right answer.  You

356
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
will find it on my Instagram.  If

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
you are not there, no problem, you

358
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
can get the correct answer from Telegram.  And friends, as

359
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
I told you, if you are preparing for UPSC.  The

360
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,000

361
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,160
most special thing about our Pratigya batch is that if you

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,160
