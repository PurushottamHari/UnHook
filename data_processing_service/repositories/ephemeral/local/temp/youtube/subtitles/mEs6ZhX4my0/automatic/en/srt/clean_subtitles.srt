Hello Friends.  Friends, India's stand regarding the ongoing Israel-Iran war is now being criticized by the opposition.  Sonia Gandhi ji, you know, is the leader of the Congress Party. He has written an open letter in the newspaper and has heavily criticized that the way India's foreign policy is right now, it has lost its moral values etc.  You can see this news.  Sonia Gandhi's surrender of values jab at centre over Iran Israel war.  We will understand this in a little detail as to what exactly has been said by him.  And here what has been India's relationship with Iran, with Israel, what is the current situation, I will tell you everything in detail.  First of all, you all know the context that there is a conflict going on between Israel and Iran. And the main reason behind this is that Israel started bombing Iran first. Israel says that Iran is very close to making its own nuclear weapons.  In fact, just a while ago the news came that Israel has said that we have set Iran back by two years, meaning the way they have attacked their nuclear sites, Iran has been set back by two years. Now we have to see what exactly is the truth, no, but I hope you must be aware of this Israel-Iran war, but what is India's position, look, the Indian government has remained publicly silent till now, meaning no official statement has been given regarding Iran or Israel, neither have we condemned nor endorsed any particular site and because of this, if you see, Sonia Gandhi ji has written an op-ed here, which is an opinion editorial, written by her in the newspaper The Hindu newspaper and look inside it, she has expressed great concern that the way India's foreign policy is being run under the current government is not right.   The government cannot remain silent at this time.  So he in a way said that India's silence is equal to moral failure.  Meaning he criticized why India has not issued any statement yet ?  Why didn't you take a moral position? Here he said that if you look at the tradition in India's foreign policy, it has always been moral and strategic.  What I mean to say is that if any type of attack takes place anywhere, a war crime takes place , or there is an attack on sovrinity, India definitely raises its voice against it. So he said that India's silence today is not neutrality.  It is a little loss of a voice a surrender of values.  Meaning we have lost our voice.  We have surrendered our values. And it is a dangerous sign of drift in our foreign policy.  So in a way directly and indirectly she was saying that the way Israel attacked Iran was not right.  We should have criticized it because this has often been India's foreign policy.  If we talk of historical ties, in fact Sonia Gandhi herself talked about India's ties with Israel and Iran and said that our deep civilizational bond will be seen with Iran as well.  For example, in 1994, when voting was taking place in the United Nations Human Rights Council regarding Kashmir, Iran supported India.   Apart from this, he also mentioned Israel and how India's defence trade and intelligence links with Israel are also growing here.  But here he said that the current policy of India and its diplomatic role is not correct somewhere.  He said that India has always supported the Palestinian cause.  Regarding non-aligned movement.  You know Nehru ji had started it.  Basically, the non-aligned movement had started under him and India's policy in the Middle East has been balanced, our diplomacy has been balanced, but we have left all those things behind.  She argued that India has always used its moral compass to take decisions in West Asia.  That means it has been our tradition that in a way we go with the truth. Raise your voice against whoever is doing wrong.  But now we are not doing that.  And in fact he directly condemned the strike carried out by Israel. She directly condemns Israel's strike on Iranian installation.  He said that what Israel has done is illegal, escalatory and an attack on the sovrinity of any country. He stated that a person who takes premature military action is a dangerous president.  There are always some things that can be resolved through dialogue and conversation.  But you cannot attack any country directly. He emphasized that the way people are being killed here, bombing is happening, this is against any international law. The use of bombings and targeted assassinations cannot be justified in a rule-based global order.  You can never give up on this.  In fact, he even criticized Netan Yau's past influences. Now you know the Prime Minister of Israel is Benjamin Netan Yahoo. What actually happened?  In 1995, a very good peace process was going on between Israel and Palestine.  So here Sonia Gandhi ji said that it is because of Netan Yew, a lot of mistrust has been created here. And in 1995 the Israeli Prime Minister was assassinated.  Assassination had taken place. Because of which the entire peace effort between Israel and Palestine broke down. And you can see the situation as of today. So Sonia Gandhi ji has directly criticized Netan Yahoo also. He then reminded how 55,000 Palestinians have been killed so far due to Israel's bombing in Gaza.  In fact, you might know that Sonia Gandhi's daughter Priyanka Gandhi had brought a bag to the Parliament. Right?  There was a Palestine flag on it and Palestine written on it, I think.  So there was some controversy regarding that as well. So here Sonia Gandhi has said that look, so many innocent people have lost their lives in Gaza and a kind of humanitarian catastrophe like famine like condition has arisen at present. Here he also criticized the US that firstly you will remember the agreement which was made between Iran and the western countries, JCPOA, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015 during the time of Obama in which it was decided that Iran will not pursue its nuclear program and America will remove the sanctions.  But ultimately when Trump comes in 2018, he backs out from this entire deal due to which this entire situation has arisen today.  So Sonia Gandhi also criticized the US.  In fact, he also wrote against Donald Trump in the article that Donald Trump says one thing and does another. Like here he was repeatedly saying that America should not have been involved in the war that it has been doing for so many years. Why are Americans going to other countries and fighting in wars?  Why are they leaving?  Why is America wasting so much money?  But on the contrary, America is deliberately trying to jump into this war. And he also reminded how America entered Iraq in 2003 saying that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  We want to put an end to that. So the US is taking its decision by failing its own intelligence, and Donald Trump is repeating the same thing. This is what Sonia Gandhi ji said.  So ultimately see what she is trying to say here ?  She is asking the Indian government to speak up against the valorization of sovranity by any state.  That means you should speak against the action taken by Israel and support Iran.  We assert India's role as a diplomatic power.  This means that when India uses its diplomatic power, it does so with moral authority.  But you are losing your moral authority.  So do n't do this.  Promote dialogue and deescalation. You cannot take up the flag of neutrality and say that we will remain calm.  We will not do anything.  If things are happening against someone here, then you should speak out against it.  We must reclaim our voice, uphold our values ​​and act as a responsible regional power. He has said so.  He stressed here that silence has not been India's long standing policy.  Our long standing policy has been of a two- state solution that there should be Palestine and there should also be Israel.  So we cannot tolerate silence in it.  We should speak about that.  And he also said that it is still not too late.  India must speak clearly at the level of responsibility and use every diplomatic channel to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East. Tensions should be reduced there.  In fact, just before Sonia Gandhi's letter which has come today, if you look at it yesterday, the Deputy Chief of Mission of the Israeli Embassy, ​​the Iranian Embassy, ​​sorry, the Deputy Chief of Mission of the Iranian Embassy in New Delhi, had requested India and many other countries to speak out against Israel, the military aggression that Israel is carrying out is not right.  So look overall why does this matter now?  It matters because here you see a lot of discussion about PM Modi's foreign policy and not about how we have kept things balanced. Especially now you must have seen that Congress party leader Shashi Tharoor himself has also praised the Russia-Ukraine war. He said earlier that when the war was starting, India was playing the role of a neutral party.  So he had criticized it at that time. But Shashi Tharoor now said that see how today India can embrace the leaders of both the US, sorry Russia and Ukraine. So they are praising him.  So in a way, here you will see a huge challenge regarding the foreign policy of PM Modi. It also has global implications as millions of India's workers live in the Middle East.  Well now you have seen that Operation Sindhu has been started by the Indian Government, efforts are being made to bring back Indians stranded in Iran.  In fact, I made a video today morning where Iran made an exception for India and opened its airspace which was closed so that flights could come to India from there. Well, now the question here is, what is India's policy and its relation with Israel and Iran? For this you will have to understand some things. Look, when we talk about Israel, it is a close ally of Western countries.  It is very close to the US.  It is kind of a part of Western security architecture. As far as Iran is concerned, it is just the opposite.  It is anti-western.  It is aligned with Russia and China.  So look here it becomes difficult for India as to whom to go with?  So India's approach has been as a strategic partner. With Israel since 1992. We have strong relations with Israel.  As far as Iran is concerned, if you look traditionally, Iran in fact, which is now an Islamic Republic, before this when Iran was under the rule of the Pahlavi Dynasty, at that time India's relations were very good.  The historical ties with Iran were quite good.  If we talk about strategic and defence cooperation, then our defence cooperation with Israel is very strong.  Be it Barak Eight missile, UAV or cyber security.  We work with Israel in every aspect.  And it is limited with Iran especially because of the sanctions imposed by the US due to which the relations are not that better and if you look before 1990, at that time there used to be very good defence ties between India and Iran.  Apart from this, there is a lot of intelligence sharing between Israel and India. Not so much with Iran because the threat perceptions of both are quite different. Talking about military sales, India in a way imports a lot of defence equipment etc. from Israel and again because of sanctions against Iran, things do not happen.  Joint ventures will also be seen to a large extent between India and Israel in DRDO and other things.  Well, if we talk about economic and strategic ties, our trade volume with Israel is 10 billion dollars.  With Iran you see it's hardly $2 billion.  It used to be a lot earlier. Specially because of the oil and gas that we used to import but that used to be $13 billion before the census.   What has happened now is that because of the sanctions imposed here, the trade with Iran has come to a halt to a great extent. And you can also see other sectors like Tech, Defence, Agriculture, Water, Innovation are there.  Usually, fertilizer, oil and gas, all these things will be seen with Iran.  There is also Jawahar Port, though if you see, we do not have energy dependency with Israel, but yes, we used to have energy dependency with Iran at one time, but now it has reduced to a great extent. Talking about connectivity projects, again there is infrastructure project with Israel as well, tech corridor, agritech hub with Iran, so obviously there is Chawah Port, I NCTC, basically we want to bypass Pakistan in a way, want to go to Central Asia, so Chawah Port is like a gateway, so we have an important role in this as well with Israel, you already know that Israel will have an important role in the India Middle East Corridor which is being built with Europe. So, as far as all these things related to diplomatic relations are concerned, see, our full diplomatic relations with Israel were set up in 1992.  It has been with Iran right from the beginning. When India became independent, Iran was one of the first Muslim nations to recognise India.  High level visits take place.  Like PM Modi went in 2017.  This was the first ever Prime Minister visit to Israel.  Ah, see, PM Modi has gone to Iran also.  Remember in 2016, there have been historic visits before as well. PM Nehru has also gone there. So this has been going on for a long time.  And you also get to see a bit of different public perception. If you look at India, it is divided.  There are many people who support Israel.  There are many people who support only Iran. So, all this will be seen.  What do you think about the rest of this?
