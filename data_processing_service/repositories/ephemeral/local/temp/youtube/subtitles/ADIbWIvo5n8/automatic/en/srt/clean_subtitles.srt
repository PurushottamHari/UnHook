Because the kind of situation that is developing between Israel and Iran, it will no longer remain a matter of just two countries. This will impact the global security of the entire world.  Oil is done , trade is done.  Over every thing which I will discuss with you in the video.  But it is obvious that if oil crisis occurs then it will have a huge impact on the Indian economy too.  And because of this there is a lot of discussion about it.  We will understand this in a little detail as to what impact it will ultimately have on global security. I will tell you everything in detail about what will happen with oil and with trade.  Let's move on. But before that let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026 or are preparing for the long term, both the batches for 2027 are available on Study IQ.  Their links are given in the comment section. You have to use this code at the time of live checkout so that you can avail the maximum discount.  Let's get started. First of all, if we talk about Iran and Israel tensions, then historically you all know that on one side Iran and Israel are Islamic Republics.  On the other side is the Jewish State, Israel.  There are hostile relations between the two.  But this did not happen earlier.  Before 1979, when the Shah was ruling, there used to be very good relations between Israel and Iran. But because of the revolution in 1979, Iran became the Islamic Republic that we see today, and if you see since then, there has been a lot of tension between the two. That means you will get to see what is called the arch enemy country. So Iran does not recognize Israel.  Iran says that we do not recognize Israel.  On the other hand, the anti-Israel groups, whether it is Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas Islamic Jihad in Gaza, they continue to support Iran and on the other hand, if you look at Israel, Israel says that Iran is developing nuclear weapons and the reason for this entire war is that Israel believes that Iran was going to develop a nuclear weapon very soon and if that had happened, it would have become an existential threat for them and that is why their nuclear sites are being continuously attacked.  Well now the question arises here because you must be hearing about all this continuously.  The question here is what are its implications on global security ?  Most important is instability within West Asia.  This means that the Middle East will once again become a war zone.   The war between Israel and Iran has happened in many other countries too, be it Lebanon, Syria, Iraq or Yemen.  You will see its effect in many places. Hezbollah, which has more than 1.5 lakh rockets, can open a second front. Just above Israel, you see this one, on the southern side of Lebanon, there is Hezbollah here, in a way. So they can open a front here on a large scale, due to which tension can again arise in Israel.  Then secondly the Iranian proxies are the Houthis, apart from this the Shiites in Iraq and Syria can also join this entire war. So in a way you can understand that this whole issue in the whole Middle East can be converted into Shia and Sunni and here you will see every country like Saudi Arabia, UAE jumping into this war.  Well, apart from this, can there be involvement of super powers other than the Middle East also? If we talk about America, it is treaty bound.  Meaning, if there is any threat to Israel, America will support it and is still doing so.  you all know.  In fact, you must have seen that yesterday itself Donald Trump has given a clear cut warning to Iran and said that if Iran launches any kind of attack on us or our assets, then we will attack Iran in a manner that it can never even imagine. So definitely the US is playing a role from the back right now but it may come to the front very soon.  On the other hand, if we talk about Russia, it is Iran's defense partner, especially in Syria, so it can get involved in it through its diplomatic cloud weapon cells.  The concern for China is that it is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil and it has a strategic deal with Iran.  So to some extent he supports Iran.  At the same time, it wants there to be stability because here you can understand that the Belt and Road Initiative can suffer a lot of damage if the war escalates.  Well besides that what else?  Apart from this, terrorism and cyber warfare can also spread rapidly across the world.  It is being said that if this war escalates, then Iranian and Hezbollah linked sleeper cells can become active across the world, especially in Europe, Gulf and South Asia, and spread terrorism. Apart from this, you will also see an increase in cyber attacks here. Especially on critical infrastructure, be it power grades, water plants etc, and because of this, Israel, which is known for its advanced cyber capabilities, can also retaliate here.  So its impact on global security is that you will see terrorism and cyber warfare spreading rapidly all over the world. Then the biggest danger is the nuclear proliferation risk.  This means that Iran can do uranium enrichment faster from here.  Yes, if tomorrow Israel completely destroys Iran's network of nuclear weapon sites and nuclear enrichment sites, then that is a different matter. But if this does not happen then Union uranium enrichment will take place here more rapidly. And it may also be possible that Iran may withdraw from the NPT, which is the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. Apart from this, regional powers like Saudi Arabia, Turkey would also want nuclear option here.  I mean, you understand that once Iran gets the nuclear capability, it is obvious that Saudi Arabia and Turkey would also want to have the nuclear option to protect themselves.  So because of this the nuclear race can increase rapidly. So this has an impact on global security.  I hope you are able to understand. Secondly, now if we talk about what impact will it have on the oil and energy market?   The most important is the choke point.  The point you will see is State of Hormus. You all know this, it became Persian Gulf and it became Gulf of Oman.  Keep these two things in mind which are important from your exam perspective, that the State of Homos connects both the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  So what happens here is that 20% of the global oil passes through here. 25% of the world's liquefied natural gas passes through this particular state. If Iran blocks it, which Iran has threatened to do, we will block it.  So you can understand that if you look at the oil prices here, there has already been a sharp increase. But many experts believe that this will suddenly increase to $120, $150 and some experts even say that $200 per barrel, you are understanding that $200 per barrel means that the Indian economy will collapse.  So this could be its impact and apart from this there could be a major disruption in Gulf exports. Whatever is exported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Qatar. Then along with this it is obvious that the insurance cost of shipping will also increase.  If we talk about oil supply disruption, then look, Iran supplies 3 million barrels of oil per day, which is in danger.  Apart from this, the Aramco facilities here in Saudi Arabia, which were also subjected to drone strikes in 2019, may once again come under threat and major oil exporters, importers India, China, Japan will travel on a large scale because our current account deficit will increase.  There will be fuel inflation which will lead to cost push inflation. Now you must be seeing that the RBI in India is reducing the repo rate so that people can borrow more and our GDP increases.  So all this could backfire if this situation continues any longer.  Apart from this, it is also said that oil can be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But again there is limited quantity in that too.  There is not much quantity. Well, what impact will this have on global trade and shipping?  We have looked at global security, the impact of oil and lastly comes trade.  So what is here is that apart from Homos there are two more important points here and that is the Babel Mandeb Strait.  Again, if you look at this map, here Golf of Eden has become and Red Sea has become.  This connects it to Babel Monday.  And you all know that the Houthis in Yemen are already attacking ships here. In the Red Sea.  So, here the danger may increase further.  Then there is the Suess Canal, here you all know, the Suess Canal is in Egypt.  So that can also create a problem here.  If it gets closed then again all the goods will have to be brought from below via the Cape of Good Hope.  Because of which if you add 10 extra days to the time it used to take then it will take more time.  Because of this the cost escalation will be very high. Meaning both cost and time will spike here.  And ultimately there will be an impact on the global economy because there will be problems everywhere at the supply chain bottle necks, from cars to semiconductors to fertilizers.  The global economic forecast will be revised downwards.  There may be a major threat of global recession.  Meaning, the impact is being felt from every direction.  As far as the question is what is its strategic concern regarding India ?  So look, first of all we are talking about energy security.  Iran was once India's third largest oil supplier.  So even now we don’t buy it, we say that we don’t buy it. Now who knows if any oil might be coming from behind. But because of the sensations and war coming here, this will be a big shock for India. Then apart from this, 8 million Indians live in West Asia.  So it will impact them as well.  Chawah Port: We are trying to ensure that through Iran, from Chawah Port, it goes towards Afghanistan. Now he can be completely blocked. Geopolitical balancing means that India will have to navigate here with Israel, with Iran, with the Arab countries, how we can balance ourselves in all this, for example, we played a balancing role in the recent Russia-Ukraine war. Whether we will be able to do that thing here too, remains to be seen.  So this had an impact on India.  As far as other countries are concerned, if we talk about China, as I told you earlier, it is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil. So he would like there to be stability here.  Otherwise its BRI will have a huge impact on the economy. Inflation will increase in America. Security costs could be military engagement. There is energy dependency in the European Union, now look, Europe is already facing the impact of the Ukraine war. And if this happens then there will be even more impact on Europe.  As far as the Gulf States are concerned, like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, there can be drone attacks on their oil infrastructure. Look at Russia, it may get some short term benefits due to increase in oil price but in long term and medium term again there is danger for it as well.  So the overall conclusion is that the Iran-Israel war is not basically bringing instability only in West Asia.  This is on the global economy, on the oil market, on the maritime trade routes, there too you will see one of the biggest threats.   There is a danger of global oil shock, multi-front regional war, economic recession and involvement of global super powers. So is this like the oil crisis of 1973 or will there be an impact like that of the Gulf War of 1990 ?  Only time will tell.  What do you think about the rest of this ?
