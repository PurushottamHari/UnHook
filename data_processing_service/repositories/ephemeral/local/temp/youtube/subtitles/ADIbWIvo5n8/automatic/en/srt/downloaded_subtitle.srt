1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,920
Hello Friends.  Friends, is

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,079
1973 going to be repeated once again?  Because the

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
kind of situation that is developing between Israel and

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,160
Iran, it will no longer remain a matter of just two countries.

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
This will

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
impact the global security of the entire world.  Oil is done

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,079
, trade is done.  Over every thing which

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
I will discuss with you in the video.  But it is

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,879
obvious that if oil crisis occurs

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
then it will have a huge impact

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,559
on the Indian economy too.  And because of this there is

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
a lot of discussion about it.  We will

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,480
understand this in a little detail as to

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,559

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,239
what impact it will ultimately have on global security.

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,760
I will

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
tell you everything in detail about what will happen with oil and with trade.  Let's move on.

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,000
But before that let me tell you all that those

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
or are preparing for the long term,

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
both the

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,200
batches for 2027 are available on Study IQ.  Their

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,200
links are given in the comment section.

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
You have to use this code at the time of live checkout

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,119
so that you

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,280
can avail the maximum discount.  Let's get started.

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
First of all, if we talk about Iran and Israel

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
tensions, then historically you all

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,880
know that on one side Iran and Israel are

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,040
Islamic Republics.  On the other side

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
is the Jewish State, Israel.  There

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,880
are hostile relations between the two.  But this did

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,840
not happen earlier.  Before 1979, when the Shah was

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,000
ruling, there used to be very good relations between Israel and Iran.

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,720

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
But because of the revolution in 1979,

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,880
Iran became the Islamic Republic that

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
we see today, and

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,680
if you see since then, there has been

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
a lot of tension between the two.

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
That means you will get to see what is called the arch enemy country.

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
So Iran does not

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
recognize Israel.  Iran says that we do

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,880
not recognize Israel.  On the other

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,200
hand, the anti-Israel groups, whether it is

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,080
Hezbollah in Lebanon or

59
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,400
Hamas Islamic Jihad in Gaza, they continue to support

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,239
Iran and on the other hand,

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
if you look at Israel,

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,560
Israel says that Iran is

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
developing nuclear weapons

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,440
and the reason for this entire war is that

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,760
Israel believes that Iran was going to

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,239
develop a nuclear weapon very soon

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,480
and if that had happened, it would have

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
become an existential threat for them and that is why

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,360
their nuclear sites are being continuously

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,200
attacked.  Well

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,879
now the question arises here because

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
you must be hearing about all this continuously.  The

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
question here is

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,280
what are its implications on global security

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,160
?  Most important is

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,800
instability within West Asia.  This means that the Middle East will

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,000
once again become a war zone.   The

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,239
war between Israel and Iran has happened

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
in many other countries too, be it Lebanon,

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,959
Syria, Iraq or

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,440
Yemen.  You will see its effect in many places.

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
Hezbollah, which has more than 1.5 lakh

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
rockets, can open a second front.

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
Just above Israel, you

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
see this one, on the southern side of Lebanon, there is

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,239
Hezbollah here, in a way.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
So they can open a front here on a large scale,

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
due to which

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,720
tension can again arise in Israel.  Then secondly the

90
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,959
Iranian proxies are the Houthis, apart from this the

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Shiites in Iraq and Syria

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
can also join this entire war.

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
So in a way you can understand that

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
this whole issue in the whole Middle East

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,120
can be converted into Shia and Sunni and

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,840
here you will see every country like Saudi Arabia, UAE

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
jumping into this war.  Well,

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
apart from this, can there be involvement of super powers other than the Middle East

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,840
also?

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,080
If we

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,720
talk about America, it is treaty bound.  Meaning, if there is

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
any threat to Israel, America will support it

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
and is still doing so.  you all know.  In

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
fact, you must have seen that yesterday itself Donald

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,959
Trump has given a clear cut warning

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,120
to Iran and said that if Iran launches

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,920
any kind of attack on us or our assets, then

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
we will attack Iran in a manner that

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,879
it can never even imagine.

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,959
So definitely the US is

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,280
playing a role from the back right now but it may

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,519
come to the front very soon.  On the other hand,

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,840
if we talk about Russia, it is Iran's

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,239
defense partner, especially in Syria,

115
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,240
so it can get involved in it through its diplomatic cloud weapon cells.  The

116
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
concern for China is that it is the

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
biggest buyer of Iranian oil and it has a

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
strategic deal with Iran.  So

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
to some extent he supports Iran.  At the same time, it

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
wants there to be stability because

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
here you can understand that the Belt and Road

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
Initiative can suffer a lot of damage

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,199
if the war escalates.  Well

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
besides that what else?  Apart from this,

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,080
terrorism and cyber warfare can also spread rapidly across the world.  It is being

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,400
said that if

128
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
this war escalates, then Iranian and

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,919
Hezbollah linked sleeper cells can become active

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,400
across the world, especially in Europe, Gulf and

131
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
South Asia,

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
and spread terrorism.

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,240
Apart from this, you will also see an increase in cyber attacks here.

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Especially on

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
critical infrastructure, be it power

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,680
grades, water plants etc, and

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,560
because of this, Israel, which is known for

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,960
its advanced cyber capabilities,

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
can also retaliate here.  So its

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
impact on global security is that

141
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
you will see terrorism and cyber warfare

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
spreading rapidly all over the world.

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Then the biggest danger is the

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,240
nuclear proliferation risk.  This means that

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,120
Iran can do uranium enrichment

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,000
faster from here.  Yes,

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,199
if tomorrow Israel completely destroys Iran's

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,440
network of nuclear weapon

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
sites and nuclear enrichment sites, then

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
that is a different matter.

151
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
But if this does not happen then

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,160
Union uranium enrichment will take place here more rapidly.

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
And it may also be possible that Iran may

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,320
withdraw from the NPT, which is the Nuclear

155
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Non Proliferation Treaty.

156
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,639
Apart from this, regional

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
powers like Saudi Arabia, Turkey would also

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
want nuclear option here.  I mean, you understand that

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,039
once Iran gets the nuclear capability, it

161
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
is obvious that Saudi

162
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
Arabia and Turkey would also want to have the

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,280
nuclear option to protect themselves.  So because of this the

164
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,280
nuclear race can increase rapidly.

165
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
So this

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,600
has an impact on global security.  I hope you are able to understand.

167
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
Secondly, now if we talk about

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,479
what impact will it have on the oil and energy market?   The

169
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
most important is the choke point.  The point

170
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
you will see is State of Hormus.

171
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
You all know this, it became Persian Gulf and it

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,400
became Gulf of Oman.  Keep these two things in mind which are

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,280
important from your exam perspective, that the State of Homos

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,680

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,199
connects both the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  So what happens here is that

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,160
20% of the global oil passes through here.

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,639
25% of the world's liquefied

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
natural gas passes through this particular state.

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
If Iran blocks it,

181
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
which Iran has threatened to do, we will

182
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,440
block it.  So

183
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,759
you can understand that if

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,919
you look at the oil prices here, there has already been a sharp increase.

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,759
But many experts believe

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,759
that this will suddenly increase to $120, $150

187
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,759
and some experts even say that

188
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,840
$200 per barrel, you are understanding that $200 per barrel

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,880
means that the Indian economy will

190
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,199
collapse.  So this could be its impact

191
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,599
and apart from this there could be a major disruption in Gulf exports.

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,599

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,440
Whatever is exported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Qatar.

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,520
Then along with this it

195
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
is obvious that the insurance cost of shipping will

196
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
also increase.  If we talk about oil supply

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,440
disruption, then look, Iran supplies 3 million

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,199
barrels of oil per day, which is

199
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
in danger.  Apart from this, the

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
Aramco facilities here in Saudi Arabia,

201
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,319
which were also subjected to drone strikes in 2019,

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,560

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,919
may once again come under threat and major oil exporters,

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,080
importers India, China, Japan will

205
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,400
travel on a large scale because our current account

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,560
deficit will increase.  There will be fuel inflation

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
which will lead to cost push inflation.

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Now you must be seeing that the RBI in India is

209
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,479
reducing the repo rate

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,680
so that people can borrow more and our

211
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,840
GDP increases.  So all this could backfire

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
if this situation continues any longer.  Apart from this,

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
it is also said that

214
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,199

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,039
oil can be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

216
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
But again there is limited quantity in that too.  There

217
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
is not much quantity.

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
Well, what impact will this have on global trade and

219
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
shipping?  We have

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,319
looked at global security, the impact of oil

221
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
and lastly comes trade.  So

222
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
what is here is that apart from Homos there are

223
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
two more important points here and

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,959
that is the Babel Mandeb Strait.  Again,

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
if you look at this map, here Golf of

226
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,839
Eden has become and Red Sea has become.  This

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,680
connects it to Babel Monday.  And you all

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
know that the Houthis in Yemen are

229
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,240
already attacking ships here.

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,480
In the Red Sea.  So, here the

231
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,480
danger may increase further.  Then there is the Suess

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,040
Canal, here you all know, the Suess

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Canal is in Egypt.  So that

234
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,680
can also create a problem here.  If it gets closed then

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,480
again all the goods will

236
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,959

237
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,279
have to be brought from below via the Cape of Good Hope.  Because of which if you

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
add 10 extra days to the time it used to take then it will

239
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
take more time.  Because of this the

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
cost escalation will be very high.

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,760
Meaning both cost and time will

242
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
spike here.  And ultimately there will be an

243
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
impact on the global economy

244
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
because there will be problems everywhere at the supply chain bottle necks, from cars to

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
semiconductors to fertilizers.  The

246
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
global

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,680
economic forecast will be revised

248
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,080
downwards.  There

249
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
may be a major threat of global recession.  Meaning, the

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,399
impact is being felt from every direction.  As far as the question is

251
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
what is its strategic concern regarding India

252
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
?  So look, first of all we are

253
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
talking about energy security.  Iran was

254
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
once India's third largest oil

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,959
supplier.  So even now we don’t buy it,

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
we say that we don’t buy it.

257
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,360
Now who knows if any oil might be coming from behind.

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
But because of the sensations and war

259
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,920
coming here, this will be a big shock for India.

260
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
Then apart from this, 8 million Indians

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
live in West Asia.  So it will

262
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,600
impact them as well.  Chawah Port: We are trying to ensure that

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
through Iran,

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
from Chawah Port, it goes towards Afghanistan.

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
Now he can be completely blocked.

266
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,800
Geopolitical balancing means that India will have to

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,120
navigate here with Israel,

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
with Iran, with the Arab countries, how we can

269
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
balance ourselves in all this,

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
for example,

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,720
we played a balancing role in the recent Russia-Ukraine war.

272
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
Whether we will be able to do that thing here too, remains to be

273
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
seen.  So this

274
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,240
had an impact on India.  As far as other countries are

275
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
concerned, if we talk about China, as I

276
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
told you earlier, it is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil.

277
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,480
So he would like there to be

278
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,120
stability here.  Otherwise its BRI will have a

279
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
huge impact on the economy.

280
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
Inflation will increase in America.

281
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
Security costs could be military engagement.

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,640
There

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,440
is energy dependency in the European Union, now look,

284
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,519
Europe is already facing the impact of the Ukraine war.

285
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
And if this happens then there will be even more

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,480
impact on Europe.  As far as the Gulf States are

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
concerned, like Saudi

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
Arabia, Qatar, UAE, there can be drone attacks on

289
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,440
their oil infrastructure.

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Look at Russia, it may get some short term benefits due to

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,680
increase in oil price but

292
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
in long term and medium term again there is

293
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,720
danger for it as well.  So the overall

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,880
conclusion is that the Iran-Israel war is

295
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,640

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,720
not basically bringing instability only in West Asia.  This is

297
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,600
on the global economy, on the oil market, on the

298
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,760
maritime trade routes, there too

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,399
you will see one of the biggest threats.   There

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,959
is a danger of global oil shock, multi-front

301
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,360
regional war, economic recession and

302
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,399
involvement of global super powers.

303
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,200
So is this like the oil crisis of 1973

304
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,800
or will there be an impact like that of the Gulf War of 1990

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,560
?  Only time

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,320
will tell.  What do you think about the rest of this

307
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
?  Please let me know in the comments.  And

308

question.  Can you arrange it?
