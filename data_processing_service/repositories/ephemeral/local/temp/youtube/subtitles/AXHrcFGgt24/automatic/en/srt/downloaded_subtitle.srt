1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
what is the right intention with wanting to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,160
do this? You should be ready to die too late.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,639
No God Realization Can Happen Without You Die

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,120
S an ego.

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
Explain what chakras and chakras mean

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,320
Wheel. something that is moving constantly

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,800
and propelling. so these seven chakras in our

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
There are seven energy points in the body that are

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
actually distributing the cosmic

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,400
The energy that we are receiving. it's god

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Created.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,719
Vampire is as powerful as the universe

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,600
is equally divided between white and black

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,000
It has to be so the vampire power it's kind

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
of almost like parasitic on someone it

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
makes a person victim and to death it will

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
Not Leave What the Western World Calls

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,719
Vampires They Thrive and Survive on the

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,000
prana of living beings were you

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,079
Place Satan in this anywhere

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
The Moment You Catch Yourself Going In

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,879
any variation of moods start immediately

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,879
Doing Japa. even if you for the one of it you

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
From Om Namah Shivay. Om Namah Shivay. even if you

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,840
Don't mean it. it will still connect you to the

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,080
Relm. And not allow you to fall down. So

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,600
there are siddhis packed into each one of our

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,760
Bodies. Yes yes. what is an understanding

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240

Divinize. whatever you say it becomes the

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
Power. a command that the universe to

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,320
Accept.

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,800
Why the Mahavidyas are Hidden

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
They are fierce forces past form of

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Energy

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,600
When the Creation Happened

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:56,000
When Consciousness is the Immovable Consciousness

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,520
begin the churning the pulsation of energy and

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Shivan Shakti Spandan Started the Force That

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,680
came out mahashakti we call it adi shakti in

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,280
The Mahavidya Tradition We Call It Adi Shakti

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
So this Adi Shakti is stand alone energy

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,240
back by consciousness of course back by the

105
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,360
The power of Shiva of course but it stands alone

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,880
Enter it has a masculine and feminine

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,479
Polarity in one Mahavidyas are not have

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Concerts in the Present Day Time in the

109
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
present study of mahavidyas in the

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,520
In present era we do have a form of shiva

111
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,120
With every mahavidya we do have a form of

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,440
even vishnu in corresponding to every ah

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,919
Mahavidya however in the history of

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Maha Vidyas There Are Stand Alone Powers

115
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,039
Without the need of a concert without the need

116
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,840
Need of another. so that means that it was a

117
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,039
Complete Amalgamation and Culmination of

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,080
The Perfect Unison of the Masculine End

119
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:59,440
Feminine Polarity. that is why they are so

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,320
Am they are so filigree looking. they are so

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Natural and raw to look at you don't see

122
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,080
Mahavidyas deck up and rest up. We Do

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Them for our worship. we deck them up like

124
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,919
goddess but there are huge portals of

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Energy. Starting from Mahakali Mahakali

126
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,960
so in our tradition and if i can speak a

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,759
Little about the Mahaganapati sect that I

128
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:30,800
Belong to We Have a Dasha Maha Dashabhuja Ganesha

129
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,600

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,319
means 10 arms a ganesha v 10 arms and

131
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,160
A Devi Sing in Ha Lap So The Sect

132
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,960
Guru and the teachers who are there in many

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,919
Life Times They Have Been Dedicated to Both

134
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,240
The Study and Worship of Ganesha and Devi

135
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,479
Which is why I happen to be the blessed

136
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,280
one to receive both these sadhanas ah parallelly

137
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,759
you know and dasha mahavidya comes in the oral

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,479
tradition we don't have much of infatuation there

139
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
is the mythological ination which talks about the

140
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,919
Shakti Manifesting Durga Manifesting

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,400
as this and that is a part that's a lot

142
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,800
Letter

143
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,440
Inception in its origin is the ten Mahavidyas

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,919
Arb Absolute Crew Run Raw Energy

145
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Starts with Mahakali and She Manifest

146
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,199
As the three gunas you know the universe

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
starts the creation of the universe

148
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,440
starts with the creation of the Gunas the

149
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,560
The three Gunas are created first then the

150
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Panchamahabhutas and then the Punshikaran of the

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,479
Panchamahabhootas gives you the gross

152
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,360
Manifestation of this whole creation. What

153
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,639
Are you the Three Mahagunas? The Three Gunas Are The Sat

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,319
Rajas and Tamas. Ok. So Mahakali Adishakti

155
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:51,120
Manifest as Kali the sum total of Tamas in

156
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:55,479
This World Parallel to Shiva and Tara

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,479
Sattva Complete White. and shodshi the

158
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:02,080
Red. Kali is the black, Tara is the white.

159
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,400
Shodashi is the red one. and they give you when

160
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,280
understand like you said you heard a talk that

161
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,759
I go on chakra relationship. it's not

162
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,759
Directly Chakra Relationship But Easier To

163
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,440
Understand from that point of view. So

164
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,960
when you see the seven worlds the chakras are

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,280
Lockjaw. seven worlds beyond these seven worlds

166
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,599
there are these three realms where the control of

167
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,479
Gunas and control of all activity on

168
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,080
Earth is happening. Ok. we will we will have

169
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,479
To pause it a little. Yes. so you are saying at

170
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
The start there were three gunas. Yes. Which

171
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,479
can be understood to be representing the

172
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,640
Three Goddesses That You Just Need. Yes. so three

173
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,320
The Mahavidya Tradition Says There Are Three

174
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,959
above the crown there are three above the crown

175
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,920
there are three points where these three gunas

176
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,120
are controlling all the life on earth kali

177
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,920
being the total of black tara being some

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,480
The Total of White and the Shodashi Being Some Total

179
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:02,160
of the red so there names also infact have

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,519
Interpretations Visavi Diz Gunas Visavi Di So

181
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Kali Itself Means Dark Darkness Total

182
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
Total darkness out of which everything was

183
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,880
Born. there was total darkness out of

184
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,839
Which all has been created. so everything

185
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,959
comes she is she is a keen to she is parallel

186
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,600
To Adi Shakti. she is adi shakti and she is the

187
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,920
The beginning of creation. so it's like

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,279
Creation, Sustenance, Resolution and

189
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,959
Involution. The Cycle Starts With Her

190
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,000
And ends with her. everything emerges out

191
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,080
From her and fun back in her. this is

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
what the

193
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,720
Mahavid Sadhna Teaches Us. so from kali

194
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,320
comes out the white aspect which is

195
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,880
Education Tara which is education, beauty,

Simplicity, Music, Art, Everything and

198
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,160

236
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,040
question yes i am born in 1993 and i

237
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Spent a majority of the 90s watching

238
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,320
television and watching the ancient shows and

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,519
that's my first education about what we

240
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,160
no such sanatan dharma yes one i had never heard

241
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,640
About the Mahavidyas till I turn 28

242
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
B and I had someone on the show talk about yes

243
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,800
so why did this knowledge visit me

244
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,040
When I was a kid. it is not visit many

245
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,279
Of the people not just you. Mahavidyas There

246
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,519
For have been here. They are very powerful.

247
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,320
Extra Ordinarily Powerful and a Person

248
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:15,120
Can become stand alone energy. if you are if

249
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,680
You get into the worship of Mahavidyas then you

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,240
Acquire The Shivaay And The Shakti Principle

251
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
Both active and equal. and you stand alone

252
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,519
then you don't require anything else in this

253
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,959
World. it's like the other in me has

254
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,560
Dissolved in me. and i am a stand

255
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,760
Alone Energy. So from the Sanatana Dharma Point

256
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,680
of view from the society point of view

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,760
This was the entire family. the concept of

258
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,959
everybody becoming a self standing person

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,120
Is an entire family. Family Tradition

260
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,440
Demands

261
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,760
Dependency Interdependency Dependency Good

262
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Strengthening Dependencies by Supporting Each Other

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,800
Each other living together were as Mahavidyas

264
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,160
were found dangerous by the traditional society

265
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,680
they were found dangerous because they were too

266
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,000
Strengthening You Know How to Strengthen You

267
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Can Extract Power Quickly Yes Very

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,560
quickly they are raw i told you they are very

269
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,120
raw u get darshan of mahavidyas very

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,440
easily you start and you know the feeling

271
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,480
The Energy Inside You Can Very Easily Give Extra

272
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,120
are very raw so the kali tara and shodashi hu

273
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,160
are the representatives of the trigunas

274
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,800
And all that is there on earth they represent

275
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
The Triune Nature Completely After

276
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,959
that comes bhuvaneshwari which comes at the

277
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,639
Crown

278
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:39,480
level Bhuvaneshwari is the ruler of the

279
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,920
Bhuvan is the essence of the entire and so she is

280
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,440
Manifested what Kali Tara and Rishi should do

281
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,399
want i think this is also an important

282
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,519
Point in our episode to explain what

283
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,880
Chakras are but more than a Reiki

284
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,240
perspective and in the way that most people

285
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,320
Understanding Chakras or The Seven Ways

286
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,839
Distribution Points Chakras R

287
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,040
What are the distribution points?

288
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,240
we call them they are propelling chakra means

289
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,120
Literally word means wheel chakra means wheel

290
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,880
something that is moving constantly and

291
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,360
Propelling Channeling Energy Energy. so these

292
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,440
Sevencraze in our body are seven energy

293
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
points energy vertices that are

294
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
actually distributing the cosmic

295
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,519
the energy that we are receiving we are receiving

296
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
Life Force Energy. this is nothing self

297
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,120
Generated. there is no courage when you

298
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,000
Understand the science of this Ranveer. there is

299
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,560
No fear. it's all an automated program

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,040
you know set right by god and it's all

301
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,199
Happening. who has seen the chakra and who

302
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,160
Program the Chakra and who has taught the Chakra

303
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,160
To move in a certain way and to channel energy

304
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,040
nobody has known god has known its god

305
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,800
created so these chakras the seven realms are

306
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,720
Energy Vortices They Are Like

307
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,040
Distribution centers at different levels

308
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,279
Starting from the Root Chakra You Know Where the

309
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,760
Lower body is taken care of our lower body

310
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,720
is completely taken care of by the root chakra

311
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,199
And then the Swadhisthana. so the energy that

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,160
means the root chakra energy center we call it the

313
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,000
Muladhara chakra. This Root Chakra Energy Center

314
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,320
is actually responsible for all the

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,720
Activities that are happening in the lower

316
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
Body. It Provides Energy, It Propels

317
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,120
Energy and sends energy to all the organs

318
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,000
systems, physiological functions that are

319
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,000
Happening in the lower body. Right? then you have

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,079
The Delicious and The Green We Call It Green.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,639
And

322
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:32,000
the this is also called cell chakra in in an

323
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,480
Energy Language. This Controls the Lower Abs

324
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,959
Part. You know your reproductive system

325
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,279
Gayani Area

326
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,760
and some part of the abdomen you know

327
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,920
Abdomen extra and delicious is

328
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,560
compared to the depth of the ocean its

329
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,399
considered to be a very deep chakra and this

330
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,519
Chakra is sending energy to all these

331
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,759
Parts of the Body. so when you think

332
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
About Chakras and Talk About Chakra B The

333
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,240
body they are basically providing energy to

334
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,800
all the physiological functions which are

335
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,880
Present in their jurisdiction.

336
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,199
Allright. Swadhisthana is here. it is called

337
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,839
Reproductive center also. and then

338
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,720
Manipura. Manipura is a naval chakra. I am

339
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,959
talking very briefly because our episode is

340
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
not a bar healing that i could go deeper into

341
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,920
The Subject. but just a brief about the

342
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,920
Chakraz. The Manipura The Naval Chakra Tex

343
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,160
Care of this band. abdomen, spleen,

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,199
Liver, pancreas, extra over here,

345
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,759
Provides Energy for All

346
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:31,680
the ah you know functions, physiological functions

347
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,680
and organs. Any Time This Chakra Is

348
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,079
Imbalance We Talk About Chakra Imbalance

349
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,120
is of course you know you here people are talking about

350
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,199
This Chakra is not good and this Chakra is good.

351
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
So when we say it's not good that it means

352
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
it's not doing its duty to spread

353
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,600
Energy Everywhere and Consequentially the

354
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,440
Organ travel. The solar plexus is called the

355
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
Power Centre. this is called a sex centre

356
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,880
And this is called the Earth Center. these three

357
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,800
The Chakras govern the realms of the Earth. Give

358
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,279
Govern the Realms of the Earth That Means All

359
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,240
Living Worldly All the Issues That Are

360
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,640
Concerning our life on earth affect the

361
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,120
Three Areas So the Chakras Exist Within

362
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,679
our body with in our body but they also

363
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,400
Linked to the original loka that they belong

364
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
to those are the trigger points ah to the

365
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,839
connection points trigger points to the

366
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,120
different locales to the different ah ah

367
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,839
Galaxies to the two different Gods and

368
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,439
goddesses they are like you are a hub and these are

369
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
are the points that are connecting you to the

370
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,440
The Entire Universe. like antennas for

371
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Different. Antennas for different parts of

372
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,559
The Universe. Ok. so there is also a

373
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,520
Biological aspects related to chakras in

374
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,559
Terms of a from a healing perspective.

375
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
yes, there is a there is a

376
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,600
Physiological Biological Energy

377
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,919
The Perspective That We as Healers Talk About

378
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Of course there is a mystic approach here

379
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,720
Mahavidyas. We talk about this. you know that

380
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,559
These goddesses are actually elemental. give and take

381
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,840
like elemental because the chakras also

382
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,600
Elemental. Chakras All Panchamahabhutas Have

383
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,760
Created this whole world. so there

384
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,520
everything has to be related to energy

385
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,080
And to ah to the element. something are fiery,

386
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,720
Somethings are watery, somethings are eerie. You

387
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,400
No like that. so, the chakra is also, you know

388
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,080
There is an earth element down below.

389
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
There is a water element in Swadhisthana.

390
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,080
There is a fire element here. Allright. End

391
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,880
Then the air element comes at the heart level.

392
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,720
we call it the anahata or the heart level texts

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,760
Care of this part of the body. and the air

394
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,760
The element is ruling here. so thewes also

395
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Corresponding to this I will come to the list

396
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,000
Of goddess after this. so after the her

397
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,600
element then you have the throat chakra and the

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,080
Vishuddhi. You know here it is the Aakash element.

399
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,960
After the air element it is sky. that's me

400
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,440
Ether. And vishudhi is where the purification

401
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,200
Of prana and all the energy is happening.

402
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,919
Allright. so when we come to mahadevis the maha

403
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,120
Mahavidyas The Chinnamasta Is Here You Know

404
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,120
which is slotted the head completely and

405
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,080
there is a purification of prana and the

406
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,840
Idae and Pingala are flowing you know with

407
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,200
The Kundalini in Complete Activation. after the

408
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,520
sky element ah sky element is going at

409
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
different levels till the crown and beyond

410
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,440
Crown There are these three stations of Devi

411
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,520
The Kali, The Tara and The Shodashi. Ok. Yeah. Ahhh

412
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,120
If One Takes a Cosmic Camera and Places

413
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,919
It's in those losses, what would one see? Because we

414
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,960
are talking about three of the gunachakras, and

415
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,160
then seven other chakras, so we are talking

416
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,000
About 10 different planes. Yes. that do not

417
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,880
Share physical space with our plane on Earth.

418
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Yes. Right? Yes. what would you see if you are

419
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,320
there? Nothing could be seen, can be felt. C

420
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,880
There is no gross reality outside.

421
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,280
There are Sattler alums. Their Sattler Alum. nothing

422
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,520
Is Visible Tribble. it doesn't have a grip

423
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,360
Or. Difficult to place innu words. Yes.

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,240
Very difficult to place in words. It

425
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,160
can be felt, sensed and seen with the inner

426
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,760
I. Can be can be sensed. can be felt

427
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,760
And Seen by the Inner Eye. Heard by the Inner

428
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,120
Word.

429
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,280
But the happenings that take place on earth in

430
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,840
Terms of thought of a very big piticle

431
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,400
Leader Hum

432
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:24,640
and someone dying because of a freak accident

433
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,080
The decisions are being made in those lols.

434
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,320
by the way varshi it works both ways when someone

435
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,520
thinks about destruction this thought goes

436
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,840
there and it is accelerated

437
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,240
energy you know it's like hiranyagarbha

438
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,240
We talk about Hiranyagarbha Hiranyagarbha is a

439
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,039
Voom of the Universe. is the collective thought and

440
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,799
The Collective Mind of the Universe. sleep in

441
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,799
Hiranyagarbha every thought is registered. End

442
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,039
It starts becoming a reality.

443
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,400
Manifesting It Starts Manifesting

444
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,400
over there from there so it comes back over

445
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,600
here as a reality so the it's both ways it is

446
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,480
both ways traffic or so there is an element

447
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,000
of free human will yes as well as the will of

448
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,840
The Datis Yes Yes Okay Beautiful Explanation

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,320
Now I will let you continue to sleep at the heart

450
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,200
level it is the air element and at the throat

451
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,440
level it is the aakash and it goes beyond the

452
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Crown Level So, beyond this upper triangle,

453
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,400
We call it the Upper Triangle. Inverted Upper

454
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Triangle is seen as Kali, Ah Tara and

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
Shodashi. Allright. This Upper Triangle

456
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,159
starts manifesting in all the seven

457
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Lokas, it gets embedded in all these seven

458
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,080
Lockjaw. that means that when bhuvaneshwari is

459
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,640
Happening, when Bhuvaneshwari seated here,

460
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,400
There is a Kali and Tara and Shodashi in

461
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,559
Bhuvaneshwari also. Right? now let me talk

462
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
About the Tantra aspect of it. because it's

463
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,880
A tantric subject. Mahavidyas Itself

464
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,280
It is a Tantric subject. so every goddess

465
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,840
From here onwards you know Bhuvaneshwari then

466
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,640
Chinamasta Bhairavi Bhuvaneshwari Den Bhairavi Den

467
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,720
Chinnamasta Dhumavati Baglamukhi Matangi And

468
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,679
kamalatmika all of these goddesses have this upper

469
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Triangle residing within them. there's all this

470
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,760
goddess all the experiments that are done can be in

471
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,440
White, can be in red and can be in black.

472
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,000
We each of this can be invoked as a star as

473
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,000
white each of these can be invoked as shorshi

474
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,440
As a Raid for Prosperity Business

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,559
extra and each of them can be taken to the

476
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,960
level of kali you see they are there this upper

477
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,080
The triangle is residing in all these seven

478
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,000
Manifestations of the Goddess. so bhuvaneshwari is

479
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,320
worship is also quite a lot, especially in

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
South India you see a lot of tradition. The

481
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,720
Mahavidya tradition has survived in the

482
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,039
South more than in the North. in the north edge

483
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,240
I explore and as I go I travel

484
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,919
Lot to See the Traditional Temples and Study

485
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,799
I love this subject. i see that the

486
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,799
Mahavidyas are modernized in the North

487
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,320
R Modernized. infact in some of the

488
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,840
Traditional temples that are there. you see the

489
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,799
Old pictures are removed now and a very

490
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,200
Feminine Feminine Domesticated Goddess

old books that are written and in

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Museums You See in a Naked Black Weather Her

496
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,640
Hair spread out in absolute freedom and

497
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,679
She is completely divided of conditioning.

498
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,679
There is no conditioning. and fiery fears

499
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,880
absolutely wearing a garland of

500
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,919
Skulls around and there is alphabet written

501
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,799
On the skulls and so she is very fiery.

502
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,919
so people are not you know in the history

503
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,600
Domestication of Mahavidyas

504
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,960
It has happened. first it was put into

505
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,440
Absolute Ah Guhiya Ah In Hiding And

506
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,360
as it is emerging by because people are asking

507
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,240
About Mahavidyas. you see so much of it

508
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,039
Coming out now. when people are asking that

509
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,760
The Domesticated Version Is Preferred You Know

510
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,799
As an incarnation of Durga and with a consort

511
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,640
Shiva and this is preferred for devotion this

512
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,559
is preferred i'm not pro i'm not

513
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,960
against this because for some reasons it's good

514
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,840
for some people it's good for householders

515
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,120
it's good but when you attent into a

516
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,559
Yogic State of Mind and You Are Pursuing

517
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,080
this vidya then it goes into it's not a

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:32,320
woman it's not a man its pure source of

519
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,640
Raw Energy That You Can Harness

520
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,720
Bracketed as a woman for the sake of the

521
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:42,159
Average Human Mind or Why or Why Not

522
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,000
Portray the Mahavidyas as men because of Shakti

523
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,400
is

524
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,840
Feminine primal power has come out of

525
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,200
shiva you know she she is the moving energy shiva

526
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,240

Is moving kinetic energy form. So, peacock

530
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,760
Again to the Feminine, That's Why We

531
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,080

537
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,679
Like basically, the mantras come first.

538
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,279
Mantras have their own energy and for the

539
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,559
Mantras to be Able to Explain

540
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,240
Themselves to human minds de potre

541
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,600
Themselves as human looking forms like

542
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,080
a goddess and goddess of course of course so it is

543
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,279
The Will of the Energy with these two Mantrasars

544
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,240
to portray themselves as well yes yes which

545
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,559
makes me question a lot

546
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,720
About Human Females and Human Males Is

547
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,120
The Nature of Being a Female Very Different

548
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,120
from the nature of being a male

549
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,600
It isn't at a spiritual level. we are semi

550
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:05,200
Nareshwar. We are all Ardhanareshwar. we are ours

551
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,440
body is a rising and then ah is a race you

552
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,000
no the receding energy there is that of

553
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,320
shivaan shakti both. there is consciousness

554
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Inside Which Is the Potential Energy and

555
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,559
There is a whole energy field. gamut of

556
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,120
The energy field that we have. which is the

557
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,240
Power. So, we are all primarily by birth

558
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,960
Ardhanareshwar. but the conditioning that we take

559
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,440
on makes us believe us to be a man or a

560
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,240
Woman. When the Awakening of the Other in New

561
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,880
Happens for instance ah biological man,

562
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,520
When the awakening of the feminine happens,

563
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,440
then he becomes more sensitive, his ego

564
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,200
Gates changed. you know his ego personality

565
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,960
gets changed and he becomes more sensitive

566
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,520
and he is then housing both a male and a

567
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,320
Female. Not biologically but spiritually.

568
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,520
And the female version. by the way varsha she becomes

569
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,520
Bold and Courageous End

570
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,840
very much more than a man you know in the sense of

571
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,600
Her energy in the sense of dynamism in the sense

572
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,840
of her courage fairness extra so a

573
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,520
Yogi then houses both Shiva and Shakti within

574
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,840
him which is the goal which is the goal ok

575
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:18,000
Coming Back to the Mahavidyas Dash 10

576
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,320
Mahavidyas Great Knowledge Yes and There Are 10

577
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,120
chakras that we are speaking about yes so

578
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,240
six inside the body one right above and then

579
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,679
Seven on the Body Including the Crown

580
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,520
And then that upper triangle is the three gunas

581
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,840
above hmm so as i am walking around the

582
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,760
Human World I am carrying all 10 Chakras

583
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,240
with me yes you are carrying all the 10 chakras you

584
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,640
We are carrying the potential of these 10 devices

585
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,880
with you the potential and maha

586
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,120
Vidya Sadhna is all about unlocking that

587
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,039
Unlocking That Potential

588
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:57,520
ok now ah based on what we spoke about

589
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:01,360
in the last episode the ultimate goal for

590
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:05,039
Human kind is to reconnect with the all

591
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,880
Encompassing God That We Call Parmatma Yes And

592
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:12,799
Deti is like krishna lord hanuman ji shivji

593
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,600
Bhairav ​​baba all the people help us to go there

594
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,320
all the energy help us to reach that

595
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Divine

596
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,120
when it comes to the goddess that you just

597
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,840
spoke about i am assuming that the three

598
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,600
Top goddesses are the ones which are the most

599
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,760
Related to Paramatma and Huj Sadhna Texts

600
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,960
you to god the most fearfully but does the

601
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,559
worship of the other seven also take you to the

602
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,000
god 100% each goddess is a door way to

603
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:47,360
parmatma because the upper triangle is

604
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,880
Deciding whether it's all right in the three aspects

605
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,279
Of The Goddess Which Is Kali Taran Produce

606
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,080
Resideing in all the end they are can be the end

607
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,640
they are very fast there are sadhanas they go here

608
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,720
because they are very fast they give it

609
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,799
starts propelling immediately you know

610
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Devi Sadhna Mahavidya Sadhna Immediately

611
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,559
Starts Propelling Energy Inside You.

612
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,919
Ok. What I understand about Mahavidya

613
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,679
sadhana is that in the modern

614
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,159
de there is a lot of people using it for

615
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,720
usage in terms of the benefits of each of

616
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,720
The Individual. Yeah. Mahavidyas Rather Give

617
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,200
Using them as a tool for ultimate

618
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,679
Liberation. Correct. but my question to you

619
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,000
is there a sadhna which includes

620
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:32,080
Worshipping All 10 in Order to Get to Some End

621
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,440
Result? Or. All 10 are encourage people like

622
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,159
me do it. For Exploring the Goddesses. So

623
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,919
for instance when this is my students

624
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:46,679
Learn Mahavidya Sadhna with me. we make them

625
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:50,440
Do a Whole Circuit of All the Mantra Japa Dhyana

626
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:54,240
extra for them to understand and

627
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,360
Realize which of the Goddess is calling them

628
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,159
because we all have different nature all of us

629
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,640
have different nature different nature one can

630
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,640
can't be said better than the other we are all good

631
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
But there is a calling for a certain just

632
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,240
Like how you have a calling for a certain

633
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,440
colour and for a certain taste and smell all of

634
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,159
We have choices. in the same way when you

635
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
Visit All the 10 Mahavidyas You Get a Calling

636
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,720
from a particular goddess it is it is

637
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,880
almost like she is telling you that I will

638
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,799
Help you go there. how are you? when you do the

639
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,039
The entire sequence comes on its own. Or

640
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:36,399
How is Ganesha linked to the Mahavidyas. Ganesha

641
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:41,279
in our sect in my sect because the

642
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,760
Devi sits in his lap we are from ages the

643
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,000
all the other people and my soul which was there

644
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,880
incarnated in earlier ages we have always

645
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Done this sadhna of Devi and Ganesha together in

646
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,960
Devi tradition also be it Shri Vidya and

647
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Be it any other Kali worship. Ganesha Is

648
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,080
considered to be the removal of obstacle and

649
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,000
The Protector That Nobody Comes in the Path of

650
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,880
Your sadhana. So Ganesha Invocation Helps You

To do the siddhi of a devi very easily.

653
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,240
Mala of Ganesh Mantra whenever they are doing

Mahavidyas minus the three which are down. The

693
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,320
once that come from baglamukhi, matangi and

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,559
Kamalatmika, they are very brave. give and take

695

698
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,880
For God. You know, energy is a play for

699
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,440
God, and in this creation all this magical

700
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,000
the mysticul things that you see are all

701
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Games and Toys for God. this what what

702
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,960

705
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,559
With him. if he gives us the ability to see

706
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,760
through or to hear through. Or to do something.

707
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,919
It's for us to play with him. And Not To

708
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Create an identity. dissolving the

709
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:40,000
Identity is the goal of anyone

710
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Sadhana. annie sadhna you name it dissolving our

711
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,080
Identity into God is the goal. if that is the

712
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,440
Goal, how seriously should I take this

713
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,279
Distractions that come on the path. The Many

714
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,679
Destructions That Come on the Path. The Gifts

715
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,320
that are given to you are not for you to keep

716
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:01,120
In the locker. And I am not for you to encash. And

717
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,360
are not for you to gain power with but there are

718
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,760
To give it back to God.

719
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,000
How do you give it back to God if he is

720
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,599
Gifting you with the siddhis you give me when I attach you

721
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,599
all of your karma all of your work vi

722
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,919
divine right that will be done that kingdom

723
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,879
bee says na that will be done so if it is

724
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,520
his will he will make me use the siddhi

725
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,000
Somewhere where it is right in a surrender mode

726
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,760
to use the siddhis when it is

727
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,560
Appropriate in a surrender mode and be so the

728
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,040
The level of awareness should be so high level of

729
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,800
the awareness of me and the me that watches me all the

730
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,720
time should be so high that you should understand

731
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,480
weather it is a prank that my ego is

732
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,200
playing ok show it off now and do it off now

733
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,960
you know or is it coming as something which is

734
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,560
just happening and i'm seeing it is

735
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,280
happening when i have a witness see that

736
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,240
something is happening through me then I

737
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,040
no that i'm not doing it somebody is just

738
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,079
you know god is making me do it flow state

739
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,640
it's flowing but if i find my head

740
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,240
Manipulating Thinking Crafting That

741
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,680
why it's called which

742
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,000
Craft My Brain Is Crafting Now

743
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,160
something and I want to play a show somewhere

744
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,599
then its abuse of that siddhi and thats

745
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,200
not what it was given to you

746
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,079
for comfortable talking about siddhi a

747
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,280
Little Bit Yes Why Not When We Say

748
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,760
Hanuman ji is the giver of Ashtasiddhi no Nidhi

749
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,880
Lee what does that statement mean and

750
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,560
secondly are there at siddhis only and are

751
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,720
There are infinite number of siddhis here

752
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
Infinite number of siddhis and what could

753
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Be a very understandable siddhi for someone

754
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,079
who never heard the term siddhi it's it

755
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,079
Actualization when we talk about a group

756
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,839
of sales a colony of sales okay when you

757
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,760
Talk about a group of cells or a colony

758
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,640
of sale when there is actualization and

759
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,240
maximisation of

760
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:07,000
consciousness completely in full form than the

761
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,000
Shakti their siddhi word is related to

762
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,280
Shakti it's not related to consciousness

763
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,079
it is related to shakti because that means that

764
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,680
Shakti is got it is come in its full

765
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,040
Form like a player comes in its full

766
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,440
form right so that means you have

767
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,160
Actualized and maximized that power

768
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,119
point over there so group of sales now are

769
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Holding on to a maximum of an ability

770
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,119
Of the power and this can be push anywhere.

771
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,800
It can be pushed anywhere. so a the seeker

772
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,720
Realises that he is God, a siddhi. First

773
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000
Of all that does not happen. rarely it

774
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,839
happens because he is in so much

775
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,839
Humility. If he is a real seeker. he is

776
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,000
In so much humility. there are people set off

777
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,160
people who are pursuing siddhis and they are

778
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,480
Doing Sadhana only for the sake of Siddhi.

779
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,720
Which happens or may not happen. it may happen

780
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,720
Or it may not happen. but if a seeker is

781
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,320
Sincere and on his path is emulsifying

782
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,320
and you know melting his ego and on the

783
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,880
Sadhna his focus is not on the siddhi

784
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,000
Siddhis Come To Him

785
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,720
anyway siddhis come to him anyway it's a bye

786
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,320
product of self

787
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,800
Actualization One Colony of Sales

788
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,839
Getting Activated in the Body Is

789
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,599
Like one's own accomplishment and the aim being that yours

790
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:29,760
The whole body has become completely activated.

791
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,160
You know that energy is fair to say that hour

792
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,079
The Human Body Mind and Spirit Holds Much

793
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,280
More potential than we are told in the text

794
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,320
books yes so there are siddhis packed into

795
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,960
each one of our bodies also yes but for the once

796
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,720
Who aligns themselves with the practices

797
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,960
you actually end up seeing those siddhis

798
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,119
Manifest Realities or the End of the World

799
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,760
Ashtasiddhis and these names that you hear of

800
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:57,040
the siddhis these are coming from

801
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,880
Our Traditional Scripture Churl Books. So

802
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,480
there is a limit to what is written

803
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,920
There. There is much more in the universe than

804
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:08,480
That. much more that doesn't have a nomenclature

805
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,040
Yet. Correct correct. much more that can be

806
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,040
Named in the future.

807
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,079
what is n

808
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,400
Understanding Siddhi That You Can Talk

809
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,160
about. so that people have a context on

810
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,720
what is this. The simplest of the siddhi is

811
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,040
Of archsiddhi. when you are doing naam

812
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,560
Remembrance, Nam Japa and when you are doing your

813
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,599
devotion regularly meditation regularly and

814
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,839
Following the Yama Niyamas of Choosing the Right Way

815
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,640
Life is coming more in discipline making

816
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,359
Conscious choices make you achieve success

817
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,000
Easiest siddhi vak siddhi is the power of

818
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,839
Speech the colony of cells here get

819
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,359
Activate the Chakras and Get Divined

820
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,520
Gates Divined. whatever you say comes

821
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,520
True. Vak siddhi is whatever you say

822
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,960
True. it has to manifest because it

823
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,079
Becomes the power. it becomes a command that the

824
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,480
The universe has to accept.

825
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,200
Ok. you know so that's a that's one of the

826
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,160
Easiest one than manifestation. some people have

827
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,320
More manifesting power than others. So two

828
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,040
who are you again everything is related to

829
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,920
Discipline and Practice. for some people are

830
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,480
Born with the Siddhis. for example if

831
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,720
someone has been a seeker in his previous life

832
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:26,079
time and had done a lot of tapa tapa and

833
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,440
have worked you know on all his ah energy

834
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,480
The system and he lets his body end

835
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,400
that life ended now he is born again

836
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,839
new born he is born with what it carries

837
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,000
forward he is born with all of that

838
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,760
the attainment that he had in his previous life

839
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,680
time and as a kid he is born with

840
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,880
siddhis you see so many youngsters you see

841
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,760
These are the miraculous children everywhere young

842
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,640
small boys and girls you know what they are

843
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,440
Born with their Siddhas and so this life

844
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,880
Time is a very limitation to understand

845
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,680
Very Big Limitation Here We Get Confused

846
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,200
A common man would get confused why he

847
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,079
why not me he did this for just one year

848
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,359
and he has reached somewhere i am doing it

849
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,119
for eight years i haven't reached anywhere

850
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:13,960
his previous account is not taken into

851
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,880
Calculate

852
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:22,960
session for instance u have maharathis maha

853
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,280
Rishis like Raman Maharshi and you know and many

854
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,680
Other Saints from Childhood They've Been

855
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,680
Saintly they have been saintly and they have

856
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,760
Born with the wisdom of an 80 year old man

857
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,760
or a very very awakened man what's the

858
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,079
partiality god is doing here that someone

859
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,839
is born with this light and someone is not

860
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,079
Born with the Light and Born with Darkness

861
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,760
in the head what is this partiality it is

862
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,760
nothing there is no partiality

863
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,680
Everything Goes in Law & Order Here There

864
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
There is a perfect order in the universe. there

865
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,320
There is a law of cause and effect that is working

866
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,520
and the accounts are maintained flawlessly

867
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,760
Without any error. The Human Body in Fact

868
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,400
Is a flawless machine. Automated Flawless Machine

869
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,839
where everything is happening automatically

870
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,240
Without your conscious interference in it.

871
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,520
your digestive system is working,

872
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,240
The excretory system is working,

873
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,280
The circulatory system is working. there is so

874
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,680
True miniscule minute detailing in

875
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,599
All these processes. we don't have to have the

876
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,160
Ability to understand these processes

877
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,440
Fully. Leave it to them having any control over

878
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,359
It. I don't know why I am asking you

879
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,520
This question. but whenever we have them

880
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,160
Spiritual Conversations Were Usually

881
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,520
talking about such subjects weather

882
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:41,280
Context is age zero to age 80 and 90

883
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,720
When you pass away. what about the phase of

884
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,200
The time which happens after you pass away in

885
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,319
Terms of if you have done the sadhana through out

886
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,440
Your Life But You Have Not Reached Enlightenment

887
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,680
you got a come back to this realm so between the

888
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,960
the next birth and this birth while you are

889
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,599
Spending time up there and down there do you

890
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,839
Get to interact with the date? this this

891
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,640
also a two schools have thought that duality and

892
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,520
Advaita think differently about this. The Soul

893
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,200
has been different from the whole game of

894
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,079
Consciousness. itself is advaita

895
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,240
Perspective Where It Travels and Goes

896
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,720
to different realms and goes through four heavens

897
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,960
And then it's coming back on the Earth. The

898
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,560
Stories as the Stories and the Explanations

899
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,640
As written in the Puranas, different

900
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,240
Scriptures, different Puranas talk about the

901
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,880
Different journeys of the soul you know after death.

902
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,319
Advaita which is non dual consciousness

903
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
talks about there is a screen there is

904
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,839
Consciousness. Ok? Now there is a ring.

905
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,319

926
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:29,760
embodiment this ring color changes a little the

927
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,000
Soul chooses to play a different role

928
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,079

Pink and Green from Is Coming. Consciousness

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,680
That means the back drop is not changing at

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,440
All. Consciousness is remaining. what does that mean

980
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,319
Accept whatever you do. there was a very

981
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,760
Beautiful There is a very beautiful South

982
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,520
Indian Movie Ah In Which There Is A Goddess

983
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,359
Shon looks like matangi to me.

984
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,000
and there is a big pendol and a big

985
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,560
function happening in that home because they are there

986
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,040
calling somebody like

987
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:18,640
Shankaracharya status person to come and do the

988
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,280
Worship of that goddess. so ah panchbhog and so

989
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,680
Much of ah prasad and everything was done. in

990
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,480
That house. there was a servant made you know

991
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,119
Who is working and she is in love with Devi.

992
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,560
but she is obviously not allowed to come there

993
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,680
And do things because she is a worker. So

994
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,880
she in her small plate you know does everything

995
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,880
what the priest was doing giving prasad

996
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,760
Giving this then she was tasting and seeing

997
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,319
If That Little She Made Was Good or Not

998
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,800

1002
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,040
Depiction It's a Story But the Ethos Is Very

1003
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,359
Clear that goddesses respond to love and

1004
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,280

Khadgamala. you know there others towards assam

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,960
side and kolkata side which is completely

1043
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,559
Different. You know so it's not the last word.

1044
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,280
Belonging to a sect is like

1045
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:55,119
Belonging to a family were certain way off

1046
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,400
Living is a burden. Right? Or

1047
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,960
Ok. Let's speak about the three.

1048
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,079
you speak about matangi right now or what

1049
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:08,200

1056
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,280

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,599
Plants with Herbs with So Many Things

1066
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,280
I made a very beautiful candle for you and

1067
00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:00,559
brought it yes with lots of mantras in it you

1068
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,839
no i explore this manifestation of the

1069
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,720
Divine energy in every iota and part and

1070
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:10,000
every grain of your living is the true

1071
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,280
Utility of this goddess to play these games

1072
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,079
that can very easily get hooked on to your

1073
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:20,160
Ego Like Things Like Vashikaran And Things

1074
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:22,960
like you know ah mesmerizing someone taking

1075
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,960
someones mind in control how good would that

1076
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,680
be this karma it is too complicated its

1077
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,079
Too complicated when you are a real seeker

1078
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,280
Then you want to share your personnel

1079
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,280
Patterns Rather Than Pile On More and More

1080
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,359
kind of interaction with another human being

1081
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,000
Create a positive or negative will

1082
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,240
or 100% like even if I'm having a two

1083
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,480
Sentence Conversation with Someone That is 100% N

1084
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,119
Intention Forget About Conversation Even If

1085
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,000
you have an intention in your heart

1086
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,839
to utilize this for something that has also

1087
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,559
Created Karma Even Thought Creates Karma

1088
00:50:53,839 --> 00:51:01,280
Enough thought creates more karma than action really

1089
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:03,520
Yes Thought Creates More Karma Than Action N

1090
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,240
unevolved ignorant person if he goes and

1091
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:10,000
slaps a boy on the street it will create

1092
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,720
A karma but not as bad as if I visualize it

1093
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,119
that's where I'm going and slumping that boy just

1094
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,880
Visualize and have an intention I wanna go

1095
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,760
and slap that boy it created a bigger

1096
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,680
Karma Seed That Man Who's Actually Gone

1097
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,960
and slapped him why do because you are not

1098
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:28,400
Causing physical harm by thought is easy

1099
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,359
a wave is a vibration nazar thought is a wave is

1100
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,160
a vibration just like bad luck is like you

1101
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,440
Putting an eye on that boy on that boy and more

1102
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,119
then you are evolved see anybody who is

1103
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Doing Experiments or Is Wanting to

1104
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,760
Experiment with these things is obvious

1105
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,079
An Evolved Person Evolved Soul Right A

1106
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,640
An ordinary man wouldn't want to do anything

1107
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,720
ok he is a help

1108
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,480
Helpless you know living an ordinary life.

1109
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,520
so an evolved person having the intention to

1110
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,800
control someone in

1111
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:03,040
it itself is a huge karma

1112
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:06,079
Creation. This goes into the golden womb. it's

1113
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,480
like in very ordinary language if a poor

1114
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,520
man on the street a beggar a rickshaw wala or

1115
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,920
Someone it just picks up a ₹100 from someone

1116
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,160
Pocket. he rubs lets say ₹100 from someone

1117
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,400
Pocket. It will create a karma. but it wont

1118
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,599
create such a big karma as much as i go

1119
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,640
and pick up a ₹1 from someone's purse when

1120
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,720
You are evolved as a soul and you are born with

1121
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,839
awareness and you have been blessed with the

1122
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,079
Higher Deeper Knowing of the Universe and You Can

1123
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,640
See the Substratum and You Can Lift Up and

1124
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,800
Look into the Karma cycle and the cause and the

1125
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,359
effect with this deep understanding if you

1126
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,680
do a petty something it creates a huge

1127
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,680
Karma

1128
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,720
The Higher You Climb The Harder You Will Fall

1129
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,720
that's it

1130
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:54,480
OK WE SPOKE ON MATANGI RIGHT NOW

1131
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:58,559
Associated We Craft And Ya Mohini Sadhna

1132
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,599
Mostly Vashikaran Mohini Sadhna and Also

1133
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,920
Lot of

1134
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:06,800
Small Fragments of These Sadhna Diez

1135
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,040
Experiment are done you know they prepare talisman and

1136
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,280
they prepare you know all kinds of things

1137
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:15,520
to eat extra they are all fragments of

1138
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:19,200
these are two sadhnas basically if you want to

1139
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,319
Pursue the Goddess Matangi to a very deep

1140
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,839
Degree How Much Time Do You Have to Dedicate

1141
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,520
Depends on your soul's back

1142
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:30,000
Journey for Instance It Doesn't Take Any Time

1143
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,680
for me because i think i am the only one

1144
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,839
Living my past lives is my life

1145
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,000
I haven't worked very hard

1146
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,640
have work very hard in this life you really

1147
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,280
Think Despite Living Alone Doing Sadhna I

1148
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,599
think so

1149
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,960
ok or

1150
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,680
But the Sadhna Wood Entails and Elaborates

1151
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,040
Mantra Yes for sure it has Mantra End

1152
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:56,480
Meditation as a part of it control of food

1153
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:00,400
Timings of Diet Control Diet Control

1154
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,240
Timings go with the rhythm of nature you know

1155
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,240
go with the rhythm of the nature

1156
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,319
And we say these are all supporting systems.

1157
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,960
See a yogi who is living in the forest and

1158
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:14,319
Doing Matangi Sadhana. let's say may not do

1159
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:18,680
all of these things for him just the mantra

1160
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:22,800
And Dhyana is Enough for How Long Years

1161
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,520
together and probably hours daily or but it

1162
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,880
it's like you can't appropriate you can't

1163
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,400
approximately this because somebody who is caring

1164
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,599
forward a previous

1165
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:38,160
Life Balance With Him Few Months Could Be

1166
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,559
Enough for him to trigger that wisdom and

1167
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,680
trigger that energy which was already late

1168
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,960
In the snow. How does one know if the energy has been

1169
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,000
Triggered?

1170
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,040
It gets found out. It gets found out. Kant B

1171
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,359
Explain in words may your dream be there

1172
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,839
is there a realization of something

1173
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,160
inside it's like i know but i can't

1174
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:02,000
explain it or

1175
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,960
ok sorry what was the lowest chakra one

1176
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,760
Kamalatmika is like Lakshmi goddess of

1177
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Early Wealth and Money and Prosperity and

1178
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,200
Everything. so she is kamalatmika has

1179
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,160
Mostly Dissolved in the Form of Lakshmi

1180
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,319
Which is in the present day. that nobody is

1181
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:22,240
Doing special sadhanas for Kamalatmika on

1182
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:24,880
From. really or it's almost like you know

1183
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,640
Taken as the other Laxmi Sadhna we do Shri

1184
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,520
Suktam and We Do You Know Kanak Kanak

1185
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,760
Mahalakshmi Stotra and so many others. So

1186
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,880
she is almost like amalgamated with the

1187
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,440
Modern day Lakshmi. or so when we say

1188
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,119
Lakshmi is the Goddess of Wealth or

1189
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,920
praying to her will attract wealth of

1190
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:49,760
different yes of course of course it will be okay we

1191
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,559
Baglamukhi yes so baglamukhi comes from the

1192
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,599
The Solar Plexus is Obviously Fire Energy

1193
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,640
Energy of Will Energy of Power So She Is Say

1194
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,960
Erection power Baglamukhi is Erection power She

1195
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,760
can't stop anything it can it can it can

1196
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,200
come with the solar power you know the power of the

1197
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,160
Solar Plexus

1198
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,319
that yellow and that blazing fire is what

1199
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,359
Baglamukhi is deified at and that's why

1200
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:16,880
she is a specialist at stopping something you

1201
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:20,160
No to end all the high death all experiments are

1202
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,720
Done with Matangi and Ah Baglamukhi both are

1203
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,520
Utilize these you know this. So the Lower Three

1204
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,400
Chakras a lot of work is done. The Early Work

1205
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,440
It is done. ah the other once higher once are mostly

1206
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:36,160
Utilized for ah transcendence and for

1207
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,839
Higher Ah Aints. but, if there are 100

1208
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,040
Who Human Beings Hypothetically Are

1209
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:44,160
Practicing the Sadhanas of the Three Lower

1210
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Devise. What is there intention usually?

1211
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,599
Like I'm sure 100 out of 100 are not

1212
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,960
Utilizing it. It is curiosity.

1213
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:55,559
Ok. Mostly it is curiosity. What is

1214
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,240
We will see. Let us see what it is. End

1215
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,720
Curiosity Spiritual Curiosity More

1216
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,960
So

1217
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,839
Also as a seeker my observation is this. I

1218
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,000
May be wrong. as a seeker is growing you know

1219
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,839
as you are

1220
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,079
Growing. There are many others watching you.

1221
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,559
There are many others looking at you. there

1222
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,960
many others are close to you and they may be

1223
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,720
wanting to also try and do things

1224
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,160
That's what you are doing. so a lot of borod

1225
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,880
Desires. It is a very big disease. is a

1226
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,720
Very big disease. Borod Desire. Or. I I

1227
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,520
I this is my phrase. My personal phrase.

1228
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,319
I have read it anyway. Borrowed Desires Is

1229
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:35,839
Like you see someone being successfully flying

1230
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:38,400
A kite. Ok. now you will see the 100 people

1231
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,240
More Flying Kites. it's like you know you

1232
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,040
doing a good podcast there are many others who

1233
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,440
You want to be just the way you are. You Know

1234
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,359
Similar to me. oh ah what a wonderful life

1235
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,280
But they don't know what life I go through.

1236
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,520
Living Up on the Mountain Alone. you know is

1237
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,880
Life. So a lot of borrowed desire. Meni

1238
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,520
People who are on this path. late se a 100 off

1239
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,040
Them that you said. RR of Curiosity

1240
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:04,720
and a borrowed curiosity of not really

1241
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,960
Wanting neither the goddess nor the shiva.

1242
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:10,400
what is the right intention with wanting to

1243
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,359
do the sadhana? you should be ready to die to be

1244
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,079
Late.

1245
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:18,240
Want it as much as you want a breath. you you

1246
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,760
you should be ready to dissolve your self and

1247
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,160
Let her be. so that even ends and there is no god

1248
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,520
Realization can happen without you dying as

1249
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,240
An ego. it can't happen if one does any of these

1250
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,079
Mahavidya Sadhanas

1251
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:36,799
Correctly and Correctly is a Subjective

1252
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:39,920
term but yes if one does it we complete faith a

1253
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:43,520
you know penance etsetra etsetra what is the

1254
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,799
and result and result is a philosophy and

1255
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,119
realization of that energy in you it's in

1256
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:52,920
It's in you that you realize for instance

1257
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:56,480
I have loved Matangi for a long time

1258
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,559
And she just disappears everywhere to me.

1259
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,799
Just out of your devotion for her. yes, just

1260
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,880
Out of her devotion for her. can you look at

1261
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,040
someone and get to know them a little bit and

1262
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,920
tell them that he this is the mahavidya you should

1263
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,000
B. Or,

1264
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:13,280
Immediately. Immediately. you will be speaking

1265
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,280
After the podcast.

1266
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,359
Anything else you want to say about Baglamukhi?

1267
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,119
She is considered very dangerous. that's why

1268
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:23,040
People are dangerous in the sense that they are very fiery.

1269
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,280
so don't touch me until you are very sure

1270
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,839
About it and very dedicated. Why?

1271
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,160
because it has a fiery energy and a lot of

1272
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:34,640
Negative experiments are done. More of Negative

1273
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:37,760
Experiments are done with her. so people are scared

1274
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,240
To come into every devotion. those who have come into

1275
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,160
The bhakti have come into the bhakti because they have

1276
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,839
Been Blessed with Something That Was Successful

1277
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:49,040
And taken for granted. At some point. at some point

1278
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:52,079
Point. somebody wanted to win a court case

1279
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,160
And you know he did some sadhana baglamukhi vent

1280
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,280
Somewhere and some pandit did a puja for him

1281
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,520
Oher and the court case was you know through and

1282
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,559
Due to this he became an eternal devotee of Baglamukhi.

1283
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,040
many of them are into bhakti like

1284
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:08,640
That. few of them rarely and they are really

1285
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:11,359
Uniform that they just have a liking for her.

1286
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,240
They just have attraction for her. they just

1287
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:17,680
have you known something is pulling me to

1288
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,760
every. For no reason. That is true devotion. that

1289
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,799
There is true attraction and that is a calling.

1290
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:27,119
True calling. so the sadhna should be done coming

1291
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,480
Back to the statement again. the sadhana should be

1292
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,960
Don't be friends the power to realize her in

1293
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,480
You end up getting a realization,

1294
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:40,839
Actualization and acquisition. we that should be the

1295
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,839
Reason. Everything else will come soon.

1296
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:47,599
Hot moving on to the upper cycle. to the

1297
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,640
Dhumavati. Dhumavati. from here from here

1298
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:52,160
You know the centers the vertices. these three r's

1299
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,960
the worldly vertices and these are the

1300
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,599
Psychological and the Upper World Vertices

1301
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,839
Chakras. So, Dhumavati you know, ah

1302
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,720
Corresponds to the air element. thats

1303
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:05,119
Why She Is Departed Grey and Very

1304
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,760
depressive which is a very very

1305
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,040
Distracting picture of hers. she is

1306
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,839
Actually an ocean of love. she can remove poverty

1307
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,799
Completely. She can remove grief completely.

1308
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,520
she can remove it but people are very scared too

1309
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:21,920
enter into her because she is depicted like

1310
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,680
die like a widow like a very scary

1311
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,760
figure with you know no color in her yantras

1312
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,680
also there is no color there is just a grey

1313
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,400
and in fact many temples even if you go

1314
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,960
to kamakhya they say the dhumavati nobody goes a

1315
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,119
Lots of our temple traditions which are

1316
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,760
there they discourage people to take darshan of

1317
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,119
Dhumavati. I have people discourage Dhumavati

1318
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,760
Worship on the show as well. or sleep, but she

1319
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:49,000
Is really in ocean of love. i went to the

1320
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,119
Baglamukhi Am Temple At

1321
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,119
Ah In The Middle

1322
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:58,720
State Datia. there is a beautiful

1323
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,520
Baglamukhi Temple at Datia. we i had gone

1324
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,119
with one of my friend and

1325
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,040
Students. when we were coming out of the

1326
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,440
Temple after doing the puja and everything.

1327
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:10,079
There is a Dhumavati temple there. So The Pandit

1328
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,240
I told you, mother, please do not go there. Bus

1329
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,400
I told you about the pain, please take a darshan mother

1330
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,160
I didn't do it, you just took it from the window

1331
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,880
look into the pp through the window and that's

1332
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,079
it he was discouraging us to even go there

1333
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,079
so we kept his honour you know okay because okay

1334
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,799
if he saying don't go we just don't go

1335
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,640
came back to our car a huge crow that i

1336
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,359
have never seen in my life such a huge crow

1337
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:35,599
came and sat on our

1338
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:38,720
Car You Know So It Is As If She Came And Crow

1339
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,799
is a vahan for dhumavati you know it is as if

1340
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,839
she came to him and she said okay you're not

1341
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:46,359
I am coming you know so these are so

1342
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:49,119
The indications are very subtle

1343
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:51,720
Indications for a common man who is very

1344
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:56,319
Logical End

1345
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:58,799
very you know brain oriented intellectual

1346
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:01,599
he may not even give an importance to such a thing

1347
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:03,839
An event what is there what is so big

1348
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,880
About a crow coming and sitting on your car

1349
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,880
But when it is coming as a coincidence

1350
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,880
When you are not going to the temple and end

1351
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,280
Suddenly I don't know where such a big crow is

1352
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,280
The size of the crow was amazing. and we three

1353
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,839
we were three of us and whether we were three

1354
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,079
Wide Eyed Jaw Dropped Looking At The Crow.

1355
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:23,200
because we all understood three in our

1356
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,760
Hearts That's Where She Is. so you know they

1357
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,720
Manifest around you. so dhumavati is an ocean

1358
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:32,480
Of compassion very very beautiful. so as a

1359
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,359
therapist and as a person who is into

1360
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,559
Mahavidya Sadhanaaz. We recommend Dhumawatis

1361
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:40,039
Mantra Rarely Only When Somebody Is Grief

1362
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,200
Stricken For

1363
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:46,640
Long Innu Deep Depression and Grief Stricken

1364
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,839
and just doesn't find any light in life then

1365
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,799
Dhumavati is given as a very antidote for a

1366
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,960
very short

1367
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:57,680
vile and then there are tantriks

1368
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,720
Practitioners That Do the Siddhi of Dhumavati

1369
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:04,400
also for prayog chinmast and dhumavati

1370
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:07,680
also have a set of experiments that are you know

1371
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,559
popular use for for all of this that we

1372
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,799
Speak about mesmerizing games and playing

1373
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:17,599
with the toys that god has given us

1374
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:21,119
ok give two extremes of people that do her

1375
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:23,839
Sadhna once that wanted to extract the power

1376
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,760
You know I utilize the power for different

1377
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:29,200
Kinds of Experiments That They Want to Do

1378
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,599
do and the others who are wanting a healing

1379
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,799
deep healing she is a she is a great healer

1380
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:38,079
Dhumavati she can actually remove the powerless

1381
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:41,280
Conditions in all levels. Material Emotional

1382
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:44,079
Levels you know. So she is a healer. and air

1383
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,640
element you know so air element itself is

1384
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,200
Creates a lot of change. Invoking Her Is

1385
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,039
Like invoking the air element. why you?

1386
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,200
you know it said that when you begin any

1387
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,880
Kind of deity worship. like when you

1388
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,359
Prefer a particular date, you get trades

1389
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,079
Off that daty. which is why i think people

1390
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:03,599
Fear springs to Dhumavati. Yeah. that will you

1391
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:07,119
Also became a widow? will you also or that's

1392
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,599
That's the negative bit of conditioning

1393
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,280
Which is there. that's a negative bit of

1394
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,920
Conditioning Which Is There Which Is Not

1395
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,079
True. A they are not in human forms.

1396
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,960
The gods are not in human forms. give and take

1397
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,280
Huge Energy Portals and Energy Day

1398
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,039
Create Energy Movement. so the depiction as

1399
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:28,319
woman is only symbolic of the

1400
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:30,960
Characteristics and Elemental Depictions

1401
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,440
Radar. The Yellow in Baglamukhi is all about the

1402
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,680
Fire element. it's not that she is a woman

1403
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,079
who likes yellow. It's not like that.

1404
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,640
similarly devi is the bhuvaneshwari is there

1405
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:44,559
Shoulder She Is Departed With The Red. it's more

1406
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:47,280
Symbolic to you know to the Rajas. Rajasic

1407
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,520
Energy is depicted by red offen. because

1408
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,599
it it has a lot of attraction and a lot of

1409
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,839
Abundance with itself. So, let's go

1410
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,559
Deputed like that. it's not that they are any

1411
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:59,039
Kind of woman. so even when we say we are

1412
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,440
Getting a Darshan. suppose i say that i have a

1413
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,240
Philosophy of Matangi. it's actually a

1414
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,760
Protection of my mind. you know there is

1415
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,760
My Energy System and My Mind

1416
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,319
Projecting into a Goddess that is so real

1417
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,440
In front of me. so it's my creation

1418
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:16,000
Basically. we are not coming in any form

1419
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,680
Anywhere like that. The energy is supporting.

1420
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,920
Undoubtedly she is supporting which is

1421
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,160
Why we say Devi has given me darshan. I

1422
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,839
Don't say that I have created a philosophy. So

1423
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,960
Devi has given me a darshan because it's

1424
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:28,799
Something that I couldn't do it has happened.

1425
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,359
How ever it is a projection from your own

1426
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:33,760
pranic system and end when you

1427
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:35,760
understand the science of it you understand

1428
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,839
it very deeply that it's a projection of

1429
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,599
Your pranic system and the maruls of your

1430
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:43,039
bodies are coming outside and giving you

1431
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,920
darshan wow or they are giving you darshan it

1432
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,960
only for your eyes it's a state of being

1433
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,920
Hypertune Again Very Hypertune and Its

1434
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,559
Like a Prasad Hum it's like a reward

1435
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,440
the system that your energy and your

1436
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:59,680
Consciousness Inside Is Giving You For You

1437
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,760
Shor Dedication and Devotion. Like If You Work

1438
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,640
out long enough and eat cleanly you will see

1439
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,839
Abs one day. Yes. Like that. To Trivialize

1440
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,559
It. And a very gross level good example.

1441
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,119
Moving on. or then after or after dhumavati

1442
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,160
then you have

1443
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:18,720
The ah chinnamasta. you know the picture of

1444
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,720
Chinnamasta is deputed in the Mahavidya

1445
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,880
Books. Whatever Few Books We Have. You Know

1446
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,920
How many. Western Have Written Coincidentally

1447
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,839
More Books. On Mahavidyaana Indians. You Know

1448
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,640
and indian books are all full of experiments and

1449
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:33,039
Everything because the focus is different. give me

1450
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,160
Focus in the Western World is All About

1451
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:38,160
Research and Inquiry. They gave and they had

1452
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,160
Not written anything much about experiments.

1453
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,119
Indian books have written more about experiment

1454
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,039
because this is where the application of the

1455
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:47,599
Mahavidyas is Conard. I Wood from Conard

1456
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:50,960
Because it is not taking into devotion level. So,

1457
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:53,280
Chinhnamasta is depicted as ah dacapitated.

1458
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,599
She's she's got a cut off head, chopped off head.

1459
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,280
and she is holding our head in her own in her

1460
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:02,720
on hand oozing out blood and then there are s

1461
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,680
you know fountains of three fountains oozing

1462
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,000
out from her they are said to be pingala

1463
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,920
and the sushmana the energy fountains they are

1464
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,319
Actually Energy Fountains They Aren't

1465
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,319
blood they are not blood and then they are two

1466
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:20,080
dakinis who are drinking this ah the dakinis

1467
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,040
are the cosmic powers and she chinnamasta is

1468
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,799
Standing Over a Copulating Couple She

1469
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,279
Standing on a copulating couple in the

1470
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,960
Puranaz it is written as Rati and Kama. She

1471
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,839
Is standing on this. So basically, the

1472
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:35,120
symbolism involved here is that complete

1473
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:37,520
Control over your ego, cutting off the head in

1474

Of Lust and Desire. so it's a highest

1481
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,040
Attainment. it's a spiritual attainment and

1482
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,239
It corresponds to the Aakash tattva

1483
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,719
to the ether to which all the other elements are

1484
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:07,920
Born. Sky, air, fire, you give the earth

1485
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:11,440
We are born to the sky. so she is at the apex

1486
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:15,279

The Way Gandhwas Help People to Create

1714
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:46,960
Positivity and Positive Creations. The

1715
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:51,679
Devils help people to create chaos and

01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:54,000
Confusion and War. Ok? so, how does one

1717
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:58,000
Decide whether you've been guided by the devil or

1718
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Buy a Gandharva? The mind is a barometer. If

1719
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,080
You are in a positive mind and uplifted

1720
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,640
Mind and you are a seeker, you are in mantra japa

1721
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,239

1722
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,880
actions and thoughts and everything, you

1723
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,960
Automatically connect to the higher level. If You

are angry any time, even a good person can

1725
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,000
Be angry any time. If You're Angry Anyone

1726
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,280
Time Allow Yourself to Breed Two Kinds

1727
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,840
Of Marinette in that anger.

1728
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:23,840
and you will immediately get a four

1729
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,320

1732
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,760

01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:29,840
Social media, there be one for the world of

1756
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,000
Cricket. hmm and of course the commonality in some

1757
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,480
on these negative forums is, they approach

1758
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,760
Almost every single topic negatively.

1759
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:41,120
Hmm, or. that's a fed that's there

1760
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,960
Work that's a religion. So on some level, the

1761
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,120
realm of the asuras is affecting all this

1762
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,280
Ficus religiosa. Of course they are supported guides. You

1763
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,920
no i have a it's important for me

1764
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,960
To give an example here if you permit me.

1765
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,880
or I had a Filipino once to come to learn

1766
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,120
with me. I do one on one learnings in the

1767
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,679
Hermitage. i used to do more that before

1768
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,400
Now I have group online sessions happening

1769
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:04,080
And I do personal coaching now. Income Take Up

1770
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:07,440
Coaching for Good People Who Want to

1771
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:11,040
Progress. So, I had this Filipina boy

1772
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:13,440
who came to study with me and he was in too

1773
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,520
Substance Abuse and Alcoholism and He

1774
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,480
Says mother I don't event. so, he had a

1775
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,560
Realization. he had a godly realization

1776
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,800
because of which he just gave up everything

1777
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,159
And He Went on a Personal Journey of Becoming

1778
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,800
A monk. you know it's a very dramatic story

1779
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:31,199
Head. but something that stayed with me in my

1780
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,159
Mind what he narrated to me. he said that

1781
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:36,719
every time i would take something if he is you

1782
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:39,760
no consuming anything he says that i would

1783
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:42,960
There are many dark forces behind me and them

1784
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:45,440
would you like to put me with so much power

1785
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,000
Said I used to feel powerful. I used to

1786
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:51,520
Feel the Power of the Whole World Is With Me.

1787
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,400
And they would walk with me. Hee sez. i say the

1788
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,760
The moment I would come out of my this thing and

1789
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,320
I felt so powerless. I felt as if I

1790
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,719
could not even stand and walk and things

1791
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,920
like that and when i was narrating to him

1792
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:08,480
This you know with the choice with the mind and with

1793
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:11,600
Our awareness we can connect to each other the higher

1794
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:15,000
Or the lower it depends on us. so by the way v

1795
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:19,280
That he was giving me this example. So the

1796
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,760
Asuras are parallel i mean as powerful as the

1797
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:26,000
Gandharvaaz and then you have just like the

1798
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:29,199
Yakshas you have ghosts. You know Bhootaaj ​​R Gan.

1799
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,679
they're like just like the arc angels

1800
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:34,560
you know they are more powerful and they have gan

1801
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,760
with them they have many asuras with them

1802
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,320
have many people with them that they and so they

1803
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:43,360
Affect people who are in negative thoughts for a

1804
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:46,639
long time somebody who is in a negative thought

1805
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:51,120
pattern for a long time some form of

1806
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:54,320
Depression and some negative thoughts

1807
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:56,480
negative action on earth in their family in

1808
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:59,199
their relationship they almost like became

1809
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:02,159
Devilish. The People Almost Like to Become Very

1810
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:05,199
Devilish. you know so there they are a pa source

1811
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:07,600
Of power to all negative activities. End

1812
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:10,480
then the last of them at power with the gods

1813
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,080
Is a vampire. What the Western World Calls

1814
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:15,120
Vampires.

1815
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:17,520
you know the vampire power is a very very huge

1816
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,840
Power. It's a huge power. it's at par

1817
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,560
With God. that means it's like a portal of

1818
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Energy. Again negative energy. The Universe

1819
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:28,560
is equally divided between white and

1820
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:31,120
Black. It has to be. The game has to go on.

1821
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:34,159
so the vampire power it's kind of

1822
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:36,400
Almost like parasitic on someone. if it's

1823
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:38,960
makes a person victim and to death it will

1824
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,760
NOT LEAVE. it rises and it sucks out

1825
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,600
Life. The Three Realms It is Said. that the

1826
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,080
the three realms do not have an independent

1827
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,920
Source of Prana in the Universe. They Thrive

1828
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:52,400
and survive on the prana of living

1829
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:53,639
Beings. so they are all the time searching for

1830
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,880
someone to

1831
01:24:53,639 --> 01:25:00,480
Pylon as a source of energy speaking of the

1832
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:03,760
positive highest world you can say that is

1833
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,639
dawlok dawaz or it wood contain elements of

1834
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,239
hanuman ji all of our devas all of ours

1835
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:12,960
Dewas

1836
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:16,400
So the vampire realm is as powerful as Dev Rathal

1837
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,800
so these are negative gods yes yes they were

1838
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:22,400
you play satan in this

1839
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:24,560
Put it anywhere.

1840
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:27,120
in our culture who is an example of a

1841
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,080
Vampire? A lot of them are there? Asuras Have

1842
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,920
been mentioned in purana also we have had so

1843
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:35,920
many asuras that have been spoken a

1844
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:37,920
mahishasura and you know i see those names

1845
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,800
Give it quite differently. I find them all

1846
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,960
symbolic of

1847
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:45,440
Some wrong trait in us. for example you

1848
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,760
Have a Jambasur. jambasura is like when

1849
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,520
You then say that the Jambhasura enters into

1850
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:53,679
Your Mouth and It Makes Your Body Very

1851
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:56,880
Lazy. So the jambhai word is basically yanning.

1852
01:25:53,679 --> 01:26:00,239
Many of these asura names are Krodhasur. You

1853
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:03,280
No they have all names associated with negative

1854
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:07,199
Instincts in human beings. so however

1855
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:08,800
I do believe that ah these two forces are

1856
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,960
Coexisting.

1857
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,040
They are existing as the negative and the

1858
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,000
Positive and One Must as a Human Being

1859
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:19,120
Always make a conscious choice to be in the

1860
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,560
higher realms in the above realms how can one

1861
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:26,360
do it because you get angry everybody gets

1862
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:29,840
angry and irritated and depressed or you know

1863
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:32,159
frustrated this is an invitation for the asura

1864
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,159
The You Know Kingdom and the Lower Kingdom. So the

1865
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:37,280
The Moment You Catch Yourself Going Into Anyone

1866
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:40,000
Variations of moods immediately start doing

1867
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:42,480
Chanted. whatever japa you are doing even if you

1868
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,560
For the nay for the heck of it you say Om Namah

1869
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,280
Shivaya Om Namah Shivaya Even If You Don't Mean It

1870
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,920
it will still connect you to the realm above and

1871
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,920
Not allowing you to fall down. you know these olden

1872
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:56,239
Times People Would Say If You See Something

1873
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:58,320
happening on the road something ah that

1874
01:26:56,239 --> 01:27:00,800
one should not see may be some accident or

1875
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,400
Anything. Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Just Say

1876
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,000
that and move away people would advise the

1877
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,719
Elders who would advise the children just say

1878
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,800
Ram Ram Ram Ram and move away so don't want

1879
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:12,159
even a visual

1880
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:15,600
take a taking us down there you know it

1881
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:18,960
like that's so the name of god and and you know

1882
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:21,520
chanting chanting namsmaran inside in

1883
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:25,480
Itself is a powerful tool that will take you

1884
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:27,840
in connection with the higher realms this is

1885
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,600
Why a Lot of People Talk About High

1886
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,080
Frequency Conversion High Versus Low

1887
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,320
frequency absolutely yes it's the same

1888
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,560
thing it's the same thing and lo

1889
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,239
Frequency need not always be cheap and

1890
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:43,040
dirty it could be even something as simple as

1891
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:45,920
Fear Fear is a Very Innocent Thing Can

1892
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:51,199
Grip Anybody But It's Bad

Sake about someone, someone, someone? it's

1897
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:06,920
Absolutely a low frequency talk. Ok?

1898
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:09,920
Hmm. let's get to high frequency

01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,280
india there are many others you have lots of

1929
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:42,960
Bhuvaneshwari Temples in South. north india

1930
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:45,520
She isn't even known. not many people the common

1931
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,239
Folk. They don't even know the world Bhuvaneshwari?

1932
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:51,760
Should we be stopping the conversation here? And

1933
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:53,920
should we elongate on tara kali maa and

1934
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:57,639
Trishurishi Tripura Sundari.

1935
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,560
or we can so that we do justice to this

1936
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:03,360
talk very briefly speaking about there the

1937
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,760
Rulers of the Gunas especially the Shodashi Shi

1938
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:09,280
has become more famous and Tara has gone more

1939
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,760
to orient to the Buddhist culture why

1940
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:14,719
it's just i think something historical

1941
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,920
Geographical reason for which Buddhism had come

1942
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:20,000
into india and you know and then they developed

1943
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,560
it's not that there is no work done there it

1944
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,520
not like that the buddhist saints end

1945
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,159
Sears

1946
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,760
have worked a lot on done a lot of sadhna on

1947
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:32,320
Tara and Tantra has as a separate wing of

1948
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,280
practice has developed over there with the

1949
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,560
Tara Cult is here in India we have

1950
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,400
Ugratara and Saumya Tara Worshipped Ugratara

1951
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,440
And the saumya tara the ugratara is a very

1952
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:46,639
Fiery version of Kali's you know they say that

1953
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:49,520
Kali is transcended so you are there in

1954
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:51,840
Consciousness but Tara is transcending that

1955
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,560
Means she is very helpful for you to go to tech

1956
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:57,199
You into the higher this thing. So Tara Worship

1957
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,199
is really very especially in the East and the

1958
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,159
North East there is a lot of Tara worship

1959
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:04,719
Still going on. we have the tarapith you know

1960
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:07,280
Above West Bengal in West Bengal Kolkata.

1961
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:10,719
Tarapitha is very famous. It's very nice.

1962
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:13,040
Fiery Tara is worship there. The Gentle Tara Haze

1963
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:15,679
Gone more to Buddhist. I feel it. Ah The One

1964
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,920
Sitting on the Lotus you know the white color Tara.

1965
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:20,239
She depicts education in Saraswati. she is a

1966
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:23,360
Tantrik Saraswati. even matangi is a

1967
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:26,320
Tantrik Saraswati. The Lower. she is because of

1968
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:28,800
Arts, all the arts. This one is more white.

1969
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,520
Tara is more white because she opens up

1970
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,560
Wisdom. and opens the direction, the right

1971
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,639
Steps That You Want to Take in

1972
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:40,159
Life. The misunderstanding that people often

1973
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:43,520
get out of these goddesses is ah out of all the

1974
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:46,320
Sadhnaaz. is their mind automatic the condition

1975
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,719
The mind automatically goes towards the practical

1976
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,520
Applications in their work and in their

1977
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:54,480
Material side. which is not what they are

1978
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:57,760
made for they are there and that's something

1979
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:59,760
that you automatically get you don't need to ask

1980
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,400
it's something that you will automatically get

1981
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:06,719
need not ask but the focus is being there

1982
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:08,760
Reduces the effect of the blessings we receive

1983
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,760
the focus should be to embrace

1984
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:14,560
Devi Obviously If the Devi is there is the source

1985
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,719
of energy is there you will get everything you

1986
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:20,639
if you say i want to be friend the sun is the

1987
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:23,199
The sun is going to be your friend without his rage

1988
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,600
it is said the glory of the goddess comes to

1989
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:28,560
You automatically when you become friend with the other one. So

1990
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,320
The Focus Is The Take Away From This Podcast

1991
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,880
Probably we are me sitting here. thats the love

1992
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:37,280
For the goddess is an important aspect

1993
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,440
That should not be missed out. and focus on

1994
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:43,199
Siddhis. Focus on Blessings and Focus on

1995
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:45,120
The by products of this blessing. shud

1996
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:47,440
Not be focused on. it will you will get that

1997
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:49,840
Automatically. you know who really want to

1998
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:52,480
worship and they want to experience the goddess

1999
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:56,480
Increase your love and seeking for the Goddess

2000
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:59,520
every sec rather than for this sec and that sec

2001
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:03,600
which will automatically come and then black

2002
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,920
The Dark She Is All of Us No You Know

2003
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,800
ramakrishna paramahansa is there so many other kali

2004
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,320
Sadhakkas are there ocean of love and compassion she

2005
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:14,639
annihilates everything she finishes the ego

2006
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:17,040
Completely so Kali Bhakti is done real Kali

2007
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:19,719
Bhakti is done by sadhak who does who really

2008
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,719
want to finish there

2009
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:24,560
Ego She She Completely

2010
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:29,600
you know it takes you into a transcendence

2011
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:33,520
state of samadhi she samadhi you can say that

2012
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:37,120
Dharana Dhyan Samadhi Dayam That We Spoke About

2013
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,760
In ten Dharana Dhyana and Samadhi these three

2014
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:42,080
people are capable of

2015
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:44,560
The three goddesses are capable of doing

2016
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,040
Fair to say that Kali Sadhna works the

2017
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,719
Fastest in terms of the yes because she is

2018
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:52,679
is the most your choice doesn't happen people are

2019
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:56,960
Scared to Choose Kali

2020
01:33:52,679 --> 01:34:00,360
sadhana she chooses you she chooses you she will choose you

2021
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:02,880
and it is the fastest because it is the

2022
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,239
The purest it is. she's gotta know

2023
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,639
The Conditioning Other Goddesses Have

2024
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:11,199
Covers. she is covering has been layers of

2025
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:14,080
Personality Like You Know The Different Chakra

2026
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:17,120
Personalities As We Speak. but kali is is

2027
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,440
Absolutely Nude She Is Unconditioned

2028
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:22,480
Completely unconditioned she is no cover raw

2029
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:26,000
Energy Raw Energy

2030
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:30,400
on what basis does she choose the seeker on the

2031
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,360
Basis of your past deeds and past sadhana

2032
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,840
If you've been on a tumultuous path and a

2033
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:40,719
Steady

2034
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:44,159
Relentless Known Dying Path She Has Merse and

2036
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:50,320
we once hosted someone on the show who was a

2037
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:53,520
descendants of the

2038
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:56,800
line of pandits who perform pujas at the

2039
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,560
Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal Oh How Amazing

2040

who and up choosing the bhairav ​​path have a

2048
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,920
The Tendency Towards Being

2049
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:31,600
destructive could have been in the

2050
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,280
the past could have been in the past it's a very

2051
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:38,880
Femme Familarity We Call It

01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:40,960
Familiarity and so that the goddess attracts

2053
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,920

01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:52,560
we know fully conditioned is redundant its

2078
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,510
futile it's all drama and it's all a

2079
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,480
waste of time
