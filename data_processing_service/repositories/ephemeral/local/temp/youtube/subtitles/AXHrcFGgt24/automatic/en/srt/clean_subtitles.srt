Today We Deep Dive into ten Mahavidya concepts which We have it covered on the channel. Butt mother knowledge Subra brings her own spin to it. it's Always almost therapeutic talking to mother. and i hope you feel the same way by the end of The Episode. gyan sura on TRS [music] Welcome back mother. Thank you Ranveer. we have taken an our long break since the last recording and people have got to know what you are about. We are so thankful to you for being in Our Studio. Again. Thank You We Have Created Two Incredibly Deep Episodes About Dash Mahavidyas vs Dr Vineet Agarwal & rajshree nandhi sir and both approach this subject from two different angles or for The Sake of Research for Our Podcast I Went through a speech that you have given about the Mahavidyas. ah and you spoke about how It's link to the chakras within the human Body as well. you also began by speaking About Kali Maa and Tara Maa and one more Ah Shorshi Shorshish That's a goddess that I have not heard about tripura sundari ok god job under its same Thing | Yeah | Allright | I will actually hand it over to you because there was a lot of parts of diet speech which i found Extremely Fascinating But A Lot Of Places Where I Wanted to Ask You More Questions. so i am getting to do that Today. hoon al let you begin today's episode bye either beginning wherever you want or a Chant the mantra Ah completely up to you so sincere it is dedicated to the mahavidyas will do a Small Mantras of the Mahavidyas Om Shri Mahaganap Namah Kali Tara Mahavidya Shodashi Bhuvaneshwari Bhairavi Symbol Mastach Vidya Dhumavati and Bagla Siddha Vidya Cha Matangi Kamalatmika Yeta Dash Maha Vidya Siddha Knowledge Prakirtita Yeta Dash Maha Vidya Gupta Vidya Kirtita Om Why the Mahavidyas are Hidden They are fierce forces past form of Energy When the Creation Happened When Consciousness is the Immovable Consciousness begin the churning the pulsation of energy and Shivan Shakti Spandan Started the Force That came out mahashakti we call it adi shakti in The Mahavidya Tradition We Call It Adi Shakti So this Adi Shakti is stand alone energy back by consciousness of course back by the The power of Shiva of course but it stands alone Enter it has a masculine and feminine Polarity in one Mahavidyas are not have Concerts in the Present Day Time in the present study of mahavidyas in the In present era we do have a form of shiva With every mahavidya we do have a form of even vishnu in corresponding to every ah Mahavidya however in the history of Maha Vidyas There Are Stand Alone Powers Without the need of a concert without the need Need of another. so that means that it was a Complete Amalgamation and Culmination of The Perfect Unison of the Masculine End Feminine Polarity. that is why they are so Am they are so filigree looking. they are so Natural and raw to look at you don't see Mahavidyas deck up and rest up. We Do Them for our worship. we deck them up like goddess but there are huge portals of Energy. Starting from Mahakali Mahakali so in our tradition and if i can speak a Little about the Mahaganapati sect that I Belong to We Have a Dasha Maha Dashabhuja Ganesha In Our Hermitage In Rishikesh 10 Dashbhuja That means 10 arms a ganesha v 10 arms and A Devi Sing in Ha Lap So The Sect Guru and the teachers who are there in many Life Times They Have Been Dedicated to Both The Study and Worship of Ganesha and Devi Which is why I happen to be the blessed one to receive both these sadhanas ah parallelly you know and dasha mahavidya comes in the oral tradition we don't have much of infatuation there is the mythological ination which talks about the Shakti Manifesting Durga Manifesting as this and that is a part that's a lot Letter Inception in its origin is the ten Mahavidyas Arb Absolute Crew Run Raw Energy Starts with Mahakali and She Manifest As the three gunas you know the universe starts the creation of the universe starts with the creation of the Gunas the The three Gunas are created first then the Panchamahabhutas and then the Punshikaran of the Panchamahabhootas gives you the gross Manifestation of this whole creation. What Are you the Three Mahagunas? The Three Gunas Are The Sat Rajas and Tamas. Ok. So Mahakali Adishakti Manifest as Kali the sum total of Tamas in This World Parallel to Shiva and Tara Sattva Complete White. and shodshi the Red. Kali is the black, Tara is the white. Shodashi is the red one. and they give you when understand like you said you heard a talk that I go on chakra relationship. it's not Directly Chakra Relationship But Easier To Understand from that point of view. So when you see the seven worlds the chakras are Lockjaw. seven worlds beyond these seven worlds there are these three realms where the control of Gunas and control of all activity on Earth is happening. Ok. we will we will have To pause it a little. Yes. so you are saying at The start there were three gunas. Yes. Which can be understood to be representing the Three Goddesses That You Just Need. Yes. so three The Mahavidya Tradition Says There Are Three above the crown there are three above the crown there are three points where these three gunas are controlling all the life on earth kali being the total of black tara being some The Total of White and the Shodashi Being Some Total of the red so there names also infact have Interpretations Visavi Diz Gunas Visavi Di So Kali Itself Means Dark Darkness Total Total darkness out of which everything was Born. there was total darkness out of Which all has been created. so everything comes she is she is a keen to she is parallel To Adi Shakti. she is adi shakti and she is the The beginning of creation. so it's like Creation, Sustenance, Resolution and Involution. The Cycle Starts With Her And ends with her. everything emerges out From her and fun back in her. this is what the Mahavid Sadhna Teaches Us. so from kali comes out the white aspect which is Education Tara which is education, beauty, Harmony, Simplicity, Music, Art, Everything and then shodshi which is which is like Absolute grandeur and royalty that Human beings derive their name from Earth. De Direve Royalty and Grand that's why she is more Popular What We Call Sri Vidya What We call sri vidya s different sect and Different schools are teaching Shri Vidya is Nothing But The Activation Of Shodashi Shodashi Representing all the so each of the Mahavidyas Is practiced by different sects Differently one Mahavidya is picked up for Instance We Have Sects That Are Only Inu Kali worship so Kali here is representing all the Similarly in the Tara has gone more to the Buddhism. Tara has traveled more to the Buddhist Tradition. there also you are White Tara, Black Tara, Red Tara, Blue Tara, Green Tara. Tara is representing all the end which is the shri which is Also called Tripura Sundari. Rajarajeswari. Right? this goddess is Representing the total of goddesses and twos who are doing the sadhana and upasana, they Realize all the levels of this Goddess. Same S Kamakhya Devi Same S Kamakhya Devi Kamakhya Devi is Kali personified it It's Kali basically and in the Kamakhya Devi temple you find the pandits will tell you that this is there is lakshmi here and there is saraswati here basically it is shodashi antara There it is sodash antara over there and then on that hill guwahati the way kamakhya is all are the mahavidyas are there all the temples of the mahavidyas are there so it is a Representation of the Whole Culmination of All Goddess Merging Inu Kali Inu Kamakhya Again to understand this better i have a personal question yes i am born in 1993 and i Spent a majority of the 90s watching television and watching the ancient shows and that's my first education about what we no such sanatan dharma yes one i had never heard About the Mahavidyas till I turn 28 B and I had someone on the show talk about yes so why did this knowledge visit me When I was a kid. it is not visit many Of the people not just you. Mahavidyas There For have been here. They are very powerful. Extra Ordinarily Powerful and a Person Can become stand alone energy. if you are if You get into the worship of Mahavidyas then you Acquire The Shivaay And The Shakti Principle Both active and equal. and you stand alone then you don't require anything else in this World. it's like the other in me has Dissolved in me. and i am a stand Alone Energy. So from the Sanatana Dharma Point of view from the society point of view This was the entire family. the concept of everybody becoming a self standing person Is an entire family. Family Tradition Demands Dependency Interdependency Dependency Good Strengthening Dependencies by Supporting Each Other Each other living together were as Mahavidyas were found dangerous by the traditional society they were found dangerous because they were too Strengthening You Know How to Strengthen You Can Extract Power Quickly Yes Very quickly they are raw i told you they are very raw u get darshan of mahavidyas very easily you start and you know the feeling The Energy Inside You Can Very Easily Give Extra are very raw so the kali tara and shodashi hu are the representatives of the trigunas And all that is there on earth they represent The Triune Nature Completely After that comes bhuvaneshwari which comes at the Crown level Bhuvaneshwari is the ruler of the Bhuvan is the essence of the entire and so she is Manifested what Kali Tara and Rishi should do want i think this is also an important Point in our episode to explain what Chakras are but more than a Reiki perspective and in the way that most people Understanding Chakras or The Seven Ways Distribution Points Chakras R What are the distribution points? we call them they are propelling chakra means Literally word means wheel chakra means wheel something that is moving constantly and Propelling Channeling Energy Energy. so these Sevencraze in our body are seven energy points energy vertices that are actually distributing the cosmic the energy that we are receiving we are receiving Life Force Energy. this is nothing self Generated. there is no courage when you Understand the science of this Ranveer. there is No fear. it's all an automated program you know set right by god and it's all Happening. who has seen the chakra and who Program the Chakra and who has taught the Chakra To move in a certain way and to channel energy nobody has known god has known its god created so these chakras the seven realms are Energy Vortices They Are Like Distribution centers at different levels Starting from the Root Chakra You Know Where the Lower body is taken care of our lower body is completely taken care of by the root chakra And then the Swadhisthana. so the energy that means the root chakra energy center we call it the Muladhara chakra. This Root Chakra Energy Center is actually responsible for all the Activities that are happening in the lower Body. It Provides Energy, It Propels Energy and sends energy to all the organs systems, physiological functions that are Happening in the lower body. Right? then you have The Delicious and The Green We Call It Green. And the this is also called cell chakra in in an Energy Language. This Controls the Lower Abs Part. You know your reproductive system Gayani Area and some part of the abdomen you know Abdomen extra and delicious is compared to the depth of the ocean its considered to be a very deep chakra and this Chakra is sending energy to all these Parts of the Body. so when you think About Chakras and Talk About Chakra B The body they are basically providing energy to all the physiological functions which are Present in their jurisdiction. Allright. Swadhisthana is here. it is called Reproductive center also. and then Manipura. Manipura is a naval chakra. I am talking very briefly because our episode is not a bar healing that i could go deeper into The Subject. but just a brief about the Chakraz. The Manipura The Naval Chakra Tex Care of this band. abdomen, spleen, Liver, pancreas, extra over here, Provides Energy for All the ah you know functions, physiological functions and organs. Any Time This Chakra Is Imbalance We Talk About Chakra Imbalance is of course you know you here people are talking about This Chakra is not good and this Chakra is good. So when we say it's not good that it means it's not doing its duty to spread Energy Everywhere and Consequentially the Organ travel. The solar plexus is called the Power Centre. this is called a sex centre And this is called the Earth Center. these three The Chakras govern the realms of the Earth. Give Govern the Realms of the Earth That Means All Living Worldly All the Issues That Are Concerning our life on earth affect the Three Areas So the Chakras Exist Within our body with in our body but they also Linked to the original loka that they belong to those are the trigger points ah to the connection points trigger points to the different locales to the different ah ah Galaxies to the two different Gods and goddesses they are like you are a hub and these are are the points that are connecting you to the The Entire Universe. like antennas for Different. Antennas for different parts of The Universe. Ok. so there is also a Biological aspects related to chakras in Terms of a from a healing perspective. yes, there is a there is a Physiological Biological Energy The Perspective That We as Healers Talk About Of course there is a mystic approach here Mahavidyas. We talk about this. you know that These goddesses are actually elemental. give and take like elemental because the chakras also Elemental. Chakras All Panchamahabhutas Have Created this whole world. so there everything has to be related to energy And to ah to the element. something are fiery, Somethings are watery, somethings are eerie. You No like that. so, the chakra is also, you know There is an earth element down below. There is a water element in Swadhisthana. There is a fire element here. Allright. End Then the air element comes at the heart level. we call it the anahata or the heart level texts Care of this part of the body. and the air The element is ruling here. so thewes also Corresponding to this I will come to the list Of goddess after this. so after the her element then you have the throat chakra and the Vishuddhi. You know here it is the Aakash element. After the air element it is sky. that's me Ether. And vishudhi is where the purification Of prana and all the energy is happening. Allright. so when we come to mahadevis the maha Mahavidyas The Chinnamasta Is Here You Know which is slotted the head completely and there is a purification of prana and the Idae and Pingala are flowing you know with The Kundalini in Complete Activation. after the sky element ah sky element is going at different levels till the crown and beyond Crown There are these three stations of Devi The Kali, The Tara and The Shodashi. Ok. Yeah. Ahhh If One Takes a Cosmic Camera and Places It's in those losses, what would one see? Because we are talking about three of the gunachakras, and then seven other chakras, so we are talking About 10 different planes. Yes. that do not Share physical space with our plane on Earth. Yes. Right? Yes. what would you see if you are there? Nothing could be seen, can be felt. C There is no gross reality outside. There are Sattler alums. Their Sattler Alum. nothing Is Visible Tribble. it doesn't have a grip Or. Difficult to place innu words. Yes. Very difficult to place in words. It can be felt, sensed and seen with the inner I. Can be can be sensed. can be felt And Seen by the Inner Eye. Heard by the Inner Word. But the happenings that take place on earth in Terms of thought of a very big piticle Leader Hum and someone dying because of a freak accident The decisions are being made in those lols. by the way varshi it works both ways when someone thinks about destruction this thought goes there and it is accelerated energy you know it's like hiranyagarbha We talk about Hiranyagarbha Hiranyagarbha is a Voom of the Universe. is the collective thought and The Collective Mind of the Universe. sleep in Hiranyagarbha every thought is registered. End It starts becoming a reality. Manifesting It Starts Manifesting over there from there so it comes back over here as a reality so the it's both ways it is both ways traffic or so there is an element of free human will yes as well as the will of The Datis Yes Yes Okay Beautiful Explanation Now I will let you continue to sleep at the heart level it is the air element and at the throat level it is the aakash and it goes beyond the Crown Level So, beyond this upper triangle, We call it the Upper Triangle. Inverted Upper Triangle is seen as Kali, Ah Tara and Shodashi. Allright. This Upper Triangle starts manifesting in all the seven Lokas, it gets embedded in all these seven Lockjaw. that means that when bhuvaneshwari is Happening, when Bhuvaneshwari seated here, There is a Kali and Tara and Shodashi in Bhuvaneshwari also. Right? now let me talk About the Tantra aspect of it. because it's A tantric subject. Mahavidyas Itself It is a Tantric subject. so every goddess From here onwards you know Bhuvaneshwari then Chinamasta Bhairavi Bhuvaneshwari Den Bhairavi Den Chinnamasta Dhumavati Baglamukhi Matangi And kamalatmika all of these goddesses have this upper Triangle residing within them. there's all this goddess all the experiments that are done can be in White, can be in red and can be in black. We each of this can be invoked as a star as white each of these can be invoked as shorshi As a Raid for Prosperity Business extra and each of them can be taken to the level of kali you see they are there this upper The triangle is residing in all these seven Manifestations of the Goddess. so bhuvaneshwari is worship is also quite a lot, especially in South India you see a lot of tradition. The Mahavidya tradition has survived in the South more than in the North. in the north edge I explore and as I go I travel Lot to See the Traditional Temples and Study I love this subject. i see that the Mahavidyas are modernized in the North R Modernized. infact in some of the Traditional temples that are there. you see the Old pictures are removed now and a very Feminine Feminine Domesticated Goddess pictures are there which is wearing a saree and july and those pictures are pur weather Mahavidyas Var Very Rawr You See The Old P old books that are written and in Museums You See in a Naked Black Weather Her Hair spread out in absolute freedom and She is completely divided of conditioning. There is no conditioning. and fiery fears absolutely wearing a garland of Skulls around and there is alphabet written On the skulls and so she is very fiery. so people are not you know in the history Domestication of Mahavidyas It has happened. first it was put into Absolute Ah Guhiya Ah In Hiding And as it is emerging by because people are asking About Mahavidyas. you see so much of it Coming out now. when people are asking that The Domesticated Version Is Preferred You Know As an incarnation of Durga and with a consort Shiva and this is preferred for devotion this is preferred i'm not pro i'm not against this because for some reasons it's good for some people it's good for householders it's good but when you attent into a Yogic State of Mind and You Are Pursuing this vidya then it goes into it's not a woman it's not a man its pure source of Raw Energy That You Can Harness Bracketed as a woman for the sake of the Average Human Mind or Why or Why Not Portray the Mahavidyas as men because of Shakti is Feminine primal power has come out of shiva you know she she is the moving energy shiva is she the divine only see both Aspects of Paramatma One is Ah is A Station Potential Energy Form and the Others Is moving kinetic energy form. So, peacock Again to the Feminine, That's Why We Depicted as goddess. hmm not that i want to despise them as Mains. that was just my curiosity Speaking up. ah and i will tell you the Origin Source of That Curiosity. agreed sir head said something Like basically, the mantras come first. Mantras have their own energy and for the Mantras to be Able to Explain Themselves to human minds de potre Themselves as human looking forms like a goddess and goddess of course of course so it is The Will of the Energy with these two Mantrasars to portray themselves as well yes yes which makes me question a lot About Human Females and Human Males Is The Nature of Being a Female Very Different from the nature of being a male It isn't at a spiritual level. we are semi Nareshwar. We are all Ardhanareshwar. we are ours body is a rising and then ah is a race you no the receding energy there is that of shivaan shakti both. there is consciousness Inside Which Is the Potential Energy and There is a whole energy field. gamut of The energy field that we have. which is the Power. So, we are all primarily by birth Ardhanareshwar. but the conditioning that we take on makes us believe us to be a man or a Woman. When the Awakening of the Other in New Happens for instance ah biological man, When the awakening of the feminine happens, then he becomes more sensitive, his ego Gates changed. you know his ego personality gets changed and he becomes more sensitive and he is then housing both a male and a Female. Not biologically but spiritually. And the female version. by the way varsha she becomes Bold and Courageous End very much more than a man you know in the sense of Her energy in the sense of dynamism in the sense of her courage fairness extra so a Yogi then houses both Shiva and Shakti within him which is the goal which is the goal ok Coming Back to the Mahavidyas Dash 10 Mahavidyas Great Knowledge Yes and There Are 10 chakras that we are speaking about yes so six inside the body one right above and then Seven on the Body Including the Crown And then that upper triangle is the three gunas above hmm so as i am walking around the Human World I am carrying all 10 Chakras with me yes you are carrying all the 10 chakras you We are carrying the potential of these 10 devices with you the potential and maha Vidya Sadhna is all about unlocking that Unlocking That Potential ok now ah based on what we spoke about in the last episode the ultimate goal for Human kind is to reconnect with the all Encompassing God That We Call Parmatma Yes And Deti is like krishna lord hanuman ji shivji Bhairav ​​baba all the people help us to go there all the energy help us to reach that Divine when it comes to the goddess that you just spoke about i am assuming that the three Top goddesses are the ones which are the most Related to Paramatma and Huj Sadhna Texts you to god the most fearfully but does the worship of the other seven also take you to the god 100% each goddess is a door way to parmatma because the upper triangle is Deciding whether it's all right in the three aspects Of The Goddess Which Is Kali Taran Produce Resideing in all the end they are can be the end they are very fast there are sadhanas they go here because they are very fast they give it starts propelling immediately you know Devi Sadhna Mahavidya Sadhna Immediately Starts Propelling Energy Inside You. Ok. What I understand about Mahavidya sadhana is that in the modern de there is a lot of people using it for usage in terms of the benefits of each of The Individual. Yeah. Mahavidyas Rather Give Using them as a tool for ultimate Liberation. Correct. but my question to you is there a sadhna which includes Worshipping All 10 in Order to Get to Some End Result? Or. All 10 are encourage people like me do it. For Exploring the Goddesses. So for instance when this is my students Learn Mahavidya Sadhna with me. we make them Do a Whole Circuit of All the Mantra Japa Dhyana extra for them to understand and Realize which of the Goddess is calling them because we all have different nature all of us have different nature different nature one can can't be said better than the other we are all good But there is a calling for a certain just Like how you have a calling for a certain colour and for a certain taste and smell all of We have choices. in the same way when you Visit All the 10 Mahavidyas You Get a Calling from a particular goddess it is it is almost like she is telling you that I will Help you go there. how are you? when you do the The entire sequence comes on its own. Or How is Ganesha linked to the Mahavidyas. Ganesha in our sect in my sect because the Devi sits in his lap we are from ages the all the other people and my soul which was there incarnated in earlier ages we have always Done this sadhna of Devi and Ganesha together in Devi tradition also be it Shri Vidya and Be it any other Kali worship. Ganesha Is considered to be the removal of obstacle and The Protector That Nobody Comes in the Path of Your sadhana. So Ganesha Invocation Helps You To do the siddhi of a devi very easily. That's why a lot of people do at least one Mala of Ganesh Mantra whenever they are doing Goddess worship. What Ganesh Mantra? Annie Ganesh Mantra in our sect we have a long Ganesh Mahaganapati Mool Mantra And I Have Given it's to you on the dupatta that I have Given you on the stole that I gave you. it's Printed. very its an old mahaganapati original Mantra available everywhere. we don't normally pronouns it's like this o on the on the on the Show. The Mantra Is Not Supposed To Be Said Like this on the it's a long mantra but it's a Beautiful mantra. Why is it? I have seen it Rajshri sir do this as well. like he is not Willing to say certain words and chants Certain Mantras. because we do puraanas and Rituals for Many Years Now. you know of The Mantra. Mantra becomes Siddha in our life System. we are not supposed to like it Giving a Lot of Reference and Respect That you're not just casually flirting with it here and there to impress the audience or to Show How Good I Am At That Mantra and whatever. It's in humility in Surrender and submission that it is kept Quiet. Yeah. it's not that it's a Secret. It's not a secret. you can Find Mahaganapati Mool Mantra Anywhere You Google and you will find it. it's not That's a secret. it's not that it Should not be given to people. it's we don't say It's up to you to float it. or to utilize it for Our showcasing it. you know, ya. getting back Into the Mahavidya Conversation. I don't know what question to ask Ask you next to forward the conversation. Because I don't know where to begin. Yeah. so, i actually handed it over to you to you and then i will stop you Whoever has a question. Yeah. most of the Mahavidyas minus the three which are down. The once that come from baglamukhi, matangi and Kamalatmika, they are very brave. give and take Very Worli Vidya and They Are Persuaded Bai Sadhakkas for Siddhis and for Magicals Abilities and For. So, it's a play for For God. You know, energy is a play for God, and in this creation all this magical the mysticul things that you see are all Games and Toys for God. this what what I have understood out of this. these are Games for us to play but play with him. You no, these are games that we can play but play With him. if he gives us the ability to see through or to hear through. Or to do something. It's for us to play with him. And Not To Create an identity. dissolving the Identity is the goal of anyone Sadhana. annie sadhna you name it dissolving our Identity into God is the goal. if that is the Goal, how seriously should I take this Distractions that come on the path. The Many Destructions That Come on the Path. The Gifts that are given to you are not for you to keep In the locker. And I am not for you to encash. And are not for you to gain power with but there are To give it back to God. How do you give it back to God if he is Gifting you with the siddhis you give me when I attach you all of your karma all of your work vi divine right that will be done that kingdom bee says na that will be done so if it is his will he will make me use the siddhi Somewhere where it is right in a surrender mode to use the siddhis when it is Appropriate in a surrender mode and be so the The level of awareness should be so high level of the awareness of me and the me that watches me all the time should be so high that you should understand weather it is a prank that my ego is playing ok show it off now and do it off now you know or is it coming as something which is just happening and i'm seeing it is happening when i have a witness see that something is happening through me then I no that i'm not doing it somebody is just you know god is making me do it flow state it's flowing but if i find my head Manipulating Thinking Crafting That why it's called which Craft My Brain Is Crafting Now something and I want to play a show somewhere then its abuse of that siddhi and thats not what it was given to you for comfortable talking about siddhi a Little Bit Yes Why Not When We Say Hanuman ji is the giver of Ashtasiddhi no Nidhi Lee what does that statement mean and secondly are there at siddhis only and are There are infinite number of siddhis here Infinite number of siddhis and what could Be a very understandable siddhi for someone who never heard the term siddhi it's it Actualization when we talk about a group of sales a colony of sales okay when you Talk about a group of cells or a colony of sale when there is actualization and maximisation of consciousness completely in full form than the Shakti their siddhi word is related to Shakti it's not related to consciousness it is related to shakti because that means that Shakti is got it is come in its full Form like a player comes in its full form right so that means you have Actualized and maximized that power point over there so group of sales now are Holding on to a maximum of an ability Of the power and this can be push anywhere. It can be pushed anywhere. so a the seeker Realises that he is God, a siddhi. First Of all that does not happen. rarely it happens because he is in so much Humility. If he is a real seeker. he is In so much humility. there are people set off people who are pursuing siddhis and they are Doing Sadhana only for the sake of Siddhi. Which happens or may not happen. it may happen Or it may not happen. but if a seeker is Sincere and on his path is emulsifying and you know melting his ego and on the Sadhna his focus is not on the siddhi Siddhis Come To Him anyway siddhis come to him anyway it's a bye product of self Actualization One Colony of Sales Getting Activated in the Body Is Like one's own accomplishment and the aim being that yours The whole body has become completely activated. You know that energy is fair to say that hour The Human Body Mind and Spirit Holds Much More potential than we are told in the text books yes so there are siddhis packed into each one of our bodies also yes but for the once Who aligns themselves with the practices you actually end up seeing those siddhis Manifest Realities or the End of the World Ashtasiddhis and these names that you hear of the siddhis these are coming from Our Traditional Scripture Churl Books. So there is a limit to what is written There. There is much more in the universe than That. much more that doesn't have a nomenclature Yet. Correct correct. much more that can be Named in the future. what is n Understanding Siddhi That You Can Talk about. so that people have a context on what is this. The simplest of the siddhi is Of archsiddhi. when you are doing naam Remembrance, Nam Japa and when you are doing your devotion regularly meditation regularly and Following the Yama Niyamas of Choosing the Right Way Life is coming more in discipline making Conscious choices make you achieve success Easiest siddhi vak siddhi is the power of Speech the colony of cells here get Activate the Chakras and Get Divined Gates Divined. whatever you say comes True. Vak siddhi is whatever you say True. it has to manifest because it Becomes the power. it becomes a command that the The universe has to accept. Ok. you know so that's a that's one of the Easiest one than manifestation. some people have More manifesting power than others. So two who are you again everything is related to Discipline and Practice. for some people are Born with the Siddhis. for example if someone has been a seeker in his previous life time and had done a lot of tapa tapa and have worked you know on all his ah energy The system and he lets his body end that life ended now he is born again new born he is born with what it carries forward he is born with all of that the attainment that he had in his previous life time and as a kid he is born with siddhis you see so many youngsters you see These are the miraculous children everywhere young small boys and girls you know what they are Born with their Siddhas and so this life Time is a very limitation to understand Very Big Limitation Here We Get Confused A common man would get confused why he why not me he did this for just one year and he has reached somewhere i am doing it for eight years i haven't reached anywhere his previous account is not taken into Calculate session for instance u have maharathis maha Rishis like Raman Maharshi and you know and many Other Saints from Childhood They've Been Saintly they have been saintly and they have Born with the wisdom of an 80 year old man or a very very awakened man what's the partiality god is doing here that someone is born with this light and someone is not Born with the Light and Born with Darkness in the head what is this partiality it is nothing there is no partiality Everything Goes in Law & Order Here There There is a perfect order in the universe. there There is a law of cause and effect that is working and the accounts are maintained flawlessly Without any error. The Human Body in Fact Is a flawless machine. Automated Flawless Machine where everything is happening automatically Without your conscious interference in it. your digestive system is working, The excretory system is working, The circulatory system is working. there is so True miniscule minute detailing in All these processes. we don't have to have the Ability to understand these processes Fully. Leave it to them having any control over It. I don't know why I am asking you This question. but whenever we have them Spiritual Conversations Were Usually talking about such subjects weather Context is age zero to age 80 and 90 When you pass away. what about the phase of The time which happens after you pass away in Terms of if you have done the sadhana through out Your Life But You Have Not Reached Enlightenment you got a come back to this realm so between the the next birth and this birth while you are Spending time up there and down there do you Get to interact with the date? this this also a two schools have thought that duality and Advaita think differently about this. The Soul has been different from the whole game of Consciousness. itself is advaita Perspective Where It Travels and Goes to different realms and goes through four heavens And then it's coming back on the Earth. The Stories as the Stories and the Explanations As written in the Puranas, different Scriptures, different Puranas talk about the Different journeys of the soul you know after death. Advaita which is non dual consciousness talks about there is a screen there is Consciousness. Ok? Now there is a ring. Imagine a ring which is your causal body. Which is your destiny. Let's Say It Coloured red and blue. in this life your cause The body is colored red and blue. your story Is red and blue. You are living this life. And you are doing some effort. you are doing podcast and you're doing this and You are doing a lot of good work for people. you are En Lightning Your Masses and You Are a Fan Followings and so, all of this is adding some Golden color to your red and blue. Allright. and if there's anything bad some black Spots are added to it. Ok? now your life Time Gates Over Physical Life Time Gates over you leave the shut this body it's only dropping down the body just like you would drop a shirt you just drop this body this The ring is not moving anywhere this ring is Here and in the back drop of this ring they Pure Consciousness Pure Light Now for the Next Lifetime Next Human embodiment this ring color changes a little the Soul chooses to play a different role The script and these black spots Will remain here. this is golden that you did Will remain here. And now the color of the ring Pink and Green from Is Coming. Consciousness That means the back drop is not changing at All. Consciousness is remaining. what does that mean here we are four people with are no four Brahmanas. this is one brahmin in which The four rings are operating. You get it? Yes. so when i leave this body my body will be Discard and go back to nature and I see this The ring will embody another body in the form of a baby will grow and this ring will remain in this in this ah body for as long as as the body will live so there is no question of losing data number one there is no The question of losing data the data is there It's there and you can tap into this data As much as you want for instance wisdom all All the golden things that you have earned in this life time let's say in the next life time you Forgotten about it you can tap into it and revive this golden this power this gleam this shine that people who are in yoga or into spirituality and to mysticism this The glow and the gleam that you see on there Faces and in their ora is nothing but the old reviving and coming and surfacing into the The present life where everybody has everybody Haze ok back to the mahavidyas yes answered my Tangent so you know the three lower Mahavidyas Baglamukhi Matangi Full of Magic Mysticism That's why maximum experiments are done with These Baglamukhi Matangi and Kamalatmika Kamalatmika Yes Kamalatmika is a kid lakshmi mahalakshmi ok kamalatmika is Just like Mahalakshmi seated on a lotus and seated on a lotus and so she gives you the siddhi of wealth and you know everything and Matangi is absolutely beautiful Crafty Goddess. you know the parrot sings with her and she is often depicted with a veena and very she is dark And she is called Uchchishta Devi. Maxima Devi means she is one of the goddesses that you Worship happens in any way she will accept it. With lots of goddesses. there are the lots of Rituals That People Are Very Careful About Cleanliness and Hydran and Left Hand and right hand and this cloth and that Clothes. Matangi is one goddess that will Accept whatever you do. there was a very Beautiful There is a very beautiful South Indian Movie Ah In Which There Is A Goddess Shon looks like matangi to me. and there is a big pendol and a big function happening in that home because they are there calling somebody like Shankaracharya status person to come and do the Worship of that goddess. so ah panchbhog and so Much of ah prasad and everything was done. in That house. there was a servant made you know Who is working and she is in love with Devi. but she is obviously not allowed to come there And do things because she is a worker. So she in her small plate you know does everything what the priest was doing giving prasad Giving this then she was tasting and seeing If That Little She Made Was Good or Not And they show that when the invocation actually occurs happens thee is not sitting in that statue which is there she comes and sits in every plate you know it's a very beautiful Depiction It's a Story But the Ethos Is Very Clear that goddesses respond to love and Sincerity especially the Mahavidyas de Respond to Love Sincerity and You Know What desire to be with her aunt desire to be with her to see her darshan you know and she Resounds so Mahavidya the school that I belong to there is no formality it should Be Just Done Intense Sadhna with Meditation and Mantra Intense Sadhana with Meditation and Mantra And And That's It But There Are Other Schools Sri Vidya For Instance we have lots of schools here in India says down south you have it in the east east of india in the north east also Shri Vidya is very popular Shri Vidya shodashi shodashi and that is tripura sundari the The Pyramid That You See You Know The Shree Yantra Puja What You See The Shree Yantra Shree Yantra is a three dimensional picture of the yantra that can be even flat the instruments you know we Have three kinds of yantras. you have a Flat Surface We Call It. then there is Kurmapage. that means it's like a toto is Like a Semai circle. You Know. and then you have a meru and a mountain like the way of shri Yantra is what you know about the Sri Vidya tradition has evolved quite a lord in india v have some very dynamic very powerful very Good Schools Down South in Kerala and Tamilnadu Ah Which Import Sri Vidya Maha Vidya is really an open school and really an open faith that one could develop his own system according to To the guidance of his master mentor he can developed his own system of worship even than the shri de school which are existing there They are different ways of doing the worship. Even people support ah take the support from lalita Sahasranāma. some people take the support from Khadgamala. you know there others towards assam side and kolkata side which is completely Different. You know so it's not the last word. Belonging to a sect is like Belonging to a family were certain way off Living is a burden. Right? Or Ok. Let's speak about the three. you speak about matangi right now or what is the associated siddhi Craft You Know Mohini Sadhna Mohini Sadhna Vashikaran All of this goes with Matangi Sadhna and basically because she is a mesmerizing Devi She is a Goddess that can mesmerize and she is a goddess that can give you power to Mesmerize. so my take on this is you know my What is my take back of the sadhna that i have done with this is that exploring Every Love Factor and If You Can Experience It matangi in you you get her craft in your Hands Anything You Touch Can Be Divined anything you make can be divined i Explore My Energy I Live In The Hermitage I Live on My Own and I Live In Isolation and I Work with Stones Plants with Herbs with So Many Things I made a very beautiful candle for you and brought it yes with lots of mantras in it you no i explore this manifestation of the Divine energy in every iota and part and every grain of your living is the true Utility of this goddess to play these games that can very easily get hooked on to your Ego Like Things Like Vashikaran And Things like you know ah mesmerizing someone taking someones mind in control how good would that be this karma it is too complicated its Too complicated when you are a real seeker Then you want to share your personnel Patterns Rather Than Pile On More and More kind of interaction with another human being Create a positive or negative will or 100% like even if I'm having a two Sentence Conversation with Someone That is 100% N Intention Forget About Conversation Even If you have an intention in your heart to utilize this for something that has also Created Karma Even Thought Creates Karma Enough thought creates more karma than action really Yes Thought Creates More Karma Than Action N unevolved ignorant person if he goes and slaps a boy on the street it will create A karma but not as bad as if I visualize it that's where I'm going and slumping that boy just Visualize and have an intention I wanna go and slap that boy it created a bigger Karma Seed That Man Who's Actually Gone and slapped him why do because you are not Causing physical harm by thought is easy a wave is a vibration nazar thought is a wave is a vibration just like bad luck is like you Putting an eye on that boy on that boy and more then you are evolved see anybody who is Doing Experiments or Is Wanting to Experiment with these things is obvious An Evolved Person Evolved Soul Right A An ordinary man wouldn't want to do anything ok he is a help Helpless you know living an ordinary life. so an evolved person having the intention to control someone in it itself is a huge karma Creation. This goes into the golden womb. it's like in very ordinary language if a poor man on the street a beggar a rickshaw wala or Someone it just picks up a ₹100 from someone Pocket. he rubs lets say ₹100 from someone Pocket. It will create a karma. but it wont create such a big karma as much as i go and pick up a ₹1 from someone's purse when You are evolved as a soul and you are born with awareness and you have been blessed with the Higher Deeper Knowing of the Universe and You Can See the Substratum and You Can Lift Up and Look into the Karma cycle and the cause and the effect with this deep understanding if you do a petty something it creates a huge Karma The Higher You Climb The Harder You Will Fall that's it OK WE SPOKE ON MATANGI RIGHT NOW Associated We Craft And Ya Mohini Sadhna Mostly Vashikaran Mohini Sadhna and Also Lot of Small Fragments of These Sadhna Diez Experiment are done you know they prepare talisman and they prepare you know all kinds of things to eat extra they are all fragments of these are two sadhnas basically if you want to Pursue the Goddess Matangi to a very deep Degree How Much Time Do You Have to Dedicate Depends on your soul's back Journey for Instance It Doesn't Take Any Time for me because i think i am the only one Living my past lives is my life I haven't worked very hard have work very hard in this life you really Think Despite Living Alone Doing Sadhna I think so ok or But the Sadhna Wood Entails and Elaborates Mantra Yes for sure it has Mantra End Meditation as a part of it control of food Timings of Diet Control Diet Control Timings go with the rhythm of nature you know go with the rhythm of the nature And we say these are all supporting systems. See a yogi who is living in the forest and Doing Matangi Sadhana. let's say may not do all of these things for him just the mantra And Dhyana is Enough for How Long Years together and probably hours daily or but it it's like you can't appropriate you can't approximately this because somebody who is caring forward a previous Life Balance With Him Few Months Could Be Enough for him to trigger that wisdom and trigger that energy which was already late In the snow. How does one know if the energy has been Triggered? It gets found out. It gets found out. Kant B Explain in words may your dream be there is there a realization of something inside it's like i know but i can't explain it or ok sorry what was the lowest chakra one Kamalatmika is like Lakshmi goddess of Early Wealth and Money and Prosperity and Everything. so she is kamalatmika has Mostly Dissolved in the Form of Lakshmi Which is in the present day. that nobody is Doing special sadhanas for Kamalatmika on From. really or it's almost like you know Taken as the other Laxmi Sadhna we do Shri Suktam and We Do You Know Kanak Kanak Mahalakshmi Stotra and so many others. So she is almost like amalgamated with the Modern day Lakshmi. or so when we say Lakshmi is the Goddess of Wealth or praying to her will attract wealth of different yes of course of course it will be okay we Baglamukhi yes so baglamukhi comes from the The Solar Plexus is Obviously Fire Energy Energy of Will Energy of Power So She Is Say Erection power Baglamukhi is Erection power She can't stop anything it can it can it can come with the solar power you know the power of the Solar Plexus that yellow and that blazing fire is what Baglamukhi is deified at and that's why she is a specialist at stopping something you No to end all the high death all experiments are Done with Matangi and Ah Baglamukhi both are Utilize these you know this. So the Lower Three Chakras a lot of work is done. The Early Work It is done. ah the other once higher once are mostly Utilized for ah transcendence and for Higher Ah Aints. but, if there are 100 Who Human Beings Hypothetically Are Practicing the Sadhanas of the Three Lower Devise. What is there intention usually? Like I'm sure 100 out of 100 are not Utilizing it. It is curiosity. Ok. Mostly it is curiosity. What is We will see. Let us see what it is. End Curiosity Spiritual Curiosity More So Also as a seeker my observation is this. I May be wrong. as a seeker is growing you know as you are Growing. There are many others watching you. There are many others looking at you. there many others are close to you and they may be wanting to also try and do things That's what you are doing. so a lot of borod Desires. It is a very big disease. is a Very big disease. Borod Desire. Or. I I I this is my phrase. My personal phrase. I have read it anyway. Borrowed Desires Is Like you see someone being successfully flying A kite. Ok. now you will see the 100 people More Flying Kites. it's like you know you doing a good podcast there are many others who You want to be just the way you are. You Know Similar to me. oh ah what a wonderful life But they don't know what life I go through. Living Up on the Mountain Alone. you know is Life. So a lot of borrowed desire. Meni People who are on this path. late se a 100 off Them that you said. RR of Curiosity and a borrowed curiosity of not really Wanting neither the goddess nor the shiva. what is the right intention with wanting to do the sadhana? you should be ready to die to be Late. Want it as much as you want a breath. you you you should be ready to dissolve your self and Let her be. so that even ends and there is no god Realization can happen without you dying as An ego. it can't happen if one does any of these Mahavidya Sadhanas Correctly and Correctly is a Subjective term but yes if one does it we complete faith a you know penance etsetra etsetra what is the and result and result is a philosophy and realization of that energy in you it's in It's in you that you realize for instance I have loved Matangi for a long time And she just disappears everywhere to me. Just out of your devotion for her. yes, just Out of her devotion for her. can you look at someone and get to know them a little bit and tell them that he this is the mahavidya you should B. Or, Immediately. Immediately. you will be speaking After the podcast. Anything else you want to say about Baglamukhi? She is considered very dangerous. that's why People are dangerous in the sense that they are very fiery. so don't touch me until you are very sure About it and very dedicated. Why? because it has a fiery energy and a lot of Negative experiments are done. More of Negative Experiments are done with her. so people are scared To come into every devotion. those who have come into The bhakti have come into the bhakti because they have Been Blessed with Something That Was Successful And taken for granted. At some point. at some point Point. somebody wanted to win a court case And you know he did some sadhana baglamukhi vent Somewhere and some pandit did a puja for him Oher and the court case was you know through and Due to this he became an eternal devotee of Baglamukhi. many of them are into bhakti like That. few of them rarely and they are really Uniform that they just have a liking for her. They just have attraction for her. they just have you known something is pulling me to every. For no reason. That is true devotion. that There is true attraction and that is a calling. True calling. so the sadhna should be done coming Back to the statement again. the sadhana should be Don't be friends the power to realize her in You end up getting a realization, Actualization and acquisition. we that should be the Reason. Everything else will come soon. Hot moving on to the upper cycle. to the Dhumavati. Dhumavati. from here from here You know the centers the vertices. these three r's the worldly vertices and these are the Psychological and the Upper World Vertices Chakras. So, Dhumavati you know, ah Corresponds to the air element. thats Why She Is Departed Grey and Very depressive which is a very very Distracting picture of hers. she is Actually an ocean of love. she can remove poverty Completely. She can remove grief completely. she can remove it but people are very scared too enter into her because she is depicted like die like a widow like a very scary figure with you know no color in her yantras also there is no color there is just a grey and in fact many temples even if you go to kamakhya they say the dhumavati nobody goes a Lots of our temple traditions which are there they discourage people to take darshan of Dhumavati. I have people discourage Dhumavati Worship on the show as well. or sleep, but she Is really in ocean of love. i went to the Baglamukhi Am Temple At Ah In The Middle State Datia. there is a beautiful Baglamukhi Temple at Datia. we i had gone with one of my friend and Students. when we were coming out of the Temple after doing the puja and everything. There is a Dhumavati temple there. So The Pandit I told you, mother, please do not go there. Bus I told you about the pain, please take a darshan mother I didn't do it, you just took it from the window look into the pp through the window and that's it he was discouraging us to even go there so we kept his honour you know okay because okay if he saying don't go we just don't go came back to our car a huge crow that i have never seen in my life such a huge crow came and sat on our Car You Know So It Is As If She Came And Crow is a vahan for dhumavati you know it is as if she came to him and she said okay you're not I am coming you know so these are so The indications are very subtle Indications for a common man who is very Logical End very you know brain oriented intellectual he may not even give an importance to such a thing An event what is there what is so big About a crow coming and sitting on your car But when it is coming as a coincidence When you are not going to the temple and end Suddenly I don't know where such a big crow is The size of the crow was amazing. and we three we were three of us and whether we were three Wide Eyed Jaw Dropped Looking At The Crow. because we all understood three in our Hearts That's Where She Is. so you know they Manifest around you. so dhumavati is an ocean Of compassion very very beautiful. so as a therapist and as a person who is into Mahavidya Sadhanaaz. We recommend Dhumawatis Mantra Rarely Only When Somebody Is Grief Stricken For Long Innu Deep Depression and Grief Stricken and just doesn't find any light in life then Dhumavati is given as a very antidote for a very short vile and then there are tantriks Practitioners That Do the Siddhi of Dhumavati also for prayog chinmast and dhumavati also have a set of experiments that are you know popular use for for all of this that we Speak about mesmerizing games and playing with the toys that god has given us ok give two extremes of people that do her Sadhna once that wanted to extract the power You know I utilize the power for different Kinds of Experiments That They Want to Do do and the others who are wanting a healing deep healing she is a she is a great healer Dhumavati she can actually remove the powerless Conditions in all levels. Material Emotional Levels you know. So she is a healer. and air element you know so air element itself is Creates a lot of change. Invoking Her Is Like invoking the air element. why you? you know it said that when you begin any Kind of deity worship. like when you Prefer a particular date, you get trades Off that daty. which is why i think people Fear springs to Dhumavati. Yeah. that will you Also became a widow? will you also or that's That's the negative bit of conditioning Which is there. that's a negative bit of Conditioning Which Is There Which Is Not True. A they are not in human forms. The gods are not in human forms. give and take Huge Energy Portals and Energy Day Create Energy Movement. so the depiction as woman is only symbolic of the Characteristics and Elemental Depictions Radar. The Yellow in Baglamukhi is all about the Fire element. it's not that she is a woman who likes yellow. It's not like that. similarly devi is the bhuvaneshwari is there Shoulder She Is Departed With The Red. it's more Symbolic to you know to the Rajas. Rajasic Energy is depicted by red offen. because it it has a lot of attraction and a lot of Abundance with itself. So, let's go Deputed like that. it's not that they are any Kind of woman. so even when we say we are Getting a Darshan. suppose i say that i have a Philosophy of Matangi. it's actually a Protection of my mind. you know there is My Energy System and My Mind Projecting into a Goddess that is so real In front of me. so it's my creation Basically. we are not coming in any form Anywhere like that. The energy is supporting. Undoubtedly she is supporting which is Why we say Devi has given me darshan. I Don't say that I have created a philosophy. So Devi has given me a darshan because it's Something that I couldn't do it has happened. How ever it is a projection from your own pranic system and end when you understand the science of it you understand it very deeply that it's a projection of Your pranic system and the maruls of your bodies are coming outside and giving you darshan wow or they are giving you darshan it only for your eyes it's a state of being Hypertune Again Very Hypertune and Its Like a Prasad Hum it's like a reward the system that your energy and your Consciousness Inside Is Giving You For You Shor Dedication and Devotion. Like If You Work out long enough and eat cleanly you will see Abs one day. Yes. Like that. To Trivialize It. And a very gross level good example. Moving on. or then after or after dhumavati then you have The ah chinnamasta. you know the picture of Chinnamasta is deputed in the Mahavidya Books. Whatever Few Books We Have. You Know How many. Western Have Written Coincidentally More Books. On Mahavidyaana Indians. You Know and indian books are all full of experiments and Everything because the focus is different. give me Focus in the Western World is All About Research and Inquiry. They gave and they had Not written anything much about experiments. Indian books have written more about experiment because this is where the application of the Mahavidyas is Conard. I Wood from Conard Because it is not taking into devotion level. So, Chinhnamasta is depicted as ah dacapitated. She's she's got a cut off head, chopped off head. and she is holding our head in her own in her on hand oozing out blood and then there are s you know fountains of three fountains oozing out from her they are said to be pingala and the sushmana the energy fountains they are Actually Energy Fountains They Aren't blood they are not blood and then they are two dakinis who are drinking this ah the dakinis are the cosmic powers and she chinnamasta is Standing Over a Copulating Couple She Standing on a copulating couple in the Puranaz it is written as Rati and Kama. She Is standing on this. So basically, the symbolism involved here is that complete Control over your ego, cutting off the head in All The Mahavidya Cutting Chopping The Head Is Like chopping off the head of the ego. End Energizing bringing an energy system to Optimize Levels, Winning Over Desire. Standing on the Copilated Couple is Like Saying, she is one over desire. every kind Of Lust and Desire. so it's a highest Attainment. it's a spiritual attainment and It corresponds to the Aakash tattva to the ether to which all the other elements are Born. Sky, air, fire, you give the earth We are born to the sky. so she is at the apex of the elemental sequence and at the having Attend to that level of detachment cutting cords With everything and highest yogic attainment. Chamasta again chinnamasta is utilized as a Therapy. Divine mantra and sadhna is utilized As a therapy. for someone who is in the middle Of a mess. I want to get detached. also addictions of all kinds on physical level Addictions, alcoholism, drugs all of this. Also, ah relationship addictions, you know, all Kinds of Addiction. To Win Over Desire At All levels, physical, emotional and others. donation beyond this then we come to bhairavi it's at Pa with Bhairava Bhairavi and Bhairava they are the same they are different the flow you know here is the Force of Shiva Jatativi Wrong Flame Flow pavi tastle you know this thing says or so Flow is the force of the desert. Maruths R Also residing in all seven Chakras. What Is it not? we will talk about it in another discussion that we will do with hanuman when I come the next time we will do it. You Know so marut is a very big subject which is There in our you know in our tradition. So the the name of the marut that comes from here is Flow. Flow is like a fiery force. So Bhairavi is is you know at this level her. when we say she is it doesn't mean she is residing Here in there. No. The Vibrational The frequencies are parallel. corresponding like we have corresponded colors corresponding aromas color you know Chakra correspondence is there at so many Levels Flowers that Correspond to the Chakras Vegetables and Fruits That Correspond to The Chakras Colours Aromas Hai Na Oils Isi Like in the same way the goddesses are Corresponding to this energy frequency when you understand and look at it from The energy point of view so Bhairavi is like she is seen in the smshana again you know and Doing Sadhna Fiery Her Face Is Quiet Familiar to that of Kali Absolute Braise Her hair and body are nude and so is she Swami of Bhoots She is like the Curse of All The Other Worlds and Has All the Powers in Her control she is like shiva she is like bhairav Just like every Bhairav ​​is described Bhairavi is there so much sickness is you not getting over sickness she is also the controller of ours prana sister system so any issues with the Panic System Respiratory Issues Extra Bhairavi's taken care of wherewe can take care of is used as a mantra is used as a Therapy in our sect by Gurudevs Teachings all these Mahavidyas are quite similar Healing Arts Different Mahavidyas for Different Healing Streams You Know For Different Kinds of Issues and Problems that People Have Wood Face White Use White Use Wide use wide and red sometimes you know for Prosperity when you have a family, you Need sustainability. When you need sustainability, You need money and you need facilities. You Know, So that comes under red. to increase your Business Turnover or You Know How to Dissolve Your Business Financial Obstacles or Two Attain in education and success, more focus and Concentration in your work. Etra. that is all The Rad Experiment. Hmm. So, Bhairavi is invoked for disease, deadly disease and also to get Rid of Evil Energy and Evil Ah Unseen Dangers that come from other dimensions, you No, so she is invoked for that. can we talk about the unseen what comes from different Dimensions a little bit may be Yes over to you? ya my gurudev you know always said to me that Bring people in faith, aastha, shraddha and Love. and it's not important for us to see the Dark. so i love following you know Advice and having known all the other dimensions that one can talk about it if it's not going to help Anyone why to talk about it. Ok. and if It creates fair why to talk about it. I can give you a very small example of the Unseen. Very small example. I was doing a black Sadhana and I keep experimenting a lot v mantras and because i have all the time in hand you know so i was experimenting with A Kali Sadhna Sing On My Sofa Our Everyday is bang on the ganga it's on the bank of ganga and you can see the Ganga You Know 70mm Full Panoramic View Of The Ganga.

Ahhh and there is a there is an infinite number of forums on Reddit. there is a lot of that Talk about culture positively and there is a A lot of people talk about it negatively. let me sleep will be one for bollywood, there will be one for Social media, there be one for the world of Cricket. hmm and of course the commonality in some on these negative forums is, they approach Almost every single topic negatively. Hmm, or. that's a fed that's there Work that's a religion. So on some level, the realm of the asuras is affecting all this Ficus religiosa. Of course they are supported guides. You no i have a it's important for me To give an example here if you permit me. or I had a Filipino once to come to learn with me. I do one on one learnings in the Hermitage. i used to do more that before Now I have group online sessions happening And I do personal coaching now. Income Take Up Coaching for Good People Who Want to Progress. So, I had this Filipina boy who came to study with me and he was in too Substance Abuse and Alcoholism and He Says mother I don't event. so, he had a Realization. he had a godly realization because of which he just gave up everything And He Went on a Personal Journey of Becoming A monk. you know it's a very dramatic story Head. but something that stayed with me in my Mind what he narrated to me. he said that every time i would take something if he is you no consuming anything he says that i would There are many dark forces behind me and them would you like to put me with so much power Said I used to feel powerful. I used to Feel the Power of the Whole World Is With Me. And they would walk with me. Hee sez. i say the The moment I would come out of my this thing and I felt so powerless. I felt as if I could not even stand and walk and things like that and when i was narrating to him This you know with the choice with the mind and with Our awareness we can connect to each other the higher Or the lower it depends on us. so by the way v That he was giving me this example. So the Asuras are parallel i mean as powerful as the Gandharvaaz and then you have just like the Yakshas you have ghosts. You know Bhootaaj ​​R Gan. they're like just like the arc angels you know they are more powerful and they have gan with them they have many asuras with them have many people with them that they and so they Affect people who are in negative thoughts for a long time somebody who is in a negative thought pattern for a long time some form of Depression and some negative thoughts negative action on earth in their family in their relationship they almost like became Devilish. The People Almost Like to Become Very Devilish. you know so there they are a pa source Of power to all negative activities. End then the last of them at power with the gods Is a vampire. What the Western World Calls Vampires. you know the vampire power is a very very huge Power. It's a huge power. it's at par With God. that means it's like a portal of Energy. Again negative energy. The Universe is equally divided between white and Black. It has to be. The game has to go on. so the vampire power it's kind of Almost like parasitic on someone. if it's makes a person victim and to death it will NOT LEAVE. it rises and it sucks out Life. The Three Realms It is Said. that the the three realms do not have an independent Source of Prana in the Universe. They Thrive and survive on the prana of living Beings. so they are all the time searching for someone to Pylon as a source of energy speaking of the positive highest world you can say that is dawlok dawaz or it wood contain elements of hanuman ji all of our devas all of ours Dewas So the vampire realm is as powerful as Dev Rathal so these are negative gods yes yes they were you play satan in this Put it anywhere. in our culture who is an example of a Vampire? A lot of them are there? Asuras Have been mentioned in purana also we have had so many asuras that have been spoken a mahishasura and you know i see those names Give it quite differently. I find them all symbolic of Some wrong trait in us. for example you Have a Jambasur. jambasura is like when You then say that the Jambhasura enters into Your Mouth and It Makes Your Body Very Lazy. So the jambhai word is basically yanning. Many of these asura names are Krodhasur. You No they have all names associated with negative Instincts in human beings. so however I do believe that ah these two forces are Coexisting. They are existing as the negative and the Positive and One Must as a Human Being Always make a conscious choice to be in the higher realms in the above realms how can one do it because you get angry everybody gets angry and irritated and depressed or you know frustrated this is an invitation for the asura The You Know Kingdom and the Lower Kingdom. So the The Moment You Catch Yourself Going Into Anyone Variations of moods immediately start doing Chanted. whatever japa you are doing even if you For the nay for the heck of it you say Om Namah Shivaya Om Namah Shivaya Even If You Don't Mean It it will still connect you to the realm above and Not allowing you to fall down. you know these olden Times People Would Say If You See Something happening on the road something ah that one should not see may be some accident or Anything. Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Just Say that and move away people would advise the Elders who would advise the children just say Ram Ram Ram Ram and move away so don't want even a visual take a taking us down there you know it like that's so the name of god and and you know chanting chanting namsmaran inside in Itself is a powerful tool that will take you in connection with the higher realms this is Why a Lot of People Talk About High Frequency Conversion High Versus Low frequency absolutely yes it's the same thing it's the same thing and lo Frequency need not always be cheap and dirty it could be even something as simple as Fear Fear is a Very Innocent Thing Can Grip Anybody But It's Bad you know or gossip or gossip gossip fear gossip and unnecessary defaming someone you know someones name and just talking for talking Sake about someone, someone, someone? it's Absolutely a low frequency talk. Ok? Hmm. let's get to high frequency Talk. Spoke about Chinasta. Then We Spoke About Bhairav. Bhairavi. After Bhairavi Is Bhuvaneshwari. so she is ruling the entire Sky. She is ruling the entire sky. End there she is manifesting here on earth What Kali, Tara and Shodashi are Manifesting in the Hiranyagarbha. that means they are planning they are Manifesting She Is Actually Grossing Grossifying it here making it a reality here on the earth so bhuvaneshwari is ofon Worshipped for Glory Richness Glory Enhancement in Business Weddings and Relationships Fertility Child Fertility you know all the good things about house hold Life Society Life Bhuvaneshwari Gives You all the abundance what word we use abundance in all senses richness the word abundance means Richness in all senses 360 degree of richness in every sense ok different from Kamalatmika or She is different from Kamalatmika more blessings and and this is more like early hum it is as sel this is very early more approachable lakshmi is more approachable that's why she is more famous wow who praises So okay we are talking about Bhuvaneshwari? Yes. who praises tuvaneshwari in north india I have seen much of a faith with her butt in the South india there are many others you have lots of Bhuvaneshwari Temples in South. north india She isn't even known. not many people the common Folk. They don't even know the world Bhuvaneshwari? Should we be stopping the conversation here? And should we elongate on tara kali maa and Trishurishi Tripura Sundari. or we can so that we do justice to this talk very briefly speaking about there the Rulers of the Gunas especially the Shodashi Shi has become more famous and Tara has gone more to orient to the Buddhist culture why it's just i think something historical Geographical reason for which Buddhism had come into india and you know and then they developed it's not that there is no work done there it not like that the buddhist saints end Sears have worked a lot on done a lot of sadhna on Tara and Tantra has as a separate wing of practice has developed over there with the Tara Cult is here in India we have Ugratara and Saumya Tara Worshipped Ugratara And the saumya tara the ugratara is a very Fiery version of Kali's you know they say that Kali is transcended so you are there in Consciousness but Tara is transcending that Means she is very helpful for you to go to tech You into the higher this thing. So Tara Worship is really very especially in the East and the North East there is a lot of Tara worship Still going on. we have the tarapith you know Above West Bengal in West Bengal Kolkata. Tarapitha is very famous. It's very nice. Fiery Tara is worship there. The Gentle Tara Haze Gone more to Buddhist. I feel it. Ah The One Sitting on the Lotus you know the white color Tara. She depicts education in Saraswati. she is a Tantrik Saraswati. even matangi is a Tantrik Saraswati. The Lower. she is because of Arts, all the arts. This one is more white. Tara is more white because she opens up Wisdom. and opens the direction, the right Steps That You Want to Take in Life. The misunderstanding that people often get out of these goddesses is ah out of all the Sadhnaaz. is their mind automatic the condition The mind automatically goes towards the practical Applications in their work and in their Material side. which is not what they are made for they are there and that's something that you automatically get you don't need to ask it's something that you will automatically get need not ask but the focus is being there Reduces the effect of the blessings we receive the focus should be to embrace Devi Obviously If the Devi is there is the source of energy is there you will get everything you if you say i want to be friend the sun is the The sun is going to be your friend without his rage it is said the glory of the goddess comes to You automatically when you become friend with the other one. So The Focus Is The Take Away From This Podcast Probably we are me sitting here. thats the love For the goddess is an important aspect That should not be missed out. and focus on Siddhis. Focus on Blessings and Focus on The by products of this blessing. shud Not be focused on. it will you will get that Automatically. you know who really want to worship and they want to experience the goddess Increase your love and seeking for the Goddess every sec rather than for this sec and that sec which will automatically come and then black The Dark She Is All of Us No You Know ramakrishna paramahansa is there so many other kali Sadhakkas are there ocean of love and compassion she annihilates everything she finishes the ego Completely so Kali Bhakti is done real Kali Bhakti is done by sadhak who does who really want to finish there Ego She She Completely you know it takes you into a transcendence state of samadhi she samadhi you can say that Dharana Dhyan Samadhi Dayam That We Spoke About In ten Dharana Dhyana and Samadhi these three people are capable of The three goddesses are capable of doing Fair to say that Kali Sadhna works the Fastest in terms of the yes because she is is the most your choice doesn't happen people are Scared to Choose Kali sadhana she chooses you she chooses you she will choose you and it is the fastest because it is the The purest it is. she's gotta know The Conditioning Other Goddesses Have Covers. she is covering has been layers of Personality Like You Know The Different Chakra Personalities As We Speak. but kali is is Absolutely Nude She Is Unconditioned Completely unconditioned she is no cover raw Energy Raw Energy on what basis does she choose the seeker on the Basis of your past deeds and past sadhana If you've been on a tumultuous path and a Steady Relentless Known Dying Path She Has Merse and she will pick you up we once hosted someone on the show who was a descendants of the line of pandits who perform pujas at the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal Oh How Amazing Incredible Conversation About Shiva And Rudraksh actually i am not even asking you about the garland that you are wearing yes this is it called siddha mala it has all the you know the faces of the rudraksha you always wear this most of the time ok or that person told me that usually with people who and up choosing the bhairav ​​path have a The Tendency Towards Being destructive could have been in the the past could have been in the past it's a very Femme Familarity We Call It Familiarity and so that the goddess attracts you know but benovelence is late with all the Goddesses And She Will Benevolently Transform Even that past unconscious is completely washed away of in goddess Devotion of All the People You Come Across in Your on life how do you know that someone is Likelear Two Step Inu Kali upasana what do you see different about that Person it gets known and it's kind of you Know it kind of says energy speaks when You Work With Energy Energy G Speaks There's a voice in your head that tells you. so, there isn't anyone Physical Am Symptoms. so to say of kali devotion but certainly an energy the person Energy Wood Speak. for shore those who are getting attracted to kalibhakti or kali Pick them up. They are at the epitome of you know kind of de destroying all the Conditioning of the World. they are like in a in a crying mode of bhakti most of the have you understood that this is human life that we know fully conditioned is redundant its futile it's all drama and it's all a waste of time [Laughter] Great point to end this episode Thank you so much Ranveer and I am going to see you again and again and again i am Going to See Your Audience Again and Again and Again again thank you so many lots of love light peace Happiness, Joy and Abundance are Imagable to All Of you.
