Mission.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
Hello Friends.  Friends, what Chanakya

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,519
said thousands of years ago is still true today.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
Chanakya said that your neighbouring

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,400
country can never be your friend.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,160
You will see a similar scenario between China and Russia.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,480
Now

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
if you look from the outside, China and Russia

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
show themselves as best friends.  But

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,519
if you look at it actually, Russia

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,239
somewhere sees China as an enemy.

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,160
You can see this news China is the enemy

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
led Russian intelligence reveals

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,239
criminality actual view of Beijing

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,879
accuses it of espionage.  So basically Russia has, in

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,440
a way, accused China of spying and that

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
China is

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,600
carrying out large-scale espionage inside Russia.  So there

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,920
is a need to understand this in a little detail,

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
what is it after all?  What is going on

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
between Russia and China, and where did this whole

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
issue come from?  Where was it

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
revealed?  I will tell you everything.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
Let's move on.  But

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,559
before that let me tell you all that our

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,280
if you are preparing for UPSC 2026

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
then you have the best chance.  You

and within this, you will be

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
prepared for everything from prelims to mains interview.

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,000
All you have to do is use this

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
code Ankit Live so that you

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
can get maximum discount and its link is

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,280
given in the comment section.  So let us

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
first see what exactly has just happened.

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
Look, you all must have

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
heard about FSB.  If you have not heard about FSB then

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,119
you all must have heard about at least KGB.

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,840
So basically at present

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,479
Russia has a very powerful FSB, that

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,520
is Federal Security Service which was earlier

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,600
called KGB during the times of USSR, which used to be

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
engaged in a lot of spying etc.   In

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,560
a way, it was a very big intelligence agency.

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,799
So their internal document has been

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,479
leaked here and it has reached the hands of

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
New York Times.  So the document here in the New York Times was

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,719

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
revealed and it was told that

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,200
how here you will see distress between China and Russia

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,479
and

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,640
because of this Russia has

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
declared China as an enemy country and this is a

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,959
complete eight page planning document which was

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
revealed here by the New York Times.

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,720
Well, you have to understand the context behind this a little bit.

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
You must know

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,800
about No Limits Partnership.

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,040
Basically in February 2022 just before Russia

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
launched invasion of Ukraine.  You remember

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,080
how in 2022 Russia

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,480
started invasion in Ukraine on 24th of February.

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
I remember the date even today.  So just before that,

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
Russia and China

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,000
declared their partnership here as a no

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
limits partnership.  Meaning both the countries

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,360
can go to any extent.  Meaning if

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,760
any kind of need arises anywhere then both the

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,160
countries will help each other.  So this

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
strategic alignment was, in some way, an

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
attempt to counter the US-led

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,800
Western influence and the censorship imposed by the

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,040
US.

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
But look, from the outside it is being

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
shown that Russia and China are such

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
good friends.  Everything is great.  But

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,599
actually, these internal leaks, these

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,560
leaked pages show

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,200
that Russia's FSB

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,599
sees Beijing as an adversary.

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
Edge sees it as an enemy.  Well,

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,120
here

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
I will tell you what things have been revealed in the leaked document.

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,440
China has been officially

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,959
designated as threat and enemy.  This means that

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,280
China has been officially

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,760
declared as an enemy by Russia in internal Russian

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
intelligence assessment.  So what happens is

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
that no matter how much you

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
show externally and say that yes, everything is good and

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,760
this also happens in geopolitics, but

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
somewhere you should know the reality.

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,640
So the

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,040
reality in the Russian Intelligence assessment in Russia is

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,799
that China is our enemy

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,040
country and the FSB says it accuses China

101
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,080
of spying on Russia, meaning that Russia

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,879
knows that China spies on a large scale

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
inside Russia.  For example,

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,760
China's MSS, the Ministry of State

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
Security, is after

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,159
Russia, and all the espionage work etc. inside Russia is

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,079
looked after by the Ministry of State Security.

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,320
Including this, you can see that China continuously tries to steal Russia's

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,800
technology, military and diplomatic

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
secrets.

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,000

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
China has currently infiltrated even the Russian academies and cyber systems here.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Apart from this, the espionage

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,199
operation here in Russian soil, that is, the

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
entire espionage operation,

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
China also continuously carries out this in Russian soil,

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,720
especially in cities like Moscow, Blokhinsk,

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
so you will find all these things

121
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
in the assessment of Russian intelligence and see,

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
somewhere this is a big reason,

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
recently I also made a shot on Instagram, I

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,840
also uploaded it on YouTube

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
regarding S400, and what is it,

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,759
if you see, China has

127
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,639
also taken it from Russia, India has also taken it.

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,880
But do you know that

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,080
India currently has full access to S400.  Full

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,759
access.  But China also has

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,320
access.  But if Russia wants, it

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,600
can deny that access

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,199
to China at any time.  Meaning that the one which is fully complete has

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
not been given to China in a way.

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
Because Russia fears that

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,520
tomorrow China might

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
use it against Russia.  So these kinds of

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,360
things can also happen.  But look, the

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
question arises that after all, whatever

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
documents we are talking about,

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,520
when and how did they become known about the leaks?

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,560
What is actually?  There is a

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,199
decent dissident group in Russia

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,199
called the Dossier Center, and what these people do is that they

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,160

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,400
keep monitoring the corruption and authoritarianism in Russia.

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,160
So during this monitoring, they came to

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,080
know of some things and

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
they accessed all the FSB documents etc.

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,199
and from that they found out

151
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,360
that actually Moscow has

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,919
declared Beijing as an enemy country.

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Then all these things came to light and

154
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,400
it was also told here that how China

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,199
keeps spying inside Russia.

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,800
Well, let me tell you what I know about the spying that we are talking about here.

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,479

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Look, the Russian

159
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,880
officials have alleged

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,360
that the Chinese students and researchers who

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,919
stay in Russian universities, they

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,960

163
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,160

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,080
operate whatever espionage is there at the behest of the Ministry of State Security, which is China's MSS.   Apart from this,

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
it is believed here that the

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,560

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,639
documents related to classified industrial and military innovations are also

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,479

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
collected by the students and researchers in Russia.

170
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,919
Apart from this, Russian cyber defense has continuously

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
intercepted Chinese hacking attempts.

172
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
China continuously attempts to hack the

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
Russian government database.

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Some reports also say

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,400
that these attacks are happening on par with

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,120
US and NATO levels.  The way US and

177
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
NATO level cyber attacks happen

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,759
inside Russia.  In a similar way, China also

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,000
keeps doing similar things.  Apart from this, if

180
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
you see, many Chinese companies

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
which operate in Russia are

182
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,319
also accused of doing intelligence gathering

183
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
work.  Apart from this, there are

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
many Chinese infrastructure

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
investments, for example Huawei

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
Energy Partnership.  So this is also

187
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,479
seen as a dual use for

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
civilian and intelligence gathering purposes.

189
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
So you are understanding that it is not the case here that

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,599
any baseless things are being said.  In a

191
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,919
way, Russia must also be monitoring China on a large scale to see

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,319

193
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,400
what China is trying to do.  So do

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,160
n't just look at geopolitics from the outside, where Russia and China

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
are together.  He will never

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,199
leave you but actually

198
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,199
you must be understanding the reality.  Well,

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
what is the geopolitical analysis of this?   The

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,919
first is strategic cooperation versus

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,479
intelligence competition.  Meaning, Russia, China,

202
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,639
as I told you why they are united together

203
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,599
so that they can counter the West,

204
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,599
you can call it a compulsion, but

205
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,240
if you look at each other, they are also rivals,

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,720
FSB's internal characterization of

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,919
China as enemy shows that there is

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,919
lack of deep trust between the two.

209
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,639
Apart from this, Russia's security

210
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,039
doctrine.  That means the Russian military and

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,680
intelligence doctrine enforces

212
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,919
that you keep an eye on everyone to make sure

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,879
you are not being spied upon.

214
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,520
That means you should

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,360
not trust even your friend's country.  This is Russia's

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
doctrine and it is not

217
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,279
happening for the first time.  If you look back at the

218
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,279
time of the USSR, the Soviet Union, there were

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,599
even more problems at that time.  There were

220
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,240
many issues between China and USSR which is

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,399
called Sino-Soviet Split of 1960.

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
I will tell you more about it.  But

223
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
here again you can see that Russian

224
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,399
vulnerability has increased further

225
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,320
because of the Ukraine war.  The thing is that

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,720
Russia has become dependent on China to a great extent.

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,720
Trade was done with China.

228
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Diplomacy took place with China.

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,480

230
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,560
China is currently supplying a lot of defence equipment to Russia.

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
So Russia also in a way has become

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,720
dependent on China and

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
that is why Russia fears that it is

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
helpful but it is also scary and

235
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
threatening.  So you will

236
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,519
get to see all these things.  Well, the historical

237
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,000
parallel I was telling you about, the

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,240
Sino-Soviet split in 1960, what was that?  Look, it was the

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,040
time of Cold War and

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,880
both China and USSR were communist states, so it

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
seemed that since both are

242
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
communist states, both should be friends

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,519
so that they can counter the capitalist states

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
like America and European countries.

245
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,640
But here you could see bitter

246
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
ideological and strategic rivalry.

247
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
Even at that time in 1960, there were

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
clashes over the border, so I am

249
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
repeatedly telling you what Chanakya had

250
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,600
said that two neighbouring countries can never be friends.

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,519
So the reason for this is

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
that there are many issues regarding borders and

253
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,360
resources.  So there

254
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,120
was the Ussuri River conflict of 1969.  Astonishment was also happening at that time.

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
So there were clashes between the two countries regarding all this.

256
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,519

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
What is happening today is that again there is mistrust but on the

258
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
surface these people show that both the countries are

259
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,760
against the western countries.  So somewhere there is

260
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
some compulsion due to which they are together at

261
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,080
this moment.  Maybe

262
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
things may change in the future.  So the conclusion is

263
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,399
that despite Putin and his

264
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
Grand Declaration of Unity,

265
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,640
you will see a lot of mistrust between the two countries.

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
So I hope that

267
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,399
through the details of this video, you would have come to

268
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
