Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission. Hello Friends.  Friends, what Chanakya said thousands of years ago is still true today. Chanakya said that your neighbouring country can never be your friend. You will see a similar scenario between China and Russia. Now if you look from the outside, China and Russia show themselves as best friends.  But if you look at it actually, Russia somewhere sees China as an enemy. You can see this news China is the enemy led Russian intelligence reveals criminality actual view of Beijing accuses it of espionage.  So basically Russia has, in a way, accused China of spying and that China is carrying out large-scale espionage inside Russia.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail, what is it after all?  What is going on between Russia and China, and where did this whole issue come from?  Where was it revealed?  I will tell you everything. Let's move on.  But before that let me tell you all that our Pratigya Foundation batch, friends, is starting from 10th of June.  Meaning if you are preparing for UPSC 2026 then you have the best chance.  You can join this batch and give UPSC 2026 prelims with complete preparation in exactly one year and within this, you will be prepared for everything from prelims to mains interview. All you have to do is use this code Ankit Live so that you can get maximum discount and its link is given in the comment section.  So let us first see what exactly has just happened. Look, you all must have heard about FSB.  If you have not heard about FSB then you all must have heard about at least KGB. So basically at present Russia has a very powerful FSB, that is Federal Security Service which was earlier called KGB during the times of USSR, which used to be engaged in a lot of spying etc.   In a way, it was a very big intelligence agency. So their internal document has been leaked here and it has reached the hands of New York Times.  So the document here in the New York Times was revealed and it was told that how here you will see distress between China and Russia and because of this Russia has declared China as an enemy country and this is a complete eight page planning document which was revealed here by the New York Times. Well, you have to understand the context behind this a little bit. You must know about No Limits Partnership. Basically in February 2022 just before Russia launched invasion of Ukraine.  You remember how in 2022 Russia started invasion in Ukraine on 24th of February. I remember the date even today.  So just before that, Russia and China declared their partnership here as a no limits partnership.  Meaning both the countries can go to any extent.  Meaning if any kind of need arises anywhere then both the countries will help each other.  So this strategic alignment was, in some way, an attempt to counter the US-led Western influence and the censorship imposed by the US. But look, from the outside it is being shown that Russia and China are such good friends.  Everything is great.  But actually, these internal leaks, these leaked pages show that Russia's FSB sees Beijing as an adversary. Edge sees it as an enemy.  Well, here I will tell you what things have been revealed in the leaked document. China has been officially designated as threat and enemy.  This means that China has been officially declared as an enemy by Russia in internal Russian intelligence assessment.  So what happens is that no matter how much you show externally and say that yes, everything is good and this also happens in geopolitics, but somewhere you should know the reality. So the reality in the Russian Intelligence assessment in Russia is that China is our enemy country and the FSB says it accuses China of spying on Russia, meaning that Russia knows that China spies on a large scale inside Russia.  For example, China's MSS, the Ministry of State Security, is after Russia, and all the espionage work etc. inside Russia is looked after by the Ministry of State Security. Including this, you can see that China continuously tries to steal Russia's technology, military and diplomatic secrets. China has currently infiltrated even the Russian academies and cyber systems here. Apart from this, the espionage operation here in Russian soil, that is, the entire espionage operation, China also continuously carries out this in Russian soil, especially in cities like Moscow, Blokhinsk, so you will find all these things in the assessment of Russian intelligence and see, somewhere this is a big reason, recently I also made a shot on Instagram, I also uploaded it on YouTube regarding S400, and what is it, if you see, China has also taken it from Russia, India has also taken it. But do you know that India currently has full access to S400.  Full access.  But China also has access.  But if Russia wants, it can deny that access to China at any time.  Meaning that the one which is fully complete has not been given to China in a way. Because Russia fears that tomorrow China might use it against Russia.  So these kinds of things can also happen.  But look, the question arises that after all, whatever documents we are talking about, when and how did they become known about the leaks? What is actually?  There is a decent dissident group in Russia called the Dossier Center, and what these people do is that they keep monitoring the corruption and authoritarianism in Russia. So during this monitoring, they came to know of some things and they accessed all the FSB documents etc. and from that they found out that actually Moscow has declared Beijing as an enemy country. Then all these things came to light and it was also told here that how China keeps spying inside Russia. Well, let me tell you what I know about the spying that we are talking about here. Look, the Russian officials have alleged that the Chinese students and researchers who stay in Russian universities, they operate whatever espionage is there at the behest of the Ministry of State Security, which is China's MSS.   Apart from this, it is believed here that the documents related to classified industrial and military innovations are also collected by the students and researchers in Russia. Apart from this, Russian cyber defense has continuously intercepted Chinese hacking attempts. China continuously attempts to hack the Russian government database. Some reports also say that these attacks are happening on par with US and NATO levels.  The way US and NATO level cyber attacks happen inside Russia.  In a similar way, China also keeps doing similar things.  Apart from this, if you see, many Chinese companies which operate in Russia are also accused of doing intelligence gathering work.  Apart from this, there are many Chinese infrastructure investments, for example Huawei Energy Partnership.  So this is also seen as a dual use for civilian and intelligence gathering purposes. So you are understanding that it is not the case here that any baseless things are being said.  In a way, Russia must also be monitoring China on a large scale to see what China is trying to do.  So do n't just look at geopolitics from the outside, where Russia and China are together.  He will never leave you but actually you must be understanding the reality.  Well, what is the geopolitical analysis of this?   The first is strategic cooperation versus intelligence competition.  Meaning, Russia, China, as I told you why they are united together so that they can counter the West, you can call it a compulsion, but if you look at each other, they are also rivals, FSB's internal characterization of China as enemy shows that there is lack of deep trust between the two. Apart from this, Russia's security doctrine.  That means the Russian military and intelligence doctrine enforces that you keep an eye on everyone to make sure you are not being spied upon. That means you should not trust even your friend's country.  This is Russia's doctrine and it is not happening for the first time.  If you look back at the time of the USSR, the Soviet Union, there were even more problems at that time.  There were many issues between China and USSR which is called Sino-Soviet Split of 1960. I will tell you more about it.  But here again you can see that Russian vulnerability has increased further because of the Ukraine war.  The thing is that Russia has become dependent on China to a great extent. Trade was done with China. Diplomacy took place with China. China is currently supplying a lot of defence equipment to Russia. So Russia also in a way has become dependent on China and that is why Russia fears that it is helpful but it is also scary and threatening.  So you will get to see all these things.  Well, the historical parallel I was telling you about, the Sino-Soviet split in 1960, what was that?  Look, it was the time of Cold War and both China and USSR were communist states, so it seemed that since both are communist states, both should be friends so that they can counter the capitalist states like America and European countries. But here you could see bitter ideological and strategic rivalry. Even at that time in 1960, there were clashes over the border, so I am repeatedly telling you what Chanakya had said that two neighbouring countries can never be friends. So the reason for this is that there are many issues regarding borders and resources.  So there was the Ussuri River conflict of 1969.  Astonishment was also happening at that time. So there were clashes between the two countries regarding all this. What is happening today is that again there is mistrust but on the surface these people show that both the countries are against the western countries.  So somewhere there is some compulsion due to which they are together at this moment.  Maybe things may change in the future.  So the conclusion is that despite Putin and his Grand Declaration of Unity, you will see a lot of mistrust between the two countries. So I hope that through the details of this video, you would have come to know important information about Geopolitics and before leaving, I have a very interesting question for all of you, can you tell?
