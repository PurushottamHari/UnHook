00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,880
[Music]

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,920
All right, it's finally here. Nintendo

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,720
sent this box over and inside this box

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,240
is our Nintendo Switch 2. It's our $449

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,240
Nintendo Switch 2. Actually, there's a

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
bunch of stuff in this box. There is the

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
Nintendo Switch 2 plus the Mario Kart

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,400
World bundle. That's $4.99. There's also

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,439
a Switch 2 camera in here, which is $55.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,399
There's also a Switch 2 Pro controller,

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,440
which is $85. And there's a physical

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,600
copy of Mario Kart World, which would be

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
$80 if you got one, which we'll need to

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,239
play today because the digital copy

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,320
doesn't work until tomorrow. So, kind of

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,719
a pricey box, but let's just jump

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,120
in with none other than our Ridge MKBHD

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
knife, of course.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
Oh, and also, by the way, you've noticed

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,199
I have over here a Switch One and a

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,719
Switch One OLED because I've gotten to

22
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,479
compare like back and forth between

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,760
seeing one and seeing the other, but I

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,360
want to look at them next to each other.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,600
So, let's jump in. Here's the Switch 2

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,320
Pro

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,320
controller. Switch

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,960
to Mario Kart World. There it is.

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
switch to camera and of course a little

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
bit of extra information. They always

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,960
give us a little PDF so we know what's

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,240
going on. But that's

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,920
it. So, of course, first we should get

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
into the console itself. That's all

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
anyone's really here for anyway. So,

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
there you go. That's the box you're

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
going to see in in stores and Best Buy

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
and

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,840
everything. There they are right on top.

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
the big new

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,840
JoyCons. And then of course the console

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,320
itself right here. Looks a little bigger

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,200
every time I see it. Nice big 7.9 in

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,840
screen. Thin

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,280
bezels. Pretty

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,360
sleek. There you go. USBC port on top.

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,319
Got those pins on the side. We'll talk

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
more about those in a second. But yeah,

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,200
that's the console right there. But what

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
else comes in this box here? HDMI cable.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,239
Nice. And then of course your two

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,239
attachments for the JoyCons and the

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,239
wrist straps. And that's it for here.

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,319
This is a wall plug. Single USBC port on

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,519
that. USB typeC cable. So that's your

56
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,239
charger right here. Here is your little

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,879
hub to attach both JoyCons. Last but not

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,560
least, the dock with the fans in it that

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,480
does 4K out to the TV with this new

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
shape. I think first thing I want to do

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,239
is just attach the JoyCons. That's the

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,640
thing that I miss when I first got to

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,319
see those those magnetic

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,760
JoyCons. It's just so satisfying. This

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,280
little mechanism here that pops the

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,840
Joy-Con off of the uh off the switch. It

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,440
attaches super super well, but if you

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
just press it a little, it detaches just

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
like that. and then you just pull. So,

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
that's nice. I kind of wonder how

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,840
durable these pins are, if they're going

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
to break. I've been told they have a

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
little bit of give on purpose so that if

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
you do knock up against it or drop it or

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
something, it won't instantly break.

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
Now, these here are the little bumpers

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
because you might actually end up using

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,879
these a little bit more often. At least

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
if the games support the new feature

80
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
where the Joy-Cons can be used as a

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
mouse. These little things, they're also

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,840
made of plastic. a little bit of give to

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,360
them, but they're still pretty sturdy.

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,440
And they attach to the JoyCons

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,840
themselves. So, if I throw this bumper

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,400
on here, just like

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,599
that. Hooks on the

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,560
bottom. And there you go. So, there's

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,799
your JoyCons as mice and also with the

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,720
bumpers on if you wanted to handhold

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,400
your controller. Everybody's used to

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
this

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,920
experience. But, I have some other

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,239
unboxings to get to. So, I'm going to do

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
these, too. Let's do the camera first.

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,400
So, some of you may remember Nintendo's

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,159
connect event where they showed this new

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,840
camera basically while you're doing

99
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,519
gameplay. You hit this new C button and

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
it opens this share menu and it's

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
supposed to be this much more social

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
console where you can share your

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,680
gameplay with other people at the same

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,880
time or even share a video feed of your

105
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,199
face which is overlaid over your

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,880
gameplay to someone else who is playing

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,479
at the same time. Could be cool. I don't

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,639
even know if you might be able to live

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
stream that feed. I'm not exactly sure

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,280
if you want to do that, but this is that

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,199
tiny little camera. And uh yep, it's

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,080
just as tiny and cute as I remember. And

113
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,080
then another USB type-C cable for that.

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,840
There's this little bezel around the

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,800
front that lets you manually physically

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,080
open and close it. You got

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,840
that? That's nice. So, we got our Pro

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,360
Controller here, which is going to be

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
sick for some games. I don't know if I'm

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
going to use this for Mario Kart World.

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,360
But here is your $85 Pro

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,560
Controller. USB type-C cable to USB

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,800
typeA on the other

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,120
end. Oh, it's kind of heavy. It's got

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,720
some weight to it that I didn't actually

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,479
expect. Everything else is obviously

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
mostly plastic and so is this

128
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,479
controller, but it does have this like

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,280
central weight where I'm sure battery

130
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,240
and haptics all are. So, okay, switch

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,039
two. I'm going to put these JoyCons back

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,639
on and fire it up for the first

133
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,240
time. That's so much faster than before.

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,080
Also, the dock here is nice because you

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,160
can just

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,560
ideally pop it in. There's a little bit

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,320
of wiggle, a little bit of give. It's

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,759
not too bad. This is the Switch One

139
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,680
dock, which didn't really have any give

140
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,720
at all. So, I'm a little surprised to

141
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,440
see so much wiggle. I think it's about

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
time to start playing some games. Power

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
button.

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
Oh

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,319
yeah. Speakers are bigger. It's

146
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,720
crisp. English, yes. The Americas, yes.

147
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
Accept the agreement, yes. Okay. About

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
to download update data. I heard about

149
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
this day one update. You can continue

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,840
setting it up while the update

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,039
downloads. Sure. What time zone am I in?

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,199
Okay. Last thing I want to do is just

153
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,600
get a look at this physical game because

154
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,680
the cartridge slot is still at the top.

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Where's my ridge knife? So, if I were to

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,160
in the future maybe not get the bundle

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,319
at launch, but get the physical Mario

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Kart World

159
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,000
game. This is what one of those nice

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
cartridges is going to look

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
like. All right.

162
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,360
So much plastic. This is a massive

163
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,680
package for this tiny little cartridge

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
right here. But this is the game. Those

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
are your

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,680
pins. There we go. MKBHD is logged in.

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Very

168
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,000
nice. More users can be added if the

169
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,240
system will be used by other people.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,280
Good to know. To Parrots and Guardians,

171
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,000
set up your controls. Psych. Don't have

172
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,680
any cards to add, but I would if I did.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,280
And then to set up the Oh, complete. Hit

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,560
home.

175
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,570
Great. First look at the home screen on

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,399
the Switch, too.

177
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,399
[Music]

178
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So, I could obviously jump in and

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,120
download an app or game right now, but I

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
think the move

181
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,560
is straight to Mario Kart World.

182
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,280
Nice. Software updates available. It'll

183
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,479
download now, but I'd like to start the

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,720
software, please. It's me. Sorry, I

185
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:28,520
should say It's a me.

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,520
This new bigger screen.

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,279
7.9 in display looks way better. 120 Hz

188
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,080
looks so much

189
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,080
better. Turn the speakers

190
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,720
down. Okay. Sorry. I'm I'm getting

191
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
carried away. What I should be doing is

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
comparing it to the other switches. So,

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm going to do that real quick just

194
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,240
because we actually have them all side

195
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
by side. So, this is the Switch One.

196
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
This is my Switch One. It's also a

197
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
ColorWare Switch One, so that's why it

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,640
looks a little different. It's got the

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
paint all over the JoyCons and the back.

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,880
And it looks super sweet. But this is

201
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,080
the old kickstand. And this is the old

202
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Switch One size. This is the new Switch,

203
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
the new Switch kickstand, and the new

204
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Switch size. The thickness is roughly

205
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,279
the same,

206
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,040
but obviously much bigger screen, much

207
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,760
better looking screen, higher refresh

208
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,399
rate, more storage, the whole deal.

209
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Obvious upgrade. But this is David's

210
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
Switch OLED, which they did upgrade some

211
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
other things on. Obviously, it's an OLED

212
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
display, but it also has this full width

213
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
kickstand. See, this is the difference

214
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
that we're talking about. This is the

215
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,560
Switch OLED on the bottom, Switch 2 on

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
the top. And this has happened so many

217
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
times in like even the smartphone world

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
and the tablet world where we say, "Oh,

219
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,519
you know, we're we're nerds. We're

220
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
really pixel peeping. We really want to

221
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,040
see a higher fidelity, better looking

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,320
display." But at the end of the day,

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,160
most people just want a bigger screen.

224
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
And that's what the Switch 2 is

225
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,360
delivering. We also fully expect, if

226
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
we're being reasonable, there's probably

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
going to be a Switch 2 OLED at some

228
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
point in the next like two years or

229
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,519
something. So, I wouldn't be shocked

230
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,360
when that shows up. And that's even more

231
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
expensive. But that's a bigger OLED

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,200
display that's also 120 Hz and looks

233
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
amazing. And they might even do some

234
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
other things that upgrade the console.

235
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,480
Like they weren't afraid of a new

236
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,640
kickstand design and some other things

237
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,860
for Switch OLED. But yeah. Oh god, I

238
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:34,920
didn't actually think this

239
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:37,440
[Music]

240
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,320
through. That is fun. Yeah, these

241
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,560
JoyCons are so much better than the old

242
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,920
ones. Here, I'll just show you. Since we

243
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,600
have them, we can actually do the direct

244
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,200
comparison. You have to pull the little

245
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,320
pin in, slot it up like

246
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,920
that. And first of all, it's larger,

247
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
which does make a difference. It's a

248
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
little more ergonomic, but then also

249
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,560
every single button is bigger. The

250
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,560
joystick is bigger. I saw that there was

251
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,440
a pre-installed screen protector on the

252
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,120
Switch, and it's true. I can see it. I'm

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
going to get a macro shot of it so you

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,000
can see what I'm seeing. But they say

255
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,880
don't remove it. And now that I've seen

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
the instructions, okay, I won't. But if

257
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,680
you want to install one on top of it,

258
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,120
that's cool, too. Like Dbrand has a

259
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,959
prism screen protector you can install

260
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,640
on top of this one, and that will hold

261
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
it and protect whatever is underneath.

262
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Now, one of the big Switch 2 talking

263
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,120
points, which I mentioned in that last

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,200
video, was that game that essentially

265
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,839
acts as a tutorial to learn about your

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Switch doesn't come with it. It's not

267
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,399
free and it's not here, but there are

268
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,279
some built-in tutorial things like how

269
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,200
to use mouse controls. If I pop one of

270
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
these

271
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,640
off, select next, and follow the oncreen

272
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,640
guides, put the bumper

273
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,480
on. Oh, there it is. Shows up

274
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,519
immediately. So, I don't know if you can

275
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,279
see that, but I am using this as a

276
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
controller. And then I'm also able to

277
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,560
scroll inside Windows, which is kind of

278
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,720
nice. And then, of course, I can

279
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,040
select, select, select using that top

280
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
button. So, it works pretty well. I

281
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,120
think there's going to be a couple of

282
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,480
games that do immediately support this

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
out the box, but it's probably not

284
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
something a lot of them are expecting to

285
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,920
use. Like, I did that wheelchair soccer

286
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
game when I was doing the demo when I

287
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,279
first tried the Switch to, and it worked

288
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,639
pretty well. But yeah, we'll see what

289
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,600
other games end up using that. So, for

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,720
those wondering what the rest of the

291
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
home screen stuff looks like, because

292
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,240
this is also something we haven't seen

293
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,760
yet. Uh, looks pretty familiar. Got your

294
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
picture up at the top cuz that's your

295
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,000
account. And I'm sure I'll blur my

296
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,320
friend code so nobody spams me. But then

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800
of course your games and then underneath

298
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,880
game chats in there. Settings are in

299
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,920
here. I can go to Let's see. Can I

300
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,200
change my display refresh rate? TV

301
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,519
resolution is automatic, but up to 4K,

302
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
which is

303
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,800
great. So, it doesn't look like I can

304
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,839
decide to go down to 60 Hz. This is for

305
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,680
just

306
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,680
TV. Yeah, I feel like these new JoyCons

307
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,480
are almost as much of an upgrade as the

308
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,120
new screen. Just having these huge new

309
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,720
buttons, the whole Joy-Con being bigger,

310
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
ergonomically, it's better, the haptics

311
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,440
are better. I should probably drop this

312
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,079
on a little bit. But yeah, it is much

313
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,120
better to game on an individual Joy-Con

314
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,639
with the new ones. So, if you're

315
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,000
thinking about Switch 2, oh, is that

316
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,040
really that much of an upgrade? Is it

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,639
that different to game on it? Um, it's

318
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
going to feel different because of the

319
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,560
JoyCons just as much as the screen. So,

320
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,600
here's all three Switches all lined up

321
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,079
next to each other. Switch one, OG,

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,639
Switch, OLED, new kickstand, OLED

323
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,600
screen. Switch two. Obviously, the

324
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
biggest difference is just that it's

325
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
bigger. I mean, this is my first

326
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
impression. The bigger JoyCons make such

327
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
a big difference. So, most people are

328
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
going to enjoy bigger Joy-Cons and

329
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,079
bigger screen. We also are expecting an

330
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,480
OLED version later. Um, I'm going to get

331
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,560
to much more detail in the full review,

332
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
but also if you're considering getting a

333
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
Switch 2, you're probably also thinking

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,240
about getting a case. Uh, in which case

335
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,120
you should consider the Kill Switch by

336
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,600
channel sponsor Dbrand. Okay, so this is

337
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,160
the Kill Switch case. Um, also it looks

338
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
like Dbrand left a note which says, uh,

339
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
we know there's a lot of features, but

340
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
they're all pretty important that you

341
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,800
can try to fit them in the end

342
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,680
roll. I'll try. So, this is the case.

343
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,120
It's got this super rigid travel cover,

344
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
crush proof. You can just toss this

345
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
thing around, which is great. But then

346
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,959
with this little bungee, which is kind

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,160
of sick, you take the cover off and

348
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,120
inside you'll notice there are 10 slots,

349
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,320
magnetic holders for your games. So,

350
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,680
take the games with you. But then even

351
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
once you got the cover off, it's still

352
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,880
protected and you have full access to

353
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,800
the kickstand, which is sick. You can

354
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
still fully remove the Joy-Cons, unlike

355
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,600
a lot of other cases. And the JoyCons

356
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
have this ergonomic back on them as

357
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,760
well, which is kind of killer. So now

358
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
the Joycon's bigger and more comfortable

359
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,959
to hold, kind of like a real mouse in

360
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,519
the hand. You can still put the bumpers

361
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,440
on and use it as a mouse. That's nice.

362
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,560
So then for docking, Dbrand includes a

363
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
dock adapter with every kill switch.

364
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,519
Pops in like that. So, all you got to do

365
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
is place your kill switch on the front

366
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
tray and they're connected and now

367
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,199
they're docked. Full 4K 60 pass through

368
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
and the dock fan still cools the dock

369
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,160
normally. And I haven't even touched on

370
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
the durability, the build quality, the

371
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
materials. This thing is a tank. So,

372
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
yeah, if you're going to travel with

373
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,519
your Switch, highly recommended. And if

374
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,839
you want to grab one for $35 off, I'll

375
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,120
have a link down below in the

376
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,800
description. That's it. Thanks for

377
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
watching this first impressions. Let me

379
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
review. What games I should play first

380
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,000
of all, which experiences I should use

381
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
GameS Share with, using the camera with,

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
using the Pro Controller with, cuz I

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,480
want to be pretty thorough. But this is

384
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,920
a first look at the newest console for

385
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,360
Nintendo. Thanks for watching. Get
