[Music] All right, it's finally here. Nintendo sent this box over and inside this box is our Nintendo Switch 2. It's our $449 Nintendo Switch 2. Actually, there's a bunch of stuff in this box. There is the Nintendo Switch 2 plus the Mario Kart World bundle. That's $4.99. There's also a Switch 2 camera in here, which is $55. There's also a Switch 2 Pro controller, which is $85. And there's a physical copy of Mario Kart World, which would be $80 if you got one, which we'll need to play today because the digital copy doesn't work until tomorrow. So, kind of a pricey box, but let's just jump in with none other than our Ridge MKBHD knife, of course. Oh, and also, by the way, you've noticed I have over here a Switch One and a Switch One OLED because I've gotten to compare like back and forth between seeing one and seeing the other, but I want to look at them next to each other. So, let's jump in. Here's the Switch 2 Pro controller. Switch to Mario Kart World. There it is. switch to camera and of course a little bit of extra information. They always give us a little PDF so we know what's going on. But that's it. So, of course, first we should get into the console itself. That's all anyone's really here for anyway. So, there you go. That's the box you're going to see in in stores and Best Buy and everything. There they are right on top. the big new JoyCons. And then of course the console itself right here. Looks a little bigger every time I see it. Nice big 7.9 in screen. Thin bezels. Pretty sleek. There you go. USBC port on top. Got those pins on the side. We'll talk more about those in a second. But yeah, that's the console right there. But what else comes in this box here? HDMI cable. Nice. And then of course your two attachments for the JoyCons and the wrist straps. And that's it for here. This is a wall plug. Single USBC port on that. USB typeC cable. So that's your charger right here. Here is your little hub to attach both JoyCons. Last but not least, the dock with the fans in it that does 4K out to the TV with this new shape. I think first thing I want to do is just attach the JoyCons. That's the thing that I miss when I first got to see those those magnetic JoyCons. It's just so satisfying. This little mechanism here that pops the Joy-Con off of the uh off the switch. It attaches super super well, but if you just press it a little, it detaches just like that. and then you just pull. So, that's nice. I kind of wonder how durable these pins are, if they're going to break. I've been told they have a little bit of give on purpose so that if you do knock up against it or drop it or something, it won't instantly break. Now, these here are the little bumpers because you might actually end up using these a little bit more often. At least if the games support the new feature where the Joy-Cons can be used as a mouse. These little things, they're also made of plastic. a little bit of give to them, but they're still pretty sturdy. And they attach to the JoyCons themselves. So, if I throw this bumper on here, just like that. Hooks on the bottom. And there you go. So, there's your JoyCons as mice and also with the bumpers on if you wanted to handhold your controller. Everybody's used to this experience. But, I have some other unboxings to get to. So, I'm going to do these, too. Let's do the camera first. So, some of you may remember Nintendo's connect event where they showed this new camera basically while you're doing gameplay. You hit this new C button and it opens this share menu and it's supposed to be this much more social console where you can share your gameplay with other people at the same time or even share a video feed of your face which is overlaid over your gameplay to someone else who is playing at the same time. Could be cool. I don't even know if you might be able to live stream that feed. I'm not exactly sure if you want to do that, but this is that tiny little camera. And uh yep, it's just as tiny and cute as I remember. And then another USB type-C cable for that. There's this little bezel around the front that lets you manually physically open and close it. You got that? That's nice. So, we got our Pro Controller here, which is going to be sick for some games. I don't know if I'm going to use this for Mario Kart World. But here is your $85 Pro Controller. USB type-C cable to USB typeA on the other end. Oh, it's kind of heavy. It's got some weight to it that I didn't actually expect. Everything else is obviously mostly plastic and so is this controller, but it does have this like central weight where I'm sure battery and haptics all are. So, okay, switch two. I'm going to put these JoyCons back on and fire it up for the first time. That's so much faster than before. Also, the dock here is nice because you can just ideally pop it in. There's a little bit of wiggle, a little bit of give. It's not too bad. This is the Switch One dock, which didn't really have any give at all. So, I'm a little surprised to see so much wiggle. I think it's about time to start playing some games. Power button. Oh yeah. Speakers are bigger. It's crisp. English, yes. The Americas, yes. Accept the agreement, yes. Okay. About to download update data. I heard about this day one update. You can continue setting it up while the update downloads. Sure. What time zone am I in? Okay. Last thing I want to do is just get a look at this physical game because the cartridge slot is still at the top. Where's my ridge knife? So, if I were to in the future maybe not get the bundle at launch, but get the physical Mario Kart World game. This is what one of those nice cartridges is going to look like. All right. So much plastic. This is a massive package for this tiny little cartridge right here. But this is the game. Those are your pins. There we go. MKBHD is logged in. Very nice. More users can be added if the system will be used by other people. Good to know. To Parrots and Guardians, set up your controls. Psych. Don't have any cards to add, but I would if I did. And then to set up the Oh, complete. Hit home. Great. First look at the home screen on the Switch, too. [Music] So, I could obviously jump in and download an app or game right now, but I think the move is straight to Mario Kart World. Nice. Software updates available. It'll download now, but I'd like to start the software, please. It's me. Sorry, I should say It's a me. This new bigger screen. 7.9 in display looks way better. 120 Hz looks so much better. Turn the speakers down. Okay. Sorry. I'm I'm getting carried away. What I should be doing is comparing it to the other switches. So, I'm going to do that real quick just because we actually have them all side by side. So, this is the Switch One. This is my Switch One. It's also a ColorWare Switch One, so that's why it looks a little different. It's got the paint all over the JoyCons and the back. And it looks super sweet. But this is the old kickstand. And this is the old Switch One size. This is the new Switch, the new Switch kickstand, and the new Switch size. The thickness is roughly the same, but obviously much bigger screen, much better looking screen, higher refresh rate, more storage, the whole deal. Obvious upgrade. But this is David's Switch OLED, which they did upgrade some other things on. Obviously, it's an OLED display, but it also has this full width kickstand. See, this is the difference that we're talking about. This is the Switch OLED on the bottom, Switch 2 on the top. And this has happened so many times in like even the smartphone world and the tablet world where we say, "Oh, you know, we're we're nerds. We're really pixel peeping. We really want to see a higher fidelity, better looking display." But at the end of the day, most people just want a bigger screen. And that's what the Switch 2 is delivering. We also fully expect, if we're being reasonable, there's probably going to be a Switch 2 OLED at some point in the next like two years or something. So, I wouldn't be shocked when that shows up. And that's even more expensive. But that's a bigger OLED display that's also 120 Hz and looks amazing. And they might even do some other things that upgrade the console. Like they weren't afraid of a new kickstand design and some other things for Switch OLED. But yeah. Oh god, I didn't actually think this [Music] through. That is fun. Yeah, these JoyCons are so much better than the old ones. Here, I'll just show you. Since we have them, we can actually do the direct comparison. You have to pull the little pin in, slot it up like that. And first of all, it's larger, which does make a difference. It's a little more ergonomic, but then also every single button is bigger. The joystick is bigger. I saw that there was a pre-installed screen protector on the Switch, and it's true. I can see it. I'm going to get a macro shot of it so you can see what I'm seeing. But they say don't remove it. And now that I've seen the instructions, okay, I won't. But if you want to install one on top of it, that's cool, too. Like Dbrand has a prism screen protector you can install on top of this one, and that will hold it and protect whatever is underneath. Now, one of the big Switch 2 talking points, which I mentioned in that last video, was that game that essentially acts as a tutorial to learn about your Switch doesn't come with it. It's not free and it's not here, but there are some built-in tutorial things like how to use mouse controls. If I pop one of these off, select next, and follow the oncreen guides, put the bumper on. Oh, there it is. Shows up immediately. So, I don't know if you can see that, but I am using this as a controller. And then I'm also able to scroll inside Windows, which is kind of nice. And then, of course, I can select, select, select using that top button. So, it works pretty well. I think there's going to be a couple of games that do immediately support this out the box, but it's probably not something a lot of them are expecting to use. Like, I did that wheelchair soccer game when I was doing the demo when I first tried the Switch to, and it worked pretty well. But yeah, we'll see what other games end up using that. So, for those wondering what the rest of the home screen stuff looks like, because this is also something we haven't seen yet. Uh, looks pretty familiar. Got your picture up at the top cuz that's your account. And I'm sure I'll blur my friend code so nobody spams me. But then of course your games and then underneath game chats in there. Settings are in here. I can go to Let's see. Can I change my display refresh rate? TV resolution is automatic, but up to 4K, which is great. So, it doesn't look like I can decide to go down to 60 Hz. This is for just TV. Yeah, I feel like these new JoyCons are almost as much of an upgrade as the new screen. Just having these huge new buttons, the whole Joy-Con being bigger, ergonomically, it's better, the haptics are better. I should probably drop this on a little bit. But yeah, it is much better to game on an individual Joy-Con with the new ones. So, if you're thinking about Switch 2, oh, is that really that much of an upgrade? Is it that different to game on it? Um, it's going to feel different because of the JoyCons just as much as the screen. So, here's all three Switches all lined up next to each other. Switch one, OG, Switch, OLED, new kickstand, OLED screen. Switch two. Obviously, the biggest difference is just that it's bigger. I mean, this is my first impression. The bigger JoyCons make such a big difference. So, most people are going to enjoy bigger Joy-Cons and bigger screen. We also are expecting an OLED version later. Um, I'm going to get to much more detail in the full review, but also if you're considering getting a Switch 2, you're probably also thinking about getting a case. Uh, in which case you should consider the Kill Switch by channel sponsor Dbrand. Okay, so this is the Kill Switch case. Um, also it looks like Dbrand left a note which says, uh, we know there's a lot of features, but they're all pretty important that you can try to fit them in the end roll. I'll try. So, this is the case. It's got this super rigid travel cover, crush proof. You can just toss this thing around, which is great. But then with this little bungee, which is kind of sick, you take the cover off and inside you'll notice there are 10 slots, magnetic holders for your games. So, take the games with you. But then even once you got the cover off, it's still protected and you have full access to the kickstand, which is sick. You can still fully remove the Joy-Cons, unlike a lot of other cases. And the JoyCons have this ergonomic back on them as well, which is kind of killer. So now the Joycon's bigger and more comfortable to hold, kind of like a real mouse in the hand. You can still put the bumpers on and use it as a mouse. That's nice. So then for docking, Dbrand includes a dock adapter with every kill switch. Pops in like that. So, all you got to do is place your kill switch on the front tray and they're connected and now they're docked. Full 4K 60 pass through and the dock fan still cools the dock normally. And I haven't even touched on the durability, the build quality, the materials. This thing is a tank. So, yeah, if you're going to travel with your Switch, highly recommended. And if you want to grab one for $35 off, I'll have a link down below in the description. That's it. Thanks for watching this first impressions. Let me know what you want to see in the full review. What games I should play first of all, which experiences I should use GameS Share with, using the camera with, using the Pro Controller with, cuz I want to be pretty thorough. But this is a first look at the newest console for Nintendo. Thanks for watching. Get subscribed to see that stuff. Catch you in the next one. Peace.
