1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,839
My name is Siddhant Agnihot.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
Friends, the war has begun.  This is a

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,640
very big war because now we can

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,960
assume that Iran will declare a full on war.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,920
This is a lot because

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
if you look at it, there was a lot of tension for the last two-three months.  There has been

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,519
tension since April.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,240
And now she has reached her climax today.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,120
Which strikes have been carried out by Israel.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,079
We will talk about Iran tax, we will talk very thoroughly,

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,800
in a way we will see what is the

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,200
scenario, what is happening,

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,440
what are the problems, and what has been the

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
problem historically, and what is the actual agenda,

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,840
but friends,

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,640
today is the last day to avail the Dark Psychology course, if

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
we turn off the positive coupon code today, then this

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
course will become expensive, it will cost â‚¹1000,

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,239
then the sale will come after two-three months, so you

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
go to the description comment box and

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,520
avail the course, Psychologist, Dr Mayurika

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
Das has told

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
how you can avoid being manipulated?  So look, this article

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
is from Indian Express and it is a bit

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,520
old.  This is the article from the day before yesterday and the

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,479
attack happened yesterday.  What has happened is that Israel has

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
bombed what is now Iran.  Now you

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
assume that Israel has destroyed Iran's

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,880
nuclear sites.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
Killed the nuclear scientist.  Their chief was killed.

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
What a huge escalation this is.  Iran will stop.

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,360
Iran will wreak havoc.  Do

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
n't try to understand Iran by weakening it.  Iran is not weak.

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
Iran is powerful.  He has placed his proxies.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
That would leave the proxies behind.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,720
He himself will launch a missile attack and a lot of things can happen,

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
friends.  But this apprehension was

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
already being anticipated.  Here

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
America and Iran are sitting and

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
playing nuclear war.  Isn't it?  Or should I not

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
listen to your conditions?  Iran is saying

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
no, we will not accept your conditions.

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,000
Go.  Ok?  So there is a fight going on between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law.

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,000
And here my father-in-law

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
played the game.  So Israel should come.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,439
He said go away and keep all this aside.

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Now look, it is not that America does

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
not know.  America knew these talks were

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,360
failing.  Friends what is talk?

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
These talks were going on since April.  Donald

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,879
Trump was going to hold this sixth meeting.  He was

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,200
saying that look, we

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
will create a regional consulate for your nuclear program.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,599
Isn't it?  You, these

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,239
sensations of yours, we will remove them.  Ok?  Whatever we have

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
told you, we will also engage with you.

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
But you will have to stop your nuclear program.

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,720
Iran isn't killing for this.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,520
Iran is saying no and it is uranium

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,440
enrichment.  Let's churn out the uranium.  Is it okay

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
?  And if it goes above 90% then you will be

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
able to make a nuclear bomb.  Now

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
centrifuges are used for this.  Isn't it?

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
These are very big churners.  Isn't it?

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
Butter is extracted by churning the milk whey.  So

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,680
you should understand something like that.  Ok?  So now

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,480
Israel has attacked the centrifuge here.  So this Iran is saying that no no

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
brother, your conditions are not right.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
We cannot destroy our nukes.

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720
We assure you that we will

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
use our nuclear program for the right purpose.  Peaceful but it is not like that.  He is

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
continuously making nuclear bombs.

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,959
Well, America fears it.  So

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,599
somewhere these talks were failing.  Both of them were

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,959
not agreeing.  And what happened to it?  The result was

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
that Israel attacked.  Well

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
what did America do?  America had

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,040

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
started deploying its troops from the Middle East.  And here the

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,840
official statement from Donald Trump came that this

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,920
is a very dangerous place, Middle East West Asia, which

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,040
means a very big war is about to happen.

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Now we all know that there is a

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680
battle for leadership in West Asia.  Iran says we are

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,680
first, Saudi Arabia says we are

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
first and Turkey says we are first.  These

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
three countries fight for supremacy

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,480
and wage indirect war against each other.  Is it

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,640
okay?  Now this is what has

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,040
happened here.  Now friends, this is a big point

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,480
of escalation.  America has issued travel

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,040
advisory for Iraq, Israel and everywhere.

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
Look, the main

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,280
thing here is oil.  Actually,

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,319
before 1979, Iran was the

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,480
younger brother of America.  Iran did whatever America said.

102
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,560
But in 1979 when the revolution

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,959
comes, Ayatollah Khomeini comes.

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
Things changed after that.  And immediately after that, the

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,239
Iran-Iraq war started which

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,640
lasted for 10 years from 1979 to 1989, and let me

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,919
tell you that parallelly, at this time, 1979 is

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,440
such a year where a lot of things happened, the

109
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,280
country changed completely, there was a coup, war is happening

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,280
in India, problem brother, the same 1979 was a

111
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,040
turning point because of which all the

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
terrorist groups that you see in India today, were

113
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
all formed at that time, there the

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,440
Soviets and Afghans were fighting, so a lot of things happened due to which

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
Iran became known as America,

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
but after that things changed and oil was

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
discovered.  Now when the oil was discovered,

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
America wanted it to be given to us

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,120
because it was afraid that

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,560
Iran would form a consortium with Russia and China.  If he

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
creates a grouping then we are done for.

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,560
So this is why Barack Obama

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,360
started engagement with Iran.  He asked if he would

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
sit.  Okay, you sell the oil to us.

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
First he said that

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,759
we are finalizing your nuclear deal.

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
Whatever nuclear power you have, use it to convert

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
it into peaceful energy and electricity.

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,240
We don't have any problem.  Don't make weapons.

130
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
We will help you.  But later the condition was

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,479
also put that your oil is ours.  Iran

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
understood this.  So Iran said no no Eena

133
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,960
Chaolbe.  Now after that when Donald Trump

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
comes then it is a big game.  Even now if

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
you look, it is a game only for oil.

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
Because both America and Israel know

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,240
that oil and gas will decide the future.

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,800
This will decide the energy.  Is it okay

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
?  Iran is not agreeing to this and

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
that is why America is upset.

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,639
Well, now America neither got oil nor gas.  On

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,960
top of that, Iran is already engaging with Russia and China.

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
Then

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,759
what option is left for them, to attack Iran and

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,759
attack it so much that everyone is destroyed.  These

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
accounts.  So American President

147
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
Donald Trump told Israeli PM Netan Yahoo

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
several times about Gaza war.  Now see, the

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,880
government of those leaders who are doing this is also going to go.

150
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
Netan Yu Benjamin Neta Yu Bhaiya, it's

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,479
okay you kill, we are not saying that Hamas should be

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
destroyed but why are you killing the people,

153
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,800
Bhaiya, in Gaza a

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,120
packet of Parleg biscuits costs 2 thousand rupees, that is a

155
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
lot, here the hospital is being

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
attacked and Israel is

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,680
not stopping at all, America has even told Methan Yu here

158
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,840
but Israel is

159
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
not listening to anyone.  Israel is lying dead

160
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,720
and nuclear negotiations between America and Iran are

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,560
going on.  The sixth round is yet to be held in Muscat.  The

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
talks have happened five times.

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,160
But it did not yield any results.  The trigger was

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,840
that America felt Israel had

165
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
clashed with America as well.  But friends, I think

166
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
that this is just an obvious thing.  But

167
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
behind the scenes America is saying, kill,

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,880
kill, kill Israel, it does not matter.  We have

169
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,360
placed our shoulder on your shoulder.  You finish it.

170
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Hit Iran.  At least

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
that is what it seems behind the scenes.  So the nuclear talks between America and Iran have

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,400

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,520
intensified here.  After that, International

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,319
Atomic, I am sorry, International Atomic

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,560
Energy Agency, AIAEA,

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,280
passed a resolution.  Just now he said

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,680
that Iran knows NPT, Non

178
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
Preferential Treaty.  What is this?  In 1969,

179
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
my father-in-law brought a treaty.  America and all the others had

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
said that the

181
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
nuclear bomb will remain with only five of our

182
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
permanent members, which includes America,

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
UK, Russia, France, China, all the

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,199
others should leave at the earliest opportunity, sign

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
these papers, sign them and after that

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
we should get this paper by tomorrow that

187
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,479
you people will not make nuclear bombs,

188
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
everyone signed it, Iran also signed it

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
because Iran was called America at that time,

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,560
now India said, now get out of here, brother,

191
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
hey, I said, what is this rudeness, what is

192
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
this rudeness, is it discriminatory or

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
highly discriminatory, America said,

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
why does it seem discriminatory brother, that is why it is

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
discriminatory because what you are doing

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
with us, first

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
destroy your own nuclear weapons, then only we will

198
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
sign, so America said this will not happen, then

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
India said yes, this will also not happen,

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
then we will not sign, then CTBT came by

201
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,639
completely changing NAPT, even then India did

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
not sign, if India had signed NPT and

203
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,599
CTBT, friends, India would have been in trouble.

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
Our situation would have become very bad,

205
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,680
very bad, the

206
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
leadership of that time was right, Indira Gandhi had

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
said that we will not sign,

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,479
so we would again become a nuclear nation, so

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,599
Iran has signed the NPT.  Now the

210
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,680
IAEA looks at it.  Ok?  That everything is

211
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,560
going well, right?  Everyone is following NPT,

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
right?  It is not like anyone is

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
buying nuclear weapons.  Iran is not following at all.

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
Iran is never following.

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,440
Not following since 1979.

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
Abdul Qadeer Khan was a scientist from Pakistan

217
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
who stole it.  Pakistan's

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,800
entire nuclear program is

219
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,879
stolen.  All this has been stolen from Europe.

220
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
So after that Pakistan set up a shop saying that

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,520
brother, whoever wants to

222
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,320
learn how to make nuclear bomb, we have stolen

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
goods.  This is how you steal those papers, not the papers.

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,760
After that sell the paper for money.

225
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,680
So America and Pakistan did this, thinking that

226
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
money will come and we will sell it.  So

227
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,120
Iran bought all the

228
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
blueprints that show me brother how a

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
nuclear program is made and after that

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Iran started making it and since then till

231
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
now it has been making it.  It's been 20 years now.  It's been

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
20 years now.  He said that they are

233
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,200
not following NPT at all.  So it wo

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
n't work like this.  Brother IAE, this

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
is an agency.  The countries themselves have to take action.

236
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
Then as soon as this report came out,

237
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,360
Israel's mood got spoiled.  He said, Oh my

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,600
god.  He will have to play the game.

239
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
This one will have to be brought on line.  This

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
cannot happen.  He is carrying out secret nuclear

241
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,000
activities.  And friends, let us assume

242
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,000
that Iran has probably almost

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
made a nuclear bomb.  Ok?  It

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
just takes some time to assemble.  But by then Israel

245
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
came into the picture.  Now, America is

246
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
talking to Iran.  And Israel

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,399
said that nothing will be achieved through talks, my

248
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,920
brother.  Kill them.  So now UK, France,

249
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,720
Germany all of them said that brother we will

250
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
impose sensation again.  Look at JCPOA,

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
Donald Trump came in 2016 and said

252
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
make light of JCPOA.  Ok?  But the rest of the

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
European nations that were involved did

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,640
not impose sanctions on Iran.

255
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,519
He said that no matter what Donald Trump says,

256
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,080
we agree on this treaty.  But now

257
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,480
all these countries are saying that no, we will

258
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
cancel it.  We will cancel it.

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
If Iran is not listening to us

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,800
then maybe Donald Trump was right.  They are actually

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,680
making nuclear weapons.  Ok.

262
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
Iran said, listen, first of all we will withdraw from NPT.

263
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
Iran because

264
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
how did Iran gain so much confidence?  Because

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
he already has a nuclear bomb.  He has done

266
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,440
uranium enrichment.  And he

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,480
said that first we will withdraw from NPT

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,800
and after that we will start enriching our uranium

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
stock pile that we have.  We are

270
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
doing it, we will do it.  Is it

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,399
okay?  Then he said, friend this is

272
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
very wrong.  And Iran said that this

273
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,760
resolution of IAAEA is politically

274
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,320
motivated.  This is all nonsense.  This Europe is

275
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
trying to tie our hands.

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,720
Then came America and America.  America

277
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
said to Iran son, it's okay, okay, don't get

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
angry, don't get angry, come, come

279
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,120
sit with me, okay, so in April America and

280
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,040
Iran started talks, now after that the

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
main motive was that Iran should

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,760
not be able to get nuclear weapons, and at the same time,

283
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
oil was also the biggest motive because you can assume

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
that America always

285
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,880
comes after resources, it does not get anything or the other

286
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,279
but it is always

287
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,720
greedy for resources, so now what

288
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,040
happened was that enrichment uranium, this was the biggest

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
deadlock that Iran was saying that brother, we will do

290
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,399
enrichment of uranium.  America

291
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,640
said that it is okay, you have it, everyone has to go for

292
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
nuclear energy.  Today,

293
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,959
90% of France's energy and electricity is

294
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
produced from nuclear power.  90% of our production is done using coal.

295
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,880
So everyone has nuclear

296
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,440
clean energy.  So you are the one who

297
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,360
creates nuclear energy.  But we will

298
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
not let you do enrichment.  No no no no no

299
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,519
what is this?  You should take only as much uranium

300
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,680
as you need.

301
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,680
What more enrichment do you need to do than that?  Iran did

302
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
not agree to this.  Iran and America said, are

303
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
you our father that you are dictating to us,

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
get out very quickly.  America

305
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,399
wanted to form a regional consortium and Iran

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,800
said that we will not accept it.  Iran

307
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
said, hey brother, look what your problem is

308
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,360
?  Iran is fine in this, friend.  Iran

309
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,399
is not that much at fault.  Iran said you

310
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,160
come.  There is transparency.  Everything is there.  You

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,640
come.  See for yourself.  We are calling you friend.

312
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,480
What do you want?  America said no, this

313
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,120
is unacceptable.  You are calling us.

314
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
After that if you do all this secretly then

315
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,640
we will not believe it.  Now after that Israel

316
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
says hey friend stop the talks, enough of the

317
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,399
respect, Israel has blown it away.  Israel

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
said wait friend I am coming.  You guys just

319
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,680
keep talking.  We will have to take direct action.

320
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,720
Today Israel attacked.

321
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,720
So now brother, there is a new war, a very

322
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,680
strong attack has happened on Iran.  This

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,480
is not a small attack, friends.  He killed the head of their Revolutionary Guard.  Is it

324
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,519
okay?  Hussein Salami.   At

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,560
the same time, if their nuclear sites are

326
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,440
destroyed, then Iran will obviously

327
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,920
take revenge and that is why it has imposed an emergency.

328
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
Now retaliation will definitely happen and America

329
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
may also be attacked.  American

330
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
military installations may be attacked.

331
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,240
America has bases all over the world,

332
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
therefore it had already started evacuating

333
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
its people.  You are

334
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
saying the same thing that America is

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,920
not involved.  How do you know if you're not involved

336
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
?  They know everything,

337
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,079
friends.  They have proper involvement

338
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,399
because this deal was going to fail.  It

339
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,800
is definitely failing.  It was America that had

340
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,240
stopped Israel from doing this until some results were seen.

341
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,760
But in the third talk

342
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,440
itself America realised that Iran was

343
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,120
not going to agree.  Then he would have

344
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
given a free hand to Israel.  Now this thing will

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
not come out.  So Donald Trump

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,880
said that we do not support Israel in such a way

347
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,720
that we can destroy Iran's facilities.  So

348
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
Donald Trump is saying

349
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
that we never supported Israel.

350
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
But Israel is saying no,

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,880
we will kill.  Well, as we

352
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,040
said, there is a lot of domestic instability

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,279
in Israel.  Benjamin Netanya's government is about to

354
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,200
go.  Many allegations are being made against Benjamin Netanyahu

355
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,959
and it is also being said

356
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,279
that perhaps the European countries will

357
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,519

358
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,600
impose sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu or the Israeli leaders and this will happen for the first time,

359
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,720
friends, that the way you are

360
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,760
carrying out genocide in Gaza will not be tolerated.

361
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,399
This is the thing.  So now the biggest thing is

362
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,920
this State Profession

363
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,240
Prevention Act 1978 of the United Nations.  What happens in this is that

364
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,560
if Iran does not agree, then

365
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Iran will not get any concession and

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
if Iran agrees, then its condition will become worse.

367
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,040
Anyway, Iran does not

368
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
get many concessions.  But then the

369
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,120
discussion will also touch upon Iran's friends.   Is it

370
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,279
okay?  So that is it now but the biggest

371
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,880
thing is that the attack has happened.  All these

372
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,959
things have no meaning because now

373
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
Israel has taken direct action.

374
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
Now the result of this will be that there will be a big war

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,959
in West Asia, friends, because

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
Iran will not sit quiet.  And now let's see

377
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
what happens next.  I will

378
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
let you know if there are any updates.  A

379
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,279
link to Dark Psychology is given in the description comment box.  today

380
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,279
is the last day.
