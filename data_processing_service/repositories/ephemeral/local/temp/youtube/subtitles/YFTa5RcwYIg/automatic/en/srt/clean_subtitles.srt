I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihot. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, the war has begun.  This is a very big war because now we can assume that Iran will declare a full on war. This is a lot because if you look at it, there was a lot of tension for the last two-three months.  There has been tension since April. And now she has reached her climax today. Which strikes have been carried out by Israel. We will talk about Iran tax, we will talk very thoroughly, in a way we will see what is the scenario, what is happening, what are the problems, and what has been the problem historically, and what is the actual agenda, but friends, today is the last day to avail the Dark Psychology course, if we turn off the positive coupon code today, then this course will become expensive, it will cost â‚¹1000, then the sale will come after two-three months, so you go to the description comment box and avail the course, Psychologist, Dr Mayurika Das has told how you can avoid being manipulated?  So look, this article is from Indian Express and it is a bit old.  This is the article from the day before yesterday and the attack happened yesterday.  What has happened is that Israel has bombed what is now Iran.  Now you assume that Israel has destroyed Iran's nuclear sites. Killed the nuclear scientist.  Their chief was killed. What a huge escalation this is.  Iran will stop. Iran will wreak havoc.  Do n't try to understand Iran by weakening it.  Iran is not weak. Iran is powerful.  He has placed his proxies. That would leave the proxies behind. He himself will launch a missile attack and a lot of things can happen, friends.  But this apprehension was already being anticipated.  Here America and Iran are sitting and playing nuclear war.  Isn't it?  Or should I not listen to your conditions?  Iran is saying no, we will not accept your conditions. Go.  Ok?  So there is a fight going on between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law. And here my father-in-law played the game.  So Israel should come. He said go away and keep all this aside. Now look, it is not that America does not know.  America knew these talks were failing.  Friends what is talk? These talks were going on since April.  Donald Trump was going to hold this sixth meeting.  He was saying that look, we will create a regional consulate for your nuclear program. Isn't it?  You, these sensations of yours, we will remove them.  Ok?  Whatever we have told you, we will also engage with you. But you will have to stop your nuclear program. Iran isn't killing for this. Iran is saying no and it is uranium enrichment.  Let's churn out the uranium.  Is it okay ?  And if it goes above 90% then you will be able to make a nuclear bomb.  Now centrifuges are used for this.  Isn't it? These are very big churners.  Isn't it? Butter is extracted by churning the milk whey.  So you should understand something like that.  Ok?  So now Israel has attacked the centrifuge here.  So this Iran is saying that no no brother, your conditions are not right. We cannot destroy our nukes. We assure you that we will use our nuclear program for the right purpose.  Peaceful but it is not like that.  He is continuously making nuclear bombs. Well, America fears it.  So somewhere these talks were failing.  Both of them were not agreeing.  And what happened to it?  The result was that Israel attacked.  Well what did America do?  America had started deploying its troops from the Middle East.  And here the official statement from Donald Trump came that this is a very dangerous place, Middle East West Asia, which means a very big war is about to happen. Now we all know that there is a battle for leadership in West Asia.  Iran says we are first, Saudi Arabia says we are first and Turkey says we are first.  These three countries fight for supremacy and wage indirect war against each other.  Is it okay?  Now this is what has happened here.  Now friends, this is a big point of escalation.  America has issued travel advisory for Iraq, Israel and everywhere. Look, the main thing here is oil.  Actually, before 1979, Iran was the younger brother of America.  Iran did whatever America said. But in 1979 when the revolution comes, Ayatollah Khomeini comes. Things changed after that.  And immediately after that, the Iran-Iraq war started which lasted for 10 years from 1979 to 1989, and let me tell you that parallelly, at this time, 1979 is such a year where a lot of things happened, the country changed completely, there was a coup, war is happening in India, problem brother, the same 1979 was a turning point because of which all the terrorist groups that you see in India today, were all formed at that time, there the Soviets and Afghans were fighting, so a lot of things happened due to which Iran became known as America, but after that things changed and oil was discovered.  Now when the oil was discovered, America wanted it to be given to us because it was afraid that Iran would form a consortium with Russia and China.  If he creates a grouping then we are done for. So this is why Barack Obama started engagement with Iran.  He asked if he would sit.  Okay, you sell the oil to us. First he said that we are finalizing your nuclear deal. Whatever nuclear power you have, use it to convert it into peaceful energy and electricity. We don't have any problem.  Don't make weapons. We will help you.  But later the condition was also put that your oil is ours.  Iran understood this.  So Iran said no no Eena Chaolbe.  Now after that when Donald Trump comes then it is a big game.  Even now if you look, it is a game only for oil. Because both America and Israel know that oil and gas will decide the future. This will decide the energy.  Is it okay ?  Iran is not agreeing to this and that is why America is upset. Well, now America neither got oil nor gas.  On top of that, Iran is already engaging with Russia and China. Then what option is left for them, to attack Iran and attack it so much that everyone is destroyed.  These accounts.  So American President Donald Trump told Israeli PM Netan Yahoo several times about Gaza war.  Now see, the government of those leaders who are doing this is also going to go. Netan Yu Benjamin Neta Yu Bhaiya, it's okay you kill, we are not saying that Hamas should be destroyed but why are you killing the people, Bhaiya, in Gaza a packet of Parleg biscuits costs 2 thousand rupees, that is a lot, here the hospital is being attacked and Israel is not stopping at all, America has even told Methan Yu here but Israel is not listening to anyone.  Israel is lying dead and nuclear negotiations between America and Iran are going on.  The sixth round is yet to be held in Muscat.  The talks have happened five times. But it did not yield any results.  The trigger was that America felt Israel had clashed with America as well.  But friends, I think that this is just an obvious thing.  But behind the scenes America is saying, kill, kill, kill Israel, it does not matter.  We have placed our shoulder on your shoulder.  You finish it. Hit Iran.  At least that is what it seems behind the scenes.  So the nuclear talks between America and Iran have intensified here.  After that, International Atomic, I am sorry, International Atomic Energy Agency, AIAEA, passed a resolution.  Just now he said that Iran knows NPT, Non Preferential Treaty.  What is this?  In 1969, my father-in-law brought a treaty.  America and all the others had said that the nuclear bomb will remain with only five of our permanent members, which includes America, UK, Russia, France, China, all the others should leave at the earliest opportunity, sign these papers, sign them and after that we should get this paper by tomorrow that you people will not make nuclear bombs, everyone signed it, Iran also signed it because Iran was called America at that time, now India said, now get out of here, brother, hey, I said, what is this rudeness, what is this rudeness, is it discriminatory or highly discriminatory, America said, why does it seem discriminatory brother, that is why it is discriminatory because what you are doing with us, first destroy your own nuclear weapons, then only we will sign, so America said this will not happen, then India said yes, this will also not happen, then we will not sign, then CTBT came by completely changing NAPT, even then India did not sign, if India had signed NPT and CTBT, friends, India would have been in trouble. Our situation would have become very bad, very bad, the leadership of that time was right, Indira Gandhi had said that we will not sign, so we would again become a nuclear nation, so Iran has signed the NPT.  Now the IAEA looks at it.  Ok?  That everything is going well, right?  Everyone is following NPT, right?  It is not like anyone is buying nuclear weapons.  Iran is not following at all. Iran is never following. Not following since 1979. Abdul Qadeer Khan was a scientist from Pakistan who stole it.  Pakistan's entire nuclear program is stolen.  All this has been stolen from Europe. So after that Pakistan set up a shop saying that brother, whoever wants to learn how to make nuclear bomb, we have stolen goods.  This is how you steal those papers, not the papers. After that sell the paper for money. So America and Pakistan did this, thinking that money will come and we will sell it.  So Iran bought all the blueprints that show me brother how a nuclear program is made and after that Iran started making it and since then till now it has been making it.  It's been 20 years now.  It's been 20 years now.  He said that they are not following NPT at all.  So it wo n't work like this.  Brother IAE, this is an agency.  The countries themselves have to take action. Then as soon as this report came out, Israel's mood got spoiled.  He said, Oh my god.  He will have to play the game. This one will have to be brought on line.  This cannot happen.  He is carrying out secret nuclear activities.  And friends, let us assume that Iran has probably almost made a nuclear bomb.  Ok?  It just takes some time to assemble.  But by then Israel came into the picture.  Now, America is talking to Iran.  And Israel said that nothing will be achieved through talks, my brother.  Kill them.  So now UK, France, Germany all of them said that brother we will impose sensation again.  Look at JCPOA, Donald Trump came in 2016 and said make light of JCPOA.  Ok?  But the rest of the European nations that were involved did not impose sanctions on Iran. He said that no matter what Donald Trump says, we agree on this treaty.  But now all these countries are saying that no, we will cancel it.  We will cancel it. If Iran is not listening to us then maybe Donald Trump was right.  They are actually making nuclear weapons.  Ok. Iran said, listen, first of all we will withdraw from NPT. Iran because how did Iran gain so much confidence?  Because he already has a nuclear bomb.  He has done uranium enrichment.  And he said that first we will withdraw from NPT and after that we will start enriching our uranium stock pile that we have.  We are doing it, we will do it.  Is it okay?  Then he said, friend this is very wrong.  And Iran said that this resolution of IAAEA is politically motivated.  This is all nonsense.  This Europe is trying to tie our hands. Then came America and America.  America said to Iran son, it's okay, okay, don't get angry, don't get angry, come, come sit with me, okay, so in April America and Iran started talks, now after that the main motive was that Iran should not be able to get nuclear weapons, and at the same time, oil was also the biggest motive because you can assume that America always comes after resources, it does not get anything or the other but it is always greedy for resources, so now what happened was that enrichment uranium, this was the biggest deadlock that Iran was saying that brother, we will do enrichment of uranium.  America said that it is okay, you have it, everyone has to go for nuclear energy.  Today, 90% of France's energy and electricity is produced from nuclear power.  90% of our production is done using coal. So everyone has nuclear clean energy.  So you are the one who creates nuclear energy.  But we will not let you do enrichment.  No no no no no what is this?  You should take only as much uranium as you need. What more enrichment do you need to do than that?  Iran did not agree to this.  Iran and America said, are you our father that you are dictating to us, get out very quickly.  America wanted to form a regional consortium and Iran said that we will not accept it.  Iran said, hey brother, look what your problem is ?  Iran is fine in this, friend.  Iran is not that much at fault.  Iran said you come.  There is transparency.  Everything is there.  You come.  See for yourself.  We are calling you friend. What do you want?  America said no, this is unacceptable.  You are calling us. After that if you do all this secretly then we will not believe it.  Now after that Israel says hey friend stop the talks, enough of the respect, Israel has blown it away.  Israel said wait friend I am coming.  You guys just keep talking.  We will have to take direct action. Today Israel attacked. So now brother, there is a new war, a very strong attack has happened on Iran.  This is not a small attack, friends.  He killed the head of their Revolutionary Guard.  Is it okay?  Hussein Salami.   At the same time, if their nuclear sites are destroyed, then Iran will obviously take revenge and that is why it has imposed an emergency. Now retaliation will definitely happen and America may also be attacked.  American military installations may be attacked. America has bases all over the world, therefore it had already started evacuating its people.  You are saying the same thing that America is not involved.  How do you know if you're not involved ?  They know everything, friends.  They have proper involvement because this deal was going to fail.  It is definitely failing.  It was America that had stopped Israel from doing this until some results were seen. But in the third talk itself America realised that Iran was not going to agree.  Then he would have given a free hand to Israel.  Now this thing will not come out.  So Donald Trump said that we do not support Israel in such a way that we can destroy Iran's facilities.  So Donald Trump is saying that we never supported Israel. But Israel is saying no, we will kill.  Well, as we said, there is a lot of domestic instability in Israel.  Benjamin Netanya's government is about to go.  Many allegations are being made against Benjamin Netanyahu and it is also being said that perhaps the European countries will impose sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu or the Israeli leaders and this will happen for the first time, friends, that the way you are carrying out genocide in Gaza will not be tolerated. This is the thing.  So now the biggest thing is this State Profession Prevention Act 1978 of the United Nations.  What happens in this is that if Iran does not agree, then Iran will not get any concession and if Iran agrees, then its condition will become worse. Anyway, Iran does not get many concessions.  But then the discussion will also touch upon Iran's friends.   Is it okay?  So that is it now but the biggest thing is that the attack has happened.  All these things have no meaning because now Israel has taken direct action. Now the result of this will be that there will be a big war in West Asia, friends, because Iran will not sit quiet.  And now let's see what happens next.  I will let you know if there are any updates.  A link to Dark Psychology is given in the description comment box.  today is the last day.
