And that too against whom?  Against our own President Donald Trump.  A lot is happening.  You might have noticed that the news came here that the US Marines, and see, the deployment of US Marines takes place in very tough conditions.  It rarely happens. Trump has deployed US Marines inside Los Angeles, California.  You can see this news.  US Marines Arrive in Los Angeles.  California Governor Wants Democracy Under Assault.  So let us understand this in a little detail as to what is happening right now and at the same time I will also tell you about the US Marines as to why the Governor here is opposing it.  There is a lot to know.  But before that let me tell you friends, those of you who are preparing for UPSC 2026.  Please avail of our Foundation Pratigya Batch.

First let's see what exactly has just happened.  Look, where were the US Marines deployed?  You can see this if you go to the western side of America, then there is a very important state here, California and there are many important cities here.  You all know that Los Angeles is its capital. Also San Francisco happened. You may have heard of Oakland.  So here it is being told that US Marines were deployed especially in Los Angeles. And why?  Because there are huge protests happening here because Donald Trump has cracked down on immigration.  Those undocumented immigrants who are living illegally in those areas, an attempt is being made to arrest them.  In view of this, the Governor of California has warned that democracy is under assault.  Well, let's look at its background as news about it has been coming continuously for the past four-five days. Basically, what is happening is that in different urban areas of California like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, a large number of arrests are taking place. Actually, if you look at California, you will find that the federalism of America is quite strong.   The state has many rights of its own. So the state of California has made its own law here in which it cannot cooperate with the federal government.  I mean, for example, if I say in India, Maharashtra has made its own separate law and said that we will not listen to the Centre. So you will see this kind of situation in California, US.  And the civil society groups, immigrant rights organisations, local residents started protesting that human rights were being violated. Donald Trump is getting people arrested wrongly.  And the result of this was that you could see roads blocked during the protests, vandalism of federal buildings, clashes between protesters and law enforcement.  Think about these kinds of scenes. This kind of scene was seen inside Los Angeles.  And while looking at this I saw that Elon Musk had also tweeted.  He said that this is not good, whatever is happening here at this time, and in view of this, finally Donald Trump first deployed the National Guard and also said that if things do not get under control then I will also deploy US Marines, and in view of this, finally Donald Trump approved it and it is being said that around 700 US Marines have reached here in Los Angeles. Well here one important thing you need to understand is that there are many laws which restrict when and what kind of deployment you can do.  For example, this is the law of 1878.  It is said that you can deploy US military only at a few places.  You can do it in some particular conditions. For example, the deployment of US Marines, in most cases, you do it outside the US.  Meaning, if you want to stop something in another country then you deploy US Marines. But when you deploy it in America itself against the American people, then this can happen only under two conditions. Either the Insurrection Act or if you declare a national emergency. What is this Insurrection Act?  Basically this law says that the situation has become so uncontrolled in that area where it is almost impossible to handle it.  In that case you can deploy US Marines.  The critics are saying that yes, the situation in Los Angeles has worsened, but it is not such that you can say that it has gone out of control.  It's gone out of hand. The Los Angeles Police Department is known as LAPD.  So they say, look, we are capable.  We can handle things.  You do n't need to deploy US Marines.  This will make the matter worse.  I will tell you more about it because there is a lot of interesting stuff happening inside it.  Well, apart from this there is also federalism and states' rights.  The federalism of the US, as I told you, is very strong. California says it is our sovereign right to mind our own internal affairs. Donald Trump doesnâ€™t need the attention. And the military presence that is being deliberately created is snatching away the autonomy of the state.  And the 10th amendment of the Constitution is being violated.  And because of this, the response from the Governor of California was to say that this is not just an overreach, it is a direct assault on democracy.  And he raised several concerns here.  For example, you are trying to stop political dissent, a violation of the states' rights legal jurisdiction, through militarization. Democratic institutions are facing a major threat because of this and he said that we will take legal action.  Will go to the Supreme Court of America so that can file a case against Donald Trump's government. We will also take majors ourselves so that we do not cooperate with you. So you understand that you will be seeing this war directly between California and Trump. But the important thing here is that the Los Angeles Police Department's main job is to improve law and order.  Why did he oppose it? This move has been made by Donald Trump to deploy US Marines.  Let me tell you why this is against him.  First of all what is this US Marines?  You please understand. Basically this is a branch of the US Armed Forces. Basically, the US Marine is a component of the US Navy.  And it was first established in 1775.   It is very old and its soldiers are trained for land and sea operations.  Particularly in effective warfare, like when you launch an attack on land from a ship etc., these people are trained for that and any citizen legal resident of the US who is between 17 to 28 years of age and has a high school diploma can join this, which means it is obvious that they have to give various strength tests etc., there is a long training and only then you get deployed and if you see at present, there are about 1772 Marine personnel on active duty in the US and 33,000 reserve personnel, that is, as per the records of 2023.  Well, why is the Los Angeles Police Department against the deployment of US Marines? So look here, the police chief of Los Angeles says that look, we are capable enough to handle the situation.  He said the possible arrival of federal military forces in Los Angeles absent clear coordination.  If US Marines are coming to our place and trying to control things here, then there is no coordination between us and them. We were not even informed about the fact that US Marines are coming here, but they are being sent forcefully due to which the situation may escalate further and get worse. He gave an example here, he reminded us of 1992, like in 1992 also US Marines were deployed and there was no proper coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department and at that time an incident came to light when the police said cover up or cover me and a police personnel said, now see what happens, for police personnel cover me means that you protect me, that is, keep the gun pointed, if you see any problem or situation then you should fire, do not fire now, this is in police language, but in US Marines language cover me means start firing immediately, so this is what happened there in 1992 the police said cover me and the US Marines here felt that they had to start firing. 200 bullets fired instantly at once.  So the situation had become very bad. You can see that at that time 63 people had died.  So because of this, the Los Angeles Police Department said that this deployment of US Marines is not right.  Because of this the situation will become worse.  And in fact let me tell you that the police also say that we are handling the situation. Mass arrests were made.  In fact, if you see, curfew was imposed during night time, despite which the protesters were not leaving.  They were creating problems. Looking at this you can see that more than 370 of your people have been arrested.  Arrests have taken place here on a mass level. Well overall the question now is what is its broader implication? What is its impact?  The first is on US federalism.  This is a dangerous president set by the Central Government.  The autonomy of the state authority is being overseen.  And in the future, it is possible that military forces may be used in this manner. Look, if you look at federalism in a country like India, there is more tilt towards the centre. Here, if the Central Government is a little stronger then it can do any type of deployment anywhere.  But within the US, as I said, it is a pure federal country.  Federalism adopts it.  The state government has a lot of power there.  In fact, the mayor of the city has a lot of power.  So because of this there is a lot of discussion about federalism here.  Then the second one is democracy.  Meaning, if you are deploying US Marines, that too for civil protest, then it shows that civil liberties are being ended in America.  The dissents here are being deliberately intimated.  The governance authoritarian regime is adopting such tactics.  And when it comes to immigration policy, look at the political and cultural divide that you see between California and the Trump administration. And because of this, its impact can be felt in many surrounding states.  In fact, there is even talk about whether California and some other states like it can demand their independence. This type of discussion has also started now. So let's see what happens regarding this. But definitely whatever is happening here is happening inside America.  It's not a good situation.  And before leaving, friends, I have a very interesting question.  Can you tell which of these countries is known for adopting the concept of direct democracy?
