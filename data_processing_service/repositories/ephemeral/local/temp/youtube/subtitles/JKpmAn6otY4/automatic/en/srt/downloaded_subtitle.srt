Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, the

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
crisis inside America is deepening.  The

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,679
Governor of the State of California has

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,240
warned that democracy is under

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,160
assault.  And that too against whom?  Against our own

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,920
President Donald Trump.  A lot is

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,080
happening.  You might have noticed that the

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,800
news came here that the US Marines, and see, the

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
deployment of US Marines takes place in very tough

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,119
conditions.  It rarely happens.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
Trump has deployed US Marines

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,760
inside Los Angeles, California.  You

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,079
can see this news.  US Marines Arrive in Los

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,239
Angeles.  California Governor Wants

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
Democracy Under Assault.  So let us

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,320
understand this in a little detail as to what is happening right now

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
and at the same time I will also tell you about the US Marines as to

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
why the

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,600
Governor here is opposing it.  There is a lot to

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
know.  But before that let me tell you

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,280
First let's see what exactly has just

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
happened.  Look, where were the US Marines

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,360
deployed?  You can see this

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,880
if you go to the western side of America, then there

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
is a very important state here, California and there are many

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
important cities here.  You

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
all know that Los Angeles is its capital.

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
Also San Francisco happened.

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,600
You may have heard of Oakland.  So here it is being

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
told that

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
US Marines were deployed especially in Los Angeles.

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,159
And why?  Because there are huge

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
protests happening here because

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
Donald Trump has

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
cracked down on immigration.  Those

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,799
undocumented immigrants who are

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
living illegally in those areas,

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,240
an attempt is being made to arrest them.  In

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
view of this, the

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,079
Governor of California has

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
warned that democracy is under

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,079
assault.  Well, let's look at its background

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
as news about it has been coming continuously for the past four-five days.

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,240

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
Basically, what is happening is that in

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,960
different urban areas of California like Los

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, a

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,360
large number of arrests are taking place.

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Actually, if you look at California,

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
you will find that the federalism of America is quite strong.   The

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,000
state has many rights of its own.

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,800
So the state of California has made its own

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
law here in

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
which it cannot

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,560
cooperate with the federal government.  I mean, for

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,720
example, if I say in India, Maharashtra has made its

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
own separate law and

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,519
said that we will not listen to the Centre.

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,519
So you will see this kind of situation

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
in California, US.  And the

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
civil society groups, immigrant

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
rights organisations, local residents

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
started protesting

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
that human rights were being violated.

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,840
Donald Trump is getting people

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
arrested wrongly.  And the result of this was that

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
you could see roads blocked during the protests,

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
vandalism of federal buildings,

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
clashes between protesters and law

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,440
enforcement.  Think about these kinds of scenes.

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
This kind of scene was

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
seen inside Los Angeles.  And while looking at this

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,200
I saw that Elon Musk had

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
also tweeted.  He said that this is

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,239
not good, whatever is happening here at this time,

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
and in view of this, finally

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
Donald Trump first

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
deployed the National Guard and also said that

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
if things do not get under control then

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,040
I will also deploy US Marines,

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
and in view of this, finally Donald

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,239
Trump approved it and it is being said

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,800
that around 700 US Marines have

95
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,040
reached here in Los Angeles.

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,920
Well here one important thing you need to

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,640
understand is that there are many laws

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
which restrict when and what

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,040
kind of deployment you can do.  For

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,200
example, this is the law of 1878.  It is

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,319
said that

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,400
you can deploy US military only at a few places.  You

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,959
can do it in some particular conditions.

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,440
For example, the deployment of US Marines,

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840

106
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,080
in most cases, you do it outside the US.  Meaning, if you want to

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
stop something in another country

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
then you deploy US Marines.

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,239
But

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,799
when you deploy it in America itself against the American people, then

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,360
this can happen only under two conditions.

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
Either the Insurrection Act or if you

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,159
declare a national emergency.

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,120
What is this Insurrection Act?  Basically this law

115
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,120
says that the situation has become so uncontrolled

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,160
in that area where it is

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,479
almost impossible to handle it.  In that case

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
you can deploy US Marines.  The

119
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
critics are saying that

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
yes, the situation in Los Angeles has worsened,

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
but it is not such that you can say

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,280
that it has gone out of control.  It's gone out of hand.

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
The Los Angeles Police Department is

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,560
known as LAPD.  So they

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
say, look, we are capable.  We

126
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
can handle things.  You do

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
n't need to deploy US Marines.  This will make the

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
matter worse.  I will tell you more about it

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
because there is a lot of

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,280
interesting stuff happening inside it.  Well,

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,440
apart from this there is also federalism and states'

132
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
rights.  The federalism of the US, as

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
I told you, is very strong.

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
California says it is our sovereign right to

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
mind our own internal affairs.

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,680
Donald Trump doesn’t need the attention.

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
And the military presence that is being

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
deliberately created is

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
snatching away the autonomy of the state.  And the

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,240
10th amendment of the Constitution is being

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
violated.  And because of this, the

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
response from the Governor of California was to

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,440
say that this is not just an

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
overreach, it is a direct assault on

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
democracy.  And he

146
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,280
raised several concerns here.  For example,

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,600
you are trying to stop political dissent, a violation of the states' rights legal jurisdiction,

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,120
through militarization.

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
Democratic

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
institutions are facing a major threat

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,400
because of this and he said that we will

153
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960
take legal action.  Will go to the Supreme Court of

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,360
America so that can file a case against Donald Trump's government.

155
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
We will also take majors ourselves

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
so that we do not cooperate with you.

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,320
So you understand that

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,320
you will be seeing this war directly between California and Trump.

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
But the important

160
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,880
thing here is that the Los Angeles

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
Police Department's main job is to

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
improve law and order.  Why did he

163
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
oppose it?

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
This move has been made by Donald Trump to

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
deploy US Marines.  Let

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
me tell you why this is against him.  First of all

167
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
what is this US Marines?  You please understand.

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,479
Basically this is a branch of the US Armed Forces.

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,039
Basically, the

170
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,520
US Marine is a component of the US Navy.  And it

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
was first established in 1775.   It is

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,240
very old and its soldiers are

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,440
trained for land and sea

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,840
operations.  Particularly in effective warfare,

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,639
like when

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
you launch an attack on land from a ship etc.,

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,639
these people are trained for that and any

178
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,199
citizen legal resident of the US who is between 17 to 28

179
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,919
years of age and has a high school diploma

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,720
can join this, which means it is obvious that

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,720
they have to give various strength tests etc., there is a

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
long training and only then

183
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,080
you get deployed and if you

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,720
see at present, there are about 1772

185
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,120
Marine personnel on active duty in the US and

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,280
33,000 reserve personnel, that is,

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,199
as per the records of 2023.  Well,

188
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
why is the Los Angeles Police Department

189
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,919
against the deployment of US Marines?

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,280
So look here, the police chief

191
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,400
of Los Angeles says that look, we are

192
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,280
capable enough to handle the situation.  He said

193
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,680
the possible arrival of federal military

194
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,639
forces in Los Angeles absent clear

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
coordination.  If US Marines are

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
coming to our place and trying to control things here, then there is

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,560

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
no coordination between us and them.

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,880
We were not even informed

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
about the fact that US Marines are

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
coming here, but they are being sent forcefully

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
due to which the situation

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
may escalate further and get worse. He

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
gave an example here, he

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,880
reminded us of 1992, like in 1992 also US

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
Marines were deployed and there was no

207
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,199
proper coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,319
and at that time

209
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,039
an incident came to light when the police said

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,280
cover up or cover me and

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,319
a police personnel said, now see what

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,160
happens, for police personnel cover me

213
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,960
means that you

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,520
protect me, that is, keep the gun pointed,

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,919
if you see any problem or

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
situation then you should fire, do not

217
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
fire now, this is in police language,

218
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
but in US Marines language cover me

219
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
means start firing immediately, so

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,960
this is what happened there

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
in 1992 the police said cover me and the

222
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,479
US Marines here felt that they had to start firing.

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
200 bullets

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
fired instantly at once.  So the situation had become very bad.

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,599
You can see that at that time 63 people had

226
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,519
died.  So because of this, the Los

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
Angeles Police Department said that

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
this deployment of US Marines is

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,080
not right.  Because of this the

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,760
situation will become worse.  And in

231
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
fact let me tell you that the police also

232
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
say that we are handling the situation.

233
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
Mass arrests were made.  In fact, if you

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
see, curfew was imposed during night time,

235
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
despite which the protesters were

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,200
not leaving.  They were creating problems.

237
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,480
Looking at this you can see that

238
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,800
more than 370 of your people have been

239
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
arrested.  Arrests have taken place here on a mass level.

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Well overall the question now is

241
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
what is its broader implication?

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
What is its impact?  The first is

243
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,720
on US federalism.  This is a dangerous

244
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,000
president set by the Central Government.  The

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,000
autonomy of the state authority is being

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
overseen.  And

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
in the future, it is possible that

248
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,720
military forces may be used in this manner.

249
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Look, if you look at federalism in a country like India, there is

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,279
more tilt towards the centre.

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Here, if the Central

252
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
Government is a little stronger

253
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,120
then it can do any type of

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
deployment anywhere.  But

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,279
within the US, as I said, it is a pure

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,519
federal country.  Federalism adopts it.  The

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,600
state government has a lot of

258
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
power there.  In fact, the mayor of the city has

259
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,160
a lot of power.  So

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,839
because of this there is

261
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,640
a lot of discussion about federalism here.  Then the second one is

262
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,480
democracy.  Meaning, if you are deploying US Marines,

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,800
that too for civil protest,

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,120
then it shows that civil liberties are being

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
ended in America.  The

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,320
dissents here are being deliberately intimated.  The

267
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,480
governance authoritarian

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,959
regime is

269
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,279
adopting such tactics.  And when it comes to immigration policy,

270
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,000
look at the political and cultural

271
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,519
divide that you see between California and the Trump

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
administration.

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,920
And because of this,

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,320
its impact can be felt in many surrounding states.  In

275
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,800
fact, there is even talk about

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,920
whether California and some other

277
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,839
states like it can demand their independence.

278
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,519
This type of discussion has also started now.

279
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,440
So let's see what happens regarding this.

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,880
But definitely whatever is happening here is happening

281
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
inside America.  It's not a good

282
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
situation.  And before leaving, friends, I have a very

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
interesting question.  Can you tell

284
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,240
which of these countries is

285
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
known for adopting the concept of

286
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
direct democracy? Which country would you say has

287
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640
adopted direct democracy

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,079
?  You all know its right answer.   You will

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,839
