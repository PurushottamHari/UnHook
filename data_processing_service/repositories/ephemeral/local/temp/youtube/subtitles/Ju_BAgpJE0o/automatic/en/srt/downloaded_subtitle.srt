1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,960
They say that lower beings get attracted

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,880
to places where you're having

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,719
conversations about them. If you light a

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,559
candle, then you're going to draw things

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,480
to

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,520
it. I've heard there is a certain

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,640
Indonesian tribe that is an expert in

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
trapping lower beings into physical

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
bottles. And there's a lot of

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,640
millionaires all over Asia travel to

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
Indonesia to purchase these lower

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,160
beings. Yeah. is an extremely powerful

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,040
thing that anyone can do. You're handing

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,399
someone who isn't trained a load of gun.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,399
What's the purpose of calling them?

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
You're tasking them to carry out

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,399
something that you can't do. People who

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,320
are drawn to this kind of work risks,

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,120
misfortunes, accidents, things breaking.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
It goes terribly wrong.

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960
You know what Ouija boards are? Yeah. If

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
you're calling a spirit so that you can

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,879
be really Yeah.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,359
The Nazi symbol is an inverted swastika.

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,280
The one we use in Sanatanhan is one of

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
the most divine symbols. A lot of people

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,560
in India think Adolf Hitler knew this

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
and twisted it to cause that level of

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
death and suffering in the world. I

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,400
agree with you. The Nazi regime is

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,920
worshiping in return for

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,159
material. I've been chased out of the

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
woods at night by spirits. You could

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
visually see them. Yeah. Most of the

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,880
time that you're seeing the spirits,

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,680
they'll be materializing in things like

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,840
smoke. Seeing something visually is very

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
jolting. It's very difficult to do. I

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,400
think it's very difficult for them to do

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,400
and sustain

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,759
them. Horror returns on TRS. This is one

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
of our scariest episodes of the year.

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
You're going to enjoy this one. And if

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,640
you enjoy all our horror episodes, I do

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
recommend that you check out the prequel

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,399
to this episode. It was our first

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,880
conversation that we recorded with Peter

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
Gray. You'll gain a lot of context for

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
the sake of this one. But if you're just

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
here for the thrill, this is a pretty

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
mind-bending episode. I'm not going to

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,040
say too much. Peter Gay returns on the

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,040
Remi Show once again.

54
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,580
[Music]

55
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,620
[Applause]

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,760
back with Peter Gray for episode two.

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
Um, thank you for visiting my life.

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
That's what I want to begin with. That's

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
great. It's it's it's wonderful to talk

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
with you around. How are you, Peter?

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,000
Really good. Really good. You all right?

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,239
Yeah. Okay. uh bow down to Babylon at

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,319
the beginning of this episode and then

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,440
we'll begin. That's great. Okay. Have

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,000
you conveyed my respect to her? Yes.

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay. Okay. You think she wanted this

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
episode to happen? Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,640
There is an element of her bringing us

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,080
together. Yeah. In my eyes, it's just

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,400
Shaki, which is uh the overall divine

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
feminine. Yeah. I I think that's a great

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
way to think about it, right? Because

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,760
the khalima I pray to also arises from

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,280
the shi in the same way that the Babylon

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,800
that you pray to arises from because

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
there at the end of the day there's only

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,560
one piece of divine femininity. Yeah.

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Fair to say. Perfect. Okay. Where do we

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
even begin this particular conversation?

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,879
You tell me. Is there something that we

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,599
missed out on in the last conversation

82
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,760
that you'd like to bring up?

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,239
No. I'm I think you're doing a a perfect

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
job. So, wherever you'd like to go. Do

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
you want to begin by talking about lower

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
beings a little bit? Because in our

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
world they say that when you actually

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,000
begin your practice, you do attract the

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,519
attention of lower beings. Uh because

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,959
what you're doing in terms of your

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,280
tantra rituals and your puja releases a

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,439
lot of energy in that physical space.

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,319
And where there is a release of energy,

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,920
lower beings also get attracted. Lower

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,560
beings also get attracted to places

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,120
where you're having conversations about

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,560
them. So firstly uh you guys do your

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,879
thing guys. Uh I know that these

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680
conversations attract these entities.

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,280
What I want to tell the viewers is with

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,919
the power of the divine you'll always be

102
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,759
protected. So just believe in the power

103
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,600
that the divine contains. Peter I

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
completely agree with you. We have we

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,560
have the same thing in our tradition

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,280
like if you if you light a candle then

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,320
you're going to draw things to it and

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,720
it's about whether you are able to move

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,000
those things forward or whether they

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
become a problem and you become

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,360
parasited for example by these kind of

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
lower entities. So the understanding of

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
lower entities is there and that's why

114
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,280
anyone who's engaged in the serious

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,720
practice of western magic needs to pay

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,080
very close attention to their spiritual

117
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,479
hygiene. So that means performing those

118
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,880
practices and rituals which prevent

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,360
those things getting getting stuck to

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,080
you. So, um, very simple things like

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,400
living in a clean space, keeping all of

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,880
your all of your materials in your

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,080
household in a clean, calm,

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,960
um, positive like organized fashion, not

125
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,680
living a disorderly life because this

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,520
will tend to bring more disorder to you

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,840
and then engaging in some of the basic

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,680
rituals. So before we perform any ritual

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,919
in western magic, there is a process of

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,080
purification. Um particularly involving

131
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,720
the use of a ritual bath. So you will

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,800
bathe before you perform ritual. Um and

133
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,440
particularly using I use a lot of salt.

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
I use salt water a lot as a way of like

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,280
cleansing the energetic system and

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
keeping everything absolutely clean. Can

137
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
you use it every day? You can use that

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,680
every day. Yeah. I think a a a saltwater

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,840
bath and performing a a blessing over

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,560
over the waters before you enter the

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,800
waters is a is an extremely powerful

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
thing that anyone can do as a way of

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
just keeping themselves keeping

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
themselves clear and clean of these

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,440
entities.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,560
Um and then again when one is performing

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
a magical ritual uh a lot of the work

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,560
that we do if you're doing work within a

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,120
magical circle in a very high ceremonial

150
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,759
fashion you'll be doing a a banishing or

151
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,479
a purifying ritual before you even begin

152
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,000
to call in any of the entities that you

153
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,919
wish to have present with you. So the

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,160
process of doing this, of repeating this

155
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,360
over and over again, day in day out,

156
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
year in year out, you begin to create

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,680
barriers to negative forces or forces

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,360
you do not wish to attract coming in. um

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,759
and then using

160
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,479
discretion. So very often in western

161
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,080
magic if you're calling a spirit rather

162
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,120
than a deity there is a there are a

163
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,440
series of challenges that you issue to

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,280
the spirit so that you can be sure that

165
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,280
what you're talking to and what you're

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,080
working with is what you think it is and

167
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,280
not something else impersonating that

168
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,039
spirit. So we there are a whole range of

169
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,680
protocols that we use there.

170
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,759
Okay, lots of tangential questions. Um

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,240
starting with the magic circle. Is it

172
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,520
about the size of this carpet?

173
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,080
It can be any size based on how many

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,759
people you're working with, but um th

175
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,039
this would this would

176
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,720
suffice. It really depends on the amount

177
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,520
amount of room that you have. There

178
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
there are there are there are classical

179
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,479
ideas about how large it should be, but

180
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,759
in practice it really depends on it

181
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,440
really depends on the area that you're

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
working in. Now I'd assume that when

183
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
you're inviting a daty that's a very

184
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
difficult process that you probably have

185
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,599
to earn. Yeah. Right. And it perhaps

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,560
would take years to reach that point. Um

187
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,479
so you said that these circles are used

188
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,400
to call higher spirits. Um, you can use

189
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240
you'd normally use them for working with

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,840
like a range of spirits, whether they're

191
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,400
positive or whether they're hostile.

192
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,520
It's the same thing. You're you're

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,039
creating a a clean space within which

194
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,959
you can work, where you know the

195
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,000
energies are balanced and where you have

196
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,000
a clear idea that that where you are and

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,680
where the spirit is to prevent the

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,360
spirit um causing problems for you. But

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
what's the purpose of calling them?

200
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,640
What's the purpose of calling them? Um

201
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,040
well there are a range of things. Um

202
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
generally you're tasking them to carry

203
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,120
out something for you that you can't do.

204
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
So whether that's bringing you

205
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,279
intelligence, whether that's performing

206
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
a task, whether that's fetching you

207
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,920
something, the whole range of like

208
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,320
magical possibilities. Understood. Um

209
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,120
and you have to be sure that the spirit

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
you're calling is genuinely benevolent.

211
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,440
You have to be sure. It doesn't have to

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
be benevolent. Um, but you have to be

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
sure that it's the it is who you're

214
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
talking to. It's not just a a random

215
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
smaller spirit that's impersonating that

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,160
spirit. Do you have names of particular

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,160
spirits in mind when you're calling

218
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,680
them? Yes. Yeah. So, are these people

219
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,000
that have existed? So, we work with a a

220
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
range of spirit cataloges in the west

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,080
that are called grimoirs. A grimoire

222
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,040
comes from uh the word grammar. Um, and

223
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,640
it's these are books that contain lists

224
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,600
of spirits and the the symbol of the

225
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
spirit and also the magicians kind of

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
loose notes about what these spirits are

227
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,000
able to accomplish, what they're what

228
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
they're what they're able to do,

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,959
possibilities. Can you give some

230
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,320
examples of those uh tasks? Okay. So,

231
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,640
those tasks can be anything from um

232
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,000
bring me a book to get me a job to find

233
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,120
me a lover to like show me where

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,040
something is which is hidden. Um a whole

235
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,200
range of possibilities

236
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,120
and they're always able to perform those

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
tasks. Generally, they're able to

238
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
perform the tasks. If they're not, then

239
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,240
uh then you go back and you reassess

240
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
what what went wrong. Are you not able

241
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
to do this? Do you not have the power to

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
do this? Does the spirit not have the

243
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,640
ability to do this? Like you go back and

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
through and and and check these things.

245
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
It's quite a it's almost a scientific

246
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
method.

247
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,079
Okay. And again, you learned this

248
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
through books and people and this is

249
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
something you learn through books and

250
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,360
people. It's been 30 years that you've

251
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
been a practitioner, right? Okay. And

252
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
you're fairly confident in this process

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
at this point? Yeah, I'm confident in my

254
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,320
practices. Are you comfortable with me

255
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,480
asking you how often you're you engage

256
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,480
in this every year? How often I engage

257
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,279
in this? So I'll perform um so I'm doing

258
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,200
a series of rituals every day. Um so

259
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll do

260
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,360
um I'll do a small ritual in the

261
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,680
morning. I'll do um banishing ritual and

262
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
work with deities in the evening. I'll

263
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,920
do my meditation. I'll do a a range of

264
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,279
spiritual practices. a major evocation,

265
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,000
a major summoning of spirit. For me, I

266
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
tend to work maybe every three months,

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
I'll do a major spirit work for the sake

268
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,640
of some purpose. For the sake of a

269
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
purpose. Yeah. Is the purpose material?

270
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,920
Sometimes it can be material. Yeah.

271
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay. There's no um there's no moral

272
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,120
understanding that asking for something

273
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,920
material is bad. You know, this that's

274
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,000
not in a hierarchy. Okay.

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,839
Are there celebrities and people who are

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,160
materially extremely successful who've

277
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,560
used these methods to gain material

278
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,279
progress? I think it's very difficult to

279
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,920
tell. I think very unlikely. Very

280
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,720
unlikely. Very unlikely. Why? Why very

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,360
unlikely? It's difficult. Um yeah, it's

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,560
difficult. It's time consuming. It's a

283
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
set of particular specialist skills. Do

284
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,720
I do I think that people are achieving

285
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,880
things because of

286
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,000
spirits? Yes, I think that happens. But

287
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,120
I think it's more informal rather than

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,079
formal ritual work that gets those that

289
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,839
gets those results for

290
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,600
people. So you're one of the few people

291
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
in the world who knows how to do this in

292
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,519
an experienced manner. In my in my

293
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,160
experience and my understanding of

294
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,959
magicians located around the world,

295
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,639
there are very few individuals who are

296
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
doing

297
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,079
this. Very few individuals. There are

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
only ever a very few individuals who do

299
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,480
this level of work.

300
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,560
What does the trade-off feel? It's

301
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,920
dangerous. Um there are risks. There are

302
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,720
risks to your health. Um there are risks

303
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,959
to your

304
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,720
sanity. Um there are risks to your

305
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:14,959
reputation socially. There are

306
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,880
um there are risks to your spiritual

307
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,279
development. It's very easy to

308
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,839
be pulled off center when you're doing

309
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,839
this kind of work,

310
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,360
particularly as most of the work, most

311
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,839
of the magical work that's going on in

312
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,519
the west is being done by individuals or

313
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,639
small groups. This isn't being done

314
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,720
necessarily in a community in a larger

315
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,880
setting. So people who are drawn to this

316
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,920
kind of work are not always balanced

317
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,399
individuals. Some of these individuals

318
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,120
are crisis individuals. Some of them

319
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,720
will end up having mental health issues.

320
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Some of them will end up with drug

321
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,760
addiction. Some of them end up with like

322
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,760
a whole range of problems. Psychosis.

323
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Psychosis. Certainly.

324
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Pardon me for overly simplifying this,

325
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,920
but this seems like the beginning of a

326
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,120
potential horror movie for people who

327
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
don't know how to do the ritual

328
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,519
correctly. Yes, it certainly can be.

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,279
Right. Yeah. Exactly what we see in

330
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,959
horror movies can happen if you don't

331
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
know what you're doing. Yeah, I think

332
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,560
there are there are genuine risks for

333
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,240
performing these kinds of spiritual

334
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,839
operations. But will that process of

335
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,600
negative outcomes happen because of the

336
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,959
spirit being upset with how you've done

337
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,160
the process or just being malevolent? On

338
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,160
one level, we're food. like uh the way

339
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,639
that we react as you see with like a

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,199
horror movie as an example is that many

341
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,320
of these entities respond to human

342
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,120
emotions and fear is a very strong

343
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,079
emotion and you'll know that certain

344
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,000
spirits will try to provoke a fear

345
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,399
reaction in people in order to feed on

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,760
that energy. And so it's easy for people

347
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,480
to end up in a in a in a parasitic

348
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,760
relationship where the entity is taking

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,320
something from them without the terms

350
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,920
being negotiated effectively and from a

351
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,120
position of strength. But how will it

352
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,320
try to scare you? How it tries to scare

353
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,440
you? Any number of ways.

354
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,000
um simply simply appearing simply like

355
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
the the presence of a spirit is

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,880
something that people are so

357
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,000
unaccustomed to. They're so not used to

358
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,000
seeing the idea that there are entities

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,320
out there which are beyond them which

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,160
are not within human bodies that can

361
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,399
move through things that can speak

362
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
through things that can cause problems

363
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,320
and misfortunes.

364
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,800
These aren't ideas that are common in

365
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,800
the west. People have forgotten a lot of

366
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
this. They they've forgotten that they

367
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,519
live in a world filled with spirits. And

368
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,399
when they become aware of that, it can

369
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,800
be a frightening place.

370
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
Exactly like a horror movie. Yes, it can

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,720
be exactly like a horror movie. It'll

372
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,720
create incidents at home. Yeah. Yeah.

373
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,880
Misfortunes, small accidents, things

374
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,880
breaking. Can it cause physical harm?

375
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,199
It can cause physical harm through

376
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
through other means. Yes. Direct

377
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,320
directly actual accidents is a good

378
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,800
example. Direct direct directly

379
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,199
intervening. No, but those accidents

380
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,199
those accidents happen. But can these

381
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,120
entities scratch you or something small

382
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,880
like that? I've I've not been scratched

383
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,759
by an entity, but I I know that that

384
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,639
gets recorded. Okay. Has an entity ever

385
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,480
gotten upset with you? Not particularly

386
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,360
upset with me. No. I'm very um I'm very

387
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,079
careful and marshally minded about what

388
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,199
I do. I don't like to leave anything

389
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,680
that may be an opening and I'm I do my

390
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,600
divination before I do work. I'm very

391
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,399
clear about what I'm going to do and I

392
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
go in. I perform the work and I get out

393
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,720
and I close and I make sure that

394
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,880
everything is as as clear as possible.

395
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,079
But you can't prevent everything. You

396
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,240
know, I've I've been I've been I've been

397
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,319
chased out of the woods at night by

398
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,880
spirits. You know, I've had, you know,

399
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,480
we we all end up with a few bumps and

400
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,360
bruises along the way. Are you

401
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,600
comfortable sharing that story? Um, in

402
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,799
in general terms? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go

403
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,520
for it.

404
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,679
So we were working we were working in

405
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,480
some some woodlands that we done a

406
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,880
significant amount of work in previously

407
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,000
in terms of preparing the site and being

408
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,679
used to spirit of place and we you mean

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
you were doing rituals? Yeah, we've been

410
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,400
doing ritual there for a while. It's

411
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,039
always important when you're working

412
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,039
somewhere to to see how a place changes

413
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,919
through a year and through the times and

414
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,520
through the seasons. We'd we'd built a

415
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,000
circle, a permanent circle out of white

416
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,960
quartz stones that we' laid out in the

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,640
woods. And we turned

418
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,480
up organized to do a ritual that we've

419
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,320
been planning for some time. And when we

420
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,840
arrived, the circle was already being

421
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
used

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,600
by entities by entities. Because it's

423
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
useful to them as well. Because it was

424
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,720
useful to them as well. But you could

425
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,919
visually see them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are

426
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
you comfortable talking about what they

427
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,679
look like? I'm not going to talk about

428
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,760
what they look like, but we uh we

429
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,840
realized that this was not the correct

430
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,320
time to be performing that work. And we

431
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,840
hight tailed it out of the woods. Okay.

432
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,400
But they had faces. Yeah. And not

433
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,760
pleasant faces. It wasn't the It was

434
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,760
clearly not our place to intrude. Okay.

435
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
And they could have caused you harm. I'm

436
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
sure they could have caused us harm.

437
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah. Could they have killed you? I have

438
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,080
no idea. Okay. Um, but when you spotted

439
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
them, they spotted you as well. Yeah.

440
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,400
And that's why they chased you out.

441
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,760
Yeah, we know. We ran. Okay. We ran.

442
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
This is a whole group of people running

443
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,280
away. A group of people who all had the

444
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,400
experience who'd all turned up ready to

445
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,000
work. But once you ran away, did they

446
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
bother you? No, they were fine. They

447
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,520
were just doing what they were doing.

448
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
They just want to be left themselves.

449
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
Just needed to be left alone. You know,

450
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,280
in the previous episode, we were

451
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,360
speaking about the Ramayan and the

452
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Mahabharat. Actually we've created a

453
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,240
series on my YouTube channel about the

454
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,240
Ramayan for the western viewer. Okay. So

455
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
I can't give too much context in this

456
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,240
conversation but it contains a lot of

457
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,320
material on raas that dwell in forest

458
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,200
and I've tried probing a lot of guess on

459
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,320
what this element of raasa is. It sounds

460
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,679
a lot like lower entities uh that are

461
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,240
also powerful in their own way. So in my

462
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,880
eyes the story that you're relaying

463
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,120
sounds like it's a raasa because I've

464
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,840
noticed that most of the west assumes

465
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,080
that lower entities are only ghosts

466
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,679
which are spirits of people who had

467
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
untimely deaths or who committed

468
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
suicide. But lower entities are of

469
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,760
different types as well. uh and there

470
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:07,600
are some more evolved lower entities

471
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:10,080
which in ancient sanatani texts uh are

472
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
called raasas. So this seems like these

473
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
were raasas like powerful entities.

474
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Yeah. Yeah. So it sounds it sounds

475
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
appropriate. Have you heard the word

476
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,919
raas? No I haven't. No but it sounds

477
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,799
parallel. It sounds parallel because in

478
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,200
the story of the Ramayan uh they bother

479
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
the rishies like the sages who are

480
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,760
trying to go about their rituals in the

481
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,520
forest. Okay. Sounds very bad to me.

482
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
Yeah. These Yeah. But these things

483
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
happen and again, you know, when you're

484
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,039
when you're performing magic, you expect

485
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,080
a degree there's also a degree of

486
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,960
resistance that you find. So very often,

487
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,600
you know, that if if something's pushing

488
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,200
back, if things are are not necessarily

489
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,480
flowing and there are obstacles to

490
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,080
overcome, sometimes that's a sign that

491
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
you're you are heading in fact in the

492
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,600
right direction. Um, and it is something

493
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,760
that you have to overcome. But on this

494
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,919
one, I'm very happy to let the spirits

495
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,960
have their place and do their magic

496
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,799
without me trying to evict them. Yeah.

497
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
What about the ritual you've done at

498
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,400
home? You're comfortable doing a ritual

499
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,880
alone by yourself. Yeah. Yeah. But you

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,679
said you run those entities through some

501
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,400
tests. Yeah. To filter out the negative

502
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,000
ones. Sure. So, um, when you're working

503
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,520
with when you're working with an entity

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
in the west, then you'll check several

505
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,880
things. You'll check things like you'll

506
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,960
check the name. You'll see whether they

507
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,039
give you the correct name. You'll check

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,520
you check the number of the name. If you

509
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,640
can do geatria, if you can add up and

510
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,880
create the value of the the spirit,

511
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,320
you'll ask it questions to see what

512
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
degree of knowledge it has. Does it know

513
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,240
something that you don't know or

514
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,480
wouldn't have access to? And you test it

515
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,000
with these things. You look at the

516
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,840
appearance. You look at the signs. And

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,400
you make sure that they're congruent.

518
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,520
and they're congruent with what you what

519
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,760
you're looking for. And if it's if if

520
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,600
those things don't match up, then

521
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,679
something's wrong. So these things

522
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,240
appear in the physical form in front of

523
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,320
you in terms of getting getting physical

524
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
manifestation is like a very rare thing.

525
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,360
Like it's very difficult to if we lived

526
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,360
in a world where you saw spirits in full

527
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,600
physical form with your open eyes in

528
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,159
normal circumstances, we would live in a

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
very different universe. So most of the

530
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
time when you're seeing these spirits,

531
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,840
they'll be materializing in things like

532
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,240
smoke. Smoke's often used to create a

533
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,640
something for them to take a form out of

534
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
or you'll um you'll see them in your

535
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,360
mind's eye. So this is a process of

536
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,840
meditation. Then there are then there's

537
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,520
temperature changes, there's sounds,

538
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,600
there's smells, there's all of these all

539
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,559
of these other things like seeing

540
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,400
something visually is very jolting. It's

541
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
very difficult to do and I think it's

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
very difficult for them to do and

543
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
sustain

544
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,640
because even that requires energy from

545
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,120
their part. Yeah. Creates a great deal

546
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,320
of energy and when you when you look at

547
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,919
the the magical texts which talk a lot

548
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,720
about physical entity manifestation

549
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
um and you look at the incenses they're

550
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,039
using, you find that they're very often

551
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,039
using things like um the Solenacia

552
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,799
alkaloids like they're using a dura

553
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,159
incense. They're using like quite

554
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,520
powerful psychoactive drugs which have

555
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,400
um which are enable you to to to see

556
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,039
these things manifest but I wouldn't

557
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
recommend those methods. So there's

558
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,360
things that will happen in the room.

559
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,919
There are things that will happen in the

560
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
room like light. Yeah. Light light

561
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,559
phenomena is very common. Yeah. And

562
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,640
you'll use things you'll use when you're

563
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,120
looking at like yes no answers. You'll

564
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
do things like you'll perform divination

565
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,480
asking the spirit questions. you'll use

566
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,400
um pendulum for example is a very common

567
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,480
method um where you where you're using

568
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,919
uh where you're holding a pendulum and

569
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,080
you're asking it yes no questions so

570
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,799
that you're establishing a dialogue. Um

571
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,000
so those kind of those kind of practices

572
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:04,360
and you've had

573
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,480
to tell many spirits to leave

574
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,799
I not not a great deal. No, I'm pretty

575
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,799
precise about my working methods. Okay.

576
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
You you go about your ritual in such a

577
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,360
way that you're able to attract only the

578
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,679
right spirits. Yeah. I work very

579
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,840
methodically and then as you work over

580
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,039
time then you tend to find there are a

581
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
small group of spirits who are

582
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,919
particularly immunable to your energy

583
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,159
who you work with more. So the most of

584
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,320
the of the most famous spirit cataloges

585
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:36,000
we have um there's in England probably

586
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,159
the the Goisha also called the Lamejeton

587
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,080
also called the lassi of Solomon. This

588
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,039
is a list of 72 spirits. Um, and these

589
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,440
are these have been used by magicians in

590
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,080
the English speaking tradition for

591
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,840
hundreds of years. Spirits are limited

592
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,240
to

593
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,320
geographies. Spirits are limited to

594
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,039
well, they're not limited to

595
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,120
geographies, but it's

596
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:04,559
easier it's easier to go somewhere where

597
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,720
there are spirits than to call spirits

598
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:11,799
where there are no spirits. M okay. So

599
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,559
if there is a particular if there is a

600
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,799
particular working that you wish to do

601
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,200
it's kind of easier to go somewhere wild

602
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,600
and remote to do it than it is to try

603
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,679
and do it in your front room. You know

604
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,360
it's and also there are spirits that you

605
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,600
don't necessarily want to call into your

606
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,159
house

607
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,440
fierce ones. Yeah. So that there if

608
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,919
there are fierce, volatile and difficult

609
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:41,279
spirits, it would be foolish to invite

610
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,200
them to come into your come into your

611
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,520
private space. Is it the equivalent of

612
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,799
meeting a murderer out in the world and

613
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,520
then saying, "Hey, I live here, by the

614
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:53,360
way." Yeah, that's a a great example.

615
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,799
Yeah. Yeah. Particularly if you have if

616
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,240
you have young children or you have

617
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,159
other people in the house who could be

618
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
obsessed or have problems. You don't

619
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
want to invite that into you. Do you

620
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,880
watch horror movies at all? Not really.

621
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,200
No. Why not? I just not really

622
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,559
interested.

623
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,400
Okay. Have you watched movies generally?

624
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,760
Yeah. In your life. Have you ever

625
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
watched a movie where you felt like,

626
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,320
hey, they're talking about my kind of

627
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,559
world? Um there's there's a modern film

628
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,039
called um A Dark Song. Um there are some

629
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,720
problems with it, but that's quite an

630
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:34,000
interesting representation of a of a

631
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:36,640
modern ceremonial um angelic um angelic

632
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,240
summoning ritual. I think that has that

633
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,919
that could give you a flavor. Okay. So,

634
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,279
when you're calling these spirits to

635
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,600
you, um I asked you earlier if they were

636
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,440
malevolent or benevolent, and you said

637
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,760
that neither. It's like a spectrum. You

638
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
can't bracket things. Yeah. I I don't

639
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,000
like to bracket things. I mean, there

640
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,760
are certainly spirits that are um that

641
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
are

642
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,880
dangerous, you know. There there are

643
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,480
spirits that you But it's like all of

644
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,320
these things like is a knife good or

645
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
bad?

646
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,799
Like it's it's you know, is a gun good

647
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,039
or bad? It's just it's natural. Yeah. Is

648
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,559
a car good or bad? Is a dagger good or

649
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,640
bad? Exactly. Exactly. And that that

650
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,440
understanding of the universe that there

651
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
are there are all of these forces in it

652
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,480
and they're all doing their thing and

653
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,559
they're all doing it in their place. The

654
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
question is is this is this the right

655
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,720
place for a tiger to be or is this the

656
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
wrong place for a tiger to be? Okay. But

657
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,799
it is the equivalent of calling a lion

658
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,440
or tiger into your vicinity. Yes, it

659
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,039
certainly can be.

660
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,799
Um so say you go about a task with

661
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:44,640
them. How does your relationship with

662
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,960
that entity develop then? Okay. So they

663
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,000
become familiar to you doing to to you

664
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,279
calling them. So they know who you are.

665
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But at the same time what you do in um

666
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:01,600
what you do traditionally in western

667
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,720
magic is you take the form of a previous

668
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,720
saint within your life. So in the

669
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,360
western tradition um it's Solomon um

670
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,279
from the Bible because the story of

671
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,480
Solomon is that in the construction of

672
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,480
Solomon's temple he called the spirits

673
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,679
and he tasked them to build the temple

674
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,039
for him. So many of our magic books go

675
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,360
back to the example of the way that

676
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:29,919
Solomon worked and they repeat that

677
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,559
pattern. So when the magician is in the

678
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,240
circle and doing their work, they dress

679
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,480
in that fashion and they present

680
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,200
themselves to the spirit as that figure

681
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,200
of spiritual

682
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,880
authority. So it's not I that commands

683
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,039
the spirit. It is it's Solomon who is

684
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,880
talking to the spirit. And you feel the

685
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,000
presence of St. Solomon. You can do

686
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
that. Yes. Do you feel it? Yeah. I use a

687
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,840
a different method that I won't talk

688
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,520
about here, but but using those ancestor

689
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,279
figures, using those powerful ancestor

690
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,000
figures is one way that we work. Have

691
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,159
you ever felt any amount of fear? Yeah.

692
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,480
I think fear is natural and healthy even

693
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,360
in these situations. Yeah. Even today.

694
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Yeah. Yeah. It's absolutely necessary.

695
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,440
What What makes you feel fear?

696
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you feel nervous before you do a

697
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,840
podcast? Do you perform better if you're

698
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,640
nervous? unders. You're sharper in the

699
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,120
head. You're sharper like it's your if

700
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,679
your adrenal system is firing and you're

701
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,520
able to deal with the the fight or

702
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
flight reflex and you're able to channel

703
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,240
that in the correct direction, then it's

704
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,000
a valuable thing. Do you mind that I'm

705
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,640
probing this? No. No, not at all. It's

706
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,120
all completely fine. I'm wondering why

707
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,799
Goddess Babylon wants this material out

708
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,399
there

709
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,720
in in my eyes when I've spoken about

710
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,480
lower entities on the show. Sure. The

711
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
downside is that it's attracted them

712
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,559
into my life a little bit. The upside is

713
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
that people get fascinated by the

714
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,720
person. Yeah. So again, while we're

715
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,399
going to continue this conversation, I

716
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,480
would like to point viewers to the

717
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,880
previous conversation we did because I

718
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,240
think that episode one would set the

719
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,320
context for everything we're speaking

720
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,720
about right now and further. And that's

721
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,440
what I think Goddess Babylon wants. That

722
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,200
people need to know much more about the

723
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,000
context that you and me are coming from

724
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,880
rather than just this one isolated part

725
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,200
of this very vast subject. Fair to say.

726
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,520
Fair to say. Yeah. Okay. Absolutely. In

727
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,399
saying that, let's dive back into what

728
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,799
we were talking about. Um, say once the

729
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,720
ritual is over Mhm. do they choose to

730
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,960
stay around you because they like you? I

731
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,960
hope not.

732
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,799
Okay. No, I mean, well, you

733
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,200
can you can you can bind spirits like

734
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,760
you can but you're keeping them you're

735
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,440
keeping them somewhere safe, right? When

736
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,480
you create a spirit home and you create

737
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,640
a spirit trap, if you put a spirit if

738
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,200
you put a spirit in a bottle. Yeah. So,

739
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,559
we go back to the Aladdin example, like

740
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,640
if it's in the bottle or the lamp. Yeah.

741
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,799
And the the lamp is somewhere safe, then

742
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,600
it can stay in the lamp. Okay. And it

743
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,760
can be happy there or it can be or it

744
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,559
can be held

745
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:15,360
there. But it's it's a relationship

746
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,279
where the magician has to be confident

747
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,440
with their authority over the spirit,

748
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,159
their ability to dominate the spirit if

749
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,679
necessary. And also very often there's

750
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,960
an understanding that the work we're

751
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,720
doing is going towards the evolution of

752
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,360
the spirit. This is very often a way

753
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,080
that people people people have thought

754
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,919
about this that when one works with a

755
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,120
lower spirit with an elemental spirit

756
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,600
that you're you're helping bring it up

757
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,360
to another level in the same way that we

758
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,080
have a relationship with with

759
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,159
with domestic animals. You know, you

760
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,720
have a relationship with your with your

761
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,720
pet dog. Like you're helping your dog,

762
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,120
your dog is helping you. you understand

763
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,039
where things are. It's part it's now

764
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,200
part of the human tribe. It's part of

765
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,240
the part of the tribe. And you can do

766
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,039
that with the spirits as well that that

767
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,960
you can help them continue on their path

768
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,440
of development over time. That's what's

769
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
in it for them. Yeah. Or you can just

770
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,000
trap them. Or you can just trap them.

771
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,480
Yeah. But as we know from all the

772
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,679
stories, they don't always stay trapped.

773
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,399
Okay.

774
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:34,200
Um, a friend of mine who's deeply into

775
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,720
tantric practices has spoken to me about

776
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,559
Indonesia. And there is a certain

777
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,399
Indonesian tribe or a bunch of them, I'm

778
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,760
not too sure, that uh is an expert in

779
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,320
what they call animism, which is exactly

780
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,480
this. Yeah.

781
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:55,200
Trapping beings, lower beings into

782
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,080
physical pots or bottles. Yeah. And

783
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,279
these sell for a lot of money.

784
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,440
So what is said is that there's this is

785
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,519
just conjecture. This is what I've heard

786
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
the world of spiritual gossip that

787
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,919
there's a lot of millionaires and

788
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,039
billionaires all over Asia who travel to

789
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,320
Indonesia to purchase these exact lower

790
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,720
beings. But it's extremely dangerous.

791
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,559
Yeah. Why is it extremely dangerous?

792
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,679
Because you're handing someone who isn't

793
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,440
trained a loaded gun.

794
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,480
You're basically selling a pet tiger.

795
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,370
You're selling a pet tiger. Yeah.

796
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,720
And that doesn't always end well.

797
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,799
[Music]

798
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,519
Apparently, it's used by politicians as

799
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,799
well. I'm sure it is. Yeah. Right. You

800
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,480
think politicians from all over the

801
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,880
world?

802
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,399
I

803
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,360
think I know I know a lot of people

804
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,279
who've traveled to Asia for these kind

805
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,840
of um these kind of services like I know

806
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,840
people within my field who travel to

807
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,919
Thailand to buy these kind of amulets

808
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,720
and to work with these kind of amulets

809
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,040
and to work with these kind of

810
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,800
spirits. It's it happens everywhere.

811
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,800
So, even if one wishes to work with

812
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,200
these spirits, you either become a

813
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,040
30-year veteran and understand what

814
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,399
you're doing in detail through practice,

815
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,520
and I'm sure there's baby steps

816
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,359
involved. Yeah. Or you just buy one for

817
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,879
a lot of money, but then the risk is

818
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,440
that the pet tiger might want to eat

819
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,000
you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say leave

820
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,919
it to the zookeepers

821
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,480
or become one yourself. Or become one.

822
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,919
Yeah.

823
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,280
H I also feel that when it comes to

824
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,399
knowledge, vidya in our culture, if you

825
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,520
truly seek vidya, knowledge, you're

826
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,599
willing to chase it with hard work,

827
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,240
it'll find a way to become accessible to

828
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,480
you. Yeah. And I'm sure anyone who's

829
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,560
watching this podcast until this point

830
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,839
is fascinated by this topic. There's a

831
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,720
bunch of people who want to chase this

832
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,640
vidya. So what's your advice to them?

833
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't

834
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,720
um don't unless

835
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,839
it's something

836
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,359
which don't unless it's something which

837
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,599
you have to do. If there's if if this is

838
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,599
your path, if this is the thing that you

839
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,480
have to do that speaks to you, then

840
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,240
pursue it. But if it's something you're

841
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,000
just a bit curious about, something

842
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,760
which like you think sounds might give

843
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,280
you your ego a boost, this is this is

844
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,920
not the work that you should be doing.

845
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,160
There are simpler, safer things you can

846
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,800
do. To be aware that this world is out

847
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,040
there, I think is a valuable thing to

848
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,680
understand that the world contains all

849
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,640
of these elements. But for the majority

850
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,400
of people who are householders like it's

851
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,680
do your mantra, do your meditation, do

852
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,560
your puja, do your simple practices and

853
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,680
find balance in that you know live live

854
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,400
that life because the number of people

855
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,079
who are involved with magic are very

856
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,320
few. They're very far between. And even

857
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,560
in that group of people, there are many

858
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,359
of them

859
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,040
who it goes terribly wrongful.

860
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,240
So yeah, beware. Magic can easily

861
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,240
backfire if you don't know what you're

862
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,680
doing. Yeah, absolutely. You're dealing

863
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,240
with nuclear material. You're dealing

864
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,400
with nuclear material.

865
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,240
[Music]

866
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,640
You know, I asked you earlier about if

867
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,880
these spirits could cause harm, and you

868
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
said that maybe not directly physically,

869
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,000
but in other ways. They'll cause

870
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,560
accidents,

871
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,720
like road accidents or road accidents.

872
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,280
They'll cause like people to come into

873
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,520
your life who will do you

874
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
harm like they'll they'll use they'll

875
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,880
use they'll use the tools that are

876
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,720
around them to create these impacts.

877
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,200
So, they can affect reality as well.

878
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,640
They can react. Yeah, absolutely.

879
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,320
There is a really scary story that I

880
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,160
heard like it's probably the

881
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,079
one so-called horror story based on a

882
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,560
true event which actually haunted me

883
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,000
very deeply. It's so intense that I may

884
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,240
not even want to repeat it on the show.

885
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,680
So, sorry guys, but I'm not going to

886
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,680
repeat it in detail, but I'll give you

887
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,520
an element of it.

888
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,480
Um, basically someone had got their

889
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,000
hands on one of these

890
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,800
Indonesian pots which contained a couple

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,359
of demons. His wife who was pregnant

892
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,760
discouraged that person from keeping it

893
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,280
and he didn't know what he was doing. It

894
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,640
just landed up with him. So they spoke a

895
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,280
lot at home about getting rid of it. And

896
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,920
uh the first night uh when they slept,

897
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,760
they both had the same dream of the two

898
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,920
spirits inside that pot telling them

899
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,800
that um do not throw us away. We will

900
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,240
come for you if you think of throwing us

901
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,560
away. The second day they discussed this

902
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,839
again, argued about it, whether wife

903
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,280
really wanted to get rid of it because

904
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,119
she understood what they're dealing

905
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,720
with. And that night they both dreamt of

906
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,359
the two spirits feeding on a baby.

907
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,440
And when they woke up, the wife had

908
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,920
faced a miscarriage and her bed was full

909
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,240
of

910
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
blood. But this is one story that I've

911
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,720
heard of these things causing physical

912
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,760
harm. And the reason I'm putting this

913
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,079
out is to put out a cautionary tale. Do

914
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
not get into this realm. It's okay to

915
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,680
have knowledge. It's okay to be

916
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,839
fascinated by this. And I've removed

917
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,560
much scarier layers of this story to

918
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,320
soften it up for the end viewer.

919
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,480
But how do you think they caused harm in

920
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,480
this case?

921
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,320
I couldn't tell you the the the physics

922
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,520
of it, but these things

923
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,440
happen particularly as you said like

924
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,560
young children like pregnancy like these

925
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,599
are these are times that you shouldn't

926
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,000
be anywhere near any of this. You

927
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,760
shouldn't be doing that.

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,640
Yeah. Don't don't do it. It's the same

929
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,960
thing as

930
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,920
like you shouldn't have friends who are

931
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,400
who are criminals because if you have

932
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,800
friends who are criminals then they will

933
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,280
drag you into their criminal world. You

934
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,200
will know bad people and if you know bad

935
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,880
people sometimes bad things happen. So

936
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,760
don't do it. Don't don't get involved

937
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,599
with that. But this is a this is a small

938
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,560
this is a small percentage of the amount

939
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,040
of spirit work that's done. And many of

940
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,119
these spirits that are particularly

941
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,680
dangerous, you would be foolish to try

942
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,640
to work with them. Even in your case,

943
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,760
even in my case, like I like there are

944
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,520
spirits. There are spirits that are

945
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,800
murderers. Do you want to have friends

946
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,560
with murderers? I don't want to have

947
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,040
friends with murderers. When you say

948
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,480
that there's spirits who are murderers,

949
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,160
are you talking about a human being

950
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
that's passed away or you're talking

951
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,000
about an ancient spirit that's been a

952
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,320
murderer traditionally? It's difficult

953
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,560
to tell, but it could be it could be

954
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,560
either of those possibilities. Some of

955
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,839
them some of them are dead humans. Yeah,

956
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,280
absolutely. Some of them are dead

957
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,480
humans. Have you worked with dead

958
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,680
humans? Yeah, I've worked with dead

959
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,320
humans. Why? Because not all dead humans

960
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,320
are bad humans. Not all dead humans are

961
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,359
bad humans. Some of them are wise people

962
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,880
who you knew. Not people who I know. No.

963
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,480
But how did you know that you're

964
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,560
supposed to work with a particular dead

965
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,040
human?

966
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,640
Well, it through a process of

967
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,880
divination, of working out what you're

968
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,240
trying to do, and of talking to a spirit

969
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,240
and discovering that a spirit, for

970
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,480
example, was previously a human being.

971
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,119
Okay. Are these iconic historical

972
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,599
figures? Not giant historical figures.

973
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,000
No. Someone who just got lost in

974
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,359
Somebody got lost in the way. All right.

975
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,359
Okay. Okay.

976
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,079
But in these spirit circles where you

977
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,079
invite these spirits

978
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,119
um you're doing it in a very controlled

979
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,960
manner. You're doing it in a very

980
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,640
controlled manner. Yeah. Uh but you are

981
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,400
still calling a lion or a tiger and you

982
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,200
need to know how to handle it. Yeah. You

983
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,960
know what Ouija boards are? Yes. That's

984
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,040
an uncontrolled way of doing the same

985
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,480
thing, right? Yes, it is. Yeah. Yeah. So

986
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,160
what you're doing is a controlled

987
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,839
portal. I'm doing a more controlled

988
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,400
method of that. Yes. But that's an

989
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,960
uncontrolled portal. That's Yeah. that I

990
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:23,359
think it's very foolish to um try to

991
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,599
invite in any any spirits which are

992
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,800
hanging around. This is it's a foolish

993
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,560
thing to do. It's foolish.

994
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,680
Okay. Um and that's how people get into

995
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,599
trouble. Yeah. In inviting misfortune

996
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,440
into your life. You're inviting you're

997
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,040
you're just Yeah. You're being you're

998
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,520
being extremely random. You're you're

999
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,280
opening a front door and you're letting

1000
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,040
anyone who's on the street walk into

1001
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,680
your house. This is a very bad idea.

1002
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,480
This is a very bad idea. Like if you're

1003
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,880
doing this kind of work like so Ouija is

1004
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,800
um Ouija is very popular because it's uh

1005
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,560
it's a quick and easy way to do it. You

1006
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,240
could use a Ouija board in a magical

1007
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,400
ritual. You could have a board in your

1008
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,640
circle and you can use it to communicate

1009
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,200
to ask questions. But if you haven't

1010
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,160
established your parameters, if you

1011
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,040
haven't set up your your wards, your

1012
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,880
your guards, you you're and you're going

1013
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,720
into it empty, that's just

1014
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,000
foolish. Just foolish. If you want to

1015
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,280
talk to the dead and if people

1016
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,839
particularly want to talk to their

1017
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,160
personal dead people in their line,

1018
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,400
that's much more easy to do with a a

1019
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,920
picture of someone who's died that you

1020
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,760
keep in your house that you burn a

1021
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,240
candle in front of, that you offer water

1022
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,079
to, that you that you talk to, who's

1023
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,319
within your family line. That's that's a

1024
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,760
safe thing to do. They might visit you

1025
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,200
in your dreams. They may visit you in

1026
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,880
your dreams. You have a relationship

1027
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,720
already, and for most people, that's the

1028
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,680
kind of work that they need to do. Yeah.

1029
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,440
Um we recently had a powerful psychic on

1030
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,240
the show and uh she spoke about

1031
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,240
something called the ancestral plane. So

1032
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
again in Sanatan we believe in

1033
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,319
reincarnation.

1034
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,880
Uh which means that once you pass away

1035
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,680
you're reborn in a body in the future.

1036
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,920
But after the time that you pass away

1037
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,920
your soul has an option of staying near

1038
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
your loved ones and just looking over

1039
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,200
them. Yeah. My question to the psychic

1040
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,680
was, "Why would my grandmom still want

1041
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,599
to be around?" And she said that it's

1042
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,480
not your decision. Maybe she just loved

1043
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,599
you that much and how if you have a

1044
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,599
child, you see the child going to

1045
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,200
school. You want to just go and drop off

1046
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,520
the kid and make sure it's okay while

1047
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,160
the kid goes to school. It's something

1048
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,079
like that but in the spirit world like I

1049
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,240
know my grandmom's protecting me all the

1050
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,680
time while you know I'm dealing with

1051
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,760
these kind of conversations and dealing

1052
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,680
with the process of fame. I know that

1053
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,960
I've got protection for my ancestors.

1054
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,000
Um you do you have anything to say about

1055
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,599
the ancestral plane? Um I completely

1056
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,079
agree with you. I think most people's

1057
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,680
work is most people's spirit work is

1058
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,079
should really be limited to that kind of

1059
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,240
ancestor work with their their immediate

1060
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,040
dead with their their parents and

1061
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,680
grandparents and their and their family

1062
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:10,079
line. I think it's a very it's a very

1063
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,160
safe thing to do because these people

1064
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,480
love and care for you and it can be done

1065
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,160
in a very a very simple and easy way.

1066
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,520
This is a spiritual

1067
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,599
uh purpose of your family. Yeah. Like

1068
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,480
even after your family members pass

1069
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,800
away, they are with you if you really

1070
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,760
wish for them to be with you. Yeah. And

1071
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,480
you can invite them back. Yes. Yeah.

1072
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,480
Right. Yeah. So you said that all you do

1073
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,640
is light a candle in front of the photo.

1074
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,040
Lighting a candle, having a photograph,

1075
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,760
like making making an offering of like

1076
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,800
water or food. It's like this is this is

1077
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,880
what people have done in human culture

1078
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,680
traditionally forever. whether you're

1079
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,240
doing that kind of um whe whether you're

1080
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,760
doing that kind of ritual on um on their

1081
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,040
birthday or the anniversary of their

1082
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:04,240
death, you know, it's it's a very useful

1083
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,480
thing to do. I think everyone who's

1084
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,440
everyone who wishes to work like this if

1085
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,640
they have a good family

1086
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,440
relationship to do those simple things

1087
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,680
to have have the pictures as a momento

1088
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,480
mores so that they remember them and to

1089
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,480
offer them light and to offer them water

1090
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,200
and and to just talk to them. I think

1091
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,839
that's that's a great thing to do in

1092
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,359
those circles. Do you also invite higher

1093
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,760
beings? Yes, you can invite higher

1094
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,560
beings like angels. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1095
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:39,160
Um we have somewhat of a concept of

1096
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:42,079
angels in sanadham. Uh it's called

1097
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,960
yakshakar and gandharvas. Gandharvas are

1098
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,839
related to music. I don't exactly know

1099
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,280
what yakshinar are related to but it's

1100
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,160
they're basically benevolent higher

1101
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:56,400
beings.

1102
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:59,000
Um, how does the purpose of a benevolent

1103
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,960
higher being vary

1104
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,480
from that of a lower

1105
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,240
being? And are all higher beings

1106
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,640
benevolent? Again, you know, we're we're

1107
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,079
we're back to the tigers.

1108
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,079
It's just their nature to be more

1109
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,480
evolved. It's their nature and it's how

1110
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,040
they respond to you. like how how a

1111
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,599
spirit responds to me and how a spirit

1112
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,920
responds to you will differ. You know,

1113
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,079
we will have we'll have different

1114
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,920
interactions in the same way that you

1115
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,599
have different friends. You meet people

1116
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,040
and you immediately like have a vibe

1117
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,319
from them. You can tell whether you get

1118
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,760
on with them or whether you don't get on

1119
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,839
with them, right? There's some people

1120
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,079
you meet and you're just like, I I can't

1121
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,319
stand this person. I I can't be around.

1122
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,280
The same thing with spirits.

1123
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,880
Exactly the same thing. It depends what

1124
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,040
you're doing. So, have any of the

1125
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,960
spirits that you've invited visited you

1126
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,800
in your dreams and still try to further

1127
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,119
conversation? Yeah, you always get like

1128
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,960
I think keeping a keeping a track on

1129
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,800
your dreams is very important because

1130
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,720
you'll often get messages through

1131
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,400
dreams.

1132
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,000
Like what like what do what do those

1133
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,359
spirits want from you? They want a

1134
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
conversation or something. Yeah,

1135
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,160
generally they generally they want a

1136
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,440
conversation. Sometimes they want

1137
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,720
particular things. Sometimes they want

1138
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,119
something done for them and then you're

1139
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,280
negotiating. If you do X, what is it

1140
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,000
that I can what is it that I can offer

1141
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,720
you that would be appropriate? So, you

1142
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,720
perform a ritual and the spirit will

1143
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,599
come to you in a dream and it'll say and

1144
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,040
you'll say, well, is there anything that

1145
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,880
I've done here which I could improve?

1146
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,839
So, a classic thing would be like the

1147
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,200
incense. So if I'm if I'm meeting a

1148
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,280
spirit for the first time and I'm making

1149
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,599
an offering of an incense, I use

1150
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,079
something very general like a like

1151
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,319
frankincense for example is like a good

1152
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,839
allpurpose incense. This is a good

1153
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,440
spiritual incense for clearing the

1154
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,040
place. And you'll make an offering of

1155
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,200
the incense and you allow the spirit to

1156
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,720
use that. But when you have a sense of

1157
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,720
the spirit, it will come back and it

1158
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:00,480
will say actually I would prefer it if

1159
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,880
you used this. if you offer this, we can

1160
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,440
we can establish a a better connection

1161
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,319
if we do that. And so you can begin to

1162
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,240
make those make those agreements, make

1163
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,800
those packs. Have you ever had to battle

1164
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,599
a doubt? I think that when you're when

1165
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,200
you're starting to practice magic and

1166
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,960
you're beginning to practice magic, it's

1167
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,800
very common for people to be filled with

1168
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,520
negative thoughts, to be filled with

1169
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,400
ideas that maybe this won't work or

1170
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,640
maybe maybe they're skeptical or those

1171
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
kind of difficulties, those those small

1172
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,520
like like kind of niggling niggling

1173
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,520
things that that that put you off what

1174
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,440
you're

1175
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,920
doing. But once you've had once you've

1176
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,040
had a solid experience and you have

1177
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,680
something you can say, I understand that

1178
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,520
this reality exists and I'm I I can I

1179
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,720
can interact with it. I can change it.

1180
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,599
It can it can change me. Then it's much

1181
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,920
easier.

1182
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,480
While I appreciate what you said because

1183
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,960
you shed more light on your world, I was

1184
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,480
asking you about whether or not you've

1185
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:11,200
had a fight with these spirits. I have

1186
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:15,040
had to defend my circle from spirits,

1187
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:19,160
but I'm a marshally minded individual.

1188
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,920
And if I'm holding a magical

1189
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:26,480
implement, whether that's a sword or a

1190
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:31,680
knife or a wand, I know how to use it.

1191
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:35,520
So I have I have no problem in facing

1192
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,160
down conflict if that's what's required.

1193
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,559
But generally, it's just testing. It's

1194
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,200
testing. Just testing. They're trying to

1195
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,359
see your toughness. Trying to see.

1196
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,920
They're trying to scare you. They're

1197
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:52,880
trying to see is this can I can I can I

1198
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,880
gain the upper hand

1199
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,000
here.

1200
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,400
Okay. I'm very surprised that you've not

1201
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,359
seen the Harry Potter films because

1202
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,440
honestly like a friend of mine who had

1203
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,319
spoken to me about Western magic long

1204
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,640
ago had told me that the Harry Potter

1205
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,520
films are loosely based on the truth.

1206
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,200
Oh, I'm I'm sure that that JK Rowling

1207
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,040
has done her research and that there are

1208
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,720
there are many elements in it. I would

1209
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,680
argue that JK Rowling has done her

1210
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,280
practice as well. We we'd have to have

1211
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,599
to ask JK when you when you get her on

1212
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,440
the podcast. She's based out of uh

1213
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,000
Britain, right? Yes. Scotland. Yeah.

1214
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,319
Scotland. Yeah. JK Rowling. You're

1215
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,440
invited to the Reni Show. But I I know

1216
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,440
for a fact that she's got some knowledge

1217
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,200
about this world. I'm sure. Yeah. She

1218
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,599
made magic mainstream in so many ways.

1219
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,040
Yes, she did. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What

1220
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,040
does your community say about the Harry

1221
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,160
Potter series?

1222
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,680
I think um I've I've seen over the years

1223
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:54,640
that there have been many cultural

1224
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,640
artifacts which have created a a rush of

1225
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,720
people towards magic. So previously in

1226
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,079
the 1980s there were there were movies

1227
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,720
that made people very excited about

1228
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:10,000
witchcraft. Um, like for example, like

1229
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,559
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, like the whole

1230
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,520
group of girls got very excited about

1231
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,079
the idea of witchcraft and magic having

1232
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,599
watched those kind of things. So, it's

1233
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,520
quite normal that when something like

1234
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,359
this happens, like Harry Potter happens,

1235
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,839
that there's a there's a rush of

1236
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,240
excitement and that people people come

1237
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:31,200
in and are are interested in in seeing

1238
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,440
what that world is because we live in

1239
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,200
such a secular society. We live in a

1240
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,040
society that that is so

1241
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,280
materialistic that is so limited in

1242
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,280
terms of people's spiritual growth that

1243
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,119
when they're exposed to a story when

1244
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,520
they're exposed to those kind of ideas

1245
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,280
then then suddenly something opens in

1246
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,200
them and they're like I want to know

1247
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:56,480
more about this like I want my world to

1248
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,440
be enchanted. I want my world to be full

1249
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,000
of magic, you know, whether that's

1250
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,079
reading like Lord of the Rings or like

1251
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,040
um The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

1252
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:10,680
or, you know, any of these any of these

1253
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,119
big alternative fantasy worlds, I think

1254
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,440
particularly particularly amongst kids

1255
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,800
and teenagers, they're they're much

1256
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,440
closer to that world. They haven't

1257
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,240
closed down to the extent that many

1258
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,760
adults have. They haven't been broken by

1259
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:28,559
the world. They still have a sense of

1260
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:31,280
like possibility and growth and what if

1261
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,440
and you know maybe they're still feeling

1262
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,520
things. Yeah. That's why they say kids

1263
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,520
can see things that adults can't. Yeah.

1264
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,280
Definitely. Right. Yeah. And then the

1265
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,040
pain of life takes that ability away

1266
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:46,040
from you. Yeah. Yeah. One of the

1267
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,480
blessings of being born in India in that

1268
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,119
geography is that generally speaking

1269
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,680
you'll find people around you who are

1270
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,960
either completely open themselves or who

1271
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,880
direct you towards openness. Uh and I

1272
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
see this in some other cultures like I

1273
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,280
have some Ghanaian friends. Yeah. I have

1274
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,200
some Arabic friends. I have some South

1275
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,599
American friends. I see this in like you

1276
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,079
know the tropical belt culture a little

1277
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,240
more. Um again taking nothing away from

1278
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,839
the west. I'm I'm deeply fascinated. No,

1279
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,040
you're com you're completely correct.

1280
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,319
Um, we were we I don't think I don't

1281
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:24,640
think everyone always realizes quite how

1282
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:27,599
secular and irreligious England is. I

1283
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,440
mean, our our religious beliefs here,

1284
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,760
our church, it it it's really broken.

1285
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,079
Like, it's not part of people's lives

1286
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,480
anymore anymore. They don't they don't

1287
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,520
have even the basic stories of the

1288
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:45,520
Bible. They don't know, you know, you

1289
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,359
say Adam and Eve to a class of of

1290
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,079
children and like most of them don't

1291
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:53,040
even know the Adam and Eve story which

1292
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,920
is like incredible. I kind of feel bad

1293
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:59,040
for pe some of the people born in the

1294
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,000
west in Christian families because they

1295
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,760
grew up with a sense of not wanting to

1296
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,280
have conversation about religion because

1297
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,800
of the negative connotation that it

1298
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,280
holds. I don't know why. Like I landed

1299
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,359
in Manchester and the immigration

1300
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,319
officer asked me about my podcast. She's

1301
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,920
like why are you here? I said to

1302
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,000
podcast. She what's your podcast about?

1303
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,000
I said everything under the sun other

1304
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,440
than politics. I said that as a joke and

1305
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,319
she's like yeah and I hope also

1306
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,960
religion. And I'm like why? It's such a

1307
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,400
it it can be a beautiful topic. Then I

1308
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,079
realized that I'm speaking from an

1309
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,480
Indian perspective where for me religion

1310
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,760
is sanatan and Buddhism and Islam and

1311
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,000
Christianity and for her it it's like

1312
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,119
more of a binary. Yeah. Right.

1313
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,240
Um what I sense in Europe is that the

1314
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:47,119
world has so much to learn from this

1315
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,240
region, this geography. But the one

1316
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,839
thing that many Europeans can learn is

1317
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,000
to find their faith in the divine once

1318
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,680
again. Yes. I feel it creates some level

1319
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,280
of anchoring which you have. We're

1320
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,000
talking about goddess Babylon. We're

1321
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,079
talking about all these topics uh which

1322
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,160
you know the Arab world has, which my

1323
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:09,200
world has, which like Southeast Asia

1324
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,359
has, South America, all these places.

1325
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,599
But people in Europe especially, even

1326
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,599
more so than America, have forgotten the

1327
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,920
divine. Yeah, very much so. And it's

1328
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,520
causing mental health problems. Yeah.

1329
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,040
Right. Have I said something offensive

1330
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,200
or wrong? No. No, you're completely

1331
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,400
correct. You're completely correct. Um

1332
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,839
we we live in a world which is so devoid

1333
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,520
of that understanding and uh it's

1334
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,220
something that you find people who who

1335
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,480
are drawn to magic and witchcraft like

1336
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,480
[Music]

1337
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,079
are they're also freer to explore those

1338
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,720
things because they haven't been limited

1339
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,240
by it. They're not coming in also with

1340
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,160
like a a negative framing of these ideas

1341
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,440
from

1342
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,440
Christianity. But there's also just that

1343
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,119
that lack of spirituality in the

1344
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,520
culture. And I think it broke with the

1345
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,920
world wars. Yeah. What do you mean? I

1346
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,640
think World War I and World War II, the

1347
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,799
the death and slaughter and the cultural

1348
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,160
change that happened, people just

1349
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:08,799
abandoned Christianity and that faith

1350
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,960
here like it just it just no longer made

1351
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,119
sense to people after seeing that level

1352
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,760
of death. Yeah. Can we speak about the

1353
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,200
world wars a little bit? Yeah. Um, we

1354
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
speak about the world wars a lot in

1355
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,319
India, but I've noticed that in this

1356
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,760
part of the world, of course, it's

1357
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,880
spoken about so much more because it's

1358
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,920
recent history.

1359
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,839
Um, do you think that there were

1360
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,720
elements of these lower or higher

1361
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:33,079
entities involved in the world wars? I

1362
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,400
think if we live in a world filled with

1363
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:39,359
spirits, which is which is my model of

1364
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,680
the universe, then it's inevitable that

1365
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,400
there is a spiritual component to these

1366
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,079
things. Yeah, absolutely. Because I've

1367
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:51,200
heard some spiritualists say on this

1368
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:55,200
show that uh Adolf Hitler was guided by

1369
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,359
a lower entity trying to create demonic

1370
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,960
chaos in this world. Yeah, I think he

1371
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:06,079
was a an extremely damaged individual um

1372
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,400
taking a huge amount of methamphetamines

1373
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,200
on top of his damaged personality which

1374
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,319
wasn't really helping things. And they

1375
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:18,480
were they were again dealing with this

1376
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:22,240
this problem of a broken Christianity.

1377
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:25,520
And he reach he he did reach back to

1378
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,920
some form of a pagan past. A very you

1379
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,920
know a

1380
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,880
very limited understanding of a Germanic

1381
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,680
pagan past. But that was certainly an

1382
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,000
element that was present within within

1383
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,839
the Nazi party. You know the Nazi

1384
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,319
symbol, the swastika. Yeah. The swastika

1385
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:47,040
u that the Nazis use is an inverted

1386
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:49,119
swastika. Yeah. Yeah. The one we use in

1387
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,799
sanatan dharm is one of the most divine

1388
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,040
symbols. Yeah. And it's supposed to

1389
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:55,839
divonize a space. Yeah. But this is an

1390
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,240
inverted swastika. Very similar to an

1391
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,520
inverted cross. Yeah. Which is a symbol

1392
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,400
of Satan. Yes. Yeah. I believe. Uh it

1393
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,119
looks like a sword instead of a cross.

1394
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,720
So they've taken a very powerful Hindu

1395
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,720
symbol and turned it around. Yeah. where

1396
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,359
to the degree where I know a lot of

1397
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,359
people in India who think twice before

1398
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:21,760
getting swastika tattoos because they

1399
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:24,720
don't want a global audience or global

1400
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,599
person to to misinterpret. Exactly.

1401
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,799
Because this in the modern day

1402
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:33,720
unfortunately can be confused to be

1403
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:36,079
a racist symbol. Yeah. Yeah. Right. I I

1404
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:39,119
I agree with you. I think I think the

1405
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,119
swastika is a is a beautiful symbol.

1406
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,079
Like I really love the swastika, but

1407
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,920
it's so difficult in our culture because

1408
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,760
of the the damage that's been done to

1409
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:52,720
it. And you see you see that it was used

1410
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,480
um through the 1940s like globally

1411
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:59,359
everyone was using this symbol and then

1412
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,200
because of the the because of the Nazi

1413
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,240
regime it was being given such a bad

1414
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:08,640
reputation. Yeah. I mean you know in uh

1415
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,160
sanatani tantra um yantras and symbols

1416
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,599
basically for us yantras are of

1417
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,280
different kinds but symbols are one of

1418
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:19,839
the key yantras and um a swastika

1419
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:22,480
contains a lot of power I am pretty sure

1420
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:27,880
that Adolf Hitler knew this spiritual

1421
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:30,960
nuance and twisted it around to uh

1422
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,760
malevolently affect the world to affect

1423
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,559
the world in a malevolent manner. Yeah.

1424
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,200
And cause that level of death Yeah. and

1425
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,280
chaos and suffering in the world. Yeah.

1426
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,079
Um but you know it's it's one of those

1427
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,079
topics that people are so edgy about

1428
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,440
like that's not discussed. Yeah. Like

1429
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,640
I'm pretty sure that even through this

1430
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,319
conversation people are going to pick up

1431
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,760
clips and take it out of context and

1432
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,280
then I'll have to do some firefighting.

1433
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,799
It's just the nature of the internet.

1434
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,200
But it's important to have these

1435
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,559
conversations because in my eyes in so

1436
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,160
many ways I'm trying to learn so much

1437
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,839
more from you. But I also represent my

1438
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,319
own culture. And one of the most

1439
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,520
beautiful aspects of my culture has been

1440
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:12,400
demonized by a human being who wasn't in

1441
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,599
his senses. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1442
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,480
While we're speaking about this

1443
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,440
particular human being, I think at this

1444
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:26,160
point in the podcast, it's a great place

1445
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,160
to also bring in Shatan or Satan. Sure.

1446
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,920
Um, I don't even know where to begin

1447
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,920
this topic because I actually don't like

1448
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,000
talking about it honestly. I think it's

1449
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,559
a low frequency conversation and

1450
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,040
whenever I speak about the Illuminati or

1451
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,640
Satan on my show, I almost feel a drain

1452
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,599
of energy. Yeah. And I know that's not

1453
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,040
something I want to dive deep into. So,

1454
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,000
I'd love for you to give me a quick

1455
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,599
fire. Okay. We'll do the quick one on

1456
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,480
this because this is easy to do. Okay.

1457
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:57,200
So um

1458
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,839
Satanism and was can only be understood

1459
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,599
as an inversion of Christianity. So it's

1460
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,359
a

1461
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:07,280
Christian it's it's something that

1462
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:09,119
Christianity to a large extent created

1463
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,760
and then projected onto all of its

1464
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:16,079
enemies and projected to all of its

1465
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,760
enemies. Yeah. So the idea that um if we

1466
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,400
look at like the classical images of

1467
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,480
like the devil or Satan with like with

1468
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,200
horns and like hairy and all of these

1469
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:30,160
things, this is this is in many ways a

1470
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,839
pagan deity. This is many ways a lot of

1471
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,280
people when they when they were looking

1472
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:37,680
at this in the Victorian kind of period,

1473
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,400
they were very interested in Pan. In

1474
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,200
what? The Greek god Pan like Peter Pan.

1475
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,920
Um yeah, the second part, Pan. So Pan is

1476
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,400
like a he was quite a small deity at the

1477
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,040
time, but he was the god of like um wine

1478
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,599
and sex and fertility and like you know

1479
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,760
like

1480
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:58,720
u a little bit of misrule.

1481
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,440
Misrule. Misrule. Yeah. And so all of

1482
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:04,799
these aspects of like um all of these

1483
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,040
aspects these more animalbased aspects

1484
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,359
that Christianity was opposed to lust

1485
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,280
oriented. Yeah. They all get got pushed

1486
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:15,119
into this this this figure that they

1487
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,160
created called Satan. Because when you

1488
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,119
look in the

1489
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:23,760
Bible, it's it it's a very mixed story

1490
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,599
about Satan and about Lucifer. It's the

1491
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,240
same person or same thing that they're

1492
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,839
talking about. They're talking about a

1493
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,559
range of different things from a range

1494
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:35,119
of different stories and traditions that

1495
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,839
have all been put under one name, one

1496
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:41,599
label. and they've said this is the bad

1497
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:43,760
thing. Anyone who's not us is this thing

1498
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:47,359
and this thing is where we all put all

1499
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,920
of the bad ideas. So if you look um if

1500
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,359
you think about the the conscious and

1501
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,359
the unconscious, if you want to think

1502
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:56,000
about the mind like that, all of the bad

1503
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,760
things get pushed into this dark place.

1504
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,160
And this dark place has a label on it

1505
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,720
called Satan saying don't touch, don't

1506
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,960
go here. And many good things were

1507
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,160
pushed here. not just bad things but

1508
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,240
there were good things that were pushed

1509
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,079
here as well. Um particularly the body

1510
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,079
and the lessons and the truths within

1511
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,359
the body because Christianity when it

1512
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,280
began was very body and life denying.

1513
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,960
There was a lot of um there were a lot

1514
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,960
of talk about um celibacy for both men

1515
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,039
and women. The body was seen as a bad

1516
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,280
thing. Even having children was seen as

1517
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,280
being a bad thing. like there was a it

1518
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,440
was quite quite a death cult when when

1519
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,559
early Christianity started first couple

1520
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,520
of centuries of Christianity. So the

1521
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:41,280
devil took on all of the negative

1522
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,599
characteristics that the culture didn't

1523
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,839
want to look at. And then this figure

1524
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:49,000
became bigger and bigger. And as the

1525
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:52,079
Christian church began to show itself as

1526
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,039
being not what it said it was, that it

1527
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,720
was doing bad things. Many, many

1528
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,640
atrocities carried out in the world of

1529
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,760
the Christian church. Some people

1530
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:04,319
inevitably look at the other side of the

1531
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,240
coin and they say the Christian God is

1532
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:08,000
not someone I want to deal with. I will

1533
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,280
I'll deal with this other thing because

1534
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,440
this this figure

1535
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,559
opposes

1536
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,720
Christianity. And Christianity at the

1537
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,319
same time

1538
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:22,240
benefited from creating this evil figure

1539
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,960
and saying anyone who is our enemy

1540
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,799
they're this no there's nothing good in

1541
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,960
this. This is kind of the cultural

1542
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:31,440
impact that created this figure. So it's

1543
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:35,280
really it's really a projection, a

1544
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,880
shadow of Christianity that they used to

1545
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:42,200
control people.

1546
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:44,559
But Satanism, the practice of Satan

1547
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,200
worship, you can break down quite

1548
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,520
quickly.

1549
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:54,280
So particularly um in terms of the

1550
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,280
written records for what we have

1551
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:00,400
um the French really invented Satanism

1552
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,640
like Satanism was something that you

1553
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,640
found um around the French courts. Um

1554
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,200
and there was uh there were a couple of

1555
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,920
famous um there were a couple of famous

1556
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,960
historical events that that revealed

1557
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,280
that there were people who were um who

1558
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,000
were killing children and performing

1559
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,319
abortions and poisonings. And so there

1560
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,400
was a there was a a a group of people

1561
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:28,720
around um the court of um the court of

1562
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Louis with the um the affair of the

1563
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,160
poisons. If you want to Google something

1564
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,680
for Satanism, The Affair of the Poisons

1565
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:38,359
is where you find it where there was an

1566
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,119
abortionist called um um Madame uh

1567
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:45,599
Montispan who had a circle of people and

1568
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,760
she was she was um she was drawing them

1569
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:53,760
in and this still happens today. She

1570
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:56,319
drawing them in to um participate in um

1571
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,720
in black masses in these acts of

1572
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:00,319
ritualized

1573
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,799
evil. And we see this today whether

1574
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:05,440
you're whether you're PD or Jeffrey

1575
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:07,520
Epstein. If you can if you can if you

1576
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,000
can compromise people in positions of

1577
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,960
power by making them participate in a

1578
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,039
bad thing, you can blackmail them. And

1579
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,319
so that was that was pretty much what

1580
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,440
what what Satanism was then. Very small

1581
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:22,960
thing, very elite

1582
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,799
level. Um at the same time there were

1583
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,640
people persecuted throughout the society

1584
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,799
who were called Satanists. Some of them

1585
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,319
were burned as witches. you know, that's

1586
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:33,359
part of the story of the witchcraft

1587
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:35,119
trials. So, that was Satanism

1588
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,960
um classically, the classical period of

1589
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,160
Satanism where you take the high

1590
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,119
Catholic mass and you flip it, you turn

1591
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,720
it on its head. There's also a deity

1592
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,400
that goes by the name of Satan. And so,

1593
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,880
there's a deity that's called Satan that

1594
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,559
they are that they are worshiping in

1595
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:55,200
return for material things and power.

1596
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,839
But this is a real deity. It's as real

1597
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,839
as you want it to be. There's clearly a

1598
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,839
it's clearly become something. So yes,

1599
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,760
it's clear it's clearly a thing. Can

1600
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,760
collective consciousness of many human

1601
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,119
beings over centuries create a deity?

1602
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,319
Yeah, completely. That's what's happened

1603
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,079
here. Yeah, it's that kind of thing.

1604
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:12,799
It's an agreor would be the technical

1605
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:17,680
term for it. It's it's a a deity that's

1606
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:18,960
been produced by a lot of people um a

1607
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,280
lot of people coming together and

1608
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,520
creating an image and creating a cult.

1609
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,359
But Satanism is now much more confusing

1610
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,680
because this classical Satanism which is

1611
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:34,799
what we we often think about black

1612
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:38,319
matters blah in the 19 um in the 1960s

1613
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:41,839
in America um there's a gentleman called

1614
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:46,079
Anton Levy who founded the church of

1615
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:48,799
Satan. Now, his form of Satanism, which

1616
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,319
is uh the most popular form of Satanism

1617
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:53,720
you will find today,

1618
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:56,039
is really quite

1619
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,680
atheistic and

1620
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,440
materialistic. And it's

1621
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,640
deliberately

1622
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:06,440
poking fun and mocking people

1623
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,760
um

1624
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:13,359
for for rejecting the body, for

1625
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,960
rejecting the pleasures of life. So if

1626
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:17,199
you look online and you search

1627
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,920
Satanists, you'll very often find people

1628
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:21,679
who are members of the church of Satan

1629
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,080
and many of them are atheists. They have

1630
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,880
no spiritual belief at all, but they

1631
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,880
like they like the aesthetic. They like

1632
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,600
to dress up in a certain way. They like

1633
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,759
to wear certain symbols. Some of them

1634
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,000
are practicing magic, but the majority

1635
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,480
of them aren't. And the majority of them

1636
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,560
are more like um they're more like

1637
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,759
American libertarians.

1638
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,560
Yeah.

1639
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,799
uh like the like the far the far

1640
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,319
Republican party like the far right of

1641
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,319
the Republican party like absolute

1642
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,719
freedom. So like they'd be they'd be in

1643
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,799
favor of no gun control. They're in

1644
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,080
favor of alcohol. They're in favor of

1645
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,319
sex. They're in favor of all of these

1646
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,159
things. So it's in some ways it's quite

1647
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,839
life affirming and they're not they're

1648
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,199
often not bad people. I know I know

1649
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:08,319
quite a few of these people. They're

1650
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:10,239
fine, but it's very modern and it's a

1651
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,319
little superficial.

1652
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:14,480
So that was that was the modern Satanism

1653
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,279
that occurred in the 60s and that's

1654
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,759
that's that's the dominant flavor of

1655
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,279
modern Satanism if you look at like if

1656
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,880
if you're looking at at

1657
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:28,560
practitioners but because this group was

1658
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,199
so um materialistic and really quite

1659
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,600
atheistic. A lot of them were atheists.

1660
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:36,319
There was a reaction to that and there

1661
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,319
is a smaller group of people who are

1662
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:42,319
theistic Satanists. So they're people

1663
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:44,319
who worship Satan as a deity. And again,

1664
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:47,199
there are a range of people here, but

1665
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,600
most of them most of them are are

1666
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:53,359
actually not bad people at all. They're

1667
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:56,080
people who are in who are just um ultra

1668
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,360
liberal, ultra libertarian. They're not

1669
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:01,840
doing awful awful things. And then we

1670
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,760
have a third level. So the third level

1671
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,400
is what you'll find if you get your

1672
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,520
information from from Twitter and

1673
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:12,800
YouTube. Yeah. And this is where there's

1674
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,760
an idea that there is an elite group of

1675
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,960
bad people who are doing bad things

1676
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:21,360
because they are Satanists. Illuminati.

1677
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,760
The Illuminati. Like all of that

1678
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,040
nonsense that that we as magical

1679
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,880
practitioners then have to deal with

1680
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,480
because we're we're placed in that

1681
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,440
category. I mean, yeah, that's that's a

1682
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,440
thought at the back of my head

1683
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,199
throughout this podcast that you know,

1684
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,199
you're going to be called satanic at

1685
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:37,840
always. Always already called satanic.

1686
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:40,320
Yeah, it's not a problem. like it's not

1687
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,120
a problem because they they simply don't

1688
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,560
understand the technical terms. Now I

1689
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,960
could describe myself

1690
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:51,520
technically as a

1691
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,719
luciferian. Okay. So what I do with my

1692
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,840
reading of the Bible is I would split

1693
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,960
the ideas of Satan as the opposer and

1694
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:03,920
Lucifer as the lightbringer. And I would

1695
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,640
say that my tradition is to do with the

1696
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,760
luciferian aspect. It's to do with

1697
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:13,520
freedom. It's to do with beauty. It's to

1698
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,920
do with the body. It's to do with light.

1699
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,480
Yeah. As opposed to the satanic aspect

1700
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,120
which is to do with the dark. is to do

1701
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,800
with transgression and it's particularly

1702
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,239
linked up with you know you

1703
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,560
know human sacrifice all that kind of

1704
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:31,280
nonsense which like really like I've

1705
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,120
never come across any of this practice

1706
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,760
before we move forward simple question

1707
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,159
for you what do you want for humankind I

1708
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,560
want the evolution of humankind I I want

1709
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,400
us to fulfill our destiny and return to

1710
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,920
the stars okay um when you meet people

1711
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,719
or when you see other human beings what

1712
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,239
do you feel Peter I I love human beings.

1713
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:52,320
Yeah. I think human beings are great.

1714
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,840
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Now, let's move on.

1715
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,040
Yeah. But it's important to do

1716
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,520
because because these technical terms

1717
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:04,080
get get turn into a mess very very

1718
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,920
quickly. Um certainly there are what

1719
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,920
people would understand to be Satanists

1720
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,199
in the

1721
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:15,360
world. by which I mean people who

1722
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:18,440
worship a deity called Satan and gather

1723
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:22,239
together in small groups and do bad

1724
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:25,840
things. But this is a blackmail racket.

1725
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:29,280
Again, as I said, this is this is PD

1726
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,360
Jeffrey Epstein style entrapment. And

1727
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,000
this is something that we found in our

1728
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:36,400
cultures for a long time. And very often

1729
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,800
as you look into it, you discover that

1730
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,199
it's intelligent services behind it

1731
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,360
because it's very useful to be able to

1732
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:51,159
blackmail people who are in positions of

1733
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:53,400
power. But as for a a an all powerful

1734
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:57,360
satanic

1735
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:59,840
conspiracy, like I have seen no evidence

1736
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,280
of such a thing. Small groups of

1737
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,120
compromised black male people in the

1738
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:08,159
elites. Absolutely. Global Satanism is a

1739
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,679
a fantasy. Got it. So, the Illuminati is

1740
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:12,400
not controlling our world.

1741
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,679
Unfortunately, not. No.

1742
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,960
Okay.

1743
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:19,199
Um, you know, I'm actually going for

1744
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,719
dinner with the Rockefellers uh at some

1745
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,040
point and they're the name associated

1746
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,600
with the Illuminati. Uh they they're

1747
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,800
visiting India. Uh if I get to do a

1748
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,640
podcast with them, this is what I intend

1749
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,320
on asking them. How do you guys feel

1750
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,800
about this stuff? Yeah. Yeah. I think

1751
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,800
it's a good question to ask really

1752
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,960
because you know certainly certainly

1753
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,040
there are people who you see playing

1754
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,159
with those symbols and ideas in

1755
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:46,640
positions of power.

1756
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:48,480
Absolutely. But why? Generally uh sexual

1757
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,679
kicks

1758
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:56,640
like um generally

1759
01:13:51,679 --> 01:14:01,560
uh for shock value to be spoken about to

1760
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:05,280
be spoken about to hold power over other

1761
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:09,679
people by appealing to those symbols of

1762
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:13,920
like crushing dangerous power.

1763
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:15,679
Um you know we mentioned PD and Epstein

1764
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,880
Um, do you think they were also involved

1765
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,520
in any kind of ritualistic practice?

1766
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,320
I'm not aware that they were involved in

1767
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,880
any kind of ritualistic practice, but I

1768
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:33,480
think all humans tend towards ritual

1769
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:36,000
behaviors, but like a a specific magical

1770
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:37,440
organized process of performing ritual.

1771
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,600
I don't think those individuals were.

1772
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,199
No. Gotcha. No. Okay. your partner's in

1773
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,159
the room with us and I was just telling

1774
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:48,320
her that uh I've manifested this

1775
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,360
conversation for years and I'm not one

1776
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,440
of those people who believes in the

1777
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,320
power of manifestation. I think it is a

1778
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,080
thing but again in the nucleus of my

1779
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,040
culture they say that only manifest the

1780
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,199
divine everything else will follow. Um

1781
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,520
but I've in my heart as a content

1782
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:06,560
creator I've wanted to meet someone like

1783
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,800
you for ages and have this exact

1784
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,320
conversation. Uh it's one conversation

1785
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,080
that we split up into two parts and um

1786
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:18,719
is there a reason you choose to wear

1787
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:22,239
black? Yeah. Yeah. Um it's it's quite

1788
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:25,120
traditional in um in western magical

1789
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:27,360
culture um that if you're engaged in

1790
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,600
this kind of work that that very often

1791
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:32,640
you'll find that people people just wear

1792
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,440
black. Just wear black. Yeah. You you

1793
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,480
just wear black? I

1794
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:42,600
literally only wear black. Yeah. Yeah, I

1795
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:45,280
wish I could do the same in my core. I

1796
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,199
met an Indian tantric once who said that

1797
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,600
yeah, if you're engaged with Khalima,

1798
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:52,080
you will naturally be drawn to black in

1799
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:55,520
color. So I see a parallel again. Yes.

1800
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,600
Yes, there is. Yeah. Right. Um you said

1801
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,520
that you had an iawaska experience in

1802
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,880
South America. Yeah. Now again on the

1803
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,400
surface for people who are not informed

1804
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,880
about Iawaska, they'd assume that it's

1805
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,360
just a psychedelic substance. Is it a

1806
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,360
party drug? No, it's not. It's a

1807
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:15,679
powerful spiritual

1808
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:17,920
um device that opens up access to other

1809
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:21,120
realms. Would you agree? Yeah,

1810
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:24,120
completely. Well, I spent um I spent a

1811
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,280
week in the Amazon um

1812
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:30,000
about about two days journey from

1813
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:32,440
civilization and uh up upper a river

1814
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,800
with a with a shaman and a group of

1815
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:38,719
people and we drank

1816
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,320
um I think we drank five I think we had

1817
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:46,800
five um five sessions with a very strict

1818
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:49,840
dieta. So we were I I dieted for a month

1819
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,920
before it with no meat, no coffee, no

1820
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,640
chocolate, no alcohol, no sex, no like

1821
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:00,480
all of those all of those requirements.

1822
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:04,320
Um and then while we were there um I did

1823
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,360
dieta with um a plant called cat's claw.

1824
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,960
Um, so I was

1825
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,880
drinking

1826
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:15,440
probably four liters of cat's claw a day

1827
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:19,920
and eating a very limited amount of

1828
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:22,880
calories and diet. Um, so plantain,

1829
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,520
quinoa, um maybe some maybe some fish,

1830
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,280
but like like really really quite a low

1831
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:32,840
calorie diet. Um, and I enjoy I enjoy

1832
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:35,199
the discipline. Um uh and I

1833
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,960
enjoy being in a space like that when I

1834
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:40,320
can devote myself to a serious piece of

1835
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,960
spiritual work. So I was in a um in a

1836
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,640
tambbo by myself. I went with my partner

1837
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,880
but we were like separate from each

1838
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,560
other for the the trip and we were

1839
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,480
guided through the experience by a

1840
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:57,760
native shaman, a very skilled shaman who

1841
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,920
performed the rituals um in the native

1842
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,600
fashion. So previously a lot of the

1843
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,480
iawaska that you can drink in the west

1844
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:08,719
is through a Brazilian church called the

1845
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:10,400
the Santa Da and Santa Da um they have

1846
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,000
quite they have a Christian approach to

1847
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,400
it. So they split up men and women and

1848
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,320
they sing Christian songs and they they

1849
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,920
have a different method about the way

1850
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,440
they go about it and I I didn't want

1851
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,640
anything to do with that. That was not

1852
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:25,120
going to be my approach. So we went and

1853
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,199
we we drank with the shaman with a group

1854
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:29,679
of people who traveled out for it,

1855
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:32,199
including one of my dear friends who was

1856
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,560
recovering from some significant heart

1857
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:38,080
surgery. So one of the reasons that I

1858
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,719
went was to support him as he was going

1859
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:43,280
through his healing experience. You

1860
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:46,560
know, it's very important for me to to

1861
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:49,239
be there um and to to help him with what

1862
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,719
he was going through.

1863
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:56,280
Um, and what I what I gained from

1864
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:59,120
Iawaska and I've

1865
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:01,679
taken I've taken a significant number of

1866
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,880
other like mindaltering substances and

1867
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,760
drugs through my time as a magician like

1868
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,080
it's it's been part of my practice to

1869
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,199
explore these

1870
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:16,719
realms. But I is very different. Um,

1871
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:18,080
they describe it as a um as a teaching

1872
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,600
plant.

1873
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:24,239
And the experience of drinking the plant

1874
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:28,840
medicine and having the shaman singing

1875
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:32,239
the ikaros, the sacred songs and him

1876
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:35,960
charming the plant within your body and

1877
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:39,360
the spirit within your body is an

1878
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:43,360
extremely powerful experience.

1879
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:46,560
So you would um you'd spend the day in

1880
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:49,600
quiet contemplation and then spend the

1881
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,440
evening drinking the iawaska which for

1882
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,360
people who haven't experienced it is a

1883
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,040
very

1884
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,199
um it's a difficult thing to drink even

1885
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,679
like a small shot glass of iawaska is

1886
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:01,600
got a very bitter taste and the effect

1887
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:05,440
of the medicine is also to make you

1888
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:08,080
purge so you vomit um and you bring a

1889
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,800
lot of things out of you and as a

1890
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:15,120
magician it was A real privilege to see

1891
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:17,760
a plant master in the Amazon and his

1892
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,320
relationship both to the spirit of the

1893
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,719
plant and his mastery of the plant and

1894
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,800
the way he could manipulate it

1895
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,040
internally inside a whole group of

1896
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,880
people all going through different kinds

1897
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:33,360
of healing crises was spectacular. I

1898
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,239
could see many parallels with the kind

1899
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,800
of work that I do

1900
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:40,800
um on a different level. It was to see

1901
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,280
another magical practitioner was

1902
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,360
fundamentally exciting. Again, in our

1903
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,840
previous conversation, we talked about

1904
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,000
other entities and lower entities.

1905
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,520
Having a

1906
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,360
shaman is extremely important to this

1907
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,199
experience because drinking Iawaska

1908
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,679
pulls in a lot of these lower entities.

1909
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:01,360
And you need a shaman to keep the space

1910
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:04,080
clear of these kind of spirits. And

1911
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:07,040
those kind of spirits, hungry spirits in

1912
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:10,159
the jungle certainly came came looking

1913
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,360
for food. Um they wanted to feed on

1914
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:16,640
human emotion. Yeah. They want to feed

1915
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:19,920
on human emotion. Yeah. Um and so I had

1916
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:22,080
I had a very good conversation with the

1917
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,560
spirit of Iawaska because you you mean

1918
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,800
mother Iawaska? Yeah. The female entity

1919
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:29,719
which is the female entity within it.

1920
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,920
Okay. I'll have to give some context.

1921
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:33,280
Iaska ceremonies are being studied by

1922
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,880
neurologists all over the world because

1923
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,199
they have found some scientific proof

1924
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:40,239
behind the changes that Iaska can create

1925
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:42,040
in a human mind. Secondly, the one

1926
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:45,199
commonality that

1927
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:47,000
everyone feels while doing Iawaska is

1928
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:49,920
that they feel the presence of a

1929
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,639
feminine dity in many cases. I won't say

1930
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,560
everyone but many cases. And another

1931
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,480
commonality is the purge. No, I had the

1932
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,840
same thing. I could feel my face running

1933
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:04,080
with tears despite not feeling like any

1934
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:07,360
any any sadness. Um but the the spirit

1935
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,760
of Iawaska, you very much feel um the

1936
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:13,280
goddess. You feel the spirit of the

1937
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:16,080
plant engaged with you in a way that I

1938
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:18,239
haven't found with any of the other

1939
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:22,080
plants or substances that I've used.

1940
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:24,159
She's a very particular spirit. Um, and

1941
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,520
in that particular context of the Amazon

1942
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:29,120
was like even an even more powerful

1943
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:31,120
experience. And as a western magician, a

1944
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,120
lot of the things I do are to do with

1945
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:36,480
um, there's a lot of secrecy. There are

1946
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:40,000
a lot of secrets that you keep. And she

1947
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,920
just like ran through my head and pulled

1948
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,080
everything out, went through everything.

1949
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,719
And it was it was quite funny because

1950
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,199
she was going through all of the symbols

1951
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,679
that I have in my system from Western

1952
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:53,760
Magic. and she was she was kind of

1953
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,400
going, "Oh, this is new. Oh, what's

1954
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,120
this?" And it was it was kind of trying

1955
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:03,360
I spent the first three days trying to

1956
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:05,120
build up a way for us to have uh a

1957
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,600
language in which we could communicate

1958
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,400
because we were coming from from such

1959
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,159
different worlds. Yeah. Um they say that

1960
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,199
everyone who does kind of encounters

1961
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:17,840
with a mother views her in a different

1962
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:20,480
visual form. What was it for you? I had

1963
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,480
a lot of serpents. I had a lot of snake

1964
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,120
stuff like she came with a lot of like

1965
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,719
kind of Anaconda snake material as in

1966
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:31,440
she was a snake herself. Yeah, she was a

1967
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:33,760
snake. Yeah. Gotcha. Um but it was it

1968
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:36,719
was a very powerful experience. It's not

1969
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,880
my medicine like in that it's not

1970
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:43,600
something that I will necessarily return

1971
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:45,280
to. I'm very I feel very privileged to

1972
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,679
have had the experience and the

1973
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,920
encounter, but that's not where my work

1974
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:55,600
lies. like I I know what my work is. Um

1975
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:58,880
but I think that the the impact of

1976
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,000
Iawaska on the spiritual development of

1977
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,440
the world is

1978
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,880
profound and I think it's only just

1979
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:08,239
started. Yeah, I think many many human

1980
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,840
beings all over the world are going to

1981
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:12,480
discover Iaska over the course of their

1982
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,480
lifetime. But of course we live in a

1983
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,960
society where uh there's a lot of

1984
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,040
preconceived notions about mindaltering

1985
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,280
substances. because that's what we're

1986
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:25,080
told by society and in no way are we

1987
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:27,760
promoting the use of harmful substances

1988
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,920
like and mind you I think IA can be

1989
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,199
harmful in excess and if you are doing

1990
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,800
it in an unguided manner

1991
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,719
you need a shaman to be able to do it

1992
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,159
you need to do it in its purest form and

1993
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,800
you need to do it with some kind of

1994
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:43,120
intention attached to your ceremony my

1995
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,679
question to you Peter is that you've

1996
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:50,199
already interacted

1997
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:53,440
with beings from other realms M um other

1998
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:55,280
than mother Iaska, could you interact

1999
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,400
with beings from other realms as well?

2000
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,600
Yeah, I think it's um I think she's such

2001
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:04,000
a powerful um spirit to encounter. I

2002
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:07,080
think you can I think you can shortcut

2003
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:11,280
years and years of personal work by by

2004
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:14,960
by going and learning from Iawaska. But

2005
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:17,040
as you said um as you said earlier um

2006
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,120
there are dangers with this and you were

2007
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:21,400
talking about the the dangers of western

2008
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:25,040
magic and whether you whether I' I'd

2009
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:28,320
seen people who it had gone wrong for.

2010
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:32,239
Probably the worst the worst person that

2011
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:37,120
I've seen from a spiritual perspective

2012
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:41,040
was um was a woman who had gone and

2013
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:45,520
drunk aaska and um apprenticed with a

2014
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:50,360
shaman and taken a lot a lot a lot a lot

2015
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:54,000
of of of plant drugs in that in that um

2016
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:56,120
process. And to me, she was the most

2017
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,960
spiritually damaged person I've ever

2018
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,719
seen.

2019
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:04,560
So, it is important to have a shaman,

2020
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,800
but it's also important to be aware that

2021
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,960
not all shamans have your best interests

2022
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,400
at heart.

2023
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:14,400
That was her mistake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2024
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,600
She made a very bad mistake. When we're

2025
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,040
talking about Iaska, we're talking about

2026
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,280
shamans. This is their version of

2027
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:24,639
tantra. They use plant medicine as well.

2028
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,920
Um the active molecule in Iawaska is DMT

2029
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:30,400
in the same way that cannabis contains

2030
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,840
THC. Uh now DMT can also be smoked in a

2031
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,040
synthetic form. And Joe Rogan keeps

2032
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,679
talking about this in his podcast. Um

2033
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:41,880
they say that everyone who smokes DMT

2034
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:45,679
enters a realm where they get to meet

2035
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:47,920
interdimensional creatures or beings.

2036
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:51,520
Yeah. Interdimensional beings that are

2037
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,600
not malevolent. Uh, and it's a very

2038
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,760
intense experience for about 20 minutes.

2039
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Yeah. And then you come out. Have you

2040
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,320
done that as well? No. But the the

2041
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,639
problem that I see with DMT is exactly

2042
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,440
what you described is that you're shot

2043
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,960
into this reality and everything happens

2044
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,719
very quickly and you come out of it.

2045
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,199
It's very difficult to bring something

2046
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:13,199
back. And as as a magician, like I'm

2047
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:14,639
always with an experience like this, I

2048
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:17,600
always want to bring something back with

2049
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:21,280
me from that world to work on or to deal

2050
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,880
with. And I'm not sure that smoking DMT

2051
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,440
enables you to do that in a very

2052
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,040
effective fashion. Whereas the beauty of

2053
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:33,679
Iawaska, what I found very helpful was

2054
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:36,159
that the first um maybe hour of having

2055
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:38,880
ingested the drug, you're in a very um

2056
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:41,440
you're in a light state where you can do

2057
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,600
a lot of work. You can get a lot of work

2058
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:46,320
done before the really powerful effects

2059
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,800
kick in. It's quite it's quite malleable

2060
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:51,440
at that stage with the ikaros and the

2061
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,920
songs and you're able to you're able to

2062
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:56,159
to process and do a lot of selfwork in

2063
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,639
that period before before things become

2064
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,880
much more intense and I think you missed

2065
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:04,400
that with the smoke DMT. I think it's

2066
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,320
just it's just too rapid. Okay. Are you

2067
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,800
comfortable sharing what your intention

2068
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,560
behind doing the Iawaska was? Yeah, I

2069
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,120
was doing a few things. One, as I say, I

2070
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:17,120
was um I wanted to be there for my

2071
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:20,239
friend. um because I was concerned that

2072
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:22,239
he was going to die of the condition

2073
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:25,280
that he was having and he was going

2074
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:28,880
through this major health crisis. And it

2075
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:31,679
was very important for me knowing um

2076
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:35,600
knowing my strengths and my ability to

2077
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:38,080
be there to be present for him while he

2078
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,560
was going through that crisis. And what

2079
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:44,400
I found with Iawaska was

2080
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,280
that I've been working on I've been

2081
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,000
working on myself for a long

2082
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:53,360
time. So there weren't any huge

2083
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,400
surprises for me in what Iaska was able

2084
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:59,199
to show me about myself or other things.

2085
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,920
I learned some useful things. I learned

2086
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:03,760
some things about animals. I learned

2087
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,280
some things about plants and my

2088
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:10,320
relationship to these different spirits.

2089
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:12,400
I learned a lot about the jungle. Um,

2090
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:15,199
but the most important thing that I

2091
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:18,320
probably learned from Iawaska is that I

2092
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:20,080
already have my path. Gotcha. It

2093
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,679
confirmed your reality. It confirmed

2094
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,639
what I was doing. What did you pick up

2095
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:27,280
about animals? Um, well, I had a few

2096
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:30,159
experiences with some of the animals in

2097
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:33,840
the jungle. I won't name them just out

2098
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:36,719
of discretion, but the relationship that

2099
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:39,840
I had with the animals that I

2100
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:42,800
encountered in the jungle both during

2101
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,960
the dieta and then subsequently during

2102
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:48,639
the iawaska experiences where they

2103
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:51,520
returned to me and taught me things was

2104
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:54,440
extremely valuable. You know we consider

2105
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:59,520
snakes divine in India. Yeah.

2106
01:29:54,440 --> 01:30:02,960
again we had um it's said that there was

2107
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:05,360
an ancient race of higher beings

2108
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,880
uh called the nagas

2109
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,239
and nag in Sanskrit means snake. So they

2110
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,679
say that modern day snakes are actually

2111
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:14,159
descendants of those higher beings.

2112
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:16,880
Yeah. But they've kind of almost like

2113
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:18,639
gone back on the evolutionary ladder.

2114
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:21,440
And it it's kind of like what

2115
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:24,320
chimpanzees are to human beings, snakes

2116
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:26,800
are to nagas. Yeah. Uh so they they're

2117
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:29,040
cousins but little back backward in the

2118
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,280
evolutionary ladder. Yeah. But nagas

2119
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:34,719
themselves are believed to have left the

2120
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:36,960
earth or are on earth but are evolved

2121
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:39,800
enough to keep themselves hidden perhaps

2122
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,800
in the oceans perhaps deep inside

2123
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:45,120
forests. Uh

2124
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:48,320
and they are revered they are prayed to

2125
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,040
in some parts of India. Uh and they

2126
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:53,520
associated with the god Shiva. Mhm. Uh

2127
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:57,120
which is also my personal daty like what

2128
01:30:53,520 --> 01:31:00,960
Babylon is to you. Yeah. Uh Shiva is to

2129
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:03,280
me. Each each Hindu child has their own

2130
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,880
favorites. Uh and at different phases of

2131
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:08,239
their life, they're drawn to one more

2132
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:10,000
than the others. In my late 20s, I've

2133
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:12,239
discovered the power of Shiva in a very

2134
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,880
intense way. And there's a form of Shiva

2135
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:17,360
called Khal Beherov. And they say that

2136
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,199
generally behav is waking up in India

2137
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,679
again. It's been a dity which is

2138
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:24,560
slightly dormant. Uh but it's a very

2139
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:28,320
powerful deity that eventually leads you

2140
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:33,080
to ma or the mother. It it can lead you

2141
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:36,719
to kali u or at least the divine

2142
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:39,360
feminine. Behav is represented by a

2143
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:42,639
black dog in many cases.

2144
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:44,480
uh so is Anubis the Egyptian deity and a

2145
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:48,080
friend of mine Rajashinandi the expert

2146
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:50,719
on tantra he thinks that there's way too

2147
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:54,239
many parallels between Anubis and Beerov

2148
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:55,920
for them to be two different uh deities

2149
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:58,760
he thinks that beerov expresses itself

2150
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,360
in Egyptian culture as Anubis

2151
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,920
um I'd love to know if you know anything

2152
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:06,880
about black dogs because there's another

2153
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,639
plant medicine called datura which is

2154
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,520
also in Sanad

2155
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:14,400
associated with Shiva. It's used by

2156
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,880
advanced tantra practitioners and aguris

2157
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:19,280
but it's a very very very dangerous

2158
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,600
plant medicine to use. Yeah. I will let

2159
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,199
you take this tangent forward wherever

2160
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:28,920
you wish. Yeah.

2161
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:32,239
The so um let's do dura briefly.

2162
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:35,760
Um all of the solenacia alkyoids the the

2163
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:37,280
the the alkyoid that you find in dura

2164
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:41,760
you find in a range of the European

2165
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:46,960
witchcraft plants. So you find it in um

2166
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:48,960
uh belladona henbane um taturura these

2167
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,880
are all these all have this this the

2168
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,239
same problem. the the difficulty with

2169
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,159
using them as you point out is that they

2170
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:59,199
are the doses in them are very difficult

2171
01:32:56,159 --> 01:33:02,080
to get correct like the the difference

2172
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,280
between like one one flower and another

2173
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,520
one seed and another it can be

2174
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:11,440
significant. The they're a very very

2175
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,920
dangerous plant to consume because

2176
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:16,639
they're disassociative. So, it's very

2177
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,360
difficult to tell the difference between

2178
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:21,760
what's happening around you and what's

2179
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,840
real and what's not real. So, you can

2180
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,840
you can get yourself into a lot of

2181
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,480
danger with these plants. And I would

2182
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,239
never recommend people to ingest or work

2183
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,120
with the plants in those ways. But

2184
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:34,639
clearly, they've been used in witchcraft

2185
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:38,320
traditions. And I know people who use

2186
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:42,400
them in limited forms like as a salve,

2187
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:46,560
as a topical salve. Um um the other one

2188
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:49,520
is uh uh mandre mandreora. You can

2189
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:52,639
extract mandre in wine. I've worked with

2190
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:57,360
mandreora extracted in wine as a as a

2191
01:33:52,639 --> 01:34:00,320
ritual tool. Um but these are these are

2192
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:02,159
quite quite quite rightly like put to

2193
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,440
one side as dangerous plants. I' I'd

2194
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:05,840
recommend if people are on a spiritual

2195
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:07,840
path that they that they look at Iawaska

2196
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:10,639
rather than looking at those those kind

2197
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:13,120
of things. black dogs. In the same way

2198
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:16,159
that people who've experienced Iawaska

2199
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:19,280
experienced the female dity, they say

2200
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:21,520
that everyone who has experienced Datura

2201
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,760
experiences the presence of a black dog.

2202
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,600
Right. So yeah, I'd love to know what

2203
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,320
you think of black dogs. Um so we have

2204
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,239
black dogs in um in a lot of English

2205
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:32,880
folklore. We get a black dog appearing

2206
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:34,400
as a portent of like everything gets

2207
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,040
called the devil because we had all of

2208
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,840
our things leveled. But but spectral

2209
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,719
black dogs are very much part of the

2210
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,280
English landscape. We've we've got

2211
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,120
hundreds of accounts of those over time.

2212
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:50,000
What do you mean by spectral black dogs?

2213
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,679
They may or may not be real. Ah, they

2214
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,280
may or may not be real. Perhaps a

2215
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,320
spiritual being. Perhaps a spiritual

2216
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:59,600
being. Yeah. In in my eyes, it's a it's

2217
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:01,600
an element of behav or this anubis or I

2218
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,760
don't know what the what the European

2219
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:07,440
equivalent dity would be. Yeah. We don't

2220
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:10,159
have a um Hecart is sometimes associated

2221
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:12,000
with the black dog. Hecart. Yeah. The

2222
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:14,239
Greek goddess of witchcraft. Greek

2223
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,600
goddess. Yeah. Because people would

2224
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:18,560
traditionally sacrifice dogs to her at

2225
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:22,080
crossroads. That was the traditional

2226
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:24,080
offering. Sacrifice dogs.

2227
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:26,320
Okay. You said that a lot of the

2228
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,040
European practitioners, you know, will

2229
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:32,320
always keep a Ganesha Morti. Yeah. Yeah.

2230
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,920
Ganesha is everywhere. like it's it's

2231
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:38,400
very common for people to have it

2232
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:42,000
because he's so he's so benithic that

2233
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:43,679
people uh he gets everywhere regardless

2234
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,360
of whether you whether you're looking

2235
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:49,440
for Garnesh or not. He's he's he's he

2236
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:52,000
seems to be one of these one of these

2237
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,920
gods that is out in the world and is

2238
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,320
happy to talk to people from different

2239
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:59,120
traditions. They in in sanatanam they

2240
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,760
say that any dity which has an animal

2241
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:04,560
face is easily reachable as compared to

2242
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,639
the deities with human faces. Yeah. Uh

2243
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,760
it's not so much about hierarchy as much

2244
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:12,199
as it is about accessibility. So he's a

2245
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:15,040
very accessible dity. Yeah. And in

2246
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:17,440
Sanatan I've done countless podcasts on

2247
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,239
the subject of Ganesha. The two core

2248
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:22,080
learnings I have is that he is the

2249
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:25,360
remover of obstacles and that's what

2250
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:27,600
Hindus pray to him for. And secondly u

2251
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,760
he's the deity of the lowest chakra the

2252
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,920
root chakra which allows you to ground

2253
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,400
yourself and be stable. So before we

2254
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,560
begin a large ritual like someone's

2255
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:40,320
marriage or a very large haven it

2256
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:44,480
usually begins with a prayer to Ganesha

2257
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:47,360
to to stabilize you and to stabilize the

2258
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:49,360
uh geography that you're in. Yeah.

2259
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,199
Similar to why you use Ganesha. Yeah.

2260
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:54,320
Yeah. That's that's that's what he gets

2261
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:58,679
used for by by by a lot of people. He's

2262
01:36:54,320 --> 01:37:02,320
he's very popular. He's very popular.

2263
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:05,119
Um I think partly because when we're

2264
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:07,040
exploring the western tradition, we're

2265
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:08,639
looking at a broken tradition. We're

2266
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,719
looking at a tradition which has which

2267
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,119
is strong in some areas. So we're we're

2268
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:16,400
strong in terms of magical books. We're

2269
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:18,960
weak in terms of like necessarily deity

2270
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,760
and people's connection to deity. So

2271
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:26,400
when people are looking for that then

2272
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:29,600
they then GES just fits this fits this

2273
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:33,199
gap and is hap seems happy to do so. And

2274
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:37,119
so for people to to to have a statue and

2275
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:40,239
to make puja too to just do small

2276
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:43,199
offerings you know you know sweets and

2277
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:45,480
incense and candles and like it's a it's

2278
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:50,320
a good benefitic for people to have

2279
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:54,000
around. So he's he's he's found a place.

2280
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:57,040
You know, most Sanatanis do not pray to

2281
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,760
Ganesha every single day. And you're a

2282
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:01,840
western practitioner of European magic

2283
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,480
who prays to Ganesha every day. Not

2284
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:07,440
every day, but like I I I have a I have

2285
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,360
Ganesha and I I I I burnt candles from

2286
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,360
him like most days. Yeah. Gotcha. Do you

2287
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,560
use mantras as well? I I don't use

2288
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,480
mantra with them because I haven't been

2289
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,159
given a mantra, but I could use mantra

2290
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:18,800
with it. So there are mantras which you

2291
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:22,000
need to be given. Yeah. By a guru or

2292
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,320
someone who um has practiced with the

2293
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,679
mantra and these are tantic mantras. You

2294
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,840
can't just use a tantic mantra and

2295
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,360
expect that it'll work or it can

2296
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,159
actually cause chaos in your life if you

2297
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:35,440
use it. But there are softer mantras,

2298
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:37,440
easier ones that you can use. Yeah. Um

2299
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,800
so the common one I I'll write this down

2300
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,880
and send it to you, but it's a longer

2301
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,800
mantra. Sure. But I have always noticed

2302
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,040
that when you attach a longer mantra to

2303
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,840
a dity and you say that mantra with

2304
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:49,760
reverence as well as after you've

2305
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,360
understood the meaning of it, your

2306
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,280
connection with the dity increases

2307
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:55,360
further and the daties even more present

2308
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,280
in your life. Yeah. Well, that would be

2309
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,560
a wonderful exchange. Yeah. The mantra

2310
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,159
is a little long. I'll say it if you

2311
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,000
want because I also want to say it in

2312
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:05,040
this particular episode as a thank you

2313
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,040
to him. Yeah.

2314
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:17,199
in the

2315
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:18,880
pronunciation just like mine. So, uh you

2316
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,840
with with mantras if you're saying it

2317
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:23,040
out loud, you have to get the

2318
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:26,280
pronunciation right. Um and ideally get

2319
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:31,520
it right even in your own mind. But

2320
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:36,320
um 108 times every day will cause that

2321
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,840
dity to come closer to you. Yeah. U 108

2322
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,560
is a very important number when it comes

2323
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:43,280
to mantras. It's one entire mala for us.

2324
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,199
Mala is like a rosary. Yeah. Uh and of

2325
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,600
course then there's shorter mantras like

2326
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:49,520
om namashai which is like the easiest

2327
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,440
mantra for shiva. But you can also use

2328
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,840
omniva to like meditate. So we just sit

2329
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,600
in meditation that's a soft mantra and

2330
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,600
then there's much more fierce mantras as

2331
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,280
well and there's a spectrum. Yeah. So

2332
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,600
even I've not reached the most fierce

2333
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:05,040
mantras but I have been given mantras

2334
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:06,800
which are not for everyone. Not fierce

2335
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:10,239
but they're like kind of the beginning

2336
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:12,800
they're the second level. Yeah. Uh and

2337
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:15,280
not for everyone honestly causes a lot

2338
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,600
of it it causes challenges in your

2339
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:19,679
material life as well. Um so it's

2340
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,400
testing your strength. If you're able to

2341
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:24,719
pass those tests, you'll come out good.

2342
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:27,440
And yeah, but Ganesha is a soft deity

2343
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:29,159
and and very very friendly, very nice.

2344
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,760
It's kind of

2345
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:33,760
like imagine the relationship you have

2346
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,760
with a at least for me because in

2347
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,880
sanatanam you share personal

2348
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,719
relationships with the dati and uh for

2349
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,639
me it almost gives me a younger sibling

2350
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:46,080
kind of energy though I know it's

2351
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,159
Ganesha it's a god but uh it's there's a

2352
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,800
loving younger sibling stabilizing me

2353
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:52,880
keeping me happy but yeah I'm sorry I'm

2354
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,280
just like flowing away into my emotions

2355
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,480
perfect yeah yeah they they also say

2356
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:01,199
that emotions matter a lot in Sanad are

2357
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:03,119
emotions a part of your magic? Yeah, I

2358
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:05,040
think so. Yeah. Yeah. How do you use

2359
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,960
emotion? I think unless you're

2360
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,520
emotionally involved with something, it

2361
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,320
doesn't become alive. Like you have to

2362
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,639
you have to engage every aspect of

2363
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,880
yourself with these things. So if you're

2364
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,880
not if you're not tapping into your

2365
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,719
emotions, if you're not allowing these

2366
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,639
things to rise out of you, then you're

2367
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:27,400
you're probably not practicing. Yeah.

2368
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:29,400
Um, what else would you like to know

2369
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,080
from Indian

2370
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:35,119
culture? Like in your heart, you've been

2371
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:37,440
practicing magic for 30 years now. Sure.

2372
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,880
But you're a lifelong student. Yeah. So,

2373
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:40,239
what are you trying to understand

2374
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,920
through Indian culture? Like how can

2375
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:45,280
Indian culture help someone like

2376
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:51,320
yourself or your community?

2377
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:54,920
Well, I think it helps to to see uh an

2378
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:57,360
animistic um pantheistic

2379
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:00,520
flourishing deity. an example of the way

2380
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:04,080
that people the way that people

2381
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:07,920
are have a complete it seems like such a

2382
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:10,320
a full universe that you inhabit because

2383
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,600
of your understanding of the the way

2384
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:15,440
that deities are are are ever present in

2385
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,040
your lives are ever present in the way

2386
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,679
that you do your lives the way that you

2387
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,960
approach um the way that you approach

2388
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:25,760
ritual the way that you approach every

2389
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:27,280
aspect it's it's so wonderful to see

2390
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,800
when you when you live in a largely

2391
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:33,280
secular culture to see people with that

2392
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,119
level of practice and difference you

2393
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,080
know that you have a culture that

2394
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:40,000
contains many different kinds of

2395
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:41,600
practitioners all of whom are are are

2396
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,159
walking their own paths towards

2397
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,880
something. So the example of India I

2398
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:48,360
think is is so powerful for us in the

2399
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:52,000
west to

2400
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:54,880
see what our tradition could become

2401
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,880
because we're really we're really

2402
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,719
probably

2403
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:01,440
only one or two hundred years into like

2404
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:03,520
the the rebirth of the the western

2405
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:06,400
tradition coming out of like the

2406
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,280
wreckage of a broken Christianity and

2407
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,639
trying to

2408
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:13,080
understand who we are in the world and

2409
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:15,719
what we have to offer.

2410
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:19,920
And I think we can learn from all

2411
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:22,159
cultures because we're all we're all in

2412
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,920
this journey together. One of the things

2413
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:26,679
we celebrate in India when it comes to

2414
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,040
sanatan dharm is the fact that it's

2415
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:31,440
survived over hundreds of thousands of

2416
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:33,840
years and that's what all of us believe.

2417
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:35,600
Um I do believe that your culture is

2418
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,239
hundreds of thousands of years old as

2419
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:41,600
well. probably we originated from the

2420
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:43,080
same origin point on some level. Perhaps

2421
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,600
some of your

2422
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,639
ancestors were as sanadani as my

2423
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:53,040
ancestors. Um but I believe that over

2424
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:55,199
the course of time some pieces of your

2425
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:57,360
cultural story have been stripped off or

2426
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:59,719
destroyed. Yeah. And I think that people

2427
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:04,639
like yourself are going

2428
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:06,199
to rebuild those lost cultural pieces of

2429
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:10,239
tradition.

2430
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:13,400
Um, Peter, I invite you to India. I want

2431
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:17,360
to thank you for this spectacular

2432
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:19,520
conversation because honestly being very

2433
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,040
transparent with you, I almost feel like

2434
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,159
I got a message from Ganesha saying,

2435
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,719
"Hey, this is a good end to the

2436
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:26,320
episode." So, just feel like stopping.

2437
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,520
No, that's wonderful for Vir and thanks

2438
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,199
thanks for sharing your time and

2439
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:32,000
knowledge. It's been it's been great.

2440
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:33,520
It's very rare that I do a four and a

2441
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,920
half, five hour conversation with

2442
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,440
anyone. It's even rarer that I feel a

2443
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:41,440
higher energy level after doing the

2444
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:44,639
5-hour conversation. So man, God bless

2445
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,400
you and thank you for being a part of

2446
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,600
this podcast. Thank you for being in my

2447
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:52,880
life. Uh I've really prayed to the

2448
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:56,159
divine to send someone like you into the

2449
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,360
world of the Reanir Show and just

2450
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:00,080
feeling very blessed to be in your

2451
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:01,920
presence because I feel I've not even

2452
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,920
tapped into 5% of everything you've seen

2453
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,840
and done in your life. That's great. So,

2454
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,440
thank you

2455
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:09,679
Sophie. Thank you. That was the episode

2456
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,119
for today, ladies and gentlemen. Give us

2457
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,560
feedback on both the episodes. And if

2458
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:15,119

2459
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,600
conversation that we had with Peter,

2460
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:19,679
please go check it out. Um, it's as

2461
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,440
heady as this one. It sets some solid

2462
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,440
context for this episode as well. Do

2463
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:26,639
send in your guest recommendations. We

2464
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:28,480
love covering the horror genre on this

2465
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,080
show and it's a genre that's present in

2466
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:32,560
every single country all over the world.

2467
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:34,719
