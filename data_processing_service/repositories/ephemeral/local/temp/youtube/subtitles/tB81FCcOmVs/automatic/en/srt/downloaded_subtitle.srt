00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
a very sad incident has happened just a short while ago.  You

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
all must be knowing about Ahmedabad Airport

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
which is known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,080
International Airport.  A

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,800
huge crash has happened just next to the airport.  The

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,080
Air India plane

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
carrying 242 passengers has crashed.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,160
And whenever such big crashes happen, the

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
chances of survival here are very low.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
But hopefully, the

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,240
more people who can survive here, the better it will be.  An

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,920

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,840
alert was continuously issued in all the surrounding hospitals.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,600
You can see this news.  Air India

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,600
flight to London with 242 passengers crashes

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,360
near Ahmedabad airport.  Look, I will try to

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
tell you the information I have so far.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,079
First of all,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
which airline is here? Air India.  And if

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
you see, the flight route here was

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,559
going from Ahmedabad to London.  Look,

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
you all know that there is Sardar

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,680
Vallabh Bhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad and

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
from there it was flying to Gatwick Airport in London

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,559
and

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,280
if I tell you exactly,

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,520
it took off at 1:55 and as soon as it took off, it

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
crashed, I will tell you about it later

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,680
but which aircraft was involved in it, so

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,760
basically Air India's Boeing 787

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,560
Dreamliner, you all must know that

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,400
Dreamliner is currently one of the most

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
reliable aircraft in the world.   It is a

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
very wide bodied aircraft.   It is

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,960
used for long journeys.  So

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,640
this particular aircraft has

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
crashed here.  And in this you

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,360
can see that initially the news was coming that there would be

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,040
130-134 passengers.  But

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,720
exactly you can see that the

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,520
confirmation has come that 242 people were inside it

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,600
and it crashed immediately after take off

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
and

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
if I tell you the location of the crash, if you

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
look carefully at the map, this is the Sardar Vallabhbhai

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Patel International Airport and you all know that

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,640
this is the runway, if you look at it, then

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
most likely, as far as things are understood till now,

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
this flight would have taken off from the runway here

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,079
and

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,159
just after take off, that means I will show you its

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,640
video.  Just a short

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,720
while later, it crashed as it took off here.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
This area which you are seeing,

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
this area here is

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,000
basically known as Meghani Nagar area

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,319
and this particular crash happened here.  In

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
fact this is an 18 second clip.

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,959
Look at this carefully and you will understand

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
how the height of this aircraft was only

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,280
a few feet.  Meaning,

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
he did not take any attitude.  You watch this video first.   I

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,060
 

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,129
mean, when

66
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,129
[music] goes

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
all the way, then from this video you might

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,080
feel like the flight is

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
actually landing near you.  But

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
actually this video shows

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
that the take off did not happen properly.   That

72
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,640
means, if any flight has to take off,

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,560
it initially requires a lot of

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,959
thrust so that it can

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,040
fly well and reach a particular attitude.

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
So, in all the news that is coming till now, it is being

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
told that it must have

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,599
achieved an altitude of only 100 feet

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
and from there the fire started falling down and

80
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,319
you have seen how the entire

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,239
smoke-like structure was seen rising and the

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,480
eyewitnesses here said

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,879
that very heavy smoke was being emanated from near the

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,440
Adani Managed Airport which is

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,519
nearby and multiple fire tenders, emergency

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
response team, again on an immediate basis,

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
you can see that

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,440
from far away from Ahmedabad, this entire smoke, black

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,519
smoke, was visible here.

90
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
Fire and

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,440
rescue teams were dispatched as emergency responses.   The

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
local police has cordoned off the entire area.

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,599
Look, there is still no

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
exact clear information as to

95
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
whether it ultimately fell in a crowded place or not.

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
What exactly happened here

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,680
and those who are by standards, the residents,

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
they initially

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
tried to help.  Until the fire tender and police

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
arrived to help.  As far as

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,439
casualties are concerned, again the

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
matter of concern is that whenever

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,599

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,920
such crashes take place across the world, the chances of survival become

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,799
very low.  Because again

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,720
you see there were 242 passengers here.  We hope

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
that the more we

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
can save lives here, the better it will be.  In fact, it is being said

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,959
that he has been immediately sent to the nearby civil

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,199
hospital, Sardar Vallabh Bhai

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,520
Patel Hospital in Ahmedabad.

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
And till now the numbers have

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,160
not been verified as to how many people have died exactly.

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
You can see this on an immediate basis.

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
Air India

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,360
tweeted here in which it is said that flight

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,240
AI 171, this is flight number AI 171

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,960
operating from Ahmedabad London Gateway Airport was

119
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
involved in an incident today.  Now

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
look, this is not an incident, it is a complete

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,919
crash.  So regarding this, Air

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
India says that we will keep

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
giving you whatever information we have regarding this very soon.

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,680
But look, the question that arises is

125
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,000
what could be the cause here?  Look, whenever

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
such crashes happen, there can be four or five

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,400
main reasons for it.  The first is bird

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
strike.  If you look at it this way, Ahmedabad

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,040
airport is near urban and semi-

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,520
rural zone where bird activity is quite

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,520
common.  But I don't know, that means from the video

132
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
you just saw, do you think that a

133
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
bird strike has happened or not, that will

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
ultimately be known through investigation.  Is there

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
any possibility because of this

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,000
?  Can't say anything right now.  As

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,160
far as the question is concerned, to a large extent, some of the

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
possibilities could be due to engine failure.  This is a

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,479
mechanical and technical

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
fault because as soon as the plane took

141
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
off, it could not achieve a particular attitude

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
and immediately crashed here.

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
So most likely there might have been an

144
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
engine failure.  There might have been a technical

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,240
fault.  Due to which, attitude

146
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
loss happened very fast and it crashed immediately.

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
As far as the question is whether there might have been a pilot

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
error?  Again, I can't say anything right now.   In

149
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
fact, from what I was hearing and reading the news,

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,520
it is being said that the main

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,759
pilot had 8200 hours of flight

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,080
experience.  Meaning, which happens a lot.

153
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,400
So it does not seem that there were any pilots

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,960
due to whom any loss might have occurred.

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,199
Maybe if there is a technical fault.  Then there

156
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
might be some pilot error.  Meaning again there

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
can be many possibilities.  Can't say anything right now.

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
If you look at most of the regions, there may be

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
engine failure as far as the weather is

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
concerned because most of the flight crashes,

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,440
plane crashes

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
also happen due to the weather but in the scene that you just saw,

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,680
you can clearly see that there was

164
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,639
no bad weather of any kind there

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,479
in Ahmedabad.  Could there be a sabotage terror attack

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,000
?  Again there can be many possibilities.

167
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
That is what I am saying to you.  That

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
can ultimately be found out through investigation.  In

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
fact, let me tell you about the past

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,280
experience here, like Indian

171
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,000
Airlines Flight 113, in 1988, it also

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,479
crashed near your Ahmedabad Airport.

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,960
And in this you can see that there were 135 people on board out of which

174
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,960
133 died.  And the

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,360
cost here was found to be

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,600
pilot error and poor visibility.  The time

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,919
I am talking about is 1988.  Apart from this,

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
a recent accident happened in 2020.  This is

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,440
basically a flight that was over run in Kozhikode in South India.

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,000

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,560
Basically the airport in Kojikot is a

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,599
table top airport.

183
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,759
Basically the runway there is very small.

184
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
Due to which the flight crossed the runway

185
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,080
and here you can see 21

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,039
fertilities were being reported.  So its

187
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
impact loss again is borne by the families

188
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,639
and it will be a matter of great concern for them.

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
Probably no one would have even imagined

190
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
that their family members would be travelling by

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
flight and such an

192
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
accident could happen, that too just

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
close to the airport.  And what to expect next, most

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
likely the DGCA team and the

195
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
investigation will be conducted thoroughly.  An

196
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,960
attempt will be made to recover the black box of the flight.  The list of passengers will be

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
released very soon, which will reveal

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,319
which nationalities the passengers belonged to.   The

200
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,479
official statement is yet to come.  It will

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
also be tweeted by PM Modi ji.

202
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,639
This will be something to watch.  But again there is

203
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,400
very sad news here.  Whatever was the

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,479
recent update, I have tried to tell you here.

205
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,080
Whatever important thing

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,960
comes up, I will definitely bring you videos related to it.

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,520
