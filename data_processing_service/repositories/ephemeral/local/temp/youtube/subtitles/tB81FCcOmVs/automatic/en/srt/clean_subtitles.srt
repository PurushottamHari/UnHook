Hello Friends.  Friends, a very sad incident has happened just a short while ago.  You all must be knowing about Ahmedabad Airport which is known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.  A huge crash has happened just next to the airport.  The Air India plane carrying 242 passengers has crashed. And whenever such big crashes happen, the chances of survival here are very low. But hopefully, the more people who can survive here, the better it will be.  An alert was continuously issued in all the surrounding hospitals. You can see this news.  Air India flight to London with 242 passengers crashes near Ahmedabad airport.  Look, I will try to tell you the information I have so far. First of all, which airline is here? Air India.  And if you see, the flight route here was going from Ahmedabad to London.  Look, you all know that there is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad and from there it was flying to Gatwick Airport in London and if I tell you exactly, it took off at 1:55 and as soon as it took off, it crashed, I will tell you about it later but which aircraft was involved in it, so basically Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner, you all must know that Dreamliner is currently one of the most reliable aircraft in the world.   It is a very wide bodied aircraft.   It is used for long journeys.  So this particular aircraft has crashed here.  And in this you can see that initially the news was coming that there would be 130-134 passengers.  But exactly you can see that the confirmation has come that 242 people were inside it and it crashed immediately after take off and if I tell you the location of the crash, if you look carefully at the map, this is the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport and you all know that this is the runway, if you look at it, then most likely, as far as things are understood till now, this flight would have taken off from the runway here and just after take off, that means I will show you its video.  Just a short while later, it crashed as it took off here. This area which you are seeing, this area here is basically known as Meghani Nagar area and this particular crash happened here.  In fact this is an 18 second clip. Look at this carefully and you will understand how the height of this aircraft was only a few feet.  Meaning, he did not take any attitude.  You watch this video first.   I mean, when [music] goes all the way, then from this video you might feel like the flight is actually landing near you.  But actually this video shows that the take off did not happen properly.   That means, if any flight has to take off, it initially requires a lot of thrust so that it can fly well and reach a particular attitude. So, in all the news that is coming till now, it is being told that it must have achieved an altitude of only 100 feet and from there the fire started falling down and you have seen how the entire smoke-like structure was seen rising and the eyewitnesses here said that very heavy smoke was being emanated from near the Adani Managed Airport which is nearby and multiple fire tenders, emergency response team, again on an immediate basis, you can see that from far away from Ahmedabad, this entire smoke, black smoke, was visible here. Fire and rescue teams were dispatched as emergency responses.   The local police has cordoned off the entire area. Look, there is still no exact clear information as to whether it ultimately fell in a crowded place or not. What exactly happened here and those who are by standards, the residents, they initially tried to help.  Until the fire tender and police arrived to help.  As far as casualties are concerned, again the matter of concern is that whenever such crashes take place across the world, the chances of survival become very low.  Because again you see there were 242 passengers here.  We hope that the more we can save lives here, the better it will be.  In fact, it is being said that he has been immediately sent to the nearby civil hospital, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital in Ahmedabad. And till now the numbers have not been verified as to how many people have died exactly. You can see this on an immediate basis. Air India tweeted here in which it is said that flight AI 171, this is flight number AI 171 operating from Ahmedabad London Gateway Airport was involved in an incident today.  Now look, this is not an incident, it is a complete crash.  So regarding this, Air India says that we will keep giving you whatever information we have regarding this very soon. But look, the question that arises is what could be the cause here?  Look, whenever such crashes happen, there can be four or five main reasons for it.  The first is bird strike.  If you look at it this way, Ahmedabad airport is near urban and semi- rural zone where bird activity is quite common.  But I don't know, that means from the video you just saw, do you think that a bird strike has happened or not, that will ultimately be known through investigation.  Is there any possibility because of this ?  Can't say anything right now.  As far as the question is concerned, to a large extent, some of the possibilities could be due to engine failure.  This is a mechanical and technical fault because as soon as the plane took off, it could not achieve a particular attitude and immediately crashed here. So most likely there might have been an engine failure.  There might have been a technical fault.  Due to which, attitude loss happened very fast and it crashed immediately. As far as the question is whether there might have been a pilot error?  Again, I can't say anything right now.   In fact, from what I was hearing and reading the news, it is being said that the main pilot had 8200 hours of flight experience.  Meaning, which happens a lot. So it does not seem that there were any pilots due to whom any loss might have occurred. Maybe if there is a technical fault.  Then there might be some pilot error.  Meaning again there can be many possibilities.  Can't say anything right now. If you look at most of the regions, there may be engine failure as far as the weather is concerned because most of the flight crashes, plane crashes also happen due to the weather but in the scene that you just saw, you can clearly see that there was no bad weather of any kind there in Ahmedabad.  Could there be a sabotage terror attack ?  Again there can be many possibilities. That is what I am saying to you.  That can ultimately be found out through investigation.  In fact, let me tell you about the past experience here, like Indian Airlines Flight 113, in 1988, it also crashed near your Ahmedabad Airport. And in this you can see that there were 135 people on board out of which 133 died.  And the cost here was found to be pilot error and poor visibility.  The time I am talking about is 1988.  Apart from this, a recent accident happened in 2020.  This is basically a flight that was over run in Kozhikode in South India. Basically the airport in Kojikot is a table top airport. Basically the runway there is very small. Due to which the flight crossed the runway and here you can see 21 fertilities were being reported.  So its impact loss again is borne by the families and it will be a matter of great concern for them. Probably no one would have even imagined that their family members would be travelling by flight and such an accident could happen, that too just close to the airport.  And what to expect next, most likely the DGCA team and the investigation will be conducted thoroughly.  An attempt will be made to recover the black box of the flight.  The list of passengers will be released very soon, which will reveal which nationalities the passengers belonged to.   The official statement is yet to come.  It will also be tweeted by PM Modi ji. This will be something to watch.  But again there is very sad news here.  Whatever was the recent update, I have tried to tell you here.
