1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
The feminism movement didn't unite

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,560
women. It split women. I feel totally

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
listen. 50% of young women don't want to

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
have children. They're really

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,080
preoccupied with making money and

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,320
materialism. But we're still looking at

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
a society that is increasingly telling

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
women where they could be better. But

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,800
sometimes feminism expects women to be

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
prioritized and both sexes want the

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,560
privileges without the responsibilities.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
Can I just add we are producing women

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
and men who are and I'll tell you what I

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
mean by that. It'll be an interesting

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,079
discussion. We're joined by three

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
leading and outspoken voices in female

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,760
societal issues with very different

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
opinions to unpack the choices and

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
consequences women face in modern

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
society. The sexual revolution gave

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
women freedom. But things like the

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
washing machine, women entering the

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
labor force, the pill had enormous

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
social changes. For instance, it gave

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,320
the illusion that sex was

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
consequencefree. But the second wave of

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,360
the feminist movement was every woman

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,280
should want free sex. And yet 82% of

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,239
young women are depressed and anxious

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
after casual sexual encounters or every

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
woman should want to go out to work and

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
leave their children in daycare. But we

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
are doing terrible damage to our

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
children by putting them in daycare.

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
This strain of feminism has basically

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
aspired as much as possible to make

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
women like men. And now gender roles are

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
changing. And we've gone so far. So we

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,479
have women dominating men. How are we

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,720
dominating men? Oh my goodness. 60% of

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,960
college students are women.

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,960
dominating. No, let me finish. Young men

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
are afraid of women and the power they

44
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
have over them. Oh god. To blame

45
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,119
feminism for those things. I mean, it's

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
insane. But there are solutions. I'm

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,920
just going to jump in there and talk

48
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
about a report that came out in 2025,

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
and this was really shocking. What are

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,920
your thoughts about this? Okay, so first

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,920
of all,

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
this has always blown my mind a little

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,560
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,759
before we start? If you like the show

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
and you like what we do here and you

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,960
want to support us, the free simple way

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,799
that you can do just that is by hitting

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
the subscribe button. And my commitment

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
everything in my power, me and my team,

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
to make sure that this show is better

64
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
for you every single week. We'll listen

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
to your feedback. We'll find the guests

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,879
that you want me to speak to and we'll

67
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,879
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

68
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,879
much.

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's start with some introductions.

70
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Louise, what is your professional

71
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
background and what do I need to

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
understand and know about your

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
experiences that feed into your

74
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
perspective on this subject? So, my

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,080
professional background, I'm a

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,239
journalist. Um, I write about ideas for

77
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
a living. I don't have like a political

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
agenda. I'm just I just write and say

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,440
things that I think are true. In terms

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
of how I arrived at some of my views on

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
what we're going to talk about today,

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,160
sexual revolution, I think I was raised

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,480
with a lot of the assumptions around

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,920
the sexual revolution, which are sort of

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,239
like the water that we swim in now

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,160
culturally. And it wasn't until I got to

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
university that I started gradually

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,280
unpicking them.

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,440
After I was I left university, I worked

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,319
in a rape crisis center which was quite

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
formative for me in that I saw some of

92
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
the ways in which some of the feminist

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,120
theory that I had learned at university

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,599
didn't quite map onto reality.

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,360
And then I after leaving that job I

96
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,680
became a journalist. Again I kept

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,560
thinking about these things and I guess

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,920
I've reached a point where

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,519
I take a very mixed view of this

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
history. I think there are good things.

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
I think there are bad things that have

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,159
come out of the sexual revolution.

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
Louise, can you define for me what you

104
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,120
mean by sexual revolution for anybody

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
that doesn't know because it's going to

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
be quite an important term today. Right.

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,400
So I think that there are two things

108
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,400
really the ideological event really of

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,560
the 1960s and 1970s. So this was a a

110
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
period of not just in relation to sexual

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
relationships, but all sorts of things.

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,640
A period of really questioning and

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
challenging traditional ideas and

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,519
particularly traditional Christian ideas

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,159
about how what sexual relationships

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,159
ought to look like. I think actually the

117
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,519
the the point that we've reached in

118
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,519
terms of progressive culture is the

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
assumption that those traditional ideas

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
are necessarily questionable, are

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
necessarily

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
fit to be challenged. I think that's the

123
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
ideological thing that we're talking

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
about. But there's this other thing that

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,120
happens at the same time which is

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
partially connected which is a material

127
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,919
change. So you have the introduction of

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,440
the pill, the advent of safe abortion.

129
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,040
Remember historically abortion is not

130
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,919
safe. So you have the advent of safe

131
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
abortion and of course it's

132
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,400
decriminalization. You have things like

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,919
the washing machine and central heating

134
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,240
and all sorts of other domestic

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
appliances, domestic technologies which

136
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
actually have been enormously important

137
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
in changing such relationships because

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
all of a sudden it means that that

139
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
basically takes less time to run a home

140
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
and so it becomes more possible for

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,919
women to enter the workforce. So then

142
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,720
you see this wave of not only changing

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,880
marriage rates and birth rates but also

144
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,320
women entering the labor force on mass

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,479
and really some enormous social changes

146
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,919
like so enormous that it can be a little

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,520
bit hard in 2025

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,520
to realize how enormous they were

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
because we've become used to them. We'll

150
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,560
talk about all of that today going

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000
clockwise then Erica same question to

152
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
you about your background and h the work

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that's fed into the perspective you

154
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,479
have. I'm a psychoanalyst in private

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,880
practice. I'm an author. I write books

156
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
about parenting. And the book I'm

157
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,000
probably most well known for is my book,

158
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Being There. And it's basically about

159
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
the neuroscience of attachment or the

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,960
importance of mothers in the first three

161
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,039
years of a child's life to create

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,639
emotional security, which lays down the

163
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
foundation for mental health in the

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
future. And so from my perspective, I

165
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
guess the conversation we're going to

166
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,960
have, I should say right off the bat,

167
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,280
um, I consider myself a feminist. Um,

168
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,759
but I consider myself a term that I like

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
better and that my community uses, the

170
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
people that I work with, and which is I

171
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
consider myself a maternal feminist.

172
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Basically, there was a a school of

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
thought called maternal feminism, which

174
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,400
really elevated women in their work as

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,440
mothers and really talked about it as

176
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,840
very important work. Um, and so I'm not

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,560
an anti-feminist and I'm certainly for

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,080
women to have choice. So, it's uh it'll

179
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
be an interesting discussion. I guess

180
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
you could say I'm more of a centrist on

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,400
this topic. As Louise said, um, there

182
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
are parts of feminism that I think

183
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,440
really helped women and there are parts

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,840
that really did a lot of harm to

185
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,800
children. And lastly, Deborah. Yes. Same

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,680
question to you. So, I am best known as

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,720
the host of the Guilty Feminist podcast,

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,479
and I started that podcast to learn

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,360
about feminism,

190
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
and I have since researched a lot. I

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
wrote a book called The Guilty Feminist.

192
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
I've just written a book called six

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
conversations we're scared to have,

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,000
which does also challenge some of the

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
directions that we've gone, but more in

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,639
in about how combative we've become as

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
progressive people to each other and how

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,240
difficult it is to talk to people on the

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,840
right now and how we need to get back in

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,720
rooms and we need to be having difficult

201
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,039
discussions like this. So, it's

202
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,440
interesting what Louise says about being

203
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,160
raised in a progressive household but

204
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
then being disillusioned and thinking

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
that there was there's some ways in

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,319
which life was better before the sexual

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,280
revolution. Um, because I'm effectively

208
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,880
a time traveler. I did live before the

209
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,160
sexual revolution because when I was 14,

210
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,759
just coming into my puberty, my family

211
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,080
joined a religious cult.

212
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,720
I didn't have any normal sexual

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,479
development and I didn't get out. I

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,120
didn't escape that patriarchal cult till

215
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,120
I was in my mid 20s. So I know what it

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,759
is

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,440
and I do not believe women want it. I

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,360
know what it is to not have autonomy, to

219
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
not have agency, and to not have

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
emotional freedom. And those are the

221
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
three big things that I think the sexual

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,240
revolution gave women.

223
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,199
First of all, agency. I think it's just

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,919
agency is so important. So agency is

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,280
just the ability to go around and choose

226
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,440
what you do moment to moment. And

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,639
autonomy is can I can I decide what my

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,360
life looks like, the shape of my life,

229
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,879
what what choices do I have? And

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
emotional freedom is the third one. And

231
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
I don't think the sexual revolution did

232
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
did give us emotional freedom because I

233
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,000
think we're still sitting in a lot of

234
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,760
guilt as women as to like if I'm at

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
work, I should be at home with my

236
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
children. If I'm at home with my

237
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
children, I'm am I providing for them

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,320
financially well enough or am I am I

239
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
going to have a career when I go back to

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
work? Um if I'm doing both of those

241
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,080
things very well, am I a good enough

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
daughter, friend? Am I running a half

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
marathon for charity? Like we are in a

244
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,519
stage of such guilt. That's why my show

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,519
and my one of my books is called the

246
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
guilty feminist because I felt that

247
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,320
feminism had become another thing to

248
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,760
feel guilty about. And so anything to me

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,720
that engenders more shame in women or

250
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,839
more guilt in women

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,560
or takes their autonomy away even

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,680
emotionally. For me, I would like to

253
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,279
move far away from that because in my

254
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,040
life, every year I've been away from

255
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,640
that cult and I have had more autonomy

256
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
and more emotional freedom. I have felt

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,760
more spaciousness

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,640
and I have become a better person, a

259
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
better partner. I have maternal roles in

260
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,839
my life. It makes me so much better in

261
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
those roles if I'm filled up, if I'm

262
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,440
creatively fulfilled.

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,480
And it also makes me a better person in

264
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
my community in every way. So that's for

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,760
me what feminism is. So autonomy,

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
emotional freedom, and agency. I also

267
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
want to touch on the word guilt as well

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,000
because I remember that being pertinent

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
to our conversation. But if if I reflect

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
on those three words, Louise, autonomy,

271
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
emotional freedom, and agency as the the

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,800
byproduct of the sexual revolution.

273
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Would you agree with that? Yes and no.

274
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,040
So I think that

275
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,480
can I give an example that is like quite

276
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
dark but I think throws us immediately

277
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,600
into like some of these really difficult

278
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
questions about freedom and who's

279
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,320
freedom right there's this line from

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
Matthew Arnold that I really like

281
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
freedom is a really good horse to ride

282
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,320
but to ride somewhere like freedom is

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,839
ought to have a purpose right and so an

284
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,279
example from my professional life which

285
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
I think highlights some of the issues

286
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
about sexual revolution promoting

287
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,399
freedom

288
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,079
the law around BDSM. I won't go into the

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
details because it's boring, but there's

290
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,720
like complicated law around BDSM

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,640
basically like so so this is um bondage,

292
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,800
domination, soda massarchism. So people

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,519
basically doing um consensually

294
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,720
violent or abusive things in sex. So

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,920
stuff that would be illegal if there

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,440
weren't consent pretty much. And the law

297
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
around it is complicated. The law

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
basically says that you can consent up

299
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
to a certain level of harm and then

300
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,079
above that level of harm, you're

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,160
criminally liable and if something goes

302
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,240
wrong, like you're done for it. And

303
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
there's been ongoing campaigns by

304
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,640
proponents of sexual freedom to loosen

305
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
these laws and to make it so that you

306
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
can consent to more than what you

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,160
legally can at the moment. So consent to

308
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
like serious body modifications as a sex

309
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
thing or consent to quite serious

310
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,279
violence as a sex thing. like if

311
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,680
something goes wrong at the moment, you

312
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,959
might be criminally liable.

313
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,399
So me and a bunch of other feminists set

314
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,240
up a group called we can't consent to

315
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
this. The reason we did this is because

316
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
there were an increasing number of cases

317
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,800
in the UK. This isn't unique to the UK

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
of women who had died during sex and

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
their partners claimed that they had

320
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
consented to the violence that killed

321
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,519
them. So this was normally

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,839
strangulation, but there were other like

323
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,760
horrible ways in which these women died.

324
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
And these men were getting away with

325
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
this in the sense that they were

326
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,440
successfully claiming, no, no, no, this

327
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,880
was all just a sex game. And they were

328
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
successfully avoiding a murder

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,040
prosecution and sometimes getting very

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
light sentences for manslaughter. And I

331
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,120
think this is a really really good

332
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,079
example of freedom for who and freedom

333
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
for what because you can completely see

334
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,000
why

335
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,279
some campaigners would want the law in

336
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,360
BDSM to be much more liberal. And they

337
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
would say and they do say, you know, I'm

338
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,639
a consenting adult. Who are you to tell

339
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,399
me that I can't do XY Z in the bedroom?

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,920
Who are you to tell me that the law

341
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
ought to step in and try and criminalize

342
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
what adults do in the privacy of their

343
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
own homes?

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
and you can see their argument. But then

345
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,160
I say, okay, but the problem is we're

346
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,120
all connected to one another and your

347
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,880
freedoms impact on mine and this all,

348
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,920
you know, a society is greater than the

349
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,560
sum of its parts. And if you're going to

350
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,639
say that sexual freedom is the

351
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,240
preeminent value,

352
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,600
then I don't know what we do in these

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,279
cases, these concrete cases where it

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,160
seems to me that a terrible wrong has

355
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,320
been done to this woman. And if we don't

356
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
have

357
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,279
illiberal laws, at least partially

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,120
illiberal laws, then men who make this

359
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,120
defense are going to get away with it.

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
And I I I'm sorry this is a dark example

361
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
to like kick off the conversation with,

362
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,959
but I just think it's a pertinent

363
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,480
example of how freedom is difficult and

364
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,320
agency is difficult and choice is

365
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,440
difficult and we can say that these

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,600
things are are good generally. I think

367
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
they are good generally, but they are

368
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
virtues that need to be balanced against

369
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
other virtues. And that's the challenge.

370
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,040
Freedom is a wonderful thing. No one

371
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
would want to take freedom away from

372
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,000
human beings. But excessive freedom

373
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,760
without structure is not good for human

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,800
beings. So I'll just I'll use the

375
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,000
example because I talk about children a

376
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,040
lot. If you raise your children with

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,480
respect for their will, that is a good

378
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
thing, right? You don't want to raise,

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,440
you don't want to quash their will. You

380
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,000
want to

381
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,079
support their individuality and support

382
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
their choices and and even when raising

383
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,920
children, you're going to give them

384
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
choices. Do you want eggs or waffles for

385
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,720
breakfast? Do you want to wear your

386
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,959
green pants or your blue pants? No more

387
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,000
than that with small children. But if

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,800
you don't provide any structure for

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,920
them, they don't feel loved. They don't

390
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
feel secure. They don't feel stable. And

391
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,839
so what I'm afraid of is that we went

392
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,839
too far. It's not that freedom isn't a

393
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,880
good thing. It's that excessive freedom,

394
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,800
without any structure at all, can also

395
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,279
make us feel untethered, unbound,

396
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,240
without connections to the people that

397
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,399
we're most intimate with. And that's my

398
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,880
concern. So, it's not that sexual

399
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,760
freedom isn't a good thing. It's that in

400
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,360
my mind, it may have gone too far.

401
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,279
Just just add to that before you jump in

402
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,440
there. Um despite the general decline in

403
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,240
sex, especially amongst younger people,

404
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,399
societal acceptance of casual sex has

405
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,519
grown quite rapidly. In the UK, approval

406
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:08,720
of casual sex rose from just 10% in 1999

407
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:11,199
to 42% in 200. The hookup culture. Yeah.

408
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,440
So when you say rules and structure,

409
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,760
Erica, I'm really interested in that

410
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
turn of phrase because of course

411
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,839
children need rules and structure, but

412
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
women aren't children. Well, we're all

413
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,560
children. Men are children, too. From a

414
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,440
psychoanalyst perspective, there's a

415
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,320
child in everyone, of course. But I

416
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,920
think when we're talking about rules and

417
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:39,480
grown women, we are really, really in

418
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,480
dangerous water because we are

419
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,240
looking at a society that is

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,279
increasingly closing down on women and

421
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,600
telling women where they could do

422
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,079
better, be better. If we're looking at

423
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,279
an extreme example, we're looking at

424
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,199
Iran in 1970s and women in parliament

425
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
and women walking around part of the

426
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,800
sexual revolution in miniskirts and

427
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,639
having a wonderful time. And then you're

428
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,160
looking at women in Iran now. You're

429
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,920
walk looking at women in Afghanistan

430
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,000
now. Women in Afghanistan now have rules

431
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,079
and they have structure. They can't

432
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,560
stand near a window. They can't leave

433
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,519
the house without a man.

434
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,040
They can't uh raise they can't use their

435
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,120
voice in public. They can't sing. Like

436
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,279
anything that says rules to me, I'm

437
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,800
immediately like firstly our society has

438
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,199
plenty of structure. We have a lot of

439
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,120
structure. We all have to work to make a

440
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,279
living. We are all encouraged into

441
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,199
monogous relationships and there's a

442
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,600
feel that you're successful if you find

443
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,240
the one and get married and have 2.4

444
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
children. There's so much structure in

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,040
our lives. there's very little time for

446
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,920
relaxation or even considering what we

447
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,920
really might want to do.

448
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,560
I would be very intrigued to know what

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,320
you mean by women should have rules.

450
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,160
Yeah. What what do you mean? So, first

451
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
of all, I don't agree with you if I can

452
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,959
just uh say that I don't agree that we

453
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,120
are encouraging monogamy. I think we're

454
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,439
encouraging polygamy. Um and I don't

455
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,240
mean marriage polygamy. I mean multiple

456
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,880
partners, young people are hooking up.

457
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,600
Um, I wrote an article for the Institute

458
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,120
for Family Studies on why the statistics

459
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,799
on the hookup culture and what it's

460
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,079
doing to young people in terms of their

461
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,199
mental health. It's causing them to feel

462
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,520
um more depressed, more anxious, more

463
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,320
embarrassed, having more regrets,

464
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,840
self-esteem issues. It's got some major

465
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,640
implications. And we're talking the

466
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:40,559
statistics say 72 to 82% 72% of young

467
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,880
men and 82% of women uh young women are

468
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,720
feeling depressed and anxious after

469
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,600
these casual sexual encounters. Tinder

470
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,200
has an ad that says meet the love of

471
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,840
your night. Um it it what it does is it

472
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
takes something so sacred and intimate

473
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,600
and it turns it into something um not

474
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
just casual but it turns it into

475
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,960
something

476
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,679
irrelevant, unimportant and dangerous if

477
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,280
you ask me. Um emotionally dangerous and

478
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,799
it can be physically dangerous. If

479
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,520
you're having casual sex, you could get

480
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,480
a sexually transmitted disease. AIDS is

481
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,960
still around. I think in a way what

482
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,640
we've taught our kids and what I

483
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,679
encourage the young people that I work

484
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,120
with is that um experiment with sex,

485
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
care about the people that you're

486
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
experimenting with, find people who care

487
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,520
about you and who you care about. So

488
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,600
that structure. Can I just counter about

489
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,039
this sort of idyllic option of monogamy

490
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,799
in the United Kingdom? The police

491
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,520
receive a domestic abuse related call

492
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,160
every 30 seconds. Yet it's estimated

493
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,760
that less that less than 24% of domestic

494
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,240
abuse crime is reported to the police.

495
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
One in four women in England and Wales

496
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,200
will experience domestic abuse in her

497
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,880
lifetime.

498
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,559
On average, nearly two women are killed

499
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,320
a week in this country. And I know that

500
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,200
America has a similar story, but

501
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,559
probably worse because there's guns.

502
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,640
That is, this is around the world. It's

503
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,039
the same in Australia.

504
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
It is not an eitheror. It's not that

505
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,000
women were so happy and fulfilled in the

506
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,280
1950s because their husbands would go to

507
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,919
work and I mean watch Madmen which is a

508
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,480
you know it's a sort of researched idea

509
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,240
of how things often were for women then

510
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,919
and men and how you know Don Draper

511
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
would go off into the city. He would

512
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,840
have a fulfilling career. Then he would

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,360
sleep with any number of women and come

514
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
home to his wife who knew he was having

515
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
affairs, who could sense it, who could

516
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
vibe it, who could smell the perfume,

517
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,080
and had to just put up with it until she

518
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,600
couldn't any longer. And she was at risk

519
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,559
of of STDs because he was going out and

520
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,520
doing whatever he wanted.

521
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:02,799
The idea that a sort of monogamy is this

522
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,320
utopia. And since we've gone into a more

523
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,600
hookup culture, I still think there's a

524
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
hell of a lot of pressure for people to

525
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,240
find the right one. Yes, people hook up

526
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
before they find the right one, but

527
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
there is pressure to have the romcom

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,880
ending. Most people, if they're hooking

529
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,960
up, are hooking up to have sexual

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,679
satisfaction

531
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,520
while they are looking for a longerterm

532
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,280
relationship or they're not and they're

533
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,960
really happy single and they're finding

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
fulfillment. And that is the

535
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
spaciousness and the freedom and the

536
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,280
autonomy to do that. I love that women

537
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,280
can choose that now. I love that women

538
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,960
can say, "I'm really happy single. This

539
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
settling for someone who's not good

540
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,120
enough for me or it doesn't suit me or

541
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,159
it doesn't fit me doesn't have to happen

542
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,159
for me anymore. I can live my full self

543
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
and maybe my career is more important to

544
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,440
me or fulfilling or my friendships or my

545
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,960
desire for travel." I love that we have

546
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,880
options.

547
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,799
I want the women watching this

548
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,159
to appreciate

549
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,600
all the options that they have.

550
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
All the options that they have. If they

551
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,039
want to be single and they want to hook

552
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
up, if they're looking but in the

553
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,960
meantime having that that that sexual

554
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
freedom, I want them to have it all. But

555
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
if the what they want is this monogamy

556
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,720
that you're talking about to find the

557
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,240
love of their life and settle down and

558
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,159
have two children or whatever they want,

559
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
I want them to have that too. Deborah,

560
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,720
can I ask? Do do you think that there is

561
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,440
a cost to hookup culture and casual sex

562
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,280
in regards to the implications it has on

563
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,280
women as Erica was implying

564
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,840
psychologically? And is that more

565
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
adverse in women than men? I think human

566
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,320
beings

567
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
can suffer from too much choice. Like we

568
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,039
know that if you put 800 varieties of

569
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,880
jam out on a supermarket shelf, people

570
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,960
will buy less jam than if you put out

571
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
eight because they get confused and they

572
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,240
just think, "Oh god, I I don't know none

573
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,159
of it then." And they walk away. I think

574
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,600
the fact that we have young people

575
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,360
sitting in a bar on a on a hinge date

576
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
and while the that person goes to the

577
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,480
bar, they're like, "What else is out

578
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
there?" I think that's bad for human

579
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,520
beings.

580
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,360
I think that is bad for women, for men,

581
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
for non-binary people. That's bad for

582
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,880
everybody. But the sort of sacredness,

583
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,400
Erica was alluding to a sacredness of

584
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,880
sex itself. Yes, I think that is not a

585
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,120
thing that we are somehow finding women

586
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,840
find sex more sacred than men. I

587
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,880
But I didn't say that women find it. I

588
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,880
think it's sacred for men and women. But

589
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
yeah, you were speaking to sort of

590
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
sacredness to it. And I know Louise, in

591
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
your work, you've you've talked about

592
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,360
how there's different implications for

593
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
men and women as it relates to casual

594
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,600
sex. So I think that hookup culture

595
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,120
basically is better suited to the

596
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,640
average preferences of men than of

597
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,200
women. So the a preferences of men are

598
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,960
more likely to be uh towards the having

599
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,720
lots of partners, jumping into bed

600
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
really quickly into the spectrum

601
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,440
basically. And this is what um

602
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,280
psychologists call um socioexuality. So

603
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,600
men are generally more unrestricted in

604
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,760
their socioexuality than are women. And

605
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,520
hookup culture favors the highly

606
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,720
socioexual. And actually you can see

607
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,320
this if you look at campus dating

608
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,600
cultures and sexual cultures which are

609
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
interesting because in a way university

610
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,720
campuses are almost a closed

611
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
environment. You've got all these young

612
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,799
horny people hanging out, not very much

613
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,440
to do and like interacting with one

614
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,520
another. And on campuses which have more

615
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,919
men than women. So the women are the

616
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,720
scarcer resource basically assuming

617
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,559
everyone's heterosexual, right? Um they

618
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,480
tend to have more uh more conservative

619
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,559
sexual cultures, so more monogamy, less

620
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,840
hooking up, people wait longer to have

621
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,760
sex, etc. On campuses where there are

622
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
fewer men and more women, which

623
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,080
increasingly is true of all universities

624
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,520
actually because exactly, you have the

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,039
opposite. you have more hookup culture

626
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,039
because basically the men are the scarce

627
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,840
resource and they can set the terms and

628
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,120
men prefer more hookup culture. There

629
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,799
are obviously exceptions. You know, this

630
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,480
is all true, but at the population

631
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,440
level, I think that's really good

632
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,520
evidence that actually women on mass

633
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,520
don't like hookup culture and are

634
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,200
actually engaging with it because they

635
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,080
sort of have to. What you're talking

636
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,799
about there is very young women who have

637
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,000
just left home. It's their first

638
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,240
exploration into sex. Now, if you ask a

639
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
32-year-old woman in London who knows

640
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,039
her body, who knows her preferences, who

641
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
knows what kind of man turns her on, who

642
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,720
can talk about these things and

643
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
communicate, and you ask her, "Do you

644
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
regret that hookup?" She'll be like,

645
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,520
"No, I was look, you know, I worked

646
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,120
really hard this week. I was literally

647
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,240
looking forward to it, and it was

648
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,840
wonderful." If you ask that same woman,

649
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,520
"Do you regret any of the hookups you

650
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,760
had when you were a fresher?" She'll be

651
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,360
like, "Oh my god, I didn't know myself.

652
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
I didn't know how to ask what I wanted.

653
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,279
The boys were terrible at it because

654
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,039
they didn't know themselves." I don't

655
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,880
think universities are a great place to

656
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,880
get this information because that is

657
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,840
when you are literally just exploring

658
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,679
and going, "Is this anything?" And we're

659
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,440
all too embarrassed to say what we want

660
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,559
or to say how that we like. So, you've

661
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,760
got to put into that mix.

662
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,080
Boys are told you got to get laid. you

663
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,480
got to get laid as as you're not cool.

664
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,480
Women, young women are told you don't

665
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,360
want too high a body count. You you're

666
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,880
going to get [ __ ] shamed. Um so you're

667
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,520
talking about 18 year olds don't know

668
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
themselves yet. And you're saying when

669
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,960
there's when the men are scarce a

670
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
resource, it's one way, women another

671
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,640
way. That is exactly what I expect to

672
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,640
see. You're talking about 18-year-olds

673
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,440
that don't know themselves yet.

674
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,400
what we are currently experiencing in

675
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
our sexual culture where yes there's

676
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
some structure yes there are some rules

677
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,400
but we are much much more sexual

678
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,360
sexually not just liberal but even

679
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
libertine than say the the sexual

680
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,919
culture of our grandparents or whatever

681
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,279
I think everyone everyone ought to be

682
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,720
able to agree on that there clearly is a

683
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,000
change now in the sexual culture from

684
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,080
previous generations and it and it's

685
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
mostly to do with the pill as I argue

686
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,159
but um

687
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,679
the expectation

688
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,679
is kind of as You say that you just have

689
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
to figure it out. Like there isn't a

690
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
very clear template. Yes, maybe there

691
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,919
isn't. I think that I think that

692
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
Deborah, you are actually right that

693
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,600
most people do in the end aspire to

694
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
monogamy and having children and

695
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,279
everything, but there's also an

696
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
expectation that you're supposed to um

697
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,080
experiment a bit in the meantime and

698
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
it's kind of actually weird to be a

699
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,240
virgin on your wedding night. And I

700
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
think that yes, I mean girls have to

701
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,559
tread this really difficult tight route

702
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
where on the one hand they are at risk

703
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,919
of [ __ ] shaming, but they're also at

704
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,640
risk of being called frigid if they're I

705
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
mean they they are much much more at

706
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
risk actually of being called frigid

707
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,760
than in previous generations and they

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
just I mean the idea that we can escape

709
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
from social judgment around our sexual

710
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,279
choices is probably not realistic. I

711
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,480
think that basically that's what humans

712
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,679
are like. We do just tend to be

713
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:01,360
judgmental about this. But anyway, I

714
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,360
don't think it's very wise to

715
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,799
subject girls to this experience is how

716
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,960
I would put it to say that you have to

717
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,240
go through the hookup culture.

718
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
They're opting out. I know young people

719
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,919
who are absolutely opting out. They're

720
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,000
not at all. I'm going to agree with her

721
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
and say freedom has become a pressure.

722
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,559
There's become a societal pressure to be

723
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,720
free. So I know many young people who

724
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,960
are opting out of the apps. I'm a I'm a

725
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,279
therapist and I see so many young people

726
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
and I give lectures and people come up

727
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,720
to me. So I can say and I write books

728
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,799
about adolescence. And I'm going to say

729
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,600
that mostly the term hookup culture is

730
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,600
used between 15 and 30. So you're

731
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,960
correct in saying a 32 year old woman

732
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,400
should have the right to have sex with

733
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,919
whoever the hell she wants to have sex

734
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
with. And I'm right there with you. She

735
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,080
should have choice whatever. But young

736
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,400
women, young men who are developing

737
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,520
emotionally, mentally should not have

738
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,440
the right. No. No. That's No, no. Let me

739
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,880
Can I finish? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

740
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,919
So, you interrupted so I didn't get to

741
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,159
finish. Sorry. Okay. So, they're more

742
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
vulnerable. They are more vulnerable

743
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,840
emotionally to what the hookup culture

744
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,039
does to them. There's a lot of research

745
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,039
to say that it causes loneliness,

746
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,840
depression, anxiety, tons of regret,

747
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,200
embarrassment, shame, self-esteem

748
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,039
issues. Um, and so, of course, we want

749
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,960
freedom. In fact, I'm probably more in

750
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,720
agreement with you on most things than

751
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,240
you think. But in this, I say that

752
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,159
freedom can become its own prison. So if

753
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,840
you think about the early feminists,

754
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,159
the really early feminists, Mary

755
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,799
Wallstonecraft,

756
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,440
uh Mary Shelley, those women were

757
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:49,200
fighting patriarchy. They were fighting

758
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,679
a system that said they had to be a

759
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,679
certain way. So of course I don't accept

760
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,720
what Iran does to women. I mean that you

761
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,159
know but what's happened is if the

762
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,919
pendulum swings too far you have a

763
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,159
different kind of patriarchy on the

764
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,480
other side you know we say the extreme

765
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,480
left and the extreme right actually meet

766
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,320
in the middle and so have we just not we

767
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,360
never want to take choice away the idea

768
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,960
of taking choice away from women to have

769
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
sex with whoever they want to have sex

770
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,720
with that's not the point of this it's

771
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,240
have we created a society which

772
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,799
pressures young women in its own way to

773
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,360
be promiscuous to have lots of

774
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,840
experiences. It's not all glorious

775
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,000
freedom there. It is glorious, but it's

776
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,760
also not all glorious. And it can be a

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,760
it can be a pressure on young people to

778
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,080
get rid of their virginity, to have lots

779
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,000
of sexual experiences,

780
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,000
and it's not all it's cracked up to be

781
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,799
for them. It really isn't. In terms of

782
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,520
their mental health, again they are more

783
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,440
um we say 9 to 25, early 27 in young men

784
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,600
is the second critical period of brain

785
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,600
development where they are very

786
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,159
susceptible to their relational

787
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,080
experiences and their environment. And

788
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
so in that period of development, which

789
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,159
is mostly what we use the the term

790
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,640
hookup culture for, it's in that very

791
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,159
young developmental period. Uh it's not

792
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,320
just in college, it's throughout their

793
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,320
20s, you know, until that woman becomes

794
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,960
32. Uh that's a very vulnerable brain.

795
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,159
And so we have created a culture that

796
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,320
confuses that brain that offers too many

797
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,039
choices that pressures them into having

798
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,520
multiple partners and many experiences

799
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,600
and leaves them feeling empty and

800
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,919
lonely.

801
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,080
Can I just say though again to the time

802
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,000
traveler piece I did not you recommend

803
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,919
Louise because I I heard you talking on

804
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,559
this podcast before that people don't

805
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,240
have sex till they're engaged. But if

806
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,240
you're engaged,

807
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,440
the next step is marriage. So presumably

808
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,039
you're going to marry that person. I.e.

809
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,640
you're going to sleep with the first

810
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,760
person you sleep with if you take that

811
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,600
advice is your partner. So you're going

812
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:08,960
to have one sexual partner for life.

813
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:12,559
I do not recommend that ideally because

814
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,520
I came from a religion where that was

815
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,600
the only option. And because I didn't

816
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,279
meet anybody,

817
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,240
I

818
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,880
atrophied. I had no intimacy.

819
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,399
I felt so lonely. Now, you're saying

820
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
sometimes people have a hookup and they

821
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,279
feel lonely afterwards. Totally. Of

822
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
course. That's happened to everyone

823
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,720
who's ever had casual sex in any

824
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
quantity where you feel a bit like, oh,

825
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,039
that didn't fill me up. It's like, you

826
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,399
know, when they say you go and have a

827
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,320
Chinese meal and you feel hungry half an

828
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,080
hour later and you were wanting more.

829
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,679
There is no utopia here. There's only

830
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,519
options.

831
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,960
And what happened to me? Because I had

832
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,960
no option. I had no autonomy.

833
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,640
I became more and more atrified, more

834
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,320
and more lonely, more and more empty,

835
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,360
more and more disconnected from myself.

836
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,200
To this day, I struggle with that. I

837
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
struggle with intimacy with a with with

838
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,960
because we were in such a culture of you

839
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
can't have sex before you get married

840
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,519
that you didn't really make eye contact

841
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,600
with people. You know, normal teenagers

842
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
will sit on each other's laps and just

843
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,799
experiment a little bit or they might

844
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
have a little kiss or whatever. If you

845
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,000
don't have anything like that, you can't

846
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
really look at people properly because

847
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,960
you know, oh, it might lead to

848
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,200
something.

849
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,360
It took me so long to heal, guys. And

850
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,159
however old you think I was when I lost

851
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,640
my virginity, I was older

852
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,760
and it was tough because if you're

853
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,360
losing your virginity very late,

854
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,320
the person you're losing it with has had

855
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,559
a more regular healthy, in my opinion,

856
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
sexual development. They've had their

857
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,000
first girlfriend or boyfriend. They've

858
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,360
they've experienced a few things.

859
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,039
It's still hard for me to say what I

860
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,120
want.

861
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,120
So, I don't recommend the other thing

862
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,360
either, which is don't have sex with

863
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,200
anyone until you're ready to prepared at

864
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,519
least to marry them. I've got a graph

865
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,080
here that somewhat dovetales into this

866
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
conversation about when you should have

867
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,600
sex and also marriage as a subject. And

868
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,760
it shows that from the 197 in 1970s

869
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,039
roughly women would get married at about

870
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,919
21 years old. And now this graph will be

871
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,039
on the screen. It's about 30. Men used

872
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,519
to get married at around 23 years old

873
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,640
and now it's just over 30, which is a

874
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,320
pretty crazy climb. So it feels to me if

875
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,240
the sexual revolution took place in

876
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
around this era where we see this rapid

877
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,559
climb, maybe the two are somewhat

878
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,919
interlin, i.e. the age in which we'd be

879
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,480
getting married or having sex under

880
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,720
Louis's, you know, potential advice that

881
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,799
it's worth kiss.

882
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,559
That's why that happened. It's because

883
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
it used to be that if you were having

884
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,799
sex with someone, you were risking

885
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,320
pregnancy. And now that's not I mean it

886
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,559
is still true because actually all

887
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,840
contraception fails and something like

888
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,120
half of women in this country get

889
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,679
pregnant. didn't mean to or whatever.

890
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,840
So, the the idea that it's foolproof is

891
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,440
not true. But what the pill did when it

892
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,600
arrived on the scene in the late '60s

893
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,000
was it gave the illusion that sex was

894
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,720
consequencefree.

895
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,159
And it isn't on a physical level. Not

896
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,760
really. It's less it's less

897
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,919
consequential than it was because of the

898
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,599
pill, but the physical the physical

899
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,079
consequences are still there. But I

900
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,240
think just as importantly, it became no

901
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
less emotionally consequential. Just

902
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,359
because you're on the pill or using

903
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,480
condoms or whatever, your mind, I'm

904
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,800
thinking particularly of women who, as

905
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,839
we talked about, bond more quickly, your

906
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,520
mind still thinks that this person could

907
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,599
well become the father of my child.

908
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,760
you are still experiencing sex as in the

909
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,200
way that all of our ancestors did for

910
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,720
all of human history up until 5 minutes

911
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,079
ago until we invented this new

912
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,679
technology. And I think that's why it

913
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,200
has to I the reason that women have

914
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,200
evolved to be picky about who they have

915
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,680
sex with is because

916
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,680
getting pregnant is an extraordinarily

917
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,760
consequential thing for women. It's

918
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,800
dangerous. It's difficult. It's a huge,

919
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,200
you know, investment of their time and

920
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,320
of their life. And you don't want to get

921
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,320
pregnant by some bozo, right? That's why

922
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,599
women tend to be very selective about

923
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,200
who they're willing to have sex with and

924
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,240
feel really bad. And I mean, I've got to

925
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,200
say, I'm leaving aside words like sacred

926
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
because they're obviously difficult

927
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,640
because the religious implications. I

928
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,880
think that we should as feminists

929
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,119
describe sex as at least special, like

930
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,200
having some kind of special status. It's

931
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,720
not like other kinds of socializing.

932
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,040
It's not like having a conversation with

933
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,040
someone or playing tennis with someone.

934
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,520
And we can tell that it's been doing it

935
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,680
wrong. Well, but we can tell. Well, it's

936
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,920
we could call it one of the most

937
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,920
intimate experiences you can have as a

938
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,560
human being. And that's why rape is so

939
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,119
bad, right? That's why feminists

940
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,960
bastardizes the most intimate experience

941
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,440
by making it into by turning it into

942
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,560
violence. Rape is worse than theft, for

943
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,200
instance. or race rape is worse than

944
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,880
assault like nonsexual assault and law

945
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,720
and the law recognizes that and we all

946
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,079
socially recognize that because there is

947
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,079
something uniquely intimate and

948
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,160
therefore uniquely violating about

949
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,680
having sex without consent. And I think

950
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
that it's really hard actually to hold

951
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,520
those two things simultaneously in mind

952
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,280
and say sex is unimportant. It's

953
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,200
basically just like a skill set that you

954
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,040
can practice on other people that it's a

955
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,599
leisure activity. All this kind of

956
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,280
trivializes, right? and then also say,

957
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,359
"Ah, but consensus is extraordinarily

958
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,560
important." Like, why do do you not see

959
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,240
the contradiction there?

960
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,680
Autonomy. If I want it,

961
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,960
if I want somebody, especially

962
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,000
penetrative sex, you're talking about

963
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,800
rape, you're talking about penetrative

964
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,280
sex, there's nothing worse than somebody

965
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,960
inside your body violating your actual

966
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,040
insides.

967
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,599
Nothing worse than that.

968
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,599
That does not mean

969
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,079
that women do not have sexual urges that

970
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,640
are exciting. I know I'm finished

971
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,720
sentence. That was that women don't have

972
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,760
sexual urges that are just about

973
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,640
attraction and a moment and fun and

974
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,640
play. Play is so important to human

975
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,079
beings.

976
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,400
When I left that cult, it took me a long

977
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,359
time and a number of different sexual

978
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,400
experiences to find out what kind of

979
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,920
sexuality I even had. You can't

980
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,280
necessarily find it with the first

981
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,320
person you meet. They may not be

982
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,240
sexually compatible with you. And you

983
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
may not know how to communicate well

984
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,320
with them and end up having a life of

985
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,240
very boring missionary position sex. If

986
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,160
you encourage young people just to have

987
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,720
sex with the first person they meet and

988
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,200
stay with that person, which I'm not

989
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,400
saying you're saying, but I am saying if

990
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,079
you don't have sex before you're

991
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,720
engaged, well, engagement leads to

992
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:59,040
marriage, you may end up with very

993
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,720
little sexual fulfillment compared to

994
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
what you could have had. You might not.

995
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
You might get lucky. The first person

996
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,760
you meet might just be amazing in bed

997
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,359
with you and you find your space

998
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,839
together and it might be wonderful. But

999
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,040
I would say that is unlikely. And I

1000
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,680
would say that the reason that the pill

1001
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,640
changed how much sex women had and with

1002
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,200
with what variety of partners is because

1003
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,040
it gave them autonomy. It gave them

1004
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,320
agency. Suddenly I can. And guess what?

1005
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,079
When I can, I choose to try. When you

1006
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,880
give women the choice, which the pill

1007
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,440
did, to have some experience,

1008
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,880
we see that most women want some

1009
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,680
experience, want to find themselves

1010
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,240
sexually, want to feel, oh, this or not

1011
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,240
that or yeah, or oh, oh my god, this

1012
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,119
one, this is amazing. I could be with

1013
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,560
this guy forever. We hit it off. He's

1014
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,320
great in bed. We're, you know, we're

1015
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,359
we're working together. Oh, we've got a

1016
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,560
little problem now, but we'll work

1017
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,240
through it together because we love each

1018
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,079
other. Most people do some version of

1019
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,599
that. and maybe they hit a point in that

1020
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,920
monogamy where this relationship isn't

1021
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,320
working anymore or something terrible

1022
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,560
happens and they have another go at

1023
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,839
that. That's that's a a large pattern.

1024
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,480
Now, how much of that is because that's

1025
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,599
what society expects, I don't know, but

1026
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,760
that is what most people tend to do. So

1027
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,000
for me

1028
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,400
saying that because one night at a music

1029
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,960
festival I had a really passionate

1030
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,280
exciting encounter with somebody who I

1031
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,359
never saw again that I am somehow

1032
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,400
minimizing rape is very disturbing. Can

1033
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,079
I just interject and just say that um

1034
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,160
you're you're right in turning to me and

1035
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,359
saying I didn't mean that you have to

1036
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,200
marry your first partner. Um, but

1037
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,680
there's something very important about

1038
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,079
the emotional connection

1039
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,320
and that's coming from maybe me being a

1040
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,920
therapist and knowing and seeing the

1041
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,880
pain that the young people who come to

1042
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,800
me are in when there's no emotional

1043
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,520
connection and they give their bodies

1044
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,480
over. By the way, young men, too. I

1045
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,000
think young men I think it's shifting

1046
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,760
actually. It's interesting what I'm

1047
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,640
seeing in my practice. Young men are

1048
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,880
more vulnerable than women now. Women

1049
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,160
have taken on the role that young men

1050
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,720
used to have emotionally. And so, you

1051
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,240
know, women have all these choices and

1052
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,920
now they're leaving young men in the

1053
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,160
dust. And the young men are feeling

1054
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,000
lonely and, you know, they they have sex

1055
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,320
with a girl and they want to date her

1056
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,920
and she says, "No, I'm dating. I'm

1057
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,560
sleeping with five guys at the same

1058
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,160
time." And these are kids in their 20s.

1059
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,920
But sex is better with emotional

1060
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,599
connection. That doesn't mean you have

1061
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,839
to marry the first guy that you have sex

1062
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,520
with. I also want to say that there is

1063
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,760
something called neurotic repetition.

1064
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,760
A lot of the early feminists had a lot

1065
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,599
of trauma. You had trauma. A lot of

1066
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:54,400
people have had trauma. And what happens

1067
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:58,079
with trauma is it tends to be like PTSD.

1068
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,960
if we have disconnection early on or

1069
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,800
abuse or violence against us, um,

1070
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,640
attachment disorders as I've talked

1071
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,359
about in your other podcasts when you're

1072
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,839
very young, it gets reenacted and

1073
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,400
repeated throughout your life over and

1074
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,079
over and over and over again. So,

1075
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
interestingly, the early feminists were

1076
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,319
mostly traumatized women. If you look at

1077
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,480
the histories of them, they had

1078
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,359
physically abusive fathers, alcoholic

1079
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,280
fathers, they had um uncles who raped

1080
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,960
them. They had I mean terrible even

1081
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
their mothers too. I mean just really

1082
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,520
abusive parents, but mostly the men in

1083
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,760
their life were horrible. And so a lot

1084
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,079
of this whole experience depends on

1085
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,079
where you come from and what you had. If

1086
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,640
you've had good models, I mean it's why

1087
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,319
I sort of talk about I'm writing a book

1088
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,000
about divorce. Why am I writing a book

1089
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,520
about divorce if I believe in

1090
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
relationships?

1091
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,079
Because divorce is going to happen and

1092
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,560
we need to help parents to know how to

1093
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,760
raise healthy children in spite of it.

1094
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,319
But relationships matter. They matter in

1095
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,359
the raising of children. So when we have

1096
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,599
a disconnected society where we say

1097
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,160
relationships don't matter, just sex

1098
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,160
matters. Sex, sex, sex. Of course sex

1099
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,400
matters. But what I say to young people

1100
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,800
is sex is a very small part of a

1101
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,720
relationship. It really is because in

1102
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
the beginning it's hot, hot, hot. And

1103
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,560
then as you get to know each other and

1104
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,200
you have the daily comeings and goings

1105
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,760
of life, it's the friendship, it's the

1106
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,680
connection, it's the companionship, it's

1107
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,560
the relationship. But if you've had a

1108
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,640
lot of trauma, then you are not going to

1109
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,960
turn towards relationships. And you are

1110
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,280
not going to turn towards men. If men

1111
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,640
traumatized you and you saw a man abuse

1112
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,839
your mother, of course you're not going

1113
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,560
to want men in your life. So a lot of it

1114
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,040
I think I think the feminist movement

1115
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,040
does something which it it's first of

1116
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,680
all I'm going to say it's done a lot of

1117
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,599
good. I wouldn't be here. None of us

1118
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,680
would be here without it. Those women

1119
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,040
that took the risks we have to be

1120
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:03,839
grateful toward. But I mean what it also

1121
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:07,040
did is it it distorted a lot of the

1122
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,839
importance of relationships and how

1123
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,319
important male and female relationships

1124
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,960
are. I'll stop there because I've talked

1125
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,520
too much. But can I say something about

1126
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
agency because this word came up earlier

1127
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,280
and I've been thinking about a lot about

1128
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,680
it recently and I just find it

1129
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,400
interesting as a subject. So I I think

1130
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,119
that actually a better way of thinking

1131
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,440
about agency than is this binary thing

1132
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,240
that you know humans have agency etc is

1133
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,200
um is it's kind of more of a personality

1134
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,720
trait. I think that some people are very

1135
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,000
agentic.

1136
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,760
Some people are able to

1137
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,079
set their minds on doing something and

1138
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,920
they just make it happen. Those people

1139
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:54,160
are very well suited to making their own

1140
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:57,119
decisions. Those people hate the idea of

1141
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,280
any kind of limits on their freedom.

1142
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,800
But they are unusual people. Most people

1143
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,079
actually they go with the flow. They

1144
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
kind of do what other people around them

1145
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,319
are doing. They drift a little bit.

1146
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
They're a little bit passive. They kind

1147
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,119
of make decisions based on what seems

1148
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,720
normal. They follow the template as it

1149
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,680
appears to them in their moment. You

1150
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,119
know, that's not necessarily a bad

1151
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,640
thing, but it does mean that those

1152
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:22,240
people are more vulnerable to

1153
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,880
bad scripts. The problem with the sexual

1154
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,119
liberation narrative is it assumes that

1155
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,599
everyone is highly agentic.

1156
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,119
It assumes that everyone is capable of

1157
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,400
being faced with all these various

1158
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,680
choices and saying, "I'm going to choose

1159
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,760
this one and that one and making it

1160
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,040
happen rather than what I think is more

1161
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,400
realistic and particularly when you're

1162
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,920
talking about young people." And I think

1163
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,960
even more talking about young women, I

1164
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,319
think young women are particularly

1165
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,599
mimemetic and particularly I mean there

1166
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,960
are studies showing this that women for

1167
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,480
instance more likely to like imitate

1168
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,720
other people's body language. They're

1169
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,119
more likely to they pick up slang more

1170
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,720
quickly than men do. Like young women

1171
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,800
are very uh socially attuned like more

1172
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,720
than any other group. They're very uh

1173
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,640
alive towards high status and low status

1174
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,920
and like keen to imitate it. You also

1175
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,160
see this with fashion, all sorts of

1176
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,880
things, right? I think to just say to

1177
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,400
those young women, good news, you can

1178
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,880
choose anything you want. You can do

1179
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,880
anything you want. Obviously, if you are

1180
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,319
highly agentic, I think you mentioned

1181
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,920
Deborah, young people who are just like,

1182
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,160
no, I'm not into this off the apps, not

1183
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,000
doing it. They're highly agentic. That's

1184
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,599
very impressive, but it's rare. Like

1185
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,520
most people actually are basically going

1186
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,599
to do what their peers do. And so that's

1187
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,160
why I think just saying everyone give

1188
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,720
everyone choice and kind of close close

1189
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,240
the lid and say good luck. I think that

1190
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,480
doesn't work. I think that actually we

1191
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,079
need to be a bit more

1192
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,640
prescriptive.

1193
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,440
Women were less agentic before the

1194
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,760
sexual revolution. Overall, as a

1195
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,560
population, we are more agentic now. We

1196
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,319
have more agency and we flex that agency

1197
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,520
more frequently.

1198
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,560
If you are worried that young women seem

1199
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,800
to you to be mimemetic, i.e. in

1200
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,520
influenced by their peer group, then we

1201
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,280
need education for what what's happening

1202
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,800
in that peer group. I don't disagree

1203
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,480
with you that thinking about intimacy,

1204
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,240
thinking about do I really want to do

1205
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,800
this with my body, do I want to let this

1206
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,160
boy touch me here or there or this girl,

1207
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,560
you know, do this or that with me or

1208
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,839
whatever. Of course, but that's

1209
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,760
education so they can have agency and

1210
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,160
that's the discussion that the parents

1211
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,760
have ideally the schools are having. We

1212
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,599
desperately need that. That's what we're

1213
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,119
doing here, right? We're trying to Yeah.

1214
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,440
But rather than saying they need rules,

1215
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,760
I would say they need to be further

1216
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,560
attuned to their own desires, their own

1217
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,440
body, their own environments,

1218
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,440
relationships. You know, how long does

1219
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,880
it feel right to me? Listening to my own

1220
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,359
body, listening to my own mind, having

1221
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,040
confidants that they can talk to who are

1222
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,160
older and more responsible if they don't

1223
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,280
feel comfortable talking to their

1224
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,040
parents cuz some kids, of course,

1225
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,880
teenagers don't necessarily go, "Mom, I

1226
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,400
had this urge." Do you provide other

1227
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,560
people in their community who they might

1228
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,800
have that conversation with? There are

1229
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:06,160
all sorts of ways that we can make sure

1230
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,760
our girls and our boys have agency and

1231
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,480
listen to themselves. But when I hear

1232
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,200
rules, when I hear it's just better for

1233
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,520
them not to until they're engaged and

1234
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,280
then just stick with that person for

1235
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:23,839
life ideally, I fear that is going

1236
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,480
taking us back generations. And women

1237
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,319
100% were not happier then. They put us

1238
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,760
put up with more. I I do want to

1239
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,760
separate um young people from what you

1240
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,359
were talking about adult women. I I want

1241
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,520
to separate them because they're not the

1242
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,680
same species. Um there's so much

1243
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,839
development going on in adolescence. And

1244
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,760
adolescence, as I said, goes on till 25.

1245
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:46,560
So by the time you're an adult woman,

1246
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,880
you are for the most part developed. by

1247
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,480
the time you get to 32, you know,

1248
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,720
there's going to be stuff going on, but

1249
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,480
the major part of your personality and

1250
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,839
character development is is pretty much

1251
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,319
set. And so that developing period is

1252
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,839
really more my concern. It's not that

1253
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,240
I'm not concerned about my older

1254
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,040
patients who come to me and talk about

1255
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,640
how free sex and, you know, multiple

1256
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,160
partners makes them feel good. I would

1257
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,160
say great, it's your choice. You know,

1258
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,560
if that makes you feel good, wonderful.

1259
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,640
But in young people where they're

1260
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,319
developing, I agree with you that we

1261
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:25,480
need more education. Um I I'm all for

1262
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,480
more education, but I'm for education

1263
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,280
right now in schools. Too much sex

1264
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,920
education if you ask me. Um it uh we're

1265
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,160
teaching 9-year-olds about anal sex.

1266
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,680
We're teaching them about genital warts.

1267
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,839
That's not something a nine-year-old

1268
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,520
needs to know, you know, in school. So,

1269
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,000
but I think we're not teaching them

1270
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,440
about emotional connection, about

1271
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,920
relationships, about family, about about

1272
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,520
the arc of a life that if you want to be

1273
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,920
single and you want to have multiple

1274
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,599
partners and you want to be free, that's

1275
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,640
your choice. I have no problem with

1276
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:02,079
that. But we're not teaching about the

1277
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,880
importance of connection and emotional

1278
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,400
connection and building families. And

1279
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,559
so, what do we have? We have a bunch of

1280
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,119
young people out there who are having

1281
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,839
sex but feeling empty and lonely and

1282
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,960
depressed and anxious and and not

1283
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,200
knowing why because we are teaching sex

1284
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,040
but we're not teaching about connection.

1285
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,200
Can I also say and I don't know that

1286
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,880
it's true that in the UK that we're

1287
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,920
teaching nine-year-olds about anal by

1288
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,200
the way but the thing that's lacking in

1289
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,720
sex education often here is pleasure.

1290
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,079
They do not talk about how how

1291
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,559
pleasurable how pleasurable it can be or

1292
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,200
that girls should be when they have

1293
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,079
their first sexual experience ideally as

1294
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,359
young women that not girls of course

1295
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,280
they should be young women they should

1296
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:52,240
be of age

1297
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,640
that their pleasure matters

1298
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,280
there's so many young women who at the

1299
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,880
first just go I guess I have to do this

1300
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,240
and he has to find pleasure in it But

1301
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,160
learning what makes your own body

1302
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,880
feel pleasure is a wonderful wonderful

1303
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,520
thing. Knowing that it it it can give

1304
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,200
you great intimacy and it can be a

1305
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,240
lifelong relationship partner and all.

1306
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,240
So that's a 1950s idea. The 1950s were a

1307
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
time I mean nobody wants to go back to

1308
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,400
the 1950s. You know when I the books

1309
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,079
that I write people come up to me and

1310
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,520
they say you want women to go back to

1311
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,760
being pregnant and barefoot in the

1312
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,599
kitchen. I'm like what? No, we don't

1313
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,119
want to go back to the 50s because women

1314
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,280
didn't have choice and women didn't know

1315
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,960
about orgasm and they didn't know about,

1316
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,680
you know, that sex could be pleasurable

1317
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,920
and um so we don't want to go back. We

1318
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,040
want to move forward. We want to take

1319
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,960
the best of the highlights of the past

1320
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,160
and not leave all of the good parts of

1321
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,839
the past behind and, you know, take the

1322
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
good parts of the feminist movement,

1323
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,160
too. But there's a lot of it that's not

1324
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,119
so good. And I'm going to a agree with

1325
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,280
Louise that there are so many young

1326
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,960
women and older women, but let's just

1327
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,480
say young women. Don't point at me and

1328
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,240
say older women. No, no, no. I'm old,

1329
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,760
too. Older. I over 32. I'll admit to

1330
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,119
over 32, Erica, and that's all I can

1331
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,880
say. But that's all we're doing. That's

1332
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:16,960
all we're doing. You're older than 25.

1333
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:20,480
There are so many young women who um are

1334
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,000
looking to understand the secret sauce.

1335
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,680
what what is going to make them the

1336
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,319
happiest? You know, I don't love the

1337
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,240
word happy, but I think our young people

1338
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:33,680
are so very unhappy. They have never

1339
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,760
been so unhappy. The statistics on

1340
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,240
mental illness and unhappiness and

1341
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,960
loneliness are we have all this sexual

1342
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,559
freedom. We have all of these feminist

1343
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,119
ideals and yet young women are so very

1344
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,119
unhappy. I think we've got a causation

1345
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,839
correlation problem there. I think the

1346
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,440
world is not well. We are we are really

1347
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,480
looking down the barrel of climate

1348
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,880
change, land wars, cost of living is out

1349
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,440
of control. Young people will never own

1350
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,079
a home unless their parents give them an

1351
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,520
enormous amount of money. There are so

1352
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,240
many factors feeding into the

1353
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,720
unhappiness of people of all ages. And

1354
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,400
young people look at this long future

1355
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,480
and go, "What is this going to be for

1356
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,839
me?" I think to blame feminism for that

1357
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,000
uh is misguided. It's a piece of the

1358
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,160
puzzle. And remember that my lens is a

1359
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
lens of seeing patients who come to me

1360
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,280
for relational issues. So therefore,

1361
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,040
you're you've got a biased set of

1362
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,800
information. The people that are unhappy

1363
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,960
with their relationships come to you.

1364
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,359
Yes, everything's a piece of the puzzle.

1365
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,640
But if it wasn't this, it would be that.

1366
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,400
And what that was was, you know, oh, I'm

1367
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,760
stuck with this person now that I'm

1368
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
we're not having sex and it's a

1369
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,119
miserable time and he doesn't talk to me

1370
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,520
and I don't talk to him, but I can't

1371
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,760
really get out of it. Human beings find

1372
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,400
ways to be dissatisfied with their lot

1373
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,079
in life. Somebody who we look at and go,

1374
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,599
"My god, they're so fortunate. They've

1375
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,119
got everything they want." Is probably

1376
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,319
one of the unhappiest people, you know,

1377
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,400
because they're going, "Is this all

1378
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,760
there is?" You know, that's why often

1379
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,520
you'll see like a a rock star or a movie

1380
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,800
star get absolutely everything they want

1381
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,960
and they have to go up a mountain to

1382
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,880
talk to a guru because they're like,

1383
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,200
"Well, I was hoping that I'd be super

1384
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,520
successful and wealthy and, you know,

1385
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,200
have all this choice and now I've got

1386
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,599
that and I'm still not happy." And

1387
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,359
the idea that we can look at unhappiness

1388
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,680
with what is here and then say if this

1389
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,960
wasn't here but that was here those same

1390
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,440
people would be blissfully happy is

1391
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,040
doesn't bear out with history. So I

1392
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,720
actually think what does bear out is

1393
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:45,760
that human beings universally from birth

1394
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,400
crave security. We know that they crave

1395
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,760
safety and security and stability from

1396
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,440
birth. And we don't teach that. We say

1397
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,280
just be impulsive, be in the moment. And

1398
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,359
I think that's a lot of what's causing

1399
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,480
the unhappiness is that we don't help

1400
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,400
educate and strategize what a good life

1401
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,960
means to you. Now, maybe for you, a good

1402
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,960
life is just being free and, you know,

1403
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,800
having a great career. And I have no

1404
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
problem with that. I'm I'm the first one

1405
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,160
to say the women's movement gave women

1406
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,040
choice to have the life they want to

1407
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,520
have. Absolutely. I think there's a lot

1408
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,760
of women who feel bullied by this

1409
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,760
narrative of freedom. They feel bullied

1410
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,319
by it. And I listen I I hear it in my

1411
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,480
practice. I see it online on my uh you

1412
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,599
know uh my Instagram following and

1413
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,680
people writing and you're right I have a

1414
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,359
particular lens. So people may come to

1415
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,079
me because of that. But what I will say

1416
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,480
is that there is

1417
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,040
it the feminist movement at least the

1418
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,680
second wave of the feminist movement was

1419
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,839
a little bit of a cabal in a sense that

1420
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,319
it was a small group of women saying

1421
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,800
every woman should feel this way. Every

1422
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,880
woman should want to go out to work and

1423
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,960
leave their children in daycare. Every

1424
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,839
woman should want free sex. And the

1425
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,680
bottom line is a lot of women don't. A

1426
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,480
lot of women want the choice to be

1427
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,800
respected, to have intimate and loving

1428
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,640
and marital relationships and monogamy,

1429
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,400
and they want to be able to stay home

1430
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,960
with their children and have society

1431
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,119
say, "You are amazing." and admire them

1432
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,440
for it. And and what I know is that

1433
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,079
there's a lot of young women and adult

1434
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,920
women who are feeling um pressured to

1435
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,839
live a life that isn't making them

1436
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,680
happy, that is without relationships,

1437
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,960
that's without having one intimate

1438
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,280
partner, that is um you know freedom

1439
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,559
without any limits.

1440
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,960
If women feel bullied by freedom, I feel

1441
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,359
like they should try the alternative. I

1442
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,800
I I

1443
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,040
still feel the predominant narrative is

1444
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,799
the romcom one. The predominant

1445
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,960
narrative is you should be married by 30

1446
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,040
with a white dress. Everyone should

1447
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,359
stand around and say you've done it now.

1448
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,119
You should have babies. That to me is

1449
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,119
still the predominant narrative that you

1450
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,839
are successful if you have achieved

1451
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,920
these things. Now it is true that um

1452
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,480
many women feel also they should have

1453
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,079
some kind of career. That is very true.

1454
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,920
But I feel like a the main thing that

1455
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,520
women are asked to aspire to, if you

1456
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:23,760
really look around, it is still find the

1457
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,480
one, have the romcom ending. And I do

1458
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,160
not see this idea that women are told

1459
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,839
the whole time we should be out on the

1460
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,559
town sleeping with everyone in town. Far

1461
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:36,400
from it. And I I know this isn't true

1462
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,160
because I I went to a school that's a

1463
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,000
very very good girl school. It's a state

1464
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
school but a very very high-end one in

1465
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,920
London in 2018 when we were all out

1466
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,920
marching in the street the women's march

1467
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,440
recently I went back and all those girls

1468
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,359
are talking about being a high value

1469
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,359
woman which is from the manosphere and

1470
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,480
not too high having having not too high

1471
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,720
a body count these are obviously

1472
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,799
different girls the ones 2018 went off

1473
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,920
to university

1474
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:04,319
that's in seven years they were saying

1475
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,720
you know in 20 in 2018 2019 around that

1476
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,559
time they were saying no [ __ ] shaming

1477
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,839
listen to your body. They weren't saying

1478
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,280
run around and have sex with everybody

1479
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,559
or I've got to have a lot of lovers.

1480
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,680
They were saying I I I make my own

1481
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,359
decisions. I don't, you know, listen to

1482
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,760
patriarchal ideas about how I need to

1483
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,920
live my life. I am going to go to

1484
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,200
university. I'm going to meet people and

1485
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,960
make meaningful relationships and some

1486
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,079
of those will be friendships. They are

1487
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,599
now talking manosphere talk. I made the

1488
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,319
biggest investment I've ever made in a

1489
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,319
company because of my girlfriend. I came

1490
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,400
home one night and my lovely girlfriend

1491
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,160
was up at 1:00 a.m. in the morning

1492
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,440
pulling her hair out as she tried to

1493
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,520
piece together her own online store for

1494
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,280
her business. And in that moment, I

1495
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,240
remembered an email I'd had from a guy

1496
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,400
called John, the founder of Stanto, our

1497
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,559
new sponsor and a company I've invested

1498
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,160
incredibly heavily in. And Stanto helps

1499
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,079
creators to sell digital products,

1500
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,400
courses, coaching, and memberships all

1501
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,880
through a simple customizable link in

1502
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,480
bio system. and it handles everything.

1503
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,960
Payments, bookings, emails, community

1504
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,040
engagement, and even links with Shopify.

1505
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,640
And I believe in it so much that I'm

1506
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,160
going to launch a Stan challenge. And as

1507
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,200
part of this challenge, I'm going to

1508
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,559
give away $100,000 to one of you. If you

1509
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,079
want to take part in this challenge, if

1510
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,000
you want to monetize the knowledge that

1511
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,599

extended 30-day free trial of Stanto if

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,720
you use that link. Your next move could

1515
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,559
quite frankly change everything. Because

1516
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,200
I talked about ketosis on this podcast

1517
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,200
and ketones, a brand called Ketone IQ

1518
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,559
sent me their little product here. And

1519
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,160
it was on my desk when I got to the

1520
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,440
office. I picked it up. It sat on my

1521
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,119
desk for a couple of weeks. Then one

1522
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,680
day, I tried it. And honestly, I have

1523
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,000
not looked back ever since. I now have

1524
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,440
this everywhere I go. When I travel all

1525
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,799
around the world, it's in my hotel room.

1526
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,559
My team will put it there. Before I did

1527
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,040
the podcast recording today that I've

1528
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,799
just finished, I had a shot of Ketone

1529
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,079
IQ. And as is always the case when I

1530
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,839
fall in love with a product, I called

1531
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,440
the CEO and asked if I could invest a

1532
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,359
couple of million quid into their

1533
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,720
company. So, I'm now an investor in the

1534
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,680
company as well as them being a brand

1535
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,599
sponsor. I find it so easy to drop into

1536
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,359
deep focused work when I've had one of

1537
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,119
these. I would love you to try one and

1538
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,480

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,599
I'm excited for you. I am. Manosphere

1546
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,720
talk. Um, I was I found this graph as

1547
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,599
well, which just shows the sort of

1548
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,520
explosion in people searching tradife,

1549
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,520
which means traditional wife. Yeah. And

1550
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,119
it seems from

1551
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,559
2024,

1552
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,040
there's been this real explosion in

1553
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,319
people searching for this trend. And you

1554
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,359
said something a second ago, Erica,

1555
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:55,599
about young boys in particular being

1556
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,760
more vulnerable I think with your words

1557
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,359
than the young girls that you're seeing.

1558
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,359
Yeah. So, how do these ideas come

1559
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,520
together to to and also link in and

1560
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:06,079
parlay into this word manosphere because

1561
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,079
this subject of manosphere has been at

1562
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,599
the very forefront of conversation. It's

1563
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,119
everything's a little out of balance.

1564
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,359
Everything's a little out of whack. So,

1565
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,119
it was out of whack in the 50s and so we

1566
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,880
fixed it and now it's out of whack in a

1567
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,520
different way. Uh we went from the

1568
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,040
patriarchy of men dominating women to

1569
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,440
now we have the patriarchy of women

1570
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,280
dominating men. I mean, what we need to

1571
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,680
do is not go back, but come to the

1572
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,359
middle. We need to It just makes common

1573
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,200
sense. How are we dominating men,

1574
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:35,839
though? Oh my goodness. Um, that 60% of

1575
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,440
college students are women and graduate

1576
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,760
students.

1577
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,000
Dominating. Let me finish. Let me

1578
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,920
finish. Young men are afraid of women

1579
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,160
and the power they have over them to

1580
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,319
accuse. No, it's true. In universities,

1581
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:53,359
it's a real thing. I know because I have

1582
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:56,400
two sons and um you know there is again

1583
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,559
the correction was necessary. We needed

1584
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,680
to course correct in society.

1585
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,480
Absolutely. But we've gone so far. So we

1586
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,240
took so the men were powerful and the

1587
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,400
women weren't. So the women said give us

1588
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,280
some power. So now the women took the

1589
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,680
power and now the men feel powerless.

1590
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,359
You need a society that's balanced. It

1591
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,520
needs to be balanced. And the idea was

1592
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,920
that where we wanted to go and and the

1593
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,079
truth is that all movements often go to

1594
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,799
extremes. The women's movement, those

1595
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,799
women had to go to extremes because to

1596
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,119
change society, you have to do that,

1597
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,200
right? So should some women not go to

1598
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,680
university? Is that what you're saying?

1599
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,319
No. But actually, I think there needs to

1600
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,599
be a balance in society of men and

1601
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:42,960
women. If we say that we are going to be

1602
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:45,359
like Amazon women and not need men

1603
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,960
anymore, the truth is that the way it

1604
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:51,520
works is that by the research is that um

1605
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,680
women will marry at their educational

1606
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,000
level or above and men will marry at

1607
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,000
their educational level or below. That

1608
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,079
means that because we have fewer men in

1609
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,480
college and graduate school, women are

1610
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,680
not finding partners. I'm just going to

1611
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,920
jump in there and talk about a report

1612
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,440
that came out in 2025 which um sent

1613
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,200
shock waves across the UK. It was called

1614
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
the Lost Boys report. I think we we

1615
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,799
might have talked about this uh in a

1616
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,240
previous episode, but it was a report by

1617
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,760
the Center of Social Justice which

1618
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,960
highlighted how many young men are now

1619
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,319
struggling in school, facing increased

1620
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,839
mental health problems and lacking

1621
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,000
positive role models, leaving them lost

1622
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,440
and isolated. And as a result, they said

1623
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,599
they suggested that many of them are

1624
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,559
turning to what we call the manosphere.

1625
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,599
And to give a definition to the

1626
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,359
manosphere because I didn't actually

1627
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,839
know what it was. The definition I have

1628
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,520
from Cambridge dictionary is manifir

1629
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,760
includes websites and discussion groups

1630
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,640
focused on men's rights which often

1631
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,200
oppose feminism in some way. And just to

1632
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,160
give a sort of a a topline look at some

1633
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,240
of the stats around this. By age 5, 25%

1634
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,680
of boys in the UK are falling behind in

1635
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,559
language communication skills compared

1636
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,559
to just 14% of women. At GCSE level boys

1637
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,200
results are on average half a grade

1638
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,240
lower than girls. The same applies for

1639
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,760
mental health and wellbeing. Obviously,

1640
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,720
we know about the suicide rates in young

1641
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,160
men. Um, with nearly three and a half,

1642
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,000
they're nearly three and a half times

1643
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,440
higher than those of young women. Eating

1644
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,680
disorders have risen as well in young

1645
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,920
men. And from an employment perspective,

1646
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,559
as of late 2024, 15.1% of men aged 16 to

1647
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,960
24 were not in education. Um, compared

1648
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,240
to 11% of women, which equates in the UK

1649
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,240
to about 550,000 men. And lastly, um,

1650
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,480
young women are between the age of 16

1651
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,839
and 24 now earn nearly 10% more than

1652
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,240
their male peers, reversing the

1653
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,920
traditional gender pay gap in this age

1654
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,280
group.

1655
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,400
And I could go on and on and on.

1656
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,000
Specifically, the things that I've kind

1657
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,039
of not talked about are just how family

1658
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,599
dynamics have changed. And by by age 14,

1659
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,280
nearly half of firstborn children do not

1660
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,760
live with both natural parents compared

1661
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,200
to 1970.

1662
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,799
And this was this was really shocking.

1663
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,960
And I think it really rose an argument

1664
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,400
which I saw play out in I saw the Sunday

1665
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,240
Times do a big piece about it. I saw it

1666
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,400
on LinkedIn which is what is going on

1667
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,799
here. And is this a clue as to why we

1668
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,599
now have this term manosphere? It's a

1669
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:01,680
reaction manosphere is a reaction to the

1670
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,640
the pendulum swinging too far. The

1671
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,920
pendulum needed to swing for sure. I

1672
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,640
slightly disagree. So I think I spoke at

1673
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,400
the beginning about the sexual

1674
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,000
revolution being two things. So one is

1675
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,280
the ideological thing we've we've spoken

1676
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,280
about quite a lot and the other is the

1677
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,960
material changes which no one designed

1678
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,319
really like this wasn't coordinated by

1679
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,559
anyone. This just happened. This is just

1680
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,480
how technology goes. And I think in

1681
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,200
general that history should best be

1682
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,640
understood as technology with everything

1683
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,280
else kind of running along in its wake

1684
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,440
including ideology. I actually think a

1685
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,119
massive thing that that's going on with

1686
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:40,799
young men, it's not actually feminism

1687
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:44,000
that has messed them up. It's actually

1688
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:46,160
technology and economics. So it's that

1689
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,920
one of the

1690
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,280
the most consequential things of the

1691
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,359
20th century and before this is really

1692
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,920
industrial revolution onwards is male

1693
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,079
strength became less important

1694
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,079
economically.

1695
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,520
Blue collar work is less valuable than

1696
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,160
it used to be. It's less available than

1697
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,839
it used to be. It turns out America was

1698
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,000
saying that girls um predominate at

1699
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,720
universities. girls actually tend to be

1700
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,119
better suited to a lot of work which has

1701
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,400
flourished in this era. So say service

1702
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,400
sector work or um uh working in

1703
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:21,039
education and things like that. there's

1704
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:23,119
basically been a boom in um areas of

1705
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,359
life which are better suited to women

1706
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,039
professionally and the opposite has

1707
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:29,280
happened with men and I really think

1708
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,760
that a lot of what's going on with men

1709
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,960
say turning to the manosphere is this

1710
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,280
feeling of being

1711
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,599
economically devalued

1712
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,920
and there are feminists who cheer that

1713
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,039
on but that's not basically that's that

1714
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,119
pretty much has actually nothing to do

1715
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,079
with ideology it's actually to do with

1716
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,000
just much bigger changes in the world

1717
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,079
and we should expect by the way I mean

1718
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,680
if AI continues a pace we should expect

1719
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,920
to see the same sort of social effects

1720
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,680
happening that this this when you change

1721
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,599
how people earn their money and

1722
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,440
particularly when we're talking about

1723
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,680
people matching up like women tend to

1724
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,720
want to marry a man who I think being a

1725
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,720
provider is not quite right I think what

1726
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,039
women really want though is a man who

1727
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,799
provides excellent insurance a man who

1728
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,920
when you've just had a baby and you

1729
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:17,039
can't work or you're ill or you want to

1730
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,720
spend more time home your children,

1731
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,640
whatever. You want a man who can step up

1732
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,160
and can look after your family. And

1733
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,200
unfortunately, the nature of the economy

1734
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,880
means that there actually aren't that

1735
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,119
many of those men. And that that makes

1736
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,039
men feel really bad and it makes women

1737
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,160
feel resentful and it creates a lot of

1738
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,240
dysfunction. And it's not really

1739
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,480
anyone's fault. It's just what's

1740
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,039
happened. I want a partner. I want

1741
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,359
someone that when things are going badly

1742
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:44,640
for them, I'm there. when things are

1743
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:47,680
going badly for me, they're that they're

1744
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,640
there for me. Like, I want a partner. I

1745
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,640
don't want this biological essentialism

1746
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,319
of he's got to step up and be the

1747
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,400
provider and the protector. I don't want

1748
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:59,760
that. Deborah, can I ask to that point

1749
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,000
then on that partnership? Um, as a man,

1750
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,520
I still kind of assume that a woman is

1751
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,359
more likely to choose me if I have more

1752
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,799
money than her and I can pay the bills

1753
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,920
and I take care of And so I looked into

1754
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,119
some of the research around that and

1755
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,799
there's still an expectation amongst

1756
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,400
women that their their male partner will

1757
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,640
earn much more than them. And when they

1758
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,319
did they did this this big I think it's

1759
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,599
about 70%. I'll put the right stat on

1760
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,359
the screen. When they did this big

1761
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,880
analysis of dating behavior where they

1762
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,880
looked at 1.8 million online dating

1763
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,200
profiles across 20 different countries

1764
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,880
if you earned more so if you had higher

1765
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,559
income you are 255% more likely to get

1766
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,240
an indication of interest on these

1767
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,319
applications. And so I I would love to

1768
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,240
live in a world where that wasn't the

1769
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,160
case. But it seems that women are still

1770
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,000
choosing men that earn much more money

1771
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,559
and that expectation of therefore being

1772
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,280
the provider is so inherent in

1773
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,880
reproductive success as a man. There's a

1774
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,400
reason for that though. So what we

1775
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,680
haven't talked about, can we talk about

1776
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,960
children now? Sure. We can talk about

1777
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,799
whatever you like. Um if you want to

1778
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,799
raise children and be the primary

1779
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,640
attachment figure for your children and

1780
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:02,319
it's usually the mother. Sometimes it's

1781
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,039
the father now, but it's still usually

1782
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:07,119
the mother. Children need a primary

1783
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,880
attachment figure as present as possible

1784
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,720
in the first 3 years if they are going

1785
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,119
to be mentally healthy in the future.

1786
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,640
All of the research shows that if you're

1787
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,480
going to be as physically present as

1788
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,719
possible, unless you've saved a lot of

1789
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,359
money as a woman, you need to depend on

1790
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,640
your partner, on your team member. My

1791
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,480
husband and I were a team before we had

1792
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,480
children. We both earned a lot and

1793
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,560
worked really hard and spent our money

1794
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,560
equally. But then we decided it was a

1795
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,560
strategy. We were going to have children

1796
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,279
and I was going to work as little as

1797
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,520
possible so I could be there for them.

1798
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,080
And he did the bulk of the earning. And

1799
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,679
now the joke is I'm out in the world and

1800
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,199
I'm going to be taking over and he's

1801
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,040
going to be sitting by the pool, you

1802
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:49,120
know, and I'd be fine with that. But

1803
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,719
that's what teamwork is. But the idea

1804
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,719
that I could lean on my husband

1805
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,560
financially in those years and not have

1806
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,199
to earn money and be able to be present

1807
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,040
for my children, there is a very good

1808
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:00,719
reason why that is critical for

1809
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,799
children. And we don't talk about

1810
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,159
children. We're sitting here. This is

1811
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:07,279
the first time we talked about children.

1812
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:09,839
We're talking about adults uh and and

1813
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,920
individuals and no children are

1814
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,679
dependent on us. If you you don't have

1815
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,040
to have children to be happy, but if you

1816
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,799
are going to bring children into this

1817
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,679
world, you have a responsibility to

1818
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,239
those children. And it surpasses any

1819
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,359
individual desire you may have. And

1820
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:25,040
you're saying the mother should be there

1821
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,880
in those opening years. The primary

1822
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,359
attachment figure who's usually the

1823
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,679
mother. Daycare is terrible for

1824
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,359
children. Let's define daycare. Daycare

1825
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,040
is anything under the age of three.

1826
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,279
Otherwise we call it preschool. We used

1827
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,679
to call it nursery school. 3 to five

1828
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,359
before kindergarten. Okay. So anything

1829
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,239
under the age of three where you put

1830
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,600
your child in group care is daycare. And

1831
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,000
what it really is, they're day

1832
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,120
orphanages. You separate a baby who

1833
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,839
needs skin-to-skin contact, the sound of

1834
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,080
their mother's voice, her eyes, her

1835
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,840
physical and emotional presence to soo

1836
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,679
that baby when they're in distress from

1837
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,840
moment to moment to help to regulate

1838
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,000
their emotions. So, two things mothers

1839
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,760
do. They buffer children from stress,

1840
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,560
which is so important because the part

1841
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,560
of their brain that regulates stress is

1842
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,679
meant to remain offline for the first

1843
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,760
year and very quietly slowly come online

1844
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,760
for the next two years. So what are we

1845
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,760
doing? We're throwing babies into these

1846
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,840
institutional orphanages. It's

1847
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,520
overstimulating. It's stressful. If you

1848
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,840
walk into any daycare, you are going to

1849
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,400
hear many, many children crying.

1850
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,560
Children are not meant to cry much in

1851
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,400
the first year. They're meant to be held

1852
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,960
by their mothers and and held against

1853
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,880
their mother's bodies. So they buffer

1854
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,199
children from stress and they regulate

1855
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,520
their emotions. So what we're seeing as

1856
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,560
a mental health crisis is a crisis of

1857
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,199
emotional regulation issues in children,

1858
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,000
adolesccents and adults. Depression,

1859
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:52,320
anxiety, ADHD, these are all emotional

1860
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,640
regulation issues. That means people

1861
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,320
cannot regulate their emotions. And so

1862
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,800
we're just giving them pills. We're not

1863
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,640
saying where does emotional regulation

1864
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,640
come from? What's the origin of it? And

1865
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,280
the origin of it is in the very early

1866
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,120
days of your life. If you had a mother

1867
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,960
who soothed you when you were in

1868
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,920
distress from moment to moment, it

1869
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,560
regulates your emotions. So it's only

1870
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,080
after three, 85% of the right brain is

1871
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,480
developed by three. It's only after

1872
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,400
three that you internalize the start to

1873
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,719
internalize the ability to regulate your

1874
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,400
own emotions or to deal with stress and

1875
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,159
adversity in the future. So does that

1876
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,600
mean that if I'm not home as a mother

1877
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,159
for those early 3 years, you think

1878
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,760
there's possible chances that my child

1879
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,159
might grow up to be somewhat traumatized

1880
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,360
or have some kind of It is not what

1881
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:40,239
nature intended for us. And so we have

1882
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:43,280
made social changes that are about

1883
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:46,480
narcissism and self-orientation and me

1884
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:48,640
me and don't involve an understanding of

1885
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,760
children's irreducible developmental

1886
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,280
needs. And if we did, then maybe more

1887
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,719
women wouldn't have children. And that

1888
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,080
would be fine. I have no problem. I'm

1889
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,080
not a pronatalist. You don't have to

1890
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,159
have children to be happy. You can, you

1891
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,239
know, build businesses, build houses,

1892
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,920
have loving, intimate relationships, not

1893
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,320
have children. But if you're going to

1894
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,880
have children, you need to know that

1895
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,000
drop dropping and running, putting them

1896
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,040
in daycare, or now, let's talk about

1897
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,560
very poor women because this is always

1898
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,440
going to come back at me. What about

1899
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,960
very poor women? There are so many

1900
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,280
solutions

1901
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,760
for very poor women that do not involve

1902
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,600
daycare. And I hate when people say poor

1903
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,360
women have to rely on daycare. Why

1904
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,800
should they have to rely on daycare when

1905
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,719
rich women don't have to rely on

1906
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,880
daycare? And the truth is there are

1907
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,719
other solutions. Poor women can live

1908
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,679
together and support one another and

1909
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:42,560
form communities. They can share care of

1910
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,880
a caregiver. It's far better to have a

1911
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,760
single surrogate attachment figure, a

1912
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,760
babysitter who is a full-time babysitter

1913
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,199
than putting a child in daycare. So, if

1914
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,199
you can't be there and you're poor and

1915
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,520
you have to work, then it's far better

1916
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,960
to have first kinship bonds, someone

1917
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,719
who's related to you because it's going

1918
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,120
to be a more similar investment in that

1919
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,840
child than anyone else. Secondly, a

1920
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,760
single surrogate caregiver, a babysitter

1921
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,920
or nanny. If you can't afford it, share

1922
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,600
the care with another mother because

1923
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,480
that's still going to be better for that

1924
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,159
child than uh than putting them into an

1925
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,239
institutional group environment. Because

1926
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:19,040
what you're doing is you're basically

1927
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:22,080
putting uh usually no less than five

1928
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,640
children with one caregiver under the

1929
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:27,280
age of three. In in some cases, it's

1930
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:30,000
under the age of one. And if you've ever

1931
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,600
had a baby crying, you know that that

1932
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,360
baby is going to get the other babies

1933
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,040
crying. And now you have five babies

1934
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,880
crying. There's no way you can soo them

1935
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,640
in when they're in distress. There's no

1936
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,120
way you can regulate all those babies

1937
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,560
emotions. We are doing terrible damage

1938
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,120
to our children by putting them in

1939
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,480
daycare. Now, daycare was the feminist

1940
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,560
agenda. It was about the the second wave

1941
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,159
of feminism. They said, "Put your babies

1942
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,560
in daycare. It's the only way you're

1943
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,239
going to go back back to work and work

1944
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,719
work." And and they didn't talk about

1945
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:01,600
children. The first wave of feminists,

1946
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:04,239
they talked about children. Um Mary

1947
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,400
Shelley and Mary Wstonecraft, they

1948
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:09,520
believed that mothering was powerful

1949
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,400
work. It was work. It was a career. It

1950
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,159
was admired. It was elevated. They also

1951
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,400
believed in fighting the patriarchy.

1952
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,159
They believed in equality. But they

1953
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,400
didn't forget about mothering. The

1954
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:23,520
second wave of feminists, I think it was

1955
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:25,120
Betty Friedan said that um staying at

1956
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,400
home with your children was she called

1957
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:30,560
it a concentration camp with comforts.

1958
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,159
That was the beginning of the tide.

1959
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,719
That's when the tide turned for women

1960
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:37,760
where the narrative changed. So women

1961
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:40,719
felt women who were loving being mothers

1962
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,000
and loving raising children suddenly

1963
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,920
were told that they were in a

1964
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,960
concentration camp and that they were

1965
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,800
prisoners and oppressed. And some of

1966
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,440
them were and some of them probably

1967
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,560
shouldn't have had children. And many of

1968
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,960
them weren't. And even today me we

1969
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,360
people write me every day and say thank

1970
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:03,280
you for saying what you say because

1971
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:06,080
society's narrative is so uh much about

1972
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,239
we have no value unless we go out into

1973
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,199
the workforce. So can I ask you

1974
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:13,840
genuinely want to know what

1975
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:16,000
baby boomers tended to be raised by

1976
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,159
stay-at-home mothers because financial

1977
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,159
world was totally different then like

1978
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,199
you know we're not when you talk about

1979
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,920
very poor women I have university

1980
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:28,239
educated friends who cannot afford to

1981
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,679
buy a property anywhere they don't have

1982
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,880
parents that can give them money they're

1983
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,640
never going to be able to save that much

1984
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,320
money and they move out of a rented

1985
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,000
property probably once a year because

1986
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,840
the landlord moves them on and then the

1987
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,800
boiler is not working and so on and so

1988
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,320
on and so on. And I have a local food

1989
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,840
bank that I donate food to and I often

1990
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,960
get chatting to people. There are

1991
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,719
nurses, full-time nurses who live in

1992
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,400
London who have two children at home who

1993
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,560
the the hospital cannot have any more

1994
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,080
nurses leave because there is there are

1995
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,480
not enough nurses. It's a real problem

1996
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,320
that the NHS is so understaffed. Various

1997
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,199
reasons for that in America too. But the

1998
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,199
nurses can't give up their job because

1999
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,679
their children would have nothing to

2000
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,360
eat. They are at food banks with a

2001
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,040
full-time nursing job. So, we're not

2002
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,120
talking about, you know, I don't really

2003
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,000
know what you mean by very poor women. I

2004
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,239
There are women with professional roles

2005
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,840
who will never own own their own home,

2006
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:22,159
who are struggling to keep the lights

2007
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,400
on, struggling to put food on the table.

2008
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:27,040
Now, when I heard you talk on Steven's

2009
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,920
podcast before, you said, "Well, look,

2010
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,320
you know, people don't want to

2011
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,920
downscale, and when when my children

2012
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,840
were young, we did without things like

2013
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,840
second homes and vacations." And Erica,

2014
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,199
there is no hope for a second home now

2015
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,480
for anyone. And I understand that's

2016
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,320
different. Your generation was

2017
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,960
different. No, but that's why I said

2018
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,960
women who are workingass and must work.

2019
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,719
There are solutions for those women that

2020
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,040
don't involve putting their children in

2021
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,520
daycare. And we're not discussing those

2022
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:56,080
solutions. But do you see, listen, I

2023
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,640
would love if the government of every

2024
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,840
government would say, "Here's the option

2025
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:05,360
to stay home for 3 years. Here's here."

2026
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:07,600
Well, and great, they should Hungary,

2027
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:10,320
there are some and that is amazing. And

2028
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,640
I think lots of parents, and for me, I

2029
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,640
don't think it has to be the mother, and

2030
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,440
I've got friends who are same-sex

2031
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,120
parents and who have the most incredible

2032
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,800
uh relationships with their children. I

2033
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,560
don't think it has to be a mother, but I

2034
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,000
I feel like there's lots and lots of

2035
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,840
parents who would love to stay home for

2036
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,360
three years with their children and be

2037
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,440
able to afford that and to be able to

2038
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:32,239
afford to get and and that that

2039
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,760
corporations would then go, you know,

2040
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,280
there's a lot of evidence that if you

2041
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,719
take three years off to raise your

2042
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,120
child, when you come back, you've got a

2043
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,640
whole new skill set. You Yeah, there's

2044
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,080
books written about that. Oh my god. You

2045
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,520
go back into the financial district,

2046
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,080
you've negotiated with a toddler for

2047
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,159
three years, step inside. Absolutely.

2048
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,840
And yet often that is not recognized.

2049
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:53,120
women are pushed out of the workforce.

2050
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:56,239
So, I am 100% with you that attachment

2051
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,480
is important and that many parents would

2052
01:17:56,239 --> 01:18:00,400
love to take three years off and this is

2053
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,719
not being made possible by unregulated

2054
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,920
capitalism by governments who do not

2055
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,520
care. Agree. And I'm from America where

2056
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,280
we don't have any paid leave at all.

2057
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,600
Absolutely. You know, I just I go I go

2058
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,199
and advocate on the hill for this. I

2059
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,840
mean, I've been advocating for a decade

2060
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,840
for paid leave and I don't seem to be

2061
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,960
getting anywhere, but I'm trying. What

2062
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,800
are your thoughts on this, Louise, in

2063
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,520
terms of the role that feminism has had

2064
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,520
on mother mothers and motherhood and

2065
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,280
someone in the trenches? So, we I I

2066
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,640
mean, I should say I partly as a

2067
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,440
consequence of reading Erica's work and

2068
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,800
also having you on my podcast. Um, we

2069
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,880
have moved heaven and earth to not put

2070
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,480
our children in daycare, which has

2071
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,560
involved quite a lot of like creative

2072
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,159
thinking and we are poorer than we would

2073
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,679
otherwise have been, you know, and and

2074
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,280
people look at us like we're crazy

2075
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,040
sometimes and think, why why have you

2076
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,719
made your life so complicated? And it's

2077
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,719
because um me and my husband both have

2078
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,000
this really strong feeling that we don't

2079
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,560
want to put them in institutional

2080
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,600
childare. And that is weird. And one of

2081
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,400
the things that I really don't like in

2082
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,960
the UK policy space and I this is true

2083
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,600
in other countries like the US too is

2084
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,080
that governments at about the turn of

2085
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,960
the millennium seem to have cottoned on

2086
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,880
to the fact that they can use women to

2087
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,440
boost GDP.

2088
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,679
And um David Goodhart, who's a a friend

2089
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,960
and author, he wrote a book recently

2090
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,400
called The Care Dilemma. And he

2091
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:23,120
described this this uh historical event

2092
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,080
as a one-time boost to GDP. It's not

2093
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,679
replicable. But in really the 1990s,

2094
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,280
obviously the sexual revolution predates

2095
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:31,520
this, but really the 1990s is when you

2096
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,920
see this massive surge of working

2097
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,840
mothers. This idea that you should be

2098
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,560
out of the house 40 hours a week,

2099
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,400
children daycare, that's pretty new. and

2100
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,560
governments like this because

2101
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,600
governments like women paying taxes.

2102
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,960
Mhm. And I think that to some extent

2103
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,760
some should we say non-maternal feminism

2104
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:55,360
has been a little bit naive about this

2105
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:58,000
and thinking that if we can get the

2106
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,560
government to support daycare based

2107
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,320
initiatives that that's good for women.

2108
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,000
There's so much research on this showing

2109
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,000
that actually most women find it really

2110
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,600
really hard and it's a it's a very

2111
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,120
common thing in mom's groups and on

2112
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,800
social media and and so on and women

2113
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,600
thinking I do not want to leave my my

2114
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,679
66% of women in UK want to stay home if

2115
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,199
they bring all want to work stay home

2116
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:20,719
more yeah and what I object to is the

2117
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:23,440
current arrangement that we have in the

2118
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,440
UK and elsewhere where the government

2119
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,800
does nothing for you if you're a

2120
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,719
stay-at-home mother the government

2121
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,400
actually punishes families in the tax

2122
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,400
system if you're a single earner a

2123
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,480
family, you will earn you will pay more

2124
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:37,120
tax than if you earn the same amount but

2125
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,120
across two incomes. You are directly

2126
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,840
punished. This was deliberately

2127
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,159
established as a quote unquote feminist

2128
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,520
policy so that it would so that it would

2129
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:48,080
channel women back into the workforce

2130
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,920
after they'd had children. I also don't

2131
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,440
like the fact that the only setup that's

2132
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,040
available in terms of getting any kind

2133
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,880
of funding from the government is for

2134
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,159
daycare. You can't put money towards a

2135
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,320
nanny. you can't put money towards

2136
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:00,800
having your a grandparent or an aunt or

2137
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,880
something help. Yeah. The only way that

2138
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,679
you can get any kind of subsidy is

2139
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,360
through daycare. And I think that I mean

2140
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,760
talking about choice that's removing

2141
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,360
choices from women and most women don't

2142
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,480
want to take that choice and they're

2143
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,239
doing it because they're being channeled

2144
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,920
in that direction by economic forces

2145
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,920
which I object to. But I don't think

2146
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,679
that's that's to call it a feminist

2147
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,840
policy. It feels like guilting women

2148
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,520
twice. what I said at the top about

2149
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,239
relieving women from this emotional

2150
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,480
burden of guilt. I feel like if that's a

2151
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:31,280
that's a cap an unregulated capitalist

2152
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,040
policy, that is not a feminist policy. I

2153
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,280
I think what she which if I heard her

2154
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:38,560
correctly, she said that they were using

2155
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,880
feminism in a way. They used it um as a

2156
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,880
as a banner, but it's actually the

2157
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,000
government wanting the GDP. I mean,

2158
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,120
that's what I heard. I don't know. Yeah.

2159
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,560
Well, and also it's a policy. The thing

2160
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,040
is that women disagree on stuff, right?

2161
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,920
So, including, you know, present company

2162
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,440
included. Um,

2163
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,520
some women I mean this is kind of the

2164
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:58,880
whole story of the second wave. There

2165
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:02,000
are some women who for temperamental or

2166
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:06,560
life circumstance reasons have benefited

2167
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,400
from this. For instance, pushing daycare

2168
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,239
as one example. I could I could list

2169
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,000
loads.

2170
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:14,480
There are some women who are more

2171
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,239
temperamentally inclined to work

2172
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:18,560
full-time, who don't like being stay at

2173
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:20,800
home moms, who find it boring,

2174
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,800
frustrating, whatever it is. Can I ask

2175
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,280
you a question, Stephen? Go ahead. Would

2176
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,520
you take a three-year career break?

2177
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,520
Would you be able to do that? Would I be

2178
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,560
able to take a threeear emotionally,

2179
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,880
mentally? So, I would be It's possible,

2180
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,360
but my

2181
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,719
would that be my choice? No. It's

2182
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,800
obviously possible because I have the

2183
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,239
means to. So, I'm a different person.

2184
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,400
I'm slightly more privileged person to

2185
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:47,440
ask. But would I want to take three

2186
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,960
years off my career, stop doing this um

2187
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,719
to

2188
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,639
solely raise children? I would I would

2189
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:56,400
not want to. You would struggle. And and

2190
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:58,320
the thing is men aren't expected to. So,

2191
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,239
we have different nurturing hormones. We

2192
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,560
have a biology that's really different.

2193
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:04,159
I I think we just need to take into

2194
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,280
account

2195
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:09,280
that no one is judging Steven for saying

2196
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,840
that.

2197
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,639
But if I said just couldn't do it,

2198
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,440
people would be like

2199
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,480
and that societal expectation and that

2200
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,000
societal guilt needs to be acknowledged.

2201
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,440
But men and women are different. They

2202
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,040
are different. Steven could say other

2203
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,000
things which would have people's jaws on

2204
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,840
the floor like I don't want to

2205
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,719
financially support my wife and child. I

2206
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,600
think people would be quite shocked by

2207
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:31,120
that. I mean we just have different

2208
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,719
expectations from I just don't want to

2209
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,239
go back to men are from Mars and women

2210
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,080
are from Venus. No no I want to give

2211
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:38,560
some evidence of that. So there is

2212
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,040
hormonal research to show that men and

2213
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,800
women respond to nurturing differently.

2214
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,719
We have different hormones, different

2215
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,960
amounts of hormones. They come, it comes

2216
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,960
from different parts of our brain. Uh

2217
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,480
women produce when they give birth, when

2218
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,120
they breastfeed, when they nurture their

2219
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:55,600
young, they produce a ton of oxytocin if

2220
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:59,280
they're healthy. Oxytocin helps you to

2221
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,440
attach to your baby. And it also is is

2222
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,520
inversely connected to cortisol. So it

2223
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,920
lowers the baby's stress. It lowers your

2224
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,320
stress and it raises the well-being of

2225
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,400
the baby and the well-being in you. And

2226
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,239
so what we know is that oxytocin is

2227
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,000
passed back and forth between babies and

2228
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:16,400
mothers. Right brainto right brain

2229
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,719
connection. Oxytocin makes mothers

2230
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,480
sensitive empathic nurturers. It makes

2231
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,560
them very attuned to the distress of

2232
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,719
their babies. When fathers produce

2233
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,000
oxytocin when they stay home, it comes

2234
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,520
from a different part of their brain and

2235
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,280
it makes them more playful tactile

2236
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,560
stimulators of babies. They tickle the

2237
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,719
babies. They throw them up in the air.

2238
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,400
They chase them around. They encourage

2239
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,800
uh risktaking. They encourage

2240
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:39,280
exploration. They're great with uh with

2241
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,040
separation. But in terms of providing

2242
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,960
that emotional security and that

2243
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,080
emotional regulation in those early

2244
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,920
days, mothers do it differently. Fathers

2245
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,199
produce a lot of vasopressin. It's

2246
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,360
called the protective aggressive

2247
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:53,280
hormone. There was a study that was done

2248
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,239
where fathers and mothers lay in bed

2249
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:59,360
together. It was done in the UK. And

2250
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:01,040
when the baby cried, almost nearly every

2251
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,400
time the mother woke up in the middle of

2252
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,480
the night to the baby's cries and the

2253
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,239
father slept through it. But when there

2254
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,320
was way, listen, when there was a

2255
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,639
rustling of leaves outside the window,

2256
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,719
the fathers woke up and the mother slept

2257
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,520
through it because of the predatorial

2258
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,440
threat. We are wired. We are mammals. We

2259
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,040
are not better than mammals. We are

2260
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,440
mammals. And mammals have been doing

2261
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:23,600
this for thousand for millennium. And

2262
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:26,159
evolutionarily there's there's a reason

2263
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,320
why we have different responses,

2264
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,639
different nurturing behaviors that are

2265
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,760
correlated with our hormones. We are not

2266
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:35,199
the we are equal in so many ways, but we

2267
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,800
are not the same in terms of our

2268
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:39,120
nurturing behaviors. That doesn't mean a

2269
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,960
father can't learn. It doesn't mean a

2270
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,520
father who wants to be the stay-at-home

2271
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,120
dad can't learn to be a sensitive,

2272
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,960
empathic nurturer, but if we can't

2273
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,800
acknowledge that we're different, then

2274
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:51,520
we can't teach what we need to teach.

2275
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,719
You said we need education. We need all

2276
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,560
kinds of education, but you can't

2277
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,920
educate a father that he's different

2278
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,560
than a mother if you're not admitting

2279
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,239
that he's different than a mother. We

2280
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,040
are different with exceptions. We're

2281
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,560
we're it's not it's not men from Mars,

2282
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,360
women from Venus. It's overlapping B

2283
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,880
curves. So, there are outliers, but but

2284
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,320
at the population level, which is what

2285
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,920
we're talking about, you have to

2286
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,280
acknowledge that there are differences.

2287
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,440
Did you say that six, what was that

2288
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,360
number you cited? 66% of women would

2289
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,920
like the opportunity to be able to stay

2290
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:22,480
at home. That's a UK figure. 60% in

2291
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,920
America, 66% in the UK. I don't know the

2292
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,719
numbers on men, but I would guess that

2293
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,760
it's really low. And that I know that

2294
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,679
there are other statistics around

2295
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,280
when fathers aren't earning that can

2296
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,560
cause I mean it's kind of difficult to

2297
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,000
because there are obviously confounding

2298
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,600
factors. Maybe fathers aren't earning

2299
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,520
because they are very depressed or

2300
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,880
because they're have poor health or

2301
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,880
something like that. But when fathers

2302
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,880
aren't earning that tends to be bad for

2303
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,920
relationships, bad for men's

2304
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,199
self-esteem. Like I think

2305
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,159
whether this is a good thing or a bad

2306
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:53,840
thing, I think the truth is that most

2307
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:57,280
people

2308
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,280
aspire to something like kind of

2309
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,679
traditional gender roles with some

2310
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,520
flexibility. And I don't think that we

2311
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,520
should consider that to be like some

2312
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,440
inconvenient problem. I think that if

2313
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,480
that's what human beings are like, then

2314
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,960
our politics ought to accept that and

2315
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,040
allow people to flourish and allow

2316
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,880
people to have the things that they want

2317
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,880
while trying to ameliate the trade-offs.

2318
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,120
So, you're you're agreeing with me that

2319
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,760
we need agency and autonomy and people

2320
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:26,320
need to choose because men are taller

2321
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:29,600
than women, right? That's an observable

2322
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:31,360
fact. Overall, it doesn't give you any

2323
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,960
information at all about me and Tom

2324
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,719
Cruz.

2325
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:38,560
So, we're talking about trends. We're

2326
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,560
not talking about the first time Steven

2327
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,679
holds his baby and nurtures it and

2328
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,719
thinks, "Bloody hell, I'm going to take

2329
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:47,440
a year off cuz I can afford to and wants

2330
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:50,239
to do that." It it the all we can ever

2331
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,840
talk about is trends. We cannot talk in

2332
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:54,480
absolutes because we don't have any

2333
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,080
information about what I as a if I were

2334
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,520
a mother, what I should do or what

2335
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,360
Steven should do as a father. But what

2336
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,960
about policy? So, like the example I

2337
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,320
gave, right? The fact that at the moment

2338
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,480
you basically will not get any money

2339
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,920
from the British government unless you

2340
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,960
put your child in daycare. They will not

2341
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,960
give you money for being a stay home

2342
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,560
parent etc. That's a policy choice and

2343
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,480
we can't be neutral about that. We have

2344
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,480
to decide are we going to incentivize

2345
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:17,360
one thing or another. In practice it's

2346
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,480
fantastical to say we just need to give

2347
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,600
people as many choices as possible.

2348
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,520
That's not how humans work and it's not

2349
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,280
how societies work because societies are

2350
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,480
greater than the sum of their parts. So

2351
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:29,360
another example, Elizabeth Warren of all

2352
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,000
people wrote a book called the two

2353
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,199
income trap. I forget when the '9s I

2354
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,199
think this was before she became a

2355
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:37,600
really prominent American politician

2356
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:39,440
where she argued that one of the really

2357
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,440
important things in boosting house

2358
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,960
prices in America and this is true

2359
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,480
elsewhere. There are other factors too

2360
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,960
like mortgage interest rates and stuff.

2361
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,800
But one of the reasons why house prices

2362
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,120
have rocketed and have made it more

2363
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,360
difficult to be a single earner family

2364
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,520
or to be a nurse and feed your children,

2365
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,000
you know, as we were talking about is

2366
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,560
because banks started giving mortgages

2367
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,639
based on two incomes. And it became

2368
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,159
possible to this this crucial legal

2369
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,960
change in in Britain happened in the

2370
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:08,560
1990s similar elsewhere.

2371
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,760
Basically, instead of just borrowing

2372
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,920
against the father's income, you're

2373
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:15,280
borrowing against both incomes. And then

2374
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:17,440
all of a sudden, house prices go up

2375
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,400
because people have more money to spend.

2376
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,880
And it becomes disastrous for a family

2377
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,239
who are paying their mortgage based on

2378
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,080
and of course rent because rent is all

2379
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:27,520
just downstream of property prices

2380
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,600
paying their mortgage on the expectation

2381
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,000
that they have two incomes. This is a

2382
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,679
really good example of why you can't

2383
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,040
just think at the individual level. It

2384
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,120
would be really easy to say, well, just

2385
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,440
give women choices. with fine. The

2386
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:42,480
problem is when it becomes the norm and

2387
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,320
when it becomes public policy for a

2388
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:46,000
certain choice to be made, suddenly

2389
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,440
everyone has to make that choice or they

2390
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,040
suffer serious consequences. And of

2391
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:51,600
course, people can be weird and there

2392
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,280
are people I know them who look at the

2393
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,800
property price problem and say, "No, I

2394
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:58,639
want to be a stay at home mother. I'm

2395
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:01,120
going to move house. I'm going to like

2396
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,199
take up some cottage industry job at

2397
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:05,679
home." Like, you can do it, but you have

2398
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,920
to be agentic. But also, can you can you

2399
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,199
live on an Etsy shop and to have a

2400
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,520
slightly smaller house? That's not what

2401
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:13,520
I know. I I people are really

2402
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,159
struggling, guys. We need these

2403
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,400
governments to step up a and allow this.

2404
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,760
And we need corporations to say, you

2405
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,639
know, you can have a three-ear break and

2406
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,520
come back if this is the ideal thing.

2407
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:29,040
What I would also say is I think it's

2408
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,840
extremely important for whichever parent

2409
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:34,400
decides to be the primary carer to have

2410
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,480
windows outside where they get fed

2411
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,960
emotionally, intellectually, creativ

2412
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:42,880
creatively. If what floats their boat is

2413
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,120
early childhood development and that's

2414
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:48,239
enough for them, that's great. That's

2415
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:50,400
that's autonomy. That's awesome. But

2416
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,840
that is not most people's experience. A

2417
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,400
lot of my friends tell me that

2418
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,560
effectively having a child is becoming

2419
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,000
an unpaid Uber driver for someone who

2420
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,520
doesn't want to go to karate and hates

2421
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,199
you anyway. And it's hard hard work. But

2422
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,120
that's that is a narrative that I'm

2423
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:07,040
going to push back on, which is part of

2424
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,120
the problem, which is that it's the

2425
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:12,560
narrative of misery, which has been

2426
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,960
promoted. And it's not miserable to have

2427
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,719
children. It's joyful. It's the most

2428
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,120
incredible love you'll ever experience

2429
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,760
in your life, but it's also really hard.

2430
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:24,960
And I think we have a bunch of [ __ ]

2431
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:27,040
actually, right? We are producing, we

2432
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,560
are producing women and men who are

2433
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,880
[ __ ] And I'll tell you what I mean

2434
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,480
by that. They cannot deal with

2435
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,239
discomfort. They cannot deal with

2436
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,120
frustration. They cannot deal with

2437
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:39,199
sacrifice or hardship or responsibility.

2438
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:41,040
They want it to be easy. Who said

2439
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:43,840
raising children was easy? You don't get

2440
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:46,000
the good stuff unless you put in the

2441
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,679
work. And it's the same if you're out in

2442
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,159
the world. Of course, it's easier to go

2443
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,159
to a job than it is to stay home with a

2444
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:55,280
child because a child demands more of

2445
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:57,360
you, but it also gives back more. And

2446
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,239
I'm going to say this is not a binary

2447
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:01,679
equation here. So, 66% may want to stay

2448
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:03,520
home, but they may want to stay home and

2449
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,920
have part-time work or do some work from

2450
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,199
home. It may not be as binary as as

2451
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,480
you're making it out to be. It's not

2452
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:11,520
like you have to stay home for three

2453
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,440
years. And it's not an elitist idea. So,

2454
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,040
can I just answer the guilt question

2455
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,120
because I didn't get to answer that

2456
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:20,960
because you said you're making a lot of

2457
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:23,280
women feel guilty. So, guilt is actually

2458
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,440
quite a healthy emotion

2459
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,199
in small supply. Guilt is a very

2460
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,199
healthy. It means that your ego is

2461
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:32,960
functioning. So, if we're not just

2462
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:35,840
preoccupied as women on our own needs

2463
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,440
and desires and self-orientation and

2464
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,679
narcissistic

2465
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:44,239
uh sort of wishes, then listen listen

2466
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:46,639
then we have no you I mean if we're not

2467
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:48,639
just concerned with ourselves then when

2468
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:51,920
we leave our very very very young

2469
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:55,040
children we should feel badly

2470
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:57,679
because we those children need us. If we

2471
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,040
stop feeling badly for our children when

2472
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:03,920
we leave them, you break the bond. You

2473
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,920
can't turn off attachment. So, a little

2474
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,440
bit of guilt means your ego is

2475
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,280
functioning. It's a good sign. Now, the

2476
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,800
response to that may not be that you can

2477
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,840
stay home with your children, even

2478
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,520
part-time, but at least it informs you.

2479
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,520
So, whatever time you have with your

2480
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:24,159
children, you spend it wisely. I mean, I

2481
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:27,840
think it was um it was Penelopey Leech

2482
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:29,360
who said well before me that don't have

2483
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,679
children if you don't want to care for

2484
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,520
them because you can have a very

2485
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,719
productive and creative life without

2486
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,440
having children. But if you're going to

2487
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:39,920
have children, you need to care for them

2488
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,600
and they're your responsibility. Can I

2489
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,120
push back on the word narcissistic?

2490
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,440
Because I'm thinking of those nurses

2491
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,960
that I met down at the food bank. One of

2492
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,400
them had a I think a nine-year-old and

2493
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,199
the others had the other had two small

2494
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,679
ones. the idea that that woman is

2495
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:56,239
narcissistic in any way. I just You've

2496
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:58,320
used it a couple of times and that she

2497
01:33:56,239 --> 01:34:02,880
should feel guilty when she drops that

2498
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:04,560
child off. I I feel so sad that it's

2499
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,520
another layer of oh, it's this healthy

2500
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,080
guilt. Women feel so much guilt all the

2501
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:13,199
time. Nobody is worried that women

2502
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:17,440
aren't feeling guilty enough. They are

2503
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:20,239
trying so hard and this world is

2504
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:23,280
becoming more and more and more and more

2505
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:25,840
and more fraught with inequality.

2506
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,520
That nurse is running around desperately

2507
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,760
trying to give people. One of them said

2508
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,080
to me at one point, I want to give

2509
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,440
people even a good death. I don't want

2510
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,280
to leave them. I have to go over here

2511
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,560
and throw medicine at this person. This

2512
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,679
person is dying. I want to sit with them

2513
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,600
and hold their hand because they don't

2514
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:42,080
have any family or they're not here.

2515
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,120
We're talking about this the most

2516
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:47,840
empathetic person. I think we're asking

2517
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,520
too much of women. Well, evidently, but

2518
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,520
to say that that you use the word

2519
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,199
narcissistic because she's going to do

2520
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,719
her job as a I didn't call that woman

2521
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,199
narcissistic. I said there's a

2522
01:34:54,719 --> 01:35:00,080
tremendous amount of narcissism out

2523
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:01,840
there in women and in men that they do

2524
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,760
not think about their children first.

2525
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,600
They think about them. Now that doesn't

2526
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,199
mean that nurse that nurse may be the

2527
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,360
exception and there's a lot of

2528
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:12,159
exceptions but the truth is we have a

2529
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,840
very narcissistically oriented society.

2530
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:15,600
We do that's why we have all these

2531
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,159
narcissistic disorders. What do you

2532
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,639
think addictions are? Eating disorders,

2533
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:23,840
alcoholism, drug addiction, these are

2534
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:26,480
all narcissistic disorders. So why are

2535
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,239
they on the rise? Because narcissism

2536
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,320
doesn't make you a bad person. A

2537
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:32,159
narcissistic disorder means you were

2538
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,920
neglected as a child and you form

2539
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:36,320
defenses to help you to cope with that

2540
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,000
neglect and that abandonment. And we are

2541
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,159
neglecting and abandoning our children

2542
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,239
on a very fundamental level in the years

2543
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:44,239
that they need us most. And they are

2544
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:46,560
developing as a result narcissistic

2545
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:48,239
disorders in childhood, adolescence, and

2546
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,520
adulthood. Louise, I want to just bring

2547
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,520
you into this for a second because I

2548
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,440
know you're a mother of two two young

2549
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,840
boys. There was a comment made earlier

2550
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,800
about many women consider parenthood and

2551
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,400
I don't want to mischaracterize anything

2552
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,880
you said Deborah but to be why would

2553
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,320
they want to be an unpaid Uber driver. I

2554
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,639
was saying that like that's sometimes

2555
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:07,600
the experience. It's not just all roses

2556
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:09,520
and happiness and joy. So therefore you

2557
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,800
need something outside for your head

2558
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,719
space. That's what I mean. I don't mean

2559
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,400
you can't be a full-time parent. I do

2560
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,719
mean

2561
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,800
mo a lot of people don't just find it a

2562
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,480
a singular joy and they just need a

2563
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,840
little something outside even if they

2564
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,000
can afford to stay home which most

2565
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,199
people can't. That's what I mean. So to

2566
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,920
that point and then also to the point

2567
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:29,679
about narcissism and individualism. What

2568
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:33,120
are your thoughts here? I'm primarily

2569
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:34,800
angry with politicians. Okay. In terms

2570
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,280
of making the life of say this nurse

2571
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:40,800
really difficult unnecessarily. Though

2572
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:43,199
the thing that I also

2573
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,840
want to draw attention to is the extent

2574
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:49,360
to which

2575
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,880
branches of feminism have made a mistake

2576
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,159
like there have been feminism is very

2577
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,800
complex. It's also very old. It didn't

2578
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:56,080
start in the 1960s but um you know Eric

2579
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,280
is talking about maternal feminism. I

2580
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,440
would also call myself a maternal

2581
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,679
feminist and I think that feminism has

2582
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,560
had a a really difficult relationship

2583
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:06,320
with motherhood certainly since the 60s

2584
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,080
because motherhood is really difficult

2585
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,600
because it particularly if you got if

2586
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:13,679
you're ideologically committed to the

2587
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,960
idea of gender sameness underplaying the

2588
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,320
differences biological differences

2589
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,320
between men and women sometimes called

2590
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,480
biological determinism

2591
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:22,880
then motherhood is a real problem for

2592
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,719
you because it really highlights those

2593
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,960
differences and I think that there are a

2594
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:29,840
lot of just facts about men and women

2595
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,119
that we don't actually know widely and a

2596
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,960
lot of young people certainly don't

2597
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:35,520
know. One of the things that a lot of

2598
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,760
women don't know is how much they're

2599
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,920
going to want to be with their babies

2600
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:43,760
because we don't really talk about this.

2601
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,360
And it is a difficult fact for the idea

2602
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,199
of men and women being basically the

2603
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,960
same with different different like bits

2604
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:50,480
and bulbs. And that is partly because

2605
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,000
we're not properly educating women about

2606
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,080
what the experience is like. But it's

2607
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,159
also because unfortunately there has

2608
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:58,080
been this this strain of feminism. It's

2609
01:37:56,159 --> 01:38:00,159
not all feminism at all which has

2610
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:03,040
basically aspired as much as possible to

2611
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:04,800
make women like men. And that includes

2612
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,560
women being like men professionally,

2613
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,840
women having sex like men. That's the

2614
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,360
expression they use in Sex in the City,

2615
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,199
having sex like a man, right? Basically

2616
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,119
enjoying hookups without any real

2617
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:15,199
emotional connection. And I think that's

2618
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:19,199
a real trap for feminism is to assume

2619
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:20,960
that women should want to be as much

2620
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,800
like men as possible. Even women's

2621
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,280
bodies, even if you look at teenage

2622
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,199
girls bodies, they all aspire to be like

2623
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,199
adolescent boys, you know, they don't

2624
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:31,760
want breasts, they don't want hips, they

2625
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:34,159
they want to be right. So, so it is it's

2626
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,880
almost as if we elevated

2627
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:38,880
in a funny way. Feminists were trying to

2628
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:41,679
reject patriarchy, but they ended up

2629
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,920
idolizing it and wanting to be it and

2630
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,520
then rejecting everything feminine. And

2631
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,880
that's a problem, and it's certainly a

2632
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,440
problem for motherhood, you know. And I

2633
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,360
think what maternal feminism says is

2634
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,960
actually maybe women are all right and

2635
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,719
maybe actually this feminine stuff is

2636
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,040
good and maybe motherhood is actually

2637
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:01,760
just as valuable as your professional

2638
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:04,080
life and we should aspire to feminist

2639
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,080
ideas, policy, education, whatever,

2640
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:09,040
which

2641
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:11,040
prizes that and how how much do you see

2642
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,960
women elevated who are mothers? I mean,

2643
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,560
do you you go to a cocktail party and

2644
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,239
you ask a woman what she does and she

2645
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,800
says, "I'm a stay-at-home mom and I'm

2646
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:21,199
raising my children, the back will turn

2647
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,520
on her, whether it's a woman or a man."

2648
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:25,520
And so that means that we've denigrated

2649
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,440
and not just deprioritized, we've

2650
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,679
depprioritized, we've denigrated it,

2651
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:32,400
we've dismissed it, we've turned it into

2652
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:35,119
something less than. And so remember

2653
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:38,719
that what helped women to feel valuable

2654
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:41,199
in society was the admiration for them.

2655
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:44,400
Feminism has to get to a place where it

2656
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:46,480
says you have choice. We admire your

2657
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,800
choice to stay home with your children

2658
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,600
and admire our choice not to have

2659
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:54,320
children. Um, you know, but the idea

2660
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,800
that the second wave of feminism, it was

2661
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,840
about it's all drudgery and it's

2662
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,679
disgusting and boring and it made it

2663
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,920
into this. And now you have these

2664
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,639
websites which are frightening to me,

2665
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,320
the the scary mommy websites where you

2666
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,159
have women saying, "I hate breastfeeding

2667
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,719
and I hate pregnancy and I hate my

2668
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:14,560
children." And it's so disturbing to me

2669
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:16,560
because what have we done to those

2670
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:19,360
women? What have we done to society that

2671
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,080
we have those websites? It's okay to

2672
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:24,239
feel frustrated, to feel bored, to have

2673
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:26,239
many feelings about mothering, but the

2674
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:28,239
hostility towards mothering, the

2675
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:31,199
hostility towards children, the

2676
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:34,000
hostility towards raising children. If

2677
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:36,560
we don't admire mothers again, there

2678
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
will be no mothers in the future. I feel

2679
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,480
totally the opposite of that. It's so

2680
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,040
interesting because I'm not a mother. I

2681
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:46,159
had a Guilty Feminist podcast episode

2682
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:47,280
where Susan Calman, who's a a comedian,

2683
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,320
came on and we said, "What do you want

2684
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,199
to talk about?" And she said, "I want to

2685
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,960
talk about the fact that I've never

2686
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:52,560
wanted to be a mother." I said, "I've

2687
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,800
tried to have children, couldn't, but I

2688
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:59,040
have lots of nurturing relationships,

2689
01:40:54,800 --> 01:41:02,080
love children. I have never had more

2690
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:04,480
fury in my inbox." Like, we were

2691
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,760
monsters because we weren't mothers. So,

2692
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,119
what you're saying is true that

2693
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:10,080
sometimes someone, oh, you're a

2694
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:12,080
stay-at-home mom. And I despise it. Be

2695
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,719
staying being a stay at home parent is a

2696
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,400
job of work. And I want women to be

2697
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,480
celebrated for staying home with their

2698
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,080
children. I want men to be celebrated.

2699
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,760
Uh men tend to be celebrated more if

2700
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,840
they do that work. I want women to be

2701
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,679
celebrated. I want all parents of any

2702
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,560
gender to be celebrated for that. We

2703
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,719
agree on that. Have we have we got a you

2704
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,920
said something there which links to the

2705
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,360
next thing I wanted to talk about which

2706
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,560
is if we don't correct this in some way,

2707
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,239
we're not going to have mothers. And

2708
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,239
when we look at the birth rates and the

2709
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:40,639
fertility rates, this 50% of young women

2710
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:42,960
don't want to have children. So, you

2711
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,280
know, again, I'm all for choice and I'm

2712
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,440
I think women have to come together. So

2713
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:50,000
in a way the feminism movement didn't

2714
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:53,440
unite women, it split women in many ways

2715
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,159
the second wave of feminism. Women were

2716
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:58,960
historically for millennium the

2717
01:41:56,159 --> 01:42:00,480
caretakers of a community, the community

2718
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,280
leaders. They would check on the

2719
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:05,520
elderly. They would feed the poor. They

2720
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:09,040
would take care of the children. Right?

2721
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:12,320
So what happened is that we took them

2722
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:14,480
out of their caretaking roles and it was

2723
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:17,440
like taking a keystone species out of

2724
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:19,840
the environment. Much of the environment

2725
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,760
degraded and shriveled up. That's why

2726
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,360
we're seeing 50%. That's why we're

2727
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,920
seeing, in my opinion, that's why we're

2728
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,679
seeing such a rise in mental illness.

2729
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,080
Women aren't going to check on their

2730
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:32,159
neighbors anymore. They're not feeding

2731
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,719
the poor at their local church. They're

2732
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:38,000
really preoccupied with making money and

2733
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:41,040
materialism and the GDP and and a world

2734
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,639
in which they are no longer caretakers.

2735
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,400
Now, not everybody's meant to be a

2736
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:50,800
caretaker, but the point is once we lose

2737
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:52,960
that that lynch pin, the the society

2738
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:56,480
degrades, the ecosystem, it it it

2739
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,760
degrades. Is it our job to be down at

2740
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,960
the soup kitchen and checking on the

2741
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,239
elderly neighbor? Surely that's the

2742
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,400
community's job. We should raise our

2743
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:04,320
sons and daughters to do that. All

2744
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,800
children should be raised to check on.

2745
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,960
It's not women's job. I work in a

2746
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,360
writer's room at the moment and I love

2747
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:14,639
it and I am not less good in the room

2748
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,360
than any man. I get so much joy from it.

2749
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:21,199
It's so exciting. If we say, "Oh,

2750
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:22,960
feminism took away my key lynchpin role

2751
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:24,320
where I have to like go to a soup

2752
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,239
kitchen and then check on a neighbor and

2753
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:27,679
check on the graph." While men still get

2754
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,360
to go into the writer's room and create

2755
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:31,199
an animated feature film like it was in

2756
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,360
the 50s or the 60s or even the 70s or

2757
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:36,159
the 80s or the damn 90s, let's be

2758
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:38,000
honest, I don't get to do that. The film

2759
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:39,600
gets to be more male. It tells the story

2760
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,840
to the next generation and the boys get

2761
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,760
to make that film and the stories go on

2762
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,400
and on and on that my role is checking

2763
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:48,080
on the elderly neighbor and the man's

2764
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,000
role is to go and write the exciting

2765
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:52,000
movie and create that's not the

2766
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
counterpart. Men do pro-social things,

2767
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,639
too. They don't just write TV shows.

2768
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,639
They fight fires. They earn money. They

2769
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,760
chop wood. They I mean I'm being really

2770
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,880
talking about what Erica was saying

2771
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,239
about the unpaid labor of checking. So

2772
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,199
can I say I think that one of the

2773
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,400
problems we have in the contemporary

2774
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,360
world and this applies just as much to

2775
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,800
men as to women. We talk about the

2776
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:12,960
manosphere earlier is that

2777
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,440
gender roles contain both privileges and

2778
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,360
responsibilities both of them. So men do

2779
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,560
other pro-social things, right? And I

2780
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,119
think that generally one of the problems

2781
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,520
that we have in contemporary culture

2782
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:26,239
having rejected so much of traditional

2783
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,679
gender ideas is that gender roles

2784
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:29,840
traditionally contain both privileges

2785
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,520
and responsibilities. So for men the

2786
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,040
privileges are kind of obvious like

2787
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,800
feminists have drawn a lot of attention

2788
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,239
to these. But men also have counterpart

2789
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,360
responsibilities which includes things

2790
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,360
like dying for their country or for

2791
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,760
their family which includes doing

2792
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,920
backbreaking labor. uh you know there

2793
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:47,440
are all sorts of hard things that men

2794
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,760
are expected to do in exchange I think

2795
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:51,760
this is the unwritten agreement in

2796
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,679
exchange for those responsibilities

2797
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:57,119
those privileges rather women have that

2798
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:59,360
too so women have some privileges you

2799
01:44:57,119 --> 01:45:01,679
get to uh the women and children first

2800
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,159
principle when it comes to saving lives

2801
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:06,159
women are often the beneficiaries of

2802
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:09,119
what's called benign sexism so men being

2803
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:11,520
kind of uh differential to women like

2804
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:13,679
nice gentlemanly men being differential

2805
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,040
to women. There's this cognitive bias

2806
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,679
called the women are wonderful principle

2807
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:22,000
where people will actually if you ask

2808
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:23,199
someone to do you want to save a a woman

2809
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,320
that you don't know or a man that you

2810
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:26,560
don't know from drowning people will

2811
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,400
overwhelmingly choose to save the woman.

2812
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,159
So there are those privileges. There are

2813
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,239
also responsibilities and they include

2814
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:34,719
things like caring work which is hard

2815
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:36,880
and the danger and difficulty of

2816
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,239
childbearing which is really hard. And I

2817
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,440
think that one of the problems, and

2818
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,719
maybe this is narcissistic, I don't

2819
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:43,360
know, this is a this is a touchy word,

2820
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:45,520
but maybe this is narcissistic, is that

2821
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:47,199
both sexes want the privileges without

2822
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,320
the responsibilities. And you see that

2823
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,600
within the manosphere as well. That's

2824
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,880
what the manosphere want. They want all

2825
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,159
the privileges of masculinity without

2826
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,239
any of the responsibilities. They don't

2827
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:56,960
want to have to be the breadwinner for

2828
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:59,119
their families or to do difficult work

2829
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,880
or to risk their safety doing anything.

2830
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:03,440
And I'm afraid sometimes feminism is

2831
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,320
like this as well that we expect women

2832
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:08,560
to be given to be deferred to and to be

2833
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:09,840
prioritized, but we say, "I don't have

2834
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,280
time to do all this stuff for other

2835
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,880
people. That's ridiculous. I should be

2836
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,159
like writing TV shows." I mean, that

2837
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:15,920
that's not the counterpart, right? Like

2838
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:19,199
writing TV shows is great, but it's not

2839
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,560
like essential work to society, whereas

2840
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:22,000
raising children and protecting your

2841
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,440
community really is. And we do need

2842
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
people to do that of both sexes. Problem

2843
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:27,679
is, we can't put a price on on it. And

2844
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,920
that's the problem is that we can't put

2845
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:32,239
a price on how important it is to raise

2846
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:35,119
children. There's there it's unpaid

2847
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:37,760
work. And because we focus so much in

2848
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:40,560
society on paid work, we can't put a

2849
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,639
price on how elevated women's work

2850
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,040
should be. Meaning how elevated

2851
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:47,199
nurturing children should be in society.

2852
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:48,400
You know, I mean, my kids always say,

2853
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:50,320
again, I'm going to get a lot of help

2854
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,880
for this, too, but my kids always say,

2855
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,880
"It's not fair that people in finance

2856
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,119
are earning all that money and doctors

2857
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:59,520
and nurses and social workers and

2858
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:01,679
teachers earn so little." And they used

2859
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,360
to say that when they were little and I

2860
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,440
had a hard time explaining to them why

2861
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,679
that was. And all I could say was the

2862
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:10,400
world is not a fair place. But that's

2863
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:13,280
not a very good response. And so, you

2864
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:16,320
know, I think the idea that we have

2865
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,360
shifted this narrative towards working

2866
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,880
out in the world and paid labor and and

2867
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:22,480
accomplishments out in the world and

2868
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,360
achievements out in the world as opposed

2869
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:27,440
to what's right in front of you. The

2870
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,920
accomplishment which is maybe the

2871
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,760
greatest accomplishment of raising

2872
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,600
emotionally, mentally, physically

2873
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:36,080
healthy children that you put out into

2874
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,320
the world for the next generation. I

2875
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:41,040
mean, we have to survive as a species.

2876
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:42,960
And so that's every all of that paid

2877
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:46,080
work is also important and you should

2878
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,800
have the choice to do that or nurture or

2879
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:51,040
some of both. But if I were going to say

2880
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:53,520
my one goal out of this podcast would be

2881
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,360
to to to help people understand that we

2882
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:57,360
have denigrated

2883
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:00,000
maybe one of the most important work you

2884
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:02,880
can do instead of elevating it. Instead

2885
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,639
of admiring women for staying home and

2886
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,400
dealing with the boring moments and

2887
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,600
dealing with the hardships and dealing

2888
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,520
with the sleeplessness and the

2889
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,600
frustration, it's much easier to go to

2890
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,920
work. It is much easier to leave your

2891
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,480
children in daycare or with a nanny, not

2892
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,800
the women that have to, believe me. But

2893
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:20,800
it is much easier if you have a choice

2894
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,360
to go to work because being out of the

2895
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:25,280
house is it's harder work staying home.

2896
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,719
So why aren't we admiring the women who

2897
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,440
are staying home and doing that hard

2898
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,639
work and having those boring moments? I

2899
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:34,480
I I agree that parenting is difficult

2900
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,520
work. I agree that raising the next

2901
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:40,639
generation is extremely valuable. I

2902
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:44,400
agree that the people who do it, whoever

2903
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:47,600
they are, should be uh respected and

2904
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:49,199
should be it be paid in in the way that

2905
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,520
we live in a capitalist society. And if

2906
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:55,360
we don't put a value on it or we don't

2907
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:58,320
create tax breaks around it or you know

2908
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,719
have child endowment around it, we then

2909
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:03,840
say it's not important. So I I

2910
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:07,600
absolutely agree with all of that. I do

2911
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:10,880
not agree that women we pull feminism

2912
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:13,840
pulled a lynch pin out when it said

2913
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,400
women women shouldn't have to be the

2914
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,239
ones that visit the neighbor and do the

2915
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:20,320
do all the unpaid labor around in the

2916
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,320
community. I think that should be unpaid

2917
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,639
labor in the community is important but

2918
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:27,280
that's what why they call it community

2919
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:29,440
and not women's work. It's a community

2920
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,280
effort. So, I should do it, but I should

2921
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:33,679
also get to go to work in the writer's

2922
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:36,000
room and my husband should do it and he

2923
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:40,080
should go and get to do his job. So, I

2924
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,080
don't think I think a lot of times today

2925
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:45,040
I don't know I think maybe I don't know

2926
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:47,199
maybe without meaning to I've heard from

2927
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:49,920
both of you even though we agree on many

2928
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:51,679
things feminism really did a number on

2929
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:54,639
us or feminism pulled the lynch fing or

2930
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:56,960
it's feminism's fault. Without feminism,

2931
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,920
none of us would be around this table

2932
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:02,480
because Steven wouldn't value our

2933
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:04,639
voices. Absolutely. Like in the nicest

2934
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:06,880
possible way, if you were in a man in

2935
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:09,119
the 50s, would you invite three women on

2936
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,000
effectively like a TV, radio show,

2937
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:13,840
whatever media was available? 100%. It's

2938
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,400
why I said feminism did a lot of good,

2939
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:19,520
but it went too far. And so that that's

2940
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:22,239
me saying I I respect the women that

2941
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:24,480
came before us that created uh a

2942
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:26,320
paradigm that allows us to work out in

2943
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,239
the world to have a voice to have

2944
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,760
choices to have control. But why is it

2945
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:32,159
feminism not going too far and

2946
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,960
capitalism not accommodating and our

2947
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:36,560
government's not accommodating the new

2948
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,000
world that we live in that is obviously

2949
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,480
better for women? We none of us could

2950
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,560
get a credit card a couple of dec few

2951
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,320
decades ago. conjugal rape was still

2952
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,440
legal in this country till like what I

2953
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,560
don't know you would know better than me

2954
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:51,840
like the 90s something technically in

2955
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,360
case law you know I it just

2956
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:55,520
we wouldn't have been able to go and get

2957
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,600
a mortgage or a bank account on our own

2958
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,600
we couldn't have anything so instead of

2959
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:02,960
blaming feminism which has got us around

2960
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:05,840
this table so frequently I feel we

2961
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,880
should look at okay feminism got us here

2962
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,600
and now what would we like next feminism

2963
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,760
has got us this far so what Can how can

2964
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:17,119
we encourage instead of damning

2965
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:21,360
feminism, encourage feminism to make

2966
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:24,080
sure we admire and respect and pay

2967
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:27,280
properly the women in our workplaces and

2968
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:29,440
also admire and respect and pay properly

2969
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,840
or make sure that women are in safety

2970
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:34,400
and security when they parent. How can

2971
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,080
we do both? I I agree with that. I feel

2972
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,679
when you keep saying well feminism did

2973
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,960
this, feminism did this. At this time,

2974
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,119
this is this is we got to meet this

2975
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,320
moment. women, we have to meet this

2976
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:45,360
moment. And do you know what this moment

2977
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:48,000
is? This moment is a moment where Row

2978
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:50,320
versus Wade has been overturned.

2979
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,679
Where far-right Christian nationalists

2980
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:55,280
are rising up to take away our rights.

2981
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:56,800
There are people in America right now

2982
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,880
saying there should be one vote per

2983
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:01,440
household and that should go to the man.

2984
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:03,920
I have seen Paula White who is the faith

2985
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:05,440
zar of at the White House saying it's

2986
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:08,320
God's arrangement that women be in

2987
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:10,960
subjection to men. I have lived that. I

2988
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:13,520
will not go back. You are both

2989
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:16,480
professional women, intelligent women.

2990
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,679
You have written books. Please come with

2991
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:22,239
me and say feminism has got us this far

2992
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:24,000
and feminism can take us further. If you

2993
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:25,679
keep saying feminism's to blame, the

2994
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,840
manosphere are watching and they take

2995
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:30,159
those clips. They take those clips. They

2996
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:32,480
go see women are saying feminism is so I

2997
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:35,199
think the idea is I believe in maternal

2998
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:36,880
feminism where all women are respected

2999
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:39,440
whether they work at home or they work

3000
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,520
outside the home L. So I think that that

3001
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:44,639
is exactly why we need to be thinking

3002
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:46,719
about maternal feminism because if

3003
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,840
basically if feminism cannot reproduce

3004
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:52,960
itself literally if it if it if it is

3005
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,679
the case that a feminist society is a is

3006
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:58,239
a very very low fertility society which

3007
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:59,920
has no which does not respect motherhood

3008
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:01,840
which discourages women from having

3009
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,639
children because it's limits your

3010
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,480
freedom etc then feminism dies out

3011
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,400
feminist societies die out they wither

3012
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,760
and die and conservative

3013
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,960
very conservative, not the kind of

3014
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,800
conservative I'm okay with, like the

3015
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,760
very conservative societies, if they are

3016
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,280
the only ones that can accommodate

3017
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,000
children,

3018
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:23,040
then they win. At the moment, the best

3019
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,440
predictors of within within low

3020
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:27,119
fertility societies like ours, the best

3021
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:28,639
predictors of how many children you have

3022
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:30,719
is basically how religious you are and

3023
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,800
how conservative you are. It used to be

3024
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,560
up until relatively recently that

3025
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,719
Democrats and Republicans had basically

3026
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,800
the same birth rate. Now Republicans are

3027
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,800
massively outstripping Democrats. And

3028
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,800
the thing is that all of this stuff is

3029
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,880
is at least to some extent heritable.

3030
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,679
People are to some extent they they

3031
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,040
adopt the politics and the world views

3032
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,679
of their parents. Not always obviously

3033
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:53,760
people rebel but in general you imitate

3034
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:55,440
the culture you were raised in. And also

3035
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,440
some of this stuff is actually heritable

3036
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,599
like there are personality traits which

3037
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:01,599
make you more religious or make you

3038
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:04,159
inclined to certain politics which are

3039
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:06,000
heritable partially. So basically

3040
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:08,239
current the current trajectory while

3041
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,280
we're kind of arguing about the rights

3042
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,800
and wrongs of this stuff the current

3043
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:13,199
trajectory is for a societyy's become

3044
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,080
much more conservative and that's what

3045
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:18,159
the birth rates phenomenon spells for

3046
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:20,239
everyone. And I mean I and I genuinely

3047
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,840
think as someone who likes being able to

3048
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:23,920
have my own bank account and vote and

3049
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,480
whatever I actually choices Yeah. Right.

3050
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:29,119
Like I I'm a centrist here. Okay. And I

3051
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:31,840
actually think that if we care about any

3052
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:34,000
of that stuff, then we have to find a

3053
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,599
way of having a feminism that is

3054
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,400
fertile. Deborah, we need a fertile

3055
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:40,639
feminism according to Louise. Listen,

3056
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:43,840
I'm as barren as [ __ ] Steve. So, I

3057
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:46,400
can't help with this. However, um I'm

3058
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:48,480
fine about it. Don't worry that I don't

3059
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:51,199
want you to feel sorry for me. I I uh I

3060
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,560
have a an amazing life and in the end

3061
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:56,639
think this was probably the better thing

3062
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:58,000
for me. But um all the fe I don't think

3063
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:00,400
we need to call it maternal feminism.

3064
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,280
All the feminists I know either have

3065
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:07,599
children or really support the mothers

3066
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:10,080
in their community including me. I uh I

3067
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:13,679
don't I don't recognize this guys. I

3068
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:16,639
don't recognize it. I feel like

3069
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:18,880
I go on marches, feminist marches in

3070
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:21,360
London. There's children everywhere.

3071
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,639
secular progressive people are so so

3072
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:26,239
below replacement just on the data. How

3073
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:27,280
do you respond? I'm talking about we're

3074
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:31,199
going to run out of these people if they

3075
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:33,840
don't start having kids. I mean makes it

3076
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:35,920
it I there's probably reasons for it

3077
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,920
like if you're more progressive, you're

3078
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,199
more aware of climate change. You're

3079
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,040
more you're less you're more likely to

3080
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:44,080
pay your taxes. You're less likely to

3081
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:45,360
have um e excess wealth to raise the

3082
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,040
next generation. You're going to be more

3083
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:49,360
aware of like what am I bringing the

3084
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:52,080
children into? If you have a vision of

3085
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:54,080
the world that God's going to save

3086
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,599
everything and you, you know, you're

3087
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:57,360
just going to vote this way and

3088
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,960
everything is going to be great, maybe

3089
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,040
you pump out more children if you think

3090
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,560
that, you know, your God, whoever that

3091
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,320
is, is going to save the day. I don't

3092
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,960
know. Do we need to be having more

3093
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:09,360
children though? Because my my concern

3094
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:13,040
about it is is what are we having them

3095
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:15,199
for? If the world is getting more

3096
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:17,119
difficult to live in, if it's if people

3097
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:19,280
can't afford a home, even like a nice

3098
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:21,280
rented property that feels quite stable,

3099
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:24,800
if they can't afford a home, if they're

3100
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:26,800
working millions of hours and not being

3101
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:30,159
able to balance parenthood and feeling

3102
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:32,639
very stressed and, you know, the the

3103
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:34,960
manosphere is rising and it's it's boys

3104
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,480
are so depressed and girls feel like

3105
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,239
this and all of that. What are we having

3106
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,639
it what are we doing it for? Unless

3107
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:44,080
we're going to create conditions

3108
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:45,760
that people want to live in that make us

3109
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,520
happy or at least, you know, no one to

3110
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,760
be happy all the time, but what are we

3111
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,840
what are we doing it for? Make sure you

3112
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,239
keep what I'm about to say to yourself.

3113
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,560
I'm inviting 10,000 of you to come even

3114
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:59,520
deeper into the D of a CEO. Welcome to

3115
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:01,040
my inner circle. This is a brand new

3116
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,639
private community that I'm launching to

3117
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:05,040
the world. We have so many incredible

3118
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:06,880
things that happen that you are never

3119
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:08,080
shown. We have the briefs that are on my

3120
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,080
iPad when I'm recording the

3121
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,599
conversation. We have clips we've never

3122
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:13,119
released. We have behind the-scenes

3123
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:15,440
conversations with the guests and also

3124
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:18,719
the episodes that we've never ever

3125
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:20,480
released and so much more. In the

3126
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:22,000
circle, you'll have direct access to me.

3127
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:23,840
You can tell us what you want this show

3128
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,280
to be, who you want us to interview, and

3129
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:28,000
the types of conversations you would

3130
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:30,000
love us to have. But remember, for now,

3131
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,320
we're only inviting the first 10,000

3132
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,520
people that join before it closes. So if

3133
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,719
you want to join our private close

3134
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,840
community, head to the link in the

3135
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,840
description below or go to

3136
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,840
daccircle.com.

3137
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:43,679
I will speak to you there.

3138
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,679
The hardest conversations are often the

3139
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,920
ones we avoid. But what if you had the

3140
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,239
right question to start them with? Every

3141
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,119
single guest on the diio has left behind

3142
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:54,880
a question in this diary. And it's a

3143
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:56,480
question designed to challenge, to

3144
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,159
connect, and to go deeper with the next

3145
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:01,119
guest. And these are all the questions

3146
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:02,960
that I have here in my hand. On one

3147
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:04,880
side, you've got the question that was

3148
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,719
asked, the name of the person who wrote

3149
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:09,679
it, and on the other side, if you scan

3150
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:12,239
that, you can watch the person who came

3151
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,239
after who answered it. 51 questions

3152
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:16,080
split across three different levels. The

3153
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:18,719
warm-up level, the openup level, and the

3154
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:20,639
deep level. So, you decide how deep the

3155
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:22,400
conversation goes. And people play these

3156
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:25,360
conversation cards in boardrooms at

3157
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:27,440
work, in bedrooms, alone at night, and

3158
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:28,719
on first dates, and everywhere in

3159
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,000
between. I'll put a link to the

3160
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:31,679
conversation cards in the description

3161
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
below and you can get yours at the

3162
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:36,239
diary.com.

3163
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,080
I want to talk about one last subject.

3164
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:42,000
Um, which is the subject of pornography.

3165
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:44,080
You left this for the end. Cool. We're

3166
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,000
not perfect. Yeah. I just I'm I'm

3167
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,440
interested to see how you all think that

3168
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,800
the impacts and implications of

3169
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,920
pornography impact everything we've

3170
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,000
talked about today, whether it's men,

3171
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,480
it's women, it's children, etc. And also

3172
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,679
how that ties into feminism.

3173
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:59,920
I would say there is there is increasing

3174
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:03,520
evidence that everything we do alone on

3175
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:06,239
our phone excessively is causing us to

3176
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:09,040
disassociate, is causing us to get some

3177
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:12,239
kind of addiction property from it, is

3178
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:14,480
causing us to disregulate, is causing

3179
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:17,199
the breakdown of regular communication

3180
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:20,800
in society. So do you think porn is a

3181
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:22,960
net negative for society?

3182
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:24,320
I I think it's it's a moot point because

3183
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,040
it's always been there and it's always

3184
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,400
going to be there. But I would like But

3185
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,960
if you could press a button and get rid

3186
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:33,199
of it and pressing that button, would

3187
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,880
that cause society to be better or worse

3188
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:36,800
in terms of happiness if we use that as

3189
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:39,520
a metric? And any of the metrics that

3190
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:42,000
one would use?

3191
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:44,400
Honestly, it's like

3192
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,639
saying, can you press a button and get

3193
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,960
rid of human sexuality? I I don't know

3194
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:51,520
what what the world would look like if

3195
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,880
people weren't seeking it out. But where

3196
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,040
there is no before we had porn, people

3197
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:56,639
always drew things through. Can I say

3198
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:58,960
that when it was two-dimensional, when

3199
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:00,400
you had when boys had a Playboy magazine

3200
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,480
under their bed or they stole their

3201
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,199
father's Playboy magazine, that was

3202
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:07,920
actually less harmful than the the the

3203
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:11,119
movies and the video because um it

3204
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,960
two-dimensional isn't as powerful as the

3205
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:14,560
I guess video. Video I mean, I'm saying

3206
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,880
films. Yeah. Modern porn is a super

3207
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:20,800
stimulus. Yeah, it's a completely It's

3208
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:24,080
not like real action is not saucy murals

3209
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:28,560
in Pompei, right? It's it's designed to

3210
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:30,080
be incredibly stimulating like in in and

3211
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,000
it's very clever actually like the way

3212
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:33,520
that the the the porn platforms work.

3213
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,719
It's really it's a clever product and

3214
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,719
like we're talking about unre

3215
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:39,440
unregulated capitalism like this is the

3216
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:43,280
preeminent example. It's designed to tap

3217
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:44,320
in to our most profound desires. Uh, I

3218
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,159
mean, particularly for men using it,

3219
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:49,040
it's like hyper visual. Everything's

3220
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:51,040
exaggerated. It's I mean, one of the

3221
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:52,960
reasons why it's a bad idea to use porn

3222
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:55,920
in general, aside from it being super

3223
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,679
unethical as an industry, is um it will

3224
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:59,840
make the rest of your sex life worse

3225
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,599
generally because it will mean that real

3226
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,480
sex will not measure up. If you've

3227
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:06,560
trained your brain to enjoy the super

3228
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:09,119
stimulus, the normal stimulus becomes

3229
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:11,199
less exciting. Like how if you eat junk

3230
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:14,400
food then it becomes less attractive to

3231
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:16,880
eat vegetables or whatever. Like it's

3232
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:19,360
it's not like Playboy

3233
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:21,520
of the 50s cuz it left room for fantasy.

3234
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:23,760
There's no I mean it's it's so explicit

3235
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,840
that it leaves no room for fantasy. Even

3236
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,840
your own fantasy and is it harming men

3237
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,719
as well, Luis? Yeah, absolutely. I mean,

3238
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,639
not least, one of the things that is uh

3239
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:34,159
certainly anecdotally a massive problem

3240
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:35,280
with compulsive porn use is erectile

3241
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:37,280
dysfunction when you're actually trying

3242
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:39,280
to have sex with a real human being

3243
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,560
because you've trained your brain and

3244
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:43,360
you've also trained the rest of your

3245
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,880
body to only respond to this particular

3246
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:46,400
stimulus and to masturbation. If I put

3247
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,880
the button in front of you, like I said

3248
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:50,880
to Deborah, would would you press it to

3249
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,040
porn forever? Of course I would. Porn is

3250
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:55,520
all bad for not least the porn forwards.

3251
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:57,440
I mean even just on that basis in the

3252
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,199
same way that I would ban some hideously

3253
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,760
unethical industry that had nothing to

3254
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:03,440
do with sex because people I mean like

3255
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,920
the suicide rate among poor performs is

3256
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:08,000
appalling or like I can't remember her

3257
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:09,760
name but the the most the most

3258
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,159
promiscuous woman in Australia that only

3259
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:14,480
fans model who last just last week had

3260
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:16,880
sex with 583 men in one day and was

3261
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:18,480
hospitalized subsequently right this is

3262
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:20,639
what we're talking about in practice

3263
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:23,199
this is like a hideous industry it is so

3264
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:24,480
bad for women I cannot I cannot

3265
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,679
understand how feminists could endorse

3266
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:28,320
it. I just can't. It's one of my

3267
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:32,159
strongest opinions. Can you would you

3268
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:34,480
ban saucy murals in Pompei? I can't. No,

3269
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:36,000
you can't ban anything. So, would you

3270
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:37,840
But but there's the button. Saucy murals

3271
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
in Pompei,

3272
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,040
which by the way is number five on the

3273
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,400
They're They're too They're

3274
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:44,000
two-dimensional. I don't mind two

3275
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:46,320
dimensional. It's funny. I don't mind

3276
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,159
two dimensional. Um it's when it it's

3277
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:51,119
live action and they actually with video

3278
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:54,000
games uh they did studies to show that

3279
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:55,840
um the more realistic the video games

3280
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,639
the more harmful they were to to

3281
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,719
teenagers and so there's something about

3282
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:02,480
so the murals were two-dimensional and

3283
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:04,000
maybe they would be considered art. So

3284
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,159
you would press the button to end the

3285
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,679
threedimensional porn there and you

3286
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:09,920
would you wouldn't press the button. I

3287
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:10,960
mean I I just think the button's right

3288
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:12,880
there. What you do? You can press it. No

3289
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,719
one's watching. Okay. that the wholesome

3290
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,040
couple who were really into each other.

3291
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:20,719
I thought this is modeling something

3292
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:23,360
that I think is very healthy people

3293
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:25,199
doing violent things to women and like

3294
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:28,800
hentai porn which I discovered in my

3295
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:30,719
research. Um which is animated porn with

3296
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:34,960
like Lolita style girls that look really

3297
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:37,040
young and violent stuff. I we obviously

3298
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,199
we need regulation and we need

3299
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:43,280
discussion. I am not the person to lead

3300
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:44,800
it, but you know, if if you would press

3301
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,119
the button to get rid of the saucy

3302
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:49,520
murals in Pompei, then it's kind of

3303
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:51,119
erasing human sexuality, I think. And I

3304
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,239
don't know what Well, would you or not?

3305
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:55,920
Would you leave those up as a sort of

3306
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:57,760
little racing artifact? What would you

3307
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:59,440
do, Louis? I think I would put it up in

3308
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:02,080
a school room. I mean like I think

3309
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:04,239
everyone accepts that even that really

3310
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:07,360
mild stuff needs to be like what about

3311
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:09,599
limited if not if not it needs to be

3312
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:11,280
limited if not legally then socially.

3313
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:14,000
What about statue of David? What about

3314
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:16,480
just the naked form?

3315
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,920
No, I would not ban that. But I Deborah,

3316
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:19,599
I think that this is a rhetorical trick

3317
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:22,960
to avoid the fact that this is the least

3318
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:25,040
feminist industry we can conceptualize.

3319
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,400
And a lot of feminists have really

3320
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:29,520
dropped the ball on this and have

3321
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:31,920
actually decided to prioritize their own

3322
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,520
their own status and their own

3323
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,520
commitment to sexual liberalism over

3324
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:36,880
actual real women who have been sexually

3325
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:40,320
tortured within this industry. And it

3326
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:42,000
makes me really angry. And I think that

3327
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,199
I mean this is true in all all sorts of

3328
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,880
areas of feminism. I mean what we're

3329
02:04:43,199 --> 02:04:46,159
doing here is an intrafeminist argument,

3330
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,599
right? Like we're all basically starting

3331
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,960
from the same position which is we think

3332
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,560
that women's interests ought to be

3333
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,880
protected that women's flourishing ought

3334
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:54,719
to be promoted children's too. What

3335
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,880
we're arguing about is over how to do

3336
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:58,159
that and that's an argument that's going

3337
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,280
to go on forever and has gone on forever

3338
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:01,360
and I think it's good. We should have

3339
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,719
these arguments but if we can't start

3340
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,480
from the premise that like the sexual

3341
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:06,239
torture of women for profit is bad then

3342
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:08,320
what are we doing? Why does it make you

3343
02:05:06,239 --> 02:05:09,599
angry and and what part of it makes you

3344
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:11,040
angry as it relates to feminism?

3345
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:15,760
possibly is partly from having worked

3346
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:19,480
with victims, I think. But

3347
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,480
I guess it's the

3348
02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:23,040
I guess it's the dishonesty I just don't

3349
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:24,320
like. I'm not accusing of being

3350
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,400
dishonest, but I just think that this

3351
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:28,000
ideology is just so riven with

3352
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:32,159
contradictions. Where did Where did

3353
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,760
feminism drop the ball in prioritizing

3354
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:35,840
the interests of a small

3355
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,440
unrepresentative group of women over the

3356
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:39,360
interests of other women? And I don't

3357
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,280
just mean in terms of like class or

3358
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:42,480
wealth, although that is a factor. I

3359
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:44,639
mean a lot of it is to do with

3360
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:46,080
personality. We've talked about agency.

3361
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:48,000
We've talked about some people are more

3362
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:49,760
maternal than others. You know, I think

3363
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,360
that one of the one of the perennial

3364
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:53,440
problems with feminism is that the women

3365
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:55,679
who tend to sort of rise to the top and

3366
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:57,840
get media careers. I do realize I'm in

3367
02:05:55,679 --> 02:06:00,000
this category are not representative of

3368
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,280
other women and will often have

3369
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,719
preferences that are very different

3370
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:04,159
which are just not shared by everyone

3371
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,920
else. I want to ask you all a question

3372
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:07,360
just for me which is something that I

3373
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,360
contend with now that the world has

3374
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:11,599
shifted and changed and definitions have

3375
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:13,760
shifted which is about masculinity and

3376
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:16,480
what it is to be a good man. I aspired

3377
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,960
to be a good man. Um and I'd like you

3378
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:21,520
all to tell me one by one what

3379
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,599
masculinity now means to you and how all

3380
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,119
of the the men that have gotten to this

3381
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:27,199
point in the podcast and and also the

3382
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:30,480
mothers of men and fathers of men should

3383
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:32,719
be raising their young boys to be good

3384
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:35,119
men. And how does that sort of

3385
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:37,599
contradict or how is that in harmony

3386
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:40,000
with our evolutionary nature? So

3387
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:42,320
starting with Louise,

3388
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,400
I think that

3389
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:48,159
the key task that every society has to

3390
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:51,360
set itself is how to young men in

3391
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:52,960
particular have this incredible energy

3392
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:55,040
that can be put to good things and to

3393
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,239
bad. Like the the the greatest

3394
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,679
discoveries in the world have

3395
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:59,040
overwhelmingly been made by young men

3396
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:01,199
and young men also commit the vast

3397
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:04,560
majority of violence, right? It's this

3398
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:06,960
this particular group is contains the

3399
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:09,119
most incredible opportunity and also the

3400
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,560
most incredible danger and every society

3401
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:12,400
faces this problem like what do we do

3402
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,560
about these guys like how do we how do

3403
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:17,599
we cor correctly channel that in a way

3404
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:19,760
that's pro-social or antisocial

3405
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:21,440
and I don't think our society is doing

3406
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,280
an especially good job of that I mean to

3407
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,800
some extent we do pacify men with porn

3408
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,719
and video games so they're less

3409
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:28,880
dangerous than they have been in

3410
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:30,400
previous eras but at the same time I

3411
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,159
don't think that we're deploying male

3412
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:35,520
male talents as well as we could. And I

3413
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:39,119
don't think that we are um encouraging

3414
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,639
men to become good husbands and fathers.

3415
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,239
What about the provider, protector,

3416
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:43,760
procreator narrative? Scott Galloway has

3417
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:45,599
talked about that men should aspire to

3418
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,440
be providers, protectors, procreators.

3419
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:48,960
Is that accurate? Yeah, that sounds

3420
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:51,040
about right. Yeah. I mean, I I've

3421
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:54,159
written about CAD and dad mode as well,

3422
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,000
like how do we encourage men to reject

3423
02:07:54,159 --> 02:07:58,480
CAD mode and embrace dad mode? What is

3424
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,400
CAD mode? I like that. A CAD, you Oh,

3425
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,520
he's a cat. Kind of an oldfashioned word

3426
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:06,239
for a man who would sweep in on a

3427
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,000
motorbike or a car

3428
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:10,480
boy. Yes, I wasn't going to say that,

3429
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,239
but you know.

3430
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,599
So, is there So, okay. So, just to make

3431
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:15,679
sure I've completed your my perspective

3432
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:18,079
of how you think about masculinity. So,

3433
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:20,239
should I be holding the door open for my

3434
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:21,760
partner and should I be paying the bill

3435
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:23,119
on the first date? I think chivalry is

3436
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,079
great. I think that rejecting chivalry

3437
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:27,679
was a mistake. Yeah. Okay. Um but also

3438
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:30,880
it's not the most important masculine

3439
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:32,400
virtue. I mean I most of the most of the

3440
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:35,199
virtues

3441
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,199
should be demonstrated by both sexes.

3442
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:38,800
Yeah. You know honestly whatever but

3443
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:40,239
there are some which I think maybe men

3444
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:42,239
need to focus on more and women need to

3445
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:43,840
focus on more. And I certainly with

3446
02:08:42,239 --> 02:08:45,199
raising my boys who are very little at

3447
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,480
the moment but we've we've me and my

3448
02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:47,760
husband have talked a lot and thought a

3449
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:49,280
lot about how do we encourage

3450
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,760
specifically masculine virtues. And

3451
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,199
sometimes that means parenting boys

3452
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,480
slightly different from girls. In what

3453
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:55,920
way? give me an example of a masculine

3454
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:57,679
virtue you're trying to bring out like

3455
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,840
this question about how what to do about

3456
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:01,760
young male aggression. I think a tried

3457
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,280
and tested way of doing that which we're

3458
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,079
certainly going to try with our kids is

3459
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,840
um combat sports or sports in general or

3460
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:10,560
basically teaching young men how to

3461
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:12,560
sublimate and regulate and and channel

3462
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,239
effectively those feelings of aggression

3463
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,960
in a way that is constructive and not

3464
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:18,960
destructive. Deborah,

3465
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:21,760
how do you agree disagree with that

3466
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,280
perception? That's not at all my

3467
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,840
worldview.

3468
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:28,639
I think we should be

3469
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:31,520
teaching our children to find their

3470
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:34,639
humanity and their empathy no matter

3471
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:36,400
their gender. When I researched my book,

3472
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:37,520
Six Conversations We were scared to

3473
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:39,520
have, I thought that it was going to

3474
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:41,040
show me that the internet and especially

3475
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:42,159
social media made us less and less

3476
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:43,679
empathetic. You know, we think about

3477
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:45,920
keyboard warriors and they can't see

3478
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:49,119
your face and all that. But what I

3479
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:52,320
discovered is in fact every single day

3480
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:55,760
social media asks us to be more and more

3481
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:58,400
empathetic to fewer and fewer people.

3482
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:59,920
That is a cult. I was in a cult. You

3483
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,760
have to be very empathetic to the people

3484
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,920
in it. And the second someone steps

3485
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:06,079
outside, they're dead to us. And that is

3486
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:07,440
what I see on the internet. I see it in

3487
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:11,440
I think we're all in a big series of

3488
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:15,520
cults. So I I see now this rise of young

3489
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:19,679
men being told women are dreadful. Women

3490
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:22,239
have taken our place which is just it is

3491
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:24,239
not for girls not to go to university to

3492
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:26,159
make things more fair for boys. It is

3493
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:27,599
for us to nurture our boys to make sure

3494
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:30,079
if they're feeling lost or they're

3495
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,360
feeling that they they can't compete or

3496
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:33,599
they're out in the world and they

3497
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:35,679
they're flailing around, we need to

3498
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:38,480
build them up. We do not need to tell

3499
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:39,840
girls to step back. that is we've we

3500
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,679
haven't got equality yet. We're nowhere

3501
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,599
near it, much less pulling ourselves

3502
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:46,560
back to make more space for boys at this

3503
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:49,280
point. We desperately need to invest in

3504
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,840
our brothers, in our in the boys in our

3505
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:53,920
community in any way we can. I went into

3506
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:55,679
a school and chatted to the boys about

3507
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,560
gender norms and how they felt about it

3508
02:10:55,679 --> 02:11:00,480
and what impositions they felt or what

3509
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,480
random things were weird. And I said to

3510
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:04,480
them, what what would be weird if a boy

3511
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:06,239
did it for no reason? Like there's no

3512
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:08,320
And one of them said knitting. He said

3513
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:09,840
if I brought my knitting knitting to

3514
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,199
school, he said, you know, not that he

3515
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:13,280
knitted. He said, everyone would laugh

3516
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:14,880
at me and why? There's no reason for it.

3517
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:17,199
And another boy just went, I'd bring

3518
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,119
knitting in. I wouldn't care. Are boys

3519
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:20,880
and girls fundamentally, biologically,

3520
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:23,760
physiologically, neurologically

3521
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,280
different? And therefore, do they need a

3522
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,480
different approach? They're hormonally

3523
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:28,639
different. We kind of understand that.

3524
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:31,119
We all agree with that from birth. So,

3525
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:33,280
do they need to be raised differently to

3526
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:35,840
cater to that difference? I wouldn't

3527
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:38,400
exacerbate it. I would say we all should

3528
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:40,400
be I as I said I want a partner and I

3529
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:43,199
think we should be raising both of our

3530
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:45,440
go both our girls and our boys and any

3531
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:47,840
children that feel that they're neither

3532
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:50,400
to aspire to their humanity to their

3533
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:53,440
empathy to look out for each other I

3534
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,679
think exacerbating roles and telling

3535
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:58,480
boys you're like this and girls are like

3536
02:11:55,679 --> 02:12:01,119
that is pushing us further away and it's

3537
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:03,199
it's it's pushing us back decades and

3538
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:05,360
generations. Should a man, a young boy

3539
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:07,440
be a provider, a procreator, a

3540
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:11,679
protector? Should should we instill

3541
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:13,840
those values in young boys? No. Why?

3542
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:16,320
Because there's this there's this heavy

3543
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,400
imposition on boys and there's a heavy

3544
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:20,320
imposition on girls that their life

3545
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:23,360
should look a certain way. And we've got

3546
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:25,520
to a point where men can stay home and

3547
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:29,360
raise their children. Where women can go

3548
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:32,800
out and explore new territory, where we

3549
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:36,079
see that women are as clever as men, as

3550
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:38,880
talented as men, as able to debate as

3551
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:40,719
men. Why would we push this back and go,

3552
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:42,880
well, girls, it's really more feminine

3553
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:45,119
if you do this and boys, girls will

3554
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,040
fancy you more if you do this. So, what

3555
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:49,199
does what does a young man, what should

3556
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,639
his virtues be? You said empathy and

3557
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:52,639
those kinds of things. And then on the

3558
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:54,320
chivalry side of things, should I be

3559
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:55,760
holding the door open for every woman

3560
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:58,159
that walks through one? Should I be

3561
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:00,320
paying that bill on the first day? I

3562
02:12:58,159 --> 02:13:02,000
think it's lovely when all human beings

3563
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,880
hold doors open behind them for other

3564
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:08,719
human beings. I I really disagree that

3565
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:11,199
we should not when we issued chivalry,

3566
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:13,119
what was going on was that there was a

3567
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:15,760
period of time where it was like she's

3568
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:17,760
more gentle. She needs help. And it

3569
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:20,800
stopped people seeing us as people who

3570
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:22,239
could be entrepreneurial CEOs. So, so

3571
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,440
women said, "Look, could you just not do

3572
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:24,800
that?" Because if you're not holding the

3573
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,880
door open for any of the guys, then you

3574
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:30,320
hold it open for me, they see me as

3575
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:32,000
somehow less than sweet, sexualized. So,

3576
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:33,280
we said, "No." Now, I think, look,

3577
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,560
honestly, if a man holds the door open

3578
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:36,079
for me, very, that's very nice,

3579
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,440
whatever. I don't think people see me

3580
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:39,840
that way anymore. I don't think it's a

3581
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:42,639
big deal anymore. I don't like the idea

3582
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:45,760
that you have to pay on the first date.

3583
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:47,360
I I think you know if I've invited you

3584
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:48,719
out, I'll pay. If you've invited me out,

3585
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:50,159
you'll pay. I mean, you're much richer

3586
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:52,480
than me, so probably you should pay. But

3587
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:53,920
that's nothing to do with gender. Steve,

3588
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:55,760
is there not something evolutionary in

3589
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:58,639
that if we look back through our

3590
02:13:55,760 --> 02:14:01,679
ancestry that the the qualities of

3591
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:03,679
fertility are more attractive to to men

3592
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:06,560
and the qualities of being a provider

3593
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:09,920
and more attractive to women. So if I if

3594
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:11,760
I don't sort of invest in becoming a

3595
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,360
provider as a young man, I'm actually

3596
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,800
going to do much worse when I get older.

3597
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:17,760
According to the the some of the data we

3598
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:20,400
referenced earlier, 250% less women are

3599
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:22,560
going to opt for me. So if I if I don't

3600
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:24,239
sort of build a base and become a

3601
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:25,840
provider, am I not am I going to be a

3602
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:27,119
disadvantage as a man in the society

3603
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,639
that we live in? But also, if we look

3604
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:31,119
back through our evolutionary history,

3605
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:35,760
is that not hardcoded into us? makes me

3606
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:37,599
feel so sad that boys feel this huge

3607
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:41,199
responsibility when we are now at a

3608
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:42,800
point when it is it is evident that you

3609
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:44,480
do dragons and you sit next to Deborah

3610
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:47,920
Megan who's every bit as good an

3611
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:49,599
entrepreneur as you. So why is it your

3612
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,280
responsibility? Why is it men's

3613
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:53,119
responsibility? We can both raise

3614
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:55,199
children. We can both we've we've

3615
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:57,840
demonstrated we can both raise children.

3616
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:59,599
I've got the society I live in. But we

3617
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,440
let's reshape it. Let raise your

3618
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:03,360
children to think differently and

3619
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:06,480
reshape it. Is the society we live in a

3620
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:08,719
consequence of our evolutionary survival

3621
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:10,639
of the fittest, natural selection, pick

3622
02:15:08,719 --> 02:15:12,400
a good partner so that you can reproduce

3623
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:13,840
past and you know you see this in women

3624
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,880
where I watching this dating show called

3625
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,360
Pop the Balloon which I love which has

3626
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,280
just gone to Netflix and it's so crazy

3627
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:21,920
that when so basically Pop the Balloon

3628
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,360
is 10 men stand in a line with a balloon

3629
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,040
um or 10 women stand in a line with a

3630
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:26,960
balloon and then a man or woman walks

3631
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:29,199
out. So when a woman walks out and she

3632
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,119
looks at the lineup, she will go down

3633
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:32,719
the lineup and pop every balloon of a

3634
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:34,320
man that's below six feet tall. Just

3635
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:35,520
like that. It's crazy. Every And just

3636
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:37,840
they'll say, "Why did you pop his

3637
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:41,119
balloon?" "Uh, small, short. Why did you

3638
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:43,040
pop his balloon?" Short short short.

3639
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:44,719
This is just part of I know it's it's so

3640
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:46,239
destructive though. Like look, we can

3641
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:48,880
talk about evolution, but I've seen

3642
02:15:46,239 --> 02:15:52,239
David Atenburgh shows wi where our

3643
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:54,000
shared ancestors who are primates um are

3644
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:55,840
ripping each other apart. They a chimp

3645
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,880
comes up and they rip the chim limb

3646
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:01,920
chimp limb from limb. What human beings

3647
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:04,079
have done is evolved to be better when

3648
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,679
we are when we war we are not better.

3649
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:08,159
But we know our better nature and our

3650
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:10,159
better self doesn't do that. Are we are

3651
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:11,520
we fighting against I remember hearing

3652
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:14,079
someone on the podcast tell me that

3653
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:16,000
across across cultures men and women

3654
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:18,159
typically go for the same thing. So like

3655
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,599
men are going for a certain hip ratio

3656
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:22,239
whatever and women are going for a

3657
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,199
certain like shoulder ratio. Are these

3658
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:24,719
things not like fundamentally

3659
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:26,239
evolutionary? It's a status symbols.

3660
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:28,719
Like my husband's shorter than me. It's

3661
02:16:26,239 --> 02:16:30,800
a status. And status is an evolutionary

3662
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:32,559
desire. It it is, but we can be better

3663
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:35,280
than that, can't we? Can't we teach our

3664
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:38,559
girls and boys and non-binary young

3665
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:40,080
people that that that these are these

3666
02:16:38,559 --> 02:16:42,800
superficial things aren't what we should

3667
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:44,880
be like aspiring to. We should be

3668
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:47,760
aspiring to get past them. The idea like

3669
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:49,200
a lot of it is we know this because

3670
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:51,040
different cultures have different beauty

3671
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:52,080
standards. different times in here in

3672
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:55,200
history have had different beauty

3673
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:57,280
standards and men tend to go for the

3674
02:16:55,200 --> 02:17:00,319
beauty standard of the time they're in

3675
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:03,200
or the location they're in and therefore

3676
02:17:00,319 --> 02:17:05,120
it is social it's hey that one means

3677
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:07,439
that you're a successful guy in no way

3678
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:10,240
evolutionary in your mind I think if it

3679
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,399
is evolutionary get over it get past it

3680
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:14,719
get beyond it good luck what do you

3681
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:16,960
think I'm going to say I don't know I

3682
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:20,960
have no idea I disagree with almost

3683
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:23,519
everything she said Um so boys are

3684
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:27,120
neurologically more fragile than girls.

3685
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:28,880
Uh more uh boys are born in the world

3686
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,479
and more girls survive. They don't

3687
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:34,399
survive because uh boys don't survive uh

3688
02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:36,639
as much because they are incredibly

3689
02:17:34,399 --> 02:17:38,960
neurologically fragile, emotionally

3690
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:41,519
fragile too. What that means is they're

3691
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:44,399
more prone to aggression, behavioral

3692
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:46,479
problems, ADHD like behaviors which is

3693
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:49,280
distractability. They're more sensitive

3694
02:17:46,479 --> 02:17:51,599
to stress from a very young age. Um,

3695
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:53,439
they are not the same as girls. They

3696
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:56,399
don't learn the same way as girls. They

3697
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:58,160
need lots of physical expression during

3698
02:17:56,399 --> 02:17:59,760
the day. If they don't get it and

3699
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:01,359
they're forced to sit in circle time

3700
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:03,679
like little girls can sit in circle

3701
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:04,880
time, little boys go off the rails and

3702
02:18:03,679 --> 02:18:07,040
then they're labeled as having

3703
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:09,359
attentional issues. And so we are

3704
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:11,120
educating little boys today like little

3705
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:12,719
girls which is why they can't keep up.

3706
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,519
So if you ask me, we should separate

3707
02:18:12,719 --> 02:18:17,200
little boys and little girls. So, in

3708
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:19,040
terms of the neurological fragility,

3709
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,719
they need that attachment figure even

3710
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:22,639
more than the little girls. When it

3711
02:18:20,719 --> 02:18:23,920
comes to going to school, maybe we

3712
02:18:22,639 --> 02:18:26,160
should separate little boys and little

3713
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:28,800
girls when they're little so we can

3714
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:31,679
cater to their individual needs. Uh, and

3715
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:34,160
it and it is different. Um, and in terms

3716
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:37,200
of going forward, men and women are not

3717
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:39,120
exactly the same. And even if we try to,

3718
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:41,679
thousands of years of evolution are not

3719
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,679
going to be turned around in 50 years.

3720
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:45,359
So we may make some of these changes,

3721
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:47,840
but that's not realistic. What's

3722
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:50,479
realistic is that we've functioned in a

3723
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:52,880
way that is based on survival for

3724
02:18:50,479 --> 02:18:54,960
thousands millennium. And and we're

3725
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:56,559
going to keep functioning that way to a

3726
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:58,160
certain extent. There may be some people

3727
02:18:56,559 --> 02:18:59,679
who branch off and try to do it

3728
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:02,639
differently. You know, the other thing

3729
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:04,639
is that young men today are not they're

3730
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:07,040
they're at a disadvantage when it comes

3731
02:19:04,639 --> 02:19:09,519
to school. And I'm going to say we need

3732
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,040
quotas. And this may sound radical, but

3733
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:13,679
when it comes to college, it should be

3734
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:15,760
50/50. So my kids went to a school and

3735
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:18,160
when it came to nursery school, they

3736
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:20,000
balanced the class. That means if you go

3737
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:22,479
to any preschool, they have half girls

3738
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,479
and half boys. That's just the way they

3739
02:19:22,479 --> 02:19:27,040
do it. They balance it in other ways,

3740
02:19:24,479 --> 02:19:29,359
too. Alpha girls and beta girls and

3741
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:31,280
alpha boys. You can't have all the same

3742
02:19:29,359 --> 02:19:33,200
kind of kid. But the idea that we have

3743
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,800
to balance the odds otherwise we're g

3744
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,559
marriage is also going to come to an end

3745
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:38,160
because of that statistic that women are

3746
02:19:36,559 --> 02:19:39,920
only going to marry at their educational

3747
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:41,840
level or above. So we're going to

3748
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:44,479
marriage will end too. So which girls

3749
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,639
shouldn't go though? It's not which

3750
02:19:44,479 --> 02:19:49,280
girls shouldn't go. It's giving boys

3751
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:52,880
advantage to succeed. And it's saying

3752
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:55,600
you know what we have uh 50% girls and

3753
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:57,600
50% boys in this college in this class.

3754
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,280
So in America we have a lot of

3755
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:01,040
universities. I don't know the UK

3756
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:02,240
system. It's not my country, but in

3757
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:05,040
America, there's a lot of different

3758
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:08,080
places you can go. But the idea that all

3759
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:10,160
it's like funneling the all the kids are

3760
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:11,920
being funneled in this way. And what I

3761
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:15,120
will say is that if we don't balance the

3762
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:17,280
odds, so girls and boys have uh equal

3763
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:19,359
opportunity in college and graduate

3764
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:22,399
school, we are going to have a huge

3765
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:24,479
social dilemma because nobody's marrying

3766
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:26,319
and we have single parents. Then women

3767
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:28,080
are going, "I can't find a man." And

3768
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:29,680
they're having children on their own and

3769
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,200
that's causing a social problem because

3770
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,520
now we have little boys and little girls

3771
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:36,160
that don't have fathers. So all I'm

3772
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:37,760
saying is we need to balance the odds.

3773
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:40,880
That's it. Well, you have to make more

3774
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:42,960
spaces because if maybe that's the

3775
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:45,040
solution. If 60% because otherwise what

3776
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:47,840
you're saying is boys who are less

3777
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:50,640
academic get the places of the 10% of

3778
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:52,880
girls that now can't go in. So is

3779
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:54,479
America going to create more spaces?

3780
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,080
there's less funding. I'm not great at

3781
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:59,760
math, but I'll I'll say we can have 60

3782
02:20:56,080 --> 02:21:02,399
and 60. I don't mind 120.

3783
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:04,160
Okay. Um,

3784
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:05,280
thank you all so much for being here. I

3785
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:07,120
just want to give you an opportunity

3786
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:08,640
just to summarize your thoughts on the

3787
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:11,439
sexual revolution in two sentences if

3788
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,040
you can. I'm going to repeat the insight

3789
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:14,240
of a great friend of mine, Mary

3790
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,359
Harrington, who's also an author. She

3791
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:20,000
wrote this amazing book called Feminism

3792
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:23,200
Against Progress. She says that feminism

3793
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,760
kind of bubbles up at moments of big

3794
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:27,200
societal change when things have really

3795
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,200
changed materially and there's like a

3796
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,479
reassessment of gender relations. And I

3797
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,760
think that's the reason why we're seeing

3798
02:21:30,479 --> 02:21:35,040
this right now. It's because we it's

3799
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:37,120
because of the digital revolution. So so

3800
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:39,200
much has changed, so much is in flux.

3801
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,560
We're having this like renegotiation of

3802
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,359
how men and women are supposed to relate

3803
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:45,600
to one another. And this always happens.

3804
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:48,080
And I think that it's it's good to talk

3805
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,439
about it and

3806
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:51,760
one way or another men and women are

3807
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:53,040
going to have to learn to get along cuz

3808
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:55,520
otherwise we won't reproduce the

3809
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:58,800
species.

3810
02:21:55,520 --> 02:22:03,439
Erica, so I believe in freedom of

3811
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:05,760
choice. Um but not if that choice

3812
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:07,680
is to do harm to children. So I believe

3813
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:09,920
that children should always come first

3814
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:12,479
in our lives. Our family should always

3815
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:14,399
come first. Freud said, "You need love

3816
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:16,080
and meaningful work, but your love

3817
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:18,479
should always come first." If it's your

3818
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:21,280
children, if it's your spouse, if it's

3819
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:23,280
your parents, if it's your next door

3820
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:25,520
neighbors who are your best friends, uh

3821
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,160
love always has to come first. And so,

3822
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:29,840
we have become a world where we put work

3823
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:32,080
first. And so, what I would say is I

3824
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:33,359
believe in choice of all kind. Uh I

3825
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:35,280
don't believe in demeaning or

3826
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:36,960
diminishing someone else's choice. If

3827
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:40,720
they make that choice, I'm fine with it.

3828
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:42,720
But don't demean or diminish my choice.

3829
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:45,520
your practice.

3830
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:49,040
I think the sexual revolution has given

3831
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:51,359
women in spades agency, autonomy, and

3832
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,840
emotional freedom. We don't yet have

3833
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:55,760
enough emotional freedom. There are many

3834
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:58,640
women around the world who have less

3835
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:03,840
agency and autonomy than they did 100

3836
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:05,520
years ago. We must fight for them. And I

3837
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:08,000
think everything is better when women

3838
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:10,960
are free. I think we can create our own

3839
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:13,120
structure and we need to be desperately

3840
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:15,439
need to be our own guiding light. So any

3841
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:18,000
women watching this,

3842
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:21,120
take everything we've said on board and

3843
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,439
then decide for yourself. Do you want

3844
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:28,800
that spaciousness in your life or do you

3845
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:30,399
want rules? And I believe that feminism,

3846
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:31,840
all feminism should be maternal

3847
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:34,560
feminism. I don't think we need the word

3848
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:38,800
maternal in it. And I really, really,

3849
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:40,960
really want all of us around this table

3850
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:43,680
who believe that feminism has given us

3851
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:47,680
the right to sit at it to say that

3852
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:50,319
feminism has given us a lot. And

3853
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:54,479
unregulated capitalism has taken and

3854
02:23:50,319 --> 02:23:57,840
that the next stage is to work together

3855
02:23:54,479 --> 02:24:01,520
because if we divide as women and as

3856
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:03,359
feminists, there is no hope. There is so

3857
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:05,439
much coming our way from the farright

3858
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:07,760
Christian nationalists. We must stand

3859
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:10,479
together.

3860
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:11,920
Thank you so much. Um I want to just

3861
02:24:10,479 --> 02:24:13,920
appreciate all of you for being here

3862
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:16,000
because I think progress starts with

3863
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:17,520
these kinds of conversations and I think

3864
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,280
all too often in society these

3865
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:21,280
conversations happen in little silos and

3866
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:23,120
echo chambers. So everyone's belief just

3867
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:25,120
ends up being reinforced. You you just

3868
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:26,800
confirmation bias just doubles down on

3869
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:28,720
whatever you think. And it's it's not

3870
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:30,399
easy to step into these environments

3871
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:32,080
when there's going to be people watching

3872
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:33,920
this that sit on different sides of this

3873
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:35,359
table in terms of their perspective. So

3874
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:36,880
I applaud you for doing the thing that I

3875
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:38,720
think is most most sort of conducive

3876
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:40,479
with progress, which is having the

3877
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:42,000
conversation and being respectful in the

3878
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:43,200
ways that you disagree about that. So

3879
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,640
thank you so much. You all have

3880
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:46,319
incredible books. There's I mean there's

3881
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:48,000
so many that I can't even I can't even

3882
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:49,680
put them all on on on the table or hold

3883
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,120
them all, but I'm going to link all of

3884
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:52,720
the books below. So, if you want to hear

3885
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:54,880

02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:57,920

3888
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:59,520
subjects, please do go and buy their

3889
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:02,000
books. Um, going to link all of them

3890
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,520
below for you. And where else can we

3891
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,880
find you, Louise? Where's the best place

3892
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,520
to hear more from you about what you

3893
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:10,720
think? So, I have a podcast called Made

3894
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:12,240
My Matriarch. Um, MM, you can find it on

3895
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:13,920
YouTube, all the other podcast

3896
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:15,520
platforms. I've had Erica on before.

3897
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:17,600
Maybe Deborah anytime. You're very

3898
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:20,240
welcome. Um, I talk about sexual

3899
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:22,240
politics, but also

3900
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:24,479
I mean I say that the things that I'm

3901
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:26,000
mostly interested in are um, birth, sex,

3902
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:28,399
violence, and death. So that's what the

3903
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,160
podcast is about. And religion. I'll

3904
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:32,000
link that below as well, Erica. Uh,

3905
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,840
www.comomasar

3906
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,479
komar.com.

3907
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:37,920
Um, you can find everything I do on

3908
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:39,760
there. You can make an appointment with

3909
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:42,160
me because I do virtual appointments.

3910
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,479
Um, and I also started a nonprofit

3911
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:46,319
called Attachment Circles, which is an

3912
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:48,880
educational platform, but a community

3913
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:51,840
building platform. So, please, you know,

3914
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:54,240
go to Attachment Circles and join and if

3915
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,920
you feel generous, donate because we

3916
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:57,439
need the resources to get the community

3917
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:00,479
building going. I'll link all of that

3918
02:25:57,439 --> 02:26:01,840
below as well. Then, Deborah, I do the

3919
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:05,040
podcast, The Guilty Feminist. So, if

3920
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:06,800
everyone could um subscribe and uh do

3921
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:09,439
all those things, that would be great.

3922
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:10,960
But I'm also starting uh a new

3923
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:13,920
grassroots movement called the road to

3924
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:16,399
Gilead because there are moves in this

3925
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:18,800
country from far-right American

3926
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:21,120
Christian nationalists to take our uh

3927
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:23,760
abortion rights and to take our LGBTQ

3928
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:25,920
plus rights and I'm really scared about

3929
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,840
it and I've been talking about it around

3930
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,920
the country on the book tour and I've

3931
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,520
discovered other academics and people

3932
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,880
who are very worried are also talking

3933
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:34,399
about it. So, if you would like to hear

3934
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:35,359
more about Road to Gilead, you can sign

3935
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:37,600

um uh projects coming up. I shall link

3941
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:48,880
all of that below, too. Thank you so

3942
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,160
much. This is a very long conversation,

3943
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,760
but it's exactly what I was hoping it

3944
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:53,680
would be, and I I found my opinion

3945
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:56,080
shifting and changing throughout. So,

3946
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:58,880
that's success for me. This has always

3947
02:26:56,080 --> 02:27:00,479
blown my mind a little bit. 53% of you

3948
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:02,560
that listen to this show regularly

3949
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:04,080
haven't yet subscribed to the show. So,

3950
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:05,200
could I ask you for a favor? If you like

3951
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:06,800
the show and you like what we do here

3952
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,319
and you want to support us, the free

3953
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:10,240
simple way that you can do just that is

3954
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:11,840
by hitting the subscribe button. And my

3955
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:13,520
commitment to you is if you do that,

3956
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:15,120
then I'll do everything in my power, me

3957
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:16,880
and my team, to make sure that this show

3958
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,640
is better for you every single week.

3959
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:19,840
We'll listen to your feedback. We'll

3960
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:21,600
find the guests that you want me to

3961
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:25,640
speak to and we'll continue to do what

3962
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,640
we do. Thank you so much.
