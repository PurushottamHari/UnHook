The ocean is spread across almost 70% of the Earth and holds countless secrets within itself.   The ocean's climate and temperature support the food supply for humans and other organisms. But despite being the source of life on Earth, we know very little about these oceans of ours.  An estimated 97% of the world's water is found in the oceans. Formally the entire global ocean is divided into four distinct regions. Which we know as Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans. Approximately 90% of the ocean has not yet been mapped or explored by humans. However, many amazing discoveries have been made by our marine scientists.  The sea floor is filled with rare and unique marine species as well as minerals.  Besides, just like land, oceans also have huge mountain ranges and deep valleys. If you are asked which is the longest mountain range on earth?  So you will say the Antis Mountain Range found in South America. But this answer is true only for land surfaces, and in fact the Earth 's longest mountain range is submerged in the ocean.  The ocean contains many such features in its depths. So in today's discussion we will discuss about the deepest part of the earth and know what is beneath the ocean. Deep Inside the Ocean. Friends, ocean basin is similar to the land surface in many ways. Mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges, canyons and trenches are also found underwater. These relief features found on the ocean floor are also called submarine relief. These ocean relief features are determined by elevation above sea level, depth above ground surface, and shape. This can be caused by a variety of factors including tectonic activity, sedimentation, and erosion.  It influences factors such as ocean bottom relief, salinity, temperature and ocean currents, as well as controlling the distribution of millions of marine organisms. These relief features can be measured using various methods such as sonar and bathymetry. What lies at the bottom of the ocean ?  To know this, first we have to understand some important facts.  Any ocean floor or sea bed is divided into four sub-divisions for detailed understanding. These are known as continental shelves, continental slopes, abyssal plains, and ocean deeps. Apart from these major divisions, many minor relief features are also found in the ocean. Which includes ridges, hills, sea mounts, gorges, trenches, canyons etc.  Let us understand all these features in detail. Continental Shelf.  Continental shelf is actually a C word extension of continent.  That means, we can call it the maritime extension of the coastline. Where it extends from the coast to the drop off point. This point is called shelf break. Because it is still connected to the coast and it is much less deep. Usually the depth of this shallow water is between about 100 to 200 meters.  Along with this the width of the shelf is 3 to 4 km.  From 100 Km.  Till then she does it very well.  You may be wondering how this part of the ocean is important?  In fact, this is the zone of shallow water ocean above the shelf where sunlight can directly penetrate into the water. Here, due to sunlight and sufficient heat, some microscopic plants and animals develop which we call plates. These plates are mostly food for shelf fish.  Apart from fish, almost all marine foods come entirely from the continental shelf.  Apart from this, the shelf region is also a major source of economic minerals, sand and gravel.  The world's petroleum and natural gas are obtained in large quantities from these shelves.  The discovery of petroleum in the Bombay High and Godavari Basin is an example of on-shore drilling in the continental shelf.  Apart from this, coral reefs, one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems found in the oceans, are also commonly found on these shelves. These are usually found parallel to the coastline and on islands. A striking feature of the continental shelf are submarine canyons.  These sea valleys are similar to the gages found on land.  Sabine canyons are steep-sided valleys that are mostly formed near river mouths.  For example, the Godavari Canyon is found at the mouth of the Godavari River, which is approximately 502 metres deep.  These valleys are also found in the continental slopes beyond the shelf region.  Continental slope.  Friends, after the shelf break point the continental shelf extends towards the deep sea floor. Which is called the continental slope. It extends between depths of about 200 metres to 3000 metres. Whereas the continental shelf region is rich in sediments, minerals, and marine plants and animals.  At the same time, due to the stiffness in the slope region, comparatively less amount of sediment deposits are found here. And all the remaining sediments like sand, mud, etc. flow and accumulate as a pile at the base of the slope. Thus the slope gently moves forward forming a high deposition belt which is called continental rise.  And through this rise, the slope eventually merges into the deep ocean floor. Which is called the Abyssal Plain. Abyssal Plain.  These plains cover about 70% of the oceanian floor at a depth of about 3000 to 6000 meters inside the sea and are also called deep sea plains.  At one time they were considered the most featureless region of the ocean.  But with the help of modern devices it was discovered that these regions of the ocean look like irregular land surfaces. It is widely distributed among oceanic plates, ridges, trenches, sea mounts and oceanic islands.   In addition, the floor of the Abyssal Plain is covered with large amounts of sediments. These sediments are formed from the fossils of organisms found in the sea.  These sediments are called oozes.  Because most of the world's major rivers dispose of their sediments into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Abyssal plains are widespread in both of these oceans. Some open oceans do not produce oozes. By the way, the sediments found on sea floors are called red clay.  And these red cliffs are believed to be formed from dust ejected from volcanoes during volcanic eruptions. Which reach the sea through air and rivers. Such red claws are found in large quantities in the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, the minerals and rare earth elements found on the Abyssal Sea floor make this region critically important.  It is a storehouse of many minerals which include minerals like zinc, copper, nickel, gold, silver and phosphorus. These minerals are present as 3 to 10 cm wide nodules on abyssal plain sediments. These are called polymetallic nodules. Friends, there are some long and narrow depressions on the ocean floor ahead of the Abyssal Plains. Which are known as the deepest parts of the ocean. Oceanic Deeps and Tris.  Oceanic deeps are approximately 3 to 5 kilometers deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. These oceanic tris are found in every ocean basin on Earth. However, the deepest trenches are found in the Pacific Ocean as part of the Ring of Fire. This also includes active volcanoes and earthquake zones.  The Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean is known as the deepest location on Earth with a depth of 36.21 feet.  And its southern end is the world's deepest point called Challengers Deep. Apart from the Pacific Ocean, some oceanic trenches are also found in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Friends, till now we have understood four major features of oceanic relief.  Now we will discuss some minor relief features. However this is just minor in name and in fact much larger features exist in the ocean.  Let us know about these features.  Mid Oceanic Ridge.  Friends, the Mid Oceanic Ridge is made up of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. Such ridges are spread over approximately 65,000 km across the entire ocean. Are spread over more than area.   The peaks of these mountain ranges can be up to 10,000 feet high.  And some of these are so high that they reach above the sea level and appear as islands.  A part of the Mid-Atlantic Rie known as Iceland.  There is an example of such an island.  The Mid Atlantic Ridge is located in the Atlantic Ocean and is considered the largest mountain range on Earth.  This volcanic mountain range extends from 1000 to 1500 km.  wide and about 16,000 feet high.  Where the peaks of mid-oceanic ridges can reach the ocean surface.  There are some Oceanic Mountains whose peaks are very pointed but they do not reach the sea surface and such mountains are called Sea Mounts. Sea Mounts These oceanic mountains are 3000 to 7000 feet high and are mainly of volcanic origin. Volcanoes that do not reach the ocean surface.  After some time it takes the form of a sea mount.  Because it never reaches the ocean surface.  This does not form islands. An example of this is an extension of the Hawaiian Islands located in the Pacific Ocean known as The Upper Sea Mount.  The peaks of sea mounts have a very pointed structure. But with time, the peaks of some sea mounts slowly begin to flatten. These are called table mounts or geos. According to research, more than 10,000 sea mounts and geos are found in the Pacific Ocean alone.  Friends, till now we have understood the geography inside the ocean. From the coastline to the deepest ocean floor, the sea is teeming with life. From microscopic algae to Earth's largest creature, the blue whale, everything is found in these oceans.  The oxygen level and temperature of sea water vary greatly. Generally, the water near the equator is warmer and holds less oxygen than the colder water found near the poles.  Along with this, if we move from surface ocean water to deep water, then with depth, both temperature and oxygen inside the ocean decrease sharply and along with this the pressure increases very rapidly. Despite such a crushing environment and total darkness, this deep ocean is the Earth 's largest habitat.  Where many strange and unique marine plants and animals are found.  Let's take a look at the marine ecosystem. Life at the Bottom of the Ocean.  Friends, while discussing about the continental shelf, we saw that due to the presence of sunlight, that area is the habitat of many marine plants and animals.  This sunlight reaches up to a depth of 200 meters in the ocean and this is why it is also called sunlight zone or photic zone.  The biggest source of the marine food web, i.e. phytoplankton, survives here.  These phytoplanktons are a type of microscopic organisms.  Such as plants, algae and bacteria. Many marine animals are dependent on these phytoplants. Which we call Z Planktens.  Such as squid, jellyfish, krill, oysters, sponges, corals etc.  Large sea animals such as whales and sea turtles can also be seen in this zone.  Most of them come to the surface in search of their food. Many species of corals are also found in this region. Corals are marine animals found in the shelf regions of warm ocean waters and some are also found in cold and dark deep ocean waters. These corals combine with algae called Jazantheli present in the sea to form structures like reefs.  Which are called coral reefs.  These reefs are made of the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral polyps. Thousands of diver species survive in these reefs and this is why they are called rain forests of the ocean. Beyond 200 meters the sunlight starts dimming in the ocean. Very little sunlight penetrates up to a depth of about 1000 meters and this is also called the twilight zone.  Because sufficient sunlight does not reach here and hence there are almost no plants in this zone. This zone overlaps with the continental slope.  As we know, large amounts of sediments flow down the continental slopes toward the deep ocean. And hence this zone serves as a migration corridor for animals like large fish and whales. Common whale species found in this zone include the fin whale, sperm whale, and minker whale.  Beyond this, the depth between 1000 to 4000 meters is called the midnight zone. Because no light can reach there. With depth the water temperature falls and the pressure increases considerably.  The animals found in this environment look strange and unique.  Many animals do not have eyes because they are not needed in the dark. Due to extreme pressure, it is difficult to find nutrients in ocean water and it is also very salty.  In such conditions, the animals found there are often small in size. But their respiratory organs are very strong.  So that it can extract sufficient oxygen from the water. Along with this, their mouth is big, teeth are pointed and stomach is of very big size.  Such features help them to easily eat shrimp, small fish and other micro organisms.  Apart from this, most of their food consists of plant and animal remains that flow from the upper zone. All these features show how these animals evolve with depth in difficult environments and adapt to underwater conditions. Beyond the midnight zone, up to a depth of about 6000 meters, the physical characteristics of abyssal plains i.e. deep sea plains can be seen. Where flat plains, low hills, sea mounts, high sediments and rift valleys exist.  From this Abyssal Zone the entire ocean is filled with darkness.  And the only light at this level comes from bioluminescent animals. Most of the animals in this area include squid, jellyfish, starfish, dragon fish, sharks etc. All of these are bioluminescent.  These are such animals that emit light from their body organs due to chemical synthesis process. This light not only provides illumination in the dark ocean but also helps these animals find their prey.   The deepest ocean zone exists below 6000 meters. Where trenches and deep canyons are found.  This zone extends to the ocean's deepest location, the Mariana Trench.  And very few organisms can survive here. These include animals such as tiny isopods, sponges, and sea cucumbers, related to crabs and shells. However, animals that survive in the abyssal and deepest ocean zones consume micro- organisms, plants and animal waste that flow from the upper zones as food.  But not all inhabitants of the bottom ocean depend just on marine decay and small animals.  Marine scientists have discovered creatures on the ocean floor that feed on unique bacteria found around hydrothermal vents, located below 4,000 metres (1,200 ft) below sea level. These vents discharge superheated water rich in minerals from the Earth's interior. These minerals provide nutrition to the bacteria that grow there. Which ultimately the ocean crustaceans make their food.  Friends, till now we have seen how many fascinating relief features and unique plants and animals the ocean contains in its depths.  But the answer to the question 'What is at the bottom of the ocean' is not over yet.  Relief features and marine ecosystems are a natural treasure found in the oceans. But apart from these, there is a lot more present in Ocean Bottom.  These include many things like aircraft remains, ships, archaeological remains, plastic waste etc.  Let's take a look at the manmade remains found in the deep ocean.  Manmade Remains at the Bottom of the Ocean.  Friends, you might think that historical remains are found only in museums.  But deep divers sometimes come across ancient statues in the ocean.  For example, the world's only underwater archaeological park is located on the sea floor off the coast of Naples, Italy. It is known as the Remains of the Ancient Roman City of Baiae.  Who knows how many more remains of ancient civilizations might exist in the deep seas of the Earth. Apart from this, the Titanic ship, said to be the world's largest and most magnificent, is present at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean today.  It was discovered by Dovers in 1985.  Along with this, aircrafts and submarines have also been found by divers at many deep ocean locations. which had once crashed.  Apart from this, remains of tanks and military trucks used in the war and some ancient weapons have also been discovered.  Apart from all this, finding plastic, microplastics and other garbage in the ocean has now become a common thing. It has become so common that it has reached the Mariana Trench, the deepest location on Earth. Today the ocean is facing the threat of pollution. According to an estimate, approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean every year.  Of these, 15% floats on the ocean surface.  15% are stranded on coasts and beaches and the remaining 70% drowns in deep ocean ecosystems. Generally, a human being cannot build a house in the sea. But whether it is plastic pollution or noise or chemical pollution.  Today humans are making their home on the sea floor in the form of pollution. Conclusion Friends, in today's discussion we learned what is present in the deep ocean.  But as we told you, till now 90% of the deep part of the ocean is undiscovered.  Some of the species that live here , some relief features and some unique objects are probably still unknown. But the discoveries made by our scientists are incredible.   On the one hand, it introduces us to scenes that we cannot see ourselves. All these scenes also inspire us to protect and preserve our ocean. So concluding today's discussion, I have a question for all of you.  Where is the world's largest and deepest submarine canyon located and by what name is it known?  You must share its answer in the comment section. Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.
