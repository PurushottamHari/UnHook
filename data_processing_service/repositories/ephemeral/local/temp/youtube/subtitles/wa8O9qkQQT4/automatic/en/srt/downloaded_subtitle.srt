00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Mission.

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,639
Friends, humans have discovered almost all the land areas.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,440
But the land

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,840
we stand on is only a small

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,800
part of the world.  The ocean is spread across almost 70% of the Earth

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
and holds countless secrets within itself.   The

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,119

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,519
ocean's climate and temperature

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,719
support the food supply for humans and other organisms.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,600
But despite being the source of life on Earth,

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,079
we know very little about these oceans of ours.  An

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,160

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,680
estimated 97% of the world's water is found in the oceans.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,239
Formally the entire global ocean is

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
divided into four distinct regions.

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,000
Which we know as Pacific, Atlantic,

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Indian and Arctic Oceans.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
 

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,199
Approximately 90% of the ocean has

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,680
not yet been mapped or explored by humans.

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
However, many

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,680
amazing discoveries have been made by our marine scientists.  The

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,799
sea floor is

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,920

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,960
filled with rare and unique marine species as well as minerals.  Besides, just like

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,080
land, oceans also have huge mountain

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,119
ranges and deep valleys.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,080
If you are asked

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,640
which is the longest mountain range on earth?  So you will say the

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,759
Antis Mountain Range found in South America.

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,799
But this answer is

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,200
true only for land surfaces, and in fact the Earth

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,640
's longest mountain range is submerged in the ocean.  The

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,520

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
ocean contains many such features in its depths.

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,479
So in today's discussion we will

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,640
discuss about the deepest part of the earth and

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,640
know what is beneath the ocean.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,079
Deep Inside the Ocean.

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
Friends, ocean basin is similar to the land surface in many ways.

42
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,480

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,599
Mountains, basins, plateaus, ridges,

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,080
canyons and trenches are also found underwater.

45
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,360
These relief features found on the ocean floor are

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,400
also called submarine relief.

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,440
These ocean relief features are determined by elevation above sea level,

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,160
depth above ground surface, and shape.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,560
This

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,959
can be caused by a variety of factors

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,319

52
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,760
including tectonic activity, sedimentation, and erosion.  It influences factors such as ocean bottom

53
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,599
relief, salinity, temperature and ocean currents,

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,239

55
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,120
as well as controlling the distribution of millions of marine organisms.

56
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,160
These

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,560
relief features can be

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,440
measured using various methods such as sonar and bathymetry.

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,239
What lies at the bottom of the ocean

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,599
?  To know this, first we have to

61
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,080
understand some important facts.  Any

62
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,959
ocean floor or sea bed is

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,159
divided into four sub-divisions for detailed understanding.

64
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,519
These are known as continental shelves,

65
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,400
continental slopes, abyssal plains, and

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
ocean deeps.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,800
Apart from these major divisions, many

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,360
minor relief features are also found in the ocean.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,799
Which includes ridges, hills, sea mounts, gorges,

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,360
trenches, canyons etc.  Let us

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,640
understand all these features in detail.

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
Continental Shelf.  Continental shelf is

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,440
actually a C word

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
extension of continent.  That means, we

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,239
can call it the maritime extension of the coastline.

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Where it extends from the coast to the drop off point.

77
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,159
This point is called shelf break.

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,959
Because it is still connected to the coast

79
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
and it is much less deep.

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,519
Usually the depth of this shallow water is between about 100

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,640
to 200 meters.  Along with this the

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,439
width of the shelf is 3 to 4 km.  From 100

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,599
Km.  Till then she does it very well.  You may be wondering

84
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,200

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,079
how this part of the ocean is important?  In fact, this is the zone of shallow water ocean above the shelf

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,880
where sunlight can

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,440
directly penetrate into the water.

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Here, due to sunlight and sufficient heat, some

89
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
microscopic plants and animals

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,120
develop which we call plates.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,240
These plates are mostly

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,639
food for shelf fish.  Apart from fish,

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,600
almost all marine foods

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,720
come entirely from the continental shelf.  Apart from this, the

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,840
shelf region is also a major source of economic minerals, sand and

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,479
gravel.  The world's

97
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,680
petroleum and natural gas are obtained in large quantities from

98
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,240
these shelves.  The discovery of

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,280
petroleum in the Bombay High and Godavari Basin is

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
an example of on-shore drilling in the continental shelf.  Apart from this, coral reefs, one of the

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
most diverse and valuable

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,880
ecosystems found in the oceans, are also commonly found on these shelves.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
These are usually found

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
parallel to the coastline and on islands.

106
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,240
A striking feature of the continental shelf are

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,880
submarine canyons.  These sea valleys are

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,000

109
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,720
similar to the gages found on land.  Sabine canyons are

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
steep-sided

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,720
valleys that are mostly

112
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,600
formed near river mouths.  For example, the

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,039
Godavari Canyon is found at the mouth of the Godavari River, which is

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,680
approximately 502 metres deep.  These

115
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,800
valleys are

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,919
also found in the continental slopes beyond the shelf region.  Continental

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,560
slope.  Friends, after the shelf break point the

118
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,520
continental shelf extends towards the deep sea floor.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Which is called the continental slope.

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,320
It extends between depths of about 200 metres to 3000 metres.

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,120
Whereas the

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,000
continental shelf region is rich in sediments,

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,160
minerals, and marine plants and animals.  At the

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,039
same time, due to the stiffness in the slope region,

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,199
comparatively

126
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,800
less amount of sediment deposits are found here.

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,840
And all the remaining sediments like sand, mud,

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,319
etc. flow and accumulate as a pile at the base of the slope.

129
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,120

130
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,919
Thus the slope gently moves forward

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,280
forming a high deposition belt which is

132
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,319
called continental rise.  And through this rise, the

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,520
slope eventually merges into the deep ocean floor.

134
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,840
Which is called the Abyssal Plain.

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Abyssal Plain.  These plains cover about 70% of the oceanian floor at a

136
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,400
depth of about 3000 to 6000 meters inside the sea

137
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,600

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,240
and are also called deep sea plains.  At

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,120
one time they were

140
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,759
considered the most featureless region of the ocean.  But with the

141
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,400
help of modern devices it was discovered that

142
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,199
these regions of the ocean look like irregular land surfaces.

143
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,080
It is widely

144
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,039

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,599
distributed among oceanic plates, ridges, trenches, sea mounts and oceanic islands.   In

146
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,919
addition, the floor of the Abyssal Plain is

147
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,800
covered with large amounts of sediments.

148
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,440
These sediments are

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
formed from the fossils of organisms found in the sea.  These

150
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,120
sediments are called oozes.  Because

151
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,039
most of the world's major rivers dispose of

152
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,599
their sediments into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

153
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,000

154
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,039
Abyssal plains are widespread in both of these oceans.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,280
Some open oceans do not produce oozes.

156
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,160
By the way, the sediments found on sea floors are

157
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,039

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
called red clay.  And these red cliffs are believed to be

159
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,680

160
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,240
formed from dust ejected from volcanoes during volcanic eruptions.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,440
Which reach the sea through air and rivers.

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,599
Such red claws are

163
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,479
found in large quantities in the Pacific Ocean.

164
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,960
Additionally, the

165
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,360
minerals and rare earth

166
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,000
elements found on the Abyssal Sea floor make this region critically

167
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,879
important.  It is a storehouse of many minerals

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,759
which include minerals like zinc, copper, nickel,

169
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,720
gold, silver and phosphorus.

170
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,039
These minerals are present as

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,360
3 to 10 cm wide nodules on abyssal plain sediments.

172
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,759

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,639
These are called polymetallic nodules.

174
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,199
Friends, there are

175
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,759
some long and narrow depressions on the ocean floor ahead of the Abyssal Plains.

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,399
Which are

177
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,320
known as the deepest parts of the ocean.

178
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,200
Oceanic Deeps and Tris.  Oceanic deeps are

179
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,080
approximately 3 to 5 kilometers deeper than the surrounding ocean floor.

180
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,560

181
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,920
These oceanic tris are found in every ocean basin on Earth.

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,920
However, the deepest trenches are found

183
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
in the Pacific Ocean as part of the Ring of Fire.

184
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
This

185
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,080
also includes active volcanoes and earthquake zones.  The

186
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,720
Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean is

187
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,680

188
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,399

189
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,200
known as the deepest location on Earth with a depth of 36.21 feet.  And its

190
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,640
southern end is the world's deepest point

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,880
called Challengers Deep.

192
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,279
Apart from the Pacific Ocean,

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,160
some oceanic trenches are also found in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean.

194
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,120
Friends, till now we have

195
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,519
understood four major features of oceanic relief.  Now we will

196
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,839
discuss some minor relief features.

197
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,399
However this is just

198
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,120
minor in name and in fact much larger features

199
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,480
exist in the ocean.  Let us

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,160
know about these features.  Mid

201
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,959
Oceanic Ridge.  Friends, the Mid Oceanic Ridge is

202
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,839
made up of two chains of mountains

203
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,440
separated by a large depression.

204
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,839
Such ridges are spread over approximately 65,000 km across the entire ocean.

205
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Are spread over more than area.   The

206
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,080
peaks of these mountain ranges can be up to 10,000 feet

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
high.  And some of these are so

208
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,040
high that they reach above the sea level

209
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,680
and

210
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
appear as islands.  A part of the Mid-Atlantic Rie

211
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,440
known as Iceland.  There

212
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,240
is an example of such an island.  The Mid

213
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,800
Atlantic Ridge is located in the Atlantic Ocean and is

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,079

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,399
considered the largest mountain range on Earth.  This volcanic mountain range extends

216
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,600
from 1000 to 1500 km.  wide and about 16,000

217
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,320
feet high.  Where the peaks of mid-oceanic

218
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,040
ridges can reach the ocean surface.  There are

219
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,079
some Oceanic Mountains

220
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,800
whose peaks are very pointed

221
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,519
but they do not reach the sea surface

222
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
and such mountains are called Sea Mounts.

223
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,399
Sea Mounts

224
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,040
These oceanic mountains are 3000 to 7000 feet

225
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,399
high and are mainly of volcanic origin.

226
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,279
Volcanoes that do

227
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,000
not reach the ocean surface.  After some time it

228
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,560
takes the form of a sea mount.  Because it never

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
reaches the ocean surface.  This does

230
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,920
not form islands.

231
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,200
An example of this is an extension of the Hawaiian Islands located in the Pacific Ocean

232
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,000

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,160
known as The Upper Sea Mount.  The

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,640
peaks of sea mounts have a very pointed structure.

235
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,880
But with time, the

236
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,600
peaks of some sea mounts slowly begin to flatten.

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,640
These are called table mounts or geos.

238
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,959
According to research,

239
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,160
more than 10,000 sea mounts and

240
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,519
geos are found in the Pacific Ocean alone.  Friends, till now we have

241
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,000
understood the geography inside the ocean.

242
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,839
From the coastline to the deepest ocean

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,480
floor, the sea is teeming with life.

244
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,200
From microscopic algae to Earth's

245
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
largest creature, the blue whale, everything is found in these oceans.  The

246
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,200
oxygen

247
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,760
level and temperature of sea water vary greatly.

248
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Generally, the water near the equator is warmer

249
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,880
and

250
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,920
holds less oxygen than the colder water found near the poles.  Along with

251
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,440
this, if we

252
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,399
move from surface ocean water to deep water, then

253
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,360
with depth, both temperature and oxygen inside the ocean

254
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,760
decrease sharply and

255
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,720
along with this the pressure increases very rapidly.

256
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,839

257
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Despite such a crushing environment and total darkness, this deep ocean is the Earth

258
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,560
's largest habitat.  Where many

259
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,279
strange and unique marine plants and

260
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,240
animals are found.  Let's take a look

261
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,200
at the marine ecosystem.

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,519
Life at the Bottom of the Ocean.  Friends,

263
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,000

264
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,160
while discussing about the continental shelf, we saw that due to the presence of sunlight,

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,880
that area is the habitat of many marine

266
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,519
plants and animals.  This

267
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,800
sunlight reaches up to a depth of 200 meters in the ocean

268
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,920
and this is why it is

269
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,320
also called sunlight zone or photic zone.  The

270
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,800
biggest source of the marine food web, i.e.

271
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,360
phytoplankton, survives here.  These

272
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,760
phytoplanktons are a type of microscopic

273
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,200
organisms.  Such as plants,

274
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,000
algae and bacteria.

275
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,279
Many marine animals are dependent on these phytoplants.

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,480
Which we call Z Planktens.  Such as

277
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:20,000
squid, jellyfish, krill, oysters,

278
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
sponges, corals etc.  Large

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,040
sea animals such as whales and sea turtles can

280
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,600
also be seen in this zone.  Most of them

281
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,200
come to the surface in search of their food.

282
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,920
Many species of corals are also found in this region.

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,639
Corals are marine

284
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,360
animals

285
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,839
found in the shelf regions of warm ocean waters and some are

286
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,680
also found in cold and dark deep ocean waters.

287
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,399
These corals combine with algae called Jazantheli present in the sea to

288
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,959

289
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,320
form structures like reefs.  Which are

290
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,639
called coral reefs.  These reefs are made of the

291
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,839
calcium carbonate skeletons of coral polyps.

292
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,560
Thousands of diver species survive in these reefs

293
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,839
and this is why

294
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,639
they are called rain forests of the ocean.

295
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,839
Beyond 200 meters the sunlight starts dimming in the ocean.

296
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,399

297
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,839
Very little sunlight penetrates up to a depth of about 1000 meters and

298
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,320
this is also called the twilight zone.  Because

299
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,639
sufficient sunlight does not reach here and

300
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,600
hence there are almost no plants in this zone.

301
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,639
This zone

302
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,279
overlaps with the continental slope.  As we know,

303
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,000
large amounts of

304
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,360
sediments flow down the continental slopes toward the deep ocean.

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,600
And hence this zone serves as a

306
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,720
migration corridor for animals like large fish and whales.

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,120

308
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,560
Common whale species found in this zone

309
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,320

310
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,440
include the fin whale, sperm whale, and minker whale.  Beyond this, the depth between 1000 to 4000 meters is

311
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,079
called the midnight zone.

312
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
Because no light can reach there.

313
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,279
With depth the water temperature falls

314
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,440
and the pressure increases considerably.  The

315
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,399
animals found in this environment

316
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,800
look strange and unique.  Many animals do

317
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,600
not have eyes because

318
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,920
they are not needed in the dark.

319
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
Due to extreme pressure, it is difficult to find nutrients in ocean water

320
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,680
and it is also very

321
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,240
salty.  In such conditions, the

322
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,880
animals found there are often small in size.

323
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
But their respiratory organs are

324
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,320
very strong.  So that it

325
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,279
can extract sufficient oxygen from the water.

326
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,240
Along with this, their mouth is big, teeth are pointed

327
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,199
and stomach is of very big size.  Such

328
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,360
features help them to easily eat shrimp, small fish and other

329
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,399
micro organisms.  Apart from

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,360
this, most of their food consists of

331
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,480

332
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,199
plant and animal remains that flow from the upper zone.

333
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,079
All these features show how these

334
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,800
animals evolve with depth in difficult environments

335
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,440
and adapt to underwater conditions.

336
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,639

337
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,959
Beyond the midnight zone, up to a depth of about 6000 meters, the

338
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
physical characteristics of abyssal plains i.e. deep sea plains can be

339
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,519
seen.

340
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,000
Where flat plains, low hills, sea

341
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,680
mounts, high sediments and rift valleys

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,320
exist.  From this Abyssal Zone the entire ocean is

343
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,360
filled with darkness.  And the

344
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,160
only light at this level comes from bioluminescent animals.

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,120
Most of the animals in this area

346
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,000

347
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,040
include squid, jellyfish, starfish, dragon fish, sharks etc.

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,360
All of these are bioluminescent.  These are such

349
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,000
animals that emit light from their body organs

350
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,120
due to chemical synthesis process.

351
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,759
This light not only

352
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,199
provides illumination in the dark ocean but

353
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,160
also helps these animals find their prey.   The

354
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,199
deepest ocean zone exists below 6000 meters.

355
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,839
Where trenches and deep canyons are

356
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,199
found.  This zone extends to the ocean's deepest

357
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,000
location, the Mariana Trench.  And

358
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,559
very few organisms can survive here.

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,760
These include animals

360
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,240
such as tiny isopods, sponges, and sea cucumbers, related to crabs and shells.

361
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,880

362
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,799
However, animals that survive in the abyssal and deepest ocean zones consume

363
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,199
micro-

364
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,679
organisms, plants and animal waste that flow from the upper zones

365
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,240

366
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,120
as food.  But not

367
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,000
all inhabitants of the bottom ocean depend just on marine decay and small

368
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,160
animals.  Marine

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
scientists have discovered creatures on the ocean floor

370
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,760
that feed on unique bacteria found around

371
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,559
hydrothermal vents, located below 4,000 metres (1,200 ft) below sea level.

372
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,360

373
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,160
These vents discharge

374
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,280
superheated water rich in minerals from the Earth's interior.

375
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,679
These minerals

376
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,720
provide nutrition to the bacteria that grow there.

377
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,520
Which ultimately the ocean crustaceans

378
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
make their food.  Friends, till now

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,799
we have seen how many

380
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,600
fascinating relief features and unique plants and

381
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,559
animals the ocean contains in its depths.  But the

382
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,280
answer to the question 'What is at the bottom of the ocean' is

383
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,840
not over yet.  Relief features and marine

384
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,280
ecosystems are a natural treasure found in the oceans.

385
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,320
But apart from these, there is a

386
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,120
lot more present in Ocean Bottom.  These

387
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,840

388
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,039

389
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,120
include many things like aircraft remains, ships, archaeological remains, plastic waste etc.  Let's take a look at the

390
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,559
manmade remains found in the deep ocean.  Manmade

391
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,799
Remains at the Bottom of the Ocean.  Friends, you might

392
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,440
think that historical remains are

393
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,760
found only in museums.  But deep

394
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,080
divers sometimes come across ancient statues in the ocean.  For

395
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
example, the

396
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,360

397
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,080
world's only

398
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,280
underwater archaeological park is located on the sea floor off the coast of Naples, Italy.

399
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,919
It is known as the Remains of the Ancient Roman City of Baiae.  Who

400
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,000
knows

401
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,880
how many more remains of ancient civilizations might exist in the deep seas of the Earth.

402
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,440

403
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Apart from this, the Titanic ship, said to be the world's largest and most magnificent, is

404
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,679

405
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,640
present at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean today.  It was discovered by Dovers in 1985.  Along with

406
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,799
this, aircrafts and submarines have also been found

407
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,679
by divers at many deep ocean locations.

408
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,799
which had

409
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,200
once crashed.  Apart from this, remains of

410
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,919
tanks and military

411
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,960
trucks used in the war and some ancient weapons have also been

412
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,520
discovered.  Apart from all this, finding plastic,

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
microplastics and other garbage

414
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,440
in the ocean has now become a common thing.

415
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,240
It has become so common that it has reached the Mariana Trench, the

416
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,440
deepest location on Earth.

417
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,000
Today the ocean is facing the threat of pollution.

418
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,120
According to an estimate,

419
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,320
approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste

420
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,840
enters the ocean every year.  Of these, 15%

421
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,400
floats on the ocean surface.  15% are

422
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,840
stranded on coasts and beaches and the

423
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,640
remaining 70% drowns in deep ocean ecosystems.

424
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,200
Generally, a human being cannot build a house in the sea.

425
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,240
But whether it is plastic pollution

426
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,120
or noise or chemical pollution.  Today

427
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:24,080
humans are making their home on the sea floor in the form of pollution.

428
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,880
Conclusion

429
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,000
Friends, in today's discussion we learned

430
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,520
what is present in the deep ocean.  But as

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,799
we told you, till now 90% of the deep

432
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,360
part of the ocean is undiscovered.  Some of the species that live here

433
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,039
, some relief features and some

434
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,520
unique objects are probably still unknown.

435
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,480
But the discoveries made by our scientists are

436
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,200
incredible.   On the

437
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,240
one hand, it introduces us to scenes that

438
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,360
we cannot see ourselves.

439
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,600
All these scenes also inspire us to protect and preserve our ocean.

440
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,880

441
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,120
So concluding today's discussion, I have

442
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,480
a question for all of you.  Where is the world's

443
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,760
largest and deepest submarine canyon

444
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,159
located and by what name is it known?  You

445
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,919
must share its answer in the comment section.

446
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,000
