welcome to

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
hard talk i'm stephen sacker what is the

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
point of the world's

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
nuclear watchdog the international

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
atomic energy agency

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
its task is to ensure that countries

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,119
intent on developing nuclear power

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
do not use their programs as cover for

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,000
development of weapons of mass

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
destruction

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
but is it mission impossible well my

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,360
guest is the

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,719
relatively new iaea chief

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,719
raphael grossi from the continued bitter

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,000
arguments over iran

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,000
to north korea and saudi arabia is the

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,120
iaea another example

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:59,840
of a global agency undermined by

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:59,840
geopolitical division

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:19,520
[Music]

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,600
rafael grossi in vienna welcome to hard

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
talk

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,840
hello good to be with you it's great to

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
have you on the show let me begin with a

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
question that arises from

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
your relatively recent appointment how

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,200
important is it that you are

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,960
seen to be in the pocket of

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,640
no nation that you are seen to be

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,720
entirely independent

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
well i think that's essential and i

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
suppose

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,560
it comes with any prominent

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
international position

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
countries have their own agendas their

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
own interests

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,640
and they want to make sure that the ones

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
leading these institutions like the iaea

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
are truly independent in my case in our

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
case is even more so

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
because unlike other international

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
organizations

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,040
we are inspectors we are the nuclear

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,959
watchdog yeah

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
you absolutely are so i just wonder if

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
it was helpful to you when it emerged

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040
that the united states had done a little

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,160
bit of lobbying on your behalf in the

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,120
runoff uh electoral election process

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
uh which the iaea conducted and you got

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
the job

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
against a romanian candidate the ua was

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
clearly lobby

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
the us rather was clearly lobbying on

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
your behalf was that counterproductive

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
damaging for you

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
no not at all and i would say it wasn't

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
only the u.s

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
it was many other countries i got a very

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,840
nice

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,480
two-thirds of the vote even more than

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
that

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,879
so it wasn't only the united states

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,959
it was 24 countries out of 35 so it was

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,519
a very nice ample win

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
but you need uh obviously the the

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
finances the hundreds of millions of

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,200
dollars a year to run your budget and

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,040
i guess it was very good news for you

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,440
when it became clear the us

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
was going to continue its full funding

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
of the iaea we've seen it cut funding

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
and indeed withdraw from other agencies

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,360
like the who so you need to stay on side

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,200
with the americans don't you

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
you need to stay on site with everybody

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760
and let me tell you something you know

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,440
in terms of the uh of the funding

79
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,599
the issue of funding international

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
organizations has been a subject of

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
dispute not only now there have been

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,080
waves

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,480
where times moments where countries were

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
reassessing how they dealt with with

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
different international organizations in

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
the case of the iaea because of its

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,920
indispensable

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,680
role that it plays we have always had

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
a lot of support not only from the

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,760
united states many other countries

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,080
440 nuclear reactors

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
a lot of nuclear material out there and

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
somebody has to check

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,439
that this nuclear material as you said

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
in your introduction

96
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,400
is does not go in the wrong direction

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
the reason i'm asking all these

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
questions about your independence your

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
relationship with the united states is

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
that it was very notable

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
in early in the new year this year when

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
you took over

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
uh it did seem there was a ratcheting up

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,680
of the

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,239
pressure on tehran and the determination

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
to use information that had been leaked

107
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
it seems from israeli sources

108
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,360
to suggest to the iranians that if they

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
didn't become

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
much much more transparent about what

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
was going on in some of their facilities

112
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,160
and plans

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
you were going to get very tough with

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
them would you say that you brought a

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,080
new attitude to the leadership of the

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
iaea when it came to iran

117
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
i did bring a new attitude in general

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
but i would say

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
when it comes to to this uh one has to

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,360
bear in mind that as

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,680
as the beatles would say the iran issue

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,880
is a long and winding road

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,400
we've been we've known ups and downs

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,039
and it's a story that goes at least

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,080
20 years back uh in its present

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,560
configuration

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,320
so it's normal that we had uh bad

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,039
moments where there were moments there

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,759
were there

130
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,360
disagreements and actually this year we

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
went through a

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
difficult patch so to speak and i was in

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,720
tehran a couple of weeks ago

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,199
and was able to to solve these issues so

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
i would say there are moments different

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
snapshots

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,440
at the moment we are working well well

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
you refer to this trip

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
to iran that you undertook in august i'm

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
absolutely fascinated by this trip

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
because

142
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,479
as you say before the trip there was a

143
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
degree of tension in your relationship

144
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,800
with the iranian government but

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
after you issued a joint statement in

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
tehran

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,039
it seems there was a an outbreak of

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,440
goodwill on all sides and

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
if i'm not wrong you now say that you

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
believe the iranians are acting

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
in good faith with all of your

152
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,240
inspection programs

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
have i got that right let me let me say

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
i

155
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,680
i suppose you yeah you get it right in

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
general

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
i think the the non-proliferation effort

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,479
is a constant effort

159
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
you're never there you have to always

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
check

161
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,000
and you always prove that everything is

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,120
okay trust but verify as they said

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,400
so what what happened this year is that

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,199
i asked iran to let

165
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,919
us let our inspectors access a couple of

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
places

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
they didn't want to so that led us to an

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
impasse

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,280
or of sorts which wasn't

170
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,600
solved and i think people were concerned

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,319
that this would add up to other

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,960
conflictual situations and debates

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
around

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,880
iran therefore you know

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,199
it was important to solve this issue i

176
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
thought it was important to talk to them

177
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
directly

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,080
they were kind enough in receiving us i

179
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,919
i spoke to president rouhani to the

180
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,039
foreign minister

181
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,360
zarif and others there and and and

182
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
we were able together to come to an

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,319
agreement yeah well that thank

184
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,240
to say so uh mr grocery the iranians

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
seem thrilled by it afterwards president

186
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
rouhani said that his relations with you

187
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,599
and the iaea were quote

188
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
very good so i just want to get to the

189
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
heart of what you achieved because there

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,199
was a lot of discussion about this

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
so-called abadi nuclear weapons

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
development

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,520
site now revelations about this site had

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
emerged

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,199
after the israeli intelligence services

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
got hold of

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
a whole bunch of secret iranian files

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
and documents

199
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,800
yeah i want to be clear about this did

200
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
your since your meeting with rouhani

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,520
have your people

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,919
been to this abadi site

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,599
our people have been able to

204
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,360
re-establish

205
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,560
their inspection activities

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,479
one place we we visit i don't get into

207
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
the specifics of the place because

208
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
this is a confidential information but

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
we were able to go to one

210
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
and we are going to a second one uh in a

211
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,560
few days but let me say that

212
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
in terms of what what we achieved it was

213
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
important

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
but it it's it's not the end of the

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,360
story uh and i would like to

216
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,520
in order not to aggrandize what we what

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
we achieved what we achieved was to go

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
back to

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,160
the normal activity that we should have

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,599
we were able it was as if the you know

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
the power had been cut

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
and now the lights are on again and we

223
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
can see

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
so this is going to be it's not like we

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
were

226
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
in hell now before and now we're in

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
paradise

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
we are working again let me put it like

229
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
this yeah but i'm i'm going to push you

230
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,080
on the detail because the detail is very

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,320
important

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
number one it seems clear that you have

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
been operating from information

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
provided to you by the israelis can you

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
confirm that yes

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,959
or no no i cannot confirm

237
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,480
because of the following we have lots of

238
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,000
information we have

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,279
information that we gather from our

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,920
own inspectors we have information that

241
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,760
countries give us and we have con we

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:08,320
have information that comes from

243
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:10,800
third parties from other other actors

244
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
because it's important we never act on

245
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,440
the basis of information that we

246
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,279
that we receive we take at face value

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
and then we go and do stuff yeah

248
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,839
we have a a a a a team

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,880
a very large team of experts

250
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
in different technologies and areas we

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,519
go through the information

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,920
we shift it we analyze it we cross it

253
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,640
with

254
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
previous information we had and only

255
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,519
when we believe

256
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,560
that something is worthy of further

257
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,279
probing or questioning and this was the

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
case

259
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,120
uh with with iran on this on this matter

260
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,760
we do it right we have tons of other

261
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
information

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,480
on which we do not act well you you are

263
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,240
a veteran argentine diplomat and you're

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
proving to be a skilled diplomat in this

265
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
interview but the truth is you did get

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
significant information

267
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
yeah well you did get significant

268
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
information from israel you clearly

269
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,880
factored that into your overall

270
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,800
assessment you won't tell me whether

271
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
abadi was one of the sites you went to

272
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
but it's cl

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,839
pretty clear it was if i'm honest with

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,279
you i just want you to tell me

275
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
simply are you now getting a level of

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,000
cooperation

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,560
from iran that you have not seen before

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
since the jcpo the international

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,959
agreement

280
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,880
uh was signed back in 2015. is there now

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
a level of cooperation that you're

282
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,760
prepared to recognize

283
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,760
as different from tehran

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
i have the level of cooperation i need

285
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,200
now

286
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,480
as you said i'm relatively new so i

287
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
took over in december and already in

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
january

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
i had i had a problem so i had to solve

290
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,040
it

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,480
now i have a level of cooperation that

292
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
allow our inspectors

293
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
to work and we are going to see what we

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,360
see

295
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,880
see the big picture here is confusing

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,279
and it gets confusing because of the

297
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
deep geopolitical divisions over iran

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,640
because

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
the u.s and israel have yeah the us and

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
israel have one perspective on what's

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
going on and other countries

302
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
have a very different perspective so you

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,360
and you've told me about your

304
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
independence you can perhaps

305
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
clear up some of these questions for me

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
so

307
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,720
is iran in your view closer

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
or further from developing a nuclear

309
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
weapon today than it was at the

310
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,360
beginning of the trump administration

311
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,360
in january 2017

312
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
the question does not lend itself to a

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,920
yes or no and i explain

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,680
why not you have different metrics

315
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
stephen you have different metrics if

316
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,399
your metric is

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,000
how much nuclear material in this case

318
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,360
enriched uranium they have you may

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,880
draw the conclusion that they have

320
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,120
now more material than they had

321
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
not at the beginning of the trump's

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,680
administration but when

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,160
this administration decided to leave the

324
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,880
agreement which was only in march

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,279
2018. since then iran by way of

326
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,480
retaliation

327
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,000
decided on its side to start degrading

328
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,360
its observance and then that meant

329
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that they started to enrich more but

330
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
again to complicate things further if

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,160
you compare that with the amounts they

332
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
had when the jcpoa

333
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,320
which is the acronym as you know for

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,240
this agreement was signed they have

335
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,040
considerably less so sometimes

336
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
this metrics can confound and confuse

337
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
people

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,160
what i can tell you is that we are

339
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,279
there to um prove and

340
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,639
to uh check that

341
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,720
iran does not get a nuclear weapon

342
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
you as i understand what you've said to

343
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,760
me and your wider reporting are saying

344
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,320
that iran

345
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,240
now has up to 10 times the amount of

346
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
enriched uranium that we're supposed to

347
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,680
be permitted underneath

348
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,560
not quite not quite not quite not quite

349
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,360
ten times

350
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,720
a little bit less but let's let's not

351
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
let's not fall out over

352
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
eight or nine or ten times the fact is

353
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,680
it has an awful lot more

354
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,040
enriched uranium than it's supposed to

355
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
have and you're grinning about it but

356
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
i'll tell you who's not grinning the

357
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
israelis aren't grinning

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
the donald trump administration is not

359
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,480
grinning and they say that as a result

360
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,120
of this

361
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
it is imperative that the european

362
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,600
powers

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,360
pull out of what remains of the jcpo

364
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,800
that international agreement

365
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
and follow with the us and impose

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,560
new tough sanctions on iran now you sit

367
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
in vienna at the iaea

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,959
you presumably have to take some sort of

369
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
a view on this who's right who's wrong

370
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,880
we are not a party to this treaty you

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
have to

372
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,120
understand we are not a party to this

373
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,760
arrangement agreement or pact

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
that is why i'm so interested in your

375
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,279
answer because you don't have a dog in

376
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
this fight but you can tell me whether

377
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,959
the euro exactly

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
this is why we verify this is why we

379
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
verify

380
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,600
and when they don't allow us to do our

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,120
job

382
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,920
we say it out loud and we demand

383
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,000
the access that is needed to prevent the

384
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,199
situation to degrade itself

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,079
into a point of no return

386
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,920
but my question still remains when you

387
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,839
hear this debate about whether what the

388
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
iranians have done in the last couple of

389
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,959
years represents

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
action and activity which must lead to

391
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,240
the wider international community

392
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,600
following the us

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,600
and reimposing tough sanctions your view

394
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
your opinion is what

395
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,720
our opinion is indispensable because we

396
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
tell the world

397
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
what's going on substantively what is

398
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
your opinion do you think given what you

399
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
see in iran

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,839
that the only way of addressing this

401
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
acquisition of enriched uranium

402
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,199
what the iranians are doing the only way

403
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,720
to address it

404
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,240
is to declare the jcpoa dead

405
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,480
and re-impose wider tough international

406
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,519
sanctions that's not up for me to say

407
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,160
frankly speaking and and i go back to

408
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
your

409
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,560
first comments i am

410
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,959
must be it's an essential quality that i

411
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,639
must

412
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,639
preserve i must be neutral

413
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,480
as i said to the iranians and to the

414
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,800
world when i came to this position

415
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,360
i will be firm with them but fair

416
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,000
so i cannot start taking political sides

417
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,920
and saying jcpoa is good or bad

418
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,800
sanctions yes or no we provide

419
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,759
with the neutral technical assessment

420
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
that allows

421
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
eventually those world powers that you

422
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,360
are mentioning

423
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
to come to the right decision yeah but

424
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
you know what mr grossly this is

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,360
fascinating because it gets to the heart

426
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
of whether

427
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,160
multilateral uh institutions such as

428
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
yours can actually function

429
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,320
in the 21st century world because on the

430
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
one hand the americans are now saying

431
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
that what is

432
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
what the iranians are doing is

433
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
outrageous and that anybody who

434
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
still backs the international agreement

435
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,320
and doesn't impose sanctions

436
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,519
is to quote the state secretary of state

437
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
mike pompeo

438
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,600
choosing to side with the ayatollahs

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,959
that's the american position

440
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,639
and on the other hand you've got the

441
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,600
chinese and the russians

442
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
who are saying absolutely no way we

443
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
won't

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,639
countenance the reimposition of

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,839
sanctions and if the iaea

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,199
dares to suggest that there are problems

447
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
with iran that

448
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,519
suggest the americans are right then

449
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
they will withdraw their support from

450
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
you

451
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,839
so you're caught in the middle you're in

452
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,759
a desperate squeeze

453
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,920
i'm caught between a rock and a hard

454
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,720
dress but this comes with my job

455
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,440
and what we need to do is to continue to

456
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
provide

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,880
the exact the exact snapshot of

458
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
what is going on and this is the

459
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,959
foundation

460
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,959
of any any decision people will know the

461
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,160
international community will know

462
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
when they are not observing uh their uh

463
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
commitments

464
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,480
or when they are not allowing the iaea

465
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,760
to work and to operate then there are

466
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,079
political persuasions

467
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,439
and opinions you have the the democrats

468
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
you have the republicans you have the

469
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
europeans

470
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,720
everybody comes to me and say what they

471
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,880
want my job is to be

472
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,559
the nuclear watchdog not more but not

473
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,280
less but the problem is

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,320
all sides are tempted to undermine your

475
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,880
credibility

476
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,080
and therefore frankly nobody can always

477
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
happen of course

478
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
that will always happen you know

479
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
sometimes you

480
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,039
let's take this here and this year is

481
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
very nice because it provides you

482
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
with a scientific example of what

483
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
happens

484
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,880
in the beginning of the year when i was

485
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
not getting the access

486
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
to to these locations and i was

487
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
reporting to

488
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
to the iaea what was going on i was

489
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,960
being described as a sheriff

490
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,600
and many other things so i was i was

491
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
tough

492
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,200
now i have an agreement and you yourself

493
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
are telling me rouhani is saying that

494
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
you have the best relation that could

495
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,400
ever be so you know i'm i

496
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,880
am i'm used to this i think it's it's

497
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
only

498
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
normal and in a way in a paradoxical way

499
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,559
it's a good indication that we are doing

500
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
just what we need to do

501
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,280
all right let's move on from iran

502
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
because you've got other big problems in

503
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,720
your entry

504
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,799
let's talk very briefly north korea now

505
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
you don't have people in north korea

506
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,320
they were kicked out

507
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
quite a few years ago that's a shame yes

508
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,919
well

509
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,160
but donald trump has pursued this

510
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
diplomatic process with the north

511
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,919
koreans apparently believing

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,640
that ultimately it can lead to the

513
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,760
denuclearization

514
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,520
in weapons terms of north korea

515
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,720
do you believe that because many people

516
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
think that's pie in the sky

517
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,000
well you know with north korea we've

518
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,320
known

519
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,120
before as as with with iran it's a long

520
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,559
process

521
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,720
we we had successes we had failures we

522
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,720
i mean the iaea the international

523
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
community the inspectors we were kicked

524
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,760
out of

525
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,880
from from the dprk back in 2009

526
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
cop figure 11 years without

527
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,360
an international presence there we have

528
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,120
some idea of what is going on

529
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,600
what is clear is that we will only be

530
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,720
able to return there and start

531
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,480
inspecting

532
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,720
once some form of a political

533
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,600
understanding is there there were some

534
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,960
in the past

535
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,320
which failed and the the latest

536
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,640
is the one that the united states and

537
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
north korea bilaterally have been trying

538
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
to attempt

539
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
for what i know uh from from secretary

540
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
pompeo

541
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
and the u.s government this is a process

542
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,240
that continues

543
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
i'm hopeful i i believe that it has to

544
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,799
succeed

545
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
and when it does we'll be ready to go

546
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,360
back and to go back

547
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
to a more different uh and more

548
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
complicated

549
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,480
i would say dprk because we're asking

550
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
but just just to be productivity was

551
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
quite limited

552
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,159
now they are a nuclear power station

553
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
well they most certainly are and just to

554
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,039
be very clear

555
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
very brief answer on this your satellite

556
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
imaging and everything else you do

557
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
from outside of the country suggest to

558
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,679
you that they are still

559
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,520
determinedly pursuing their

560
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,440
weapons program trying to develop more

561
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,320
sophisticated weapons miniaturize them

562
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
everything else

563
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,919
yes right well thanks for that now very

564
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
quickly one other

565
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,640
specific country saudi arabia how

566
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
worried are you by the saudi investment

567
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,240
in

568
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,159
enlarging their nuclear program and now

569
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
seeking out and using the help of

570
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,919
china in a very big way is that worrying

571
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,799
you because some people think that could

572
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,840
be

573
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,240
very alarming well yeah there's been

574
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
some

575
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,840
speculation in the press the reality is

576
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
and yet again

577
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,000
we tell things as they are and not on

578
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,559
the basis of speculation

579
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,679
the reality is that the kingdom of saudi

580
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,520
arabia has very

581
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,640
limited nuclear activity very limited

582
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
they have some research activities they

583
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
have now

584
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,080
bought a low power research reactor

585
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,280
which is very small they don't even have

586
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,600
it yet

587
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,360
and there have been and i suppose you uh

588
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,919
are referring to that there have been

589
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,280
some

590
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,679
uh press uh um articles

591
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,320
uh indicating that they they might have

592
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,120
some uh cooperation with other countries

593
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,880
on uh

594
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,440
on uranium mining we don't have any any

595
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
any concrete indication of that we are

596
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,280
in conversation

597
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,080
with saudi arabia to make sure that when

598
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,440
they

599
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,960
upgrade their nuclear program which is

600
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,559
as i said embryonic

601
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,159
we will be ramping up our safeguards

602
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,039
activities there so i'm not particularly

603
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
worried but i'm following actively

604
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,400
interesting

605
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,360
a final thought your bigger one of your

606
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,120
big ideas when you took over the iaea

607
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
seems to me to have been to stress to

608
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,440
the world that you want to see much

609
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,280
more uh expansion and development of

610
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,200
civil nuclear power because you think

611
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,000
it's part of the

612
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,919
decarbonization climate change solution

613
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
well you say it is so confidently but

614
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,520
how can you say that when

615
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,520
all of the stuff we've discussed today

616
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,840
suggests that there is such a very

617
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,120
difficult grey area where countries

618
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,679
expand their nuclear programs and they

619
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
they

620
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,960
run not only does the world run the risk

621
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
of hang on just

622
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,000
not only is it probably a danger to

623
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
nuclear proliferation in the long run

624
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,880
but it's also

625
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
a safety issue because we all know what

626
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
happened at fukushima

627
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,200
it's also a cost issue because nuclear

628
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,840
is extraordinarily expensive in capital

629
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
terms

630
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,120
and here you are telling the world that

631
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,679
we have to ramp up

632
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,880
civil nuclear production no no no no all

633
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,120
i'm saying all

634
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
i'm saying is that nuclear has a place

635
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,679
at the table

636
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,159
it is clear that for many countries 31

637
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,159
of them

638
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,640
including the united kingdom and many

639
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,039
others have in their mix

640
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,679
nuclear power and it is clear that we

641
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,960
have a

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
huge challenge in terms of climate

643
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,280
change

644
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,520
so to say that a source of energy which

645
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,480
is

646
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080
basically clean which is saving us from

647
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,919
two gigatons per year

648
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,360
of uh emissions does not have a place

649
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,280
in the successful mix to

650
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,280
decarbonize the economy is simply

651
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,360
technically incorrect then countries can

652
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,480
decide whether they go for it or not

653
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,279
and the iaea is there to make sure

654
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,799
that this nuclear material which is used

655
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,000
to generate electricity

656
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,880
to cure people for the benefit of of the

657
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,279
many

658
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,320
is going to be done in the right in the

659
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
right way

660
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,600
all right raphael grossi it's been

661
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,120
fascinating talking to you thank you

662
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:04,880
very much for joining me on hard talk

663
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:18,609
thank you very much it's been a pleasure
