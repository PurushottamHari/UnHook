00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, it seems that

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,799
Israel is trying to surround Iran from all sides.  This

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
means that whatever power Iran has

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
, its economic power is

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,360
also being hit hard.  I am saying this

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,679
because the world's largest gas

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,240
field has been bombed and this was

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,039
actually done by Israel on Iran.  And

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
let me tell you, Iran is very dependent on this gas field.

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,080
I will

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,480
tell you in the video but you can watch the

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,199
news.  Iran Says Production at World's

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
Largest Gas Field Partially Suspended

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,680
After Israeli Attack.

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
We will know in a little detail which gas field is this

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,840
?  This becomes very important from your exam perspective.

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,320
And this gas field is

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,760
shared with another country.  I will

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
tell you that as well.  Let's move on.  But

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
before that, let me tell you all friends, today is the

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
last date.  If you

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,920
given in the comment section.  Let's

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,560
start off by first looking at

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,920
what just happened.  See, Israel

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,159
bombed the gas field here which is

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,880
said to be the biggest gas field in the world

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,320
and its name is South Parts.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
I will try to explain this to you a little bit through the map.

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
You can see this is the

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
map of Iran.  Its capital is Tehran

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,720
here.  And the gas field that we are talking about,

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,040
you will basically see it down

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,400
towards the Persian Gulf.  And

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,320
if you see here, there is their state

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
or there it is called province.

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,600
Whose name is Bushehr Province.  If

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
you look carefully, this connects

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,799
a very large province of Iran with the Persian Gulf.

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,360
Bushehr Province.  And

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,240
adjacent to this province, i.e. inside the Persian Gulf,

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,000
here basically you will see this gas field

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,920
whose name is South

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,720
Parts.  Again I'm showing you the map a little bit zoomed in.

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,399

54
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,079
You are getting to see this Bushehr province.  This

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,880
is the entire Persian Gulf.  And

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,320
look carefully here, this is Qatar.  And if you

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,440
know then Qatar is the biggest in the world,

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,440
listen carefully.  It is the world's largest gas

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
producer.  Natural gas is produced

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,599
by them.  So

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
what you are seeing here is your

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
upper north part.  We are not talking about this.

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,720
You are seeing this entire huge area below, this is what is

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,400
called, this is your South parts.  And it

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,560
also adjoins Qatar's gas field.  Qatar

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
calls it North Field.  So

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
understand it carefully.  Qatar calls this field North

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Field.  And Iran is called South

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,319
Parts.  He is the same in a way.  So this is

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
what we are talking about.  So it is being said

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,040
that a massive bombing was carried out on this particular gas field

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
due to which the

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,680
infrastructure was damaged and here

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,599
you can see a massive fire breakout

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
took place.  If you see this picture, it was being

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,879
shown from a distance

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
through cameras etc. that how an attempt was made to

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,360
triple the infrastructure there

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
and through sources it is being

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
told that the production has been

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,080
partially suspended.

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,480
Well, how much does this gas field, South

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
Paras, produce?  Is this

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
exactly this?  South Parts, as

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,120
I told you, is the world's largest gas

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,400
field and it is said that the

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,120
production of natural gas there is 1800 trillion

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
cubic feet.

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,360
And this becomes important because

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,720

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,040
66% of Iran's total natural gas production

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,200
comes from this particular gas field alone.  And

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,360
it also has a large share in Iran's petrochemical feed stock.

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,920
Look, petrochemical feed

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
stock means petrochemical industry, you must be

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
understanding that where plastics etc are

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,720
made, the raw material there

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,720
also comes from this particular gas field.  Apart from

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,120
this, you will

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
also get to see the fuel for electricity generation and heating in Iran from

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
here.

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,080
Meaning it is strategic and

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,720
economic value.  It has a lot of importance

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
in Iran.  And Iran's biggest

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,319
revenue actually comes from exporting oil

107
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
and the second most revenue comes from

108
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,120
producing gas.  So from this you will be

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,640
able to understand how important this particular gas field is

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,519
for Iran.  Why is this a

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,680
big deal?  The bottom line is that till now

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
Israel was mostly trying to [ __ ] the

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
nuclear facilities or the

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,280
military infrastructure inside Iran.  He was

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,519
attacking him.

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,759
But if you see from yesterday, the

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,080
news is coming that if you look inside Tehran, which is its

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
capital, in the

119
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,960
North Western side, it is being reported here

120
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,960
that a bombing was done on an oil depot.

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Then

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,639
another oil depot here on the southern side was bombed.

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,360
And then now the news comes that the

124
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,160
South Parts, which is the biggest

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,520
production hub of natural gas here, has been attacked in a way.

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
So this is

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,080
unexpected.  So,

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,479
if you are attacking civilian energy infrastructure, it

129
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,120
means you are trying to impact Iran's economy and daily

130
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,560
life in some way or the other.

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
This is an

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
attempt to give a signal that the battlefield is

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,199
getting wider from here and it is

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
possible that Iran too will retaliate on a large scale.

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,520
Well,

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
what will be its domestic impact on Iran?  Again,

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,080
as I told you,

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
66% of all gas production in Iran comes from here.

139
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
So if a long term disruption

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
happens here, then it can lead to power

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
outages, heating crisis and many other things in Iran.

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,479
Petrochemical

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
plants can be crippled.

144
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,720
Raw material will not reach the industries.   The

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,199
public's anger may flare up further.

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
Look what Israel

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
wants here.  I made a video this morning

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
and tried to tell you that the

149
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,680
unstated goal of Israel is

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
regime change.  Meaning, Israel wants to

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
ultimately get a permanent solution.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,479

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,720
He wants to overthrow the regime currently running in Iran since 1979, that of the Islamic Republic.

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
So one thing

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
can also happen that by doing all these things and

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
destroying the infrastructure, the public will get

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,000
angry and come out on the streets, and the

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,919
entire system of the Islamic Republic that is running at the moment in

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
which the supreme

160
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,560
leader is Kamayani, they might be trying to remove all of them in a way.

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,639
Already let me

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
tell you one thing that this

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,880
attack which has happened on South Parts, now it will

164
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
not be that easy to restart it

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,360
because the thing is that there is already

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,680
US sanctions on Iran, so the

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,600
parts etc. which will be replaced for that, will be

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
very difficult for Iran to get them, so it will be interesting to

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,440
see how it

170
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,319
deals with it.  But apart from this,

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,560
you have to understand another dimension of this that this is

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
also a huge blow on the Iran-Qatar shared resources.  What

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
I mean to say is

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,880
that here this North, if you

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,440
see the North Field, which I was telling you about, then

176
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,600
it is shared with this.  Meaning, both Qatar and

177
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
Iran share this thing.  So

178
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,800
what does attacking here mean?  This means that there is

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
a huge danger that

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
its impact can reach the other side as well.

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Because if you are attacking a shared gas field then

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
it will definitely impact

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Qatar as well.  And because of this,

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,639
Qatar, as I told you, is the largest exporter of LNG.

185
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080

186
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,240
Exports on a large scale to Europe and Asia.   In

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,360
fact, India also imports most of its

188
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,919
LNG from Qatar.

189
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,240
So because of this, the matter

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
can go beyond Iran as well.  In fact, if you

191
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
look, news is also coming here that

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,440
Iran has threatened that it

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,960
can also close the Strait of Homeus.

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
Can cause a blockage.  Again if you look, it is the

195
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Persian Gulf.  So here is your

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,120
State of Holmouse.  Now this is a very important

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,919
particular state.  Especially because

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,319
30% of all oil exported in the world comes

199
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,800
from here.  Qatar is also able to carry out LNG shipments

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
through this.  So think about it,

201
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,039
if any kind of

202
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,840
disturbance occurs here then it will bring a huge

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,080
disruption in the energy market of the entire world.

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,240
And the prices etc. will

205
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
fall so fast that we probably can't

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,319
even believe it.  In fact, some estimates

207
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,479
say that it can go up to $120 per barrel.  It

208
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
can go up to 150, it can even go up to 200.

209
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,479
Meaning, such

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
speculations are being made based on the situation that currently

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
prevails in the Middle East.  Already, if you

212
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,240
see, due to this news the

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,840
price of crude oil has increased by 9%.  The

214
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
future

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,479
prices of natural gas in European and Asian exchanges also

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,800
increased suddenly.  So in a way the market is

217
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
afraid that a chain reaction may also be seen.  It is

218
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,479
possible that due to the exchanges taking place between

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,039
Iran and Israel, in the future,

220
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,240

221
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,319
many oil fields of Saudi Arabia, UAE, even the

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
oil fields of Iraq may be

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
hit in a way.  So

224
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
if this starts happening then there will be a huge change

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
reaction and ultimately it

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
can trigger a global energy crisis.

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
So this is a small thing and it

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,000
is obvious that if we talk about India, then India

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,640
imports 85% of its crude oil from here.

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
We import 55% of natural gas from here.  We

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
mean whatever our requirement is and

232
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,440
if you look at the supply from the Middle East,

233
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,760
60% of India's crude oil comes from here.

234
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Especially if we look at Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE,

235
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,399
what could be its possible outcome

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,959
?  If the oil prices increase, then

237
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,880
ultimately it will impact India's trade

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,360
deficit, physical deficit or inflation.

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,920
And suppose

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,640
if the State of Hormos is closed

241
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,440
then it will be even more dangerous because

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,600
40% of all the oil that comes to India

243
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,800
comes from this particular state.  So if Iran

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,680
retaliates here, like blocks

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,399
Homeus, then the shipping cost here will

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,320
increase.  The insurance that has been done will go

247
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
up very fast because it is often

248
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
seen that whenever there is a

249
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
conflict, the ships etc. that are

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
coming, the cost of their insurance

251
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
suddenly increases very rapidly.

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,240
India's energy supply

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,240
may be disrupted.  We will

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
also have to try to look for some alternatives.  As far as

255
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
India's reserves are concerned, look, we have

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
reserves only for 9 to 10 days.

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
We are talking about oil.  So

258
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,399
ultimately its impact will be on India and the entire

259
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,160
world.  If we talk about its geopolitical

260
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
implications, then look,

261
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,600
because of this war that has started, the

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,160
last hope that there were to be talks between Iran and the US

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
regarding peace,

264
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
that too has been cancelled now.  A

265
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,880
discussion was to be held here regarding this today but it has been

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,560
abruptly cancelled.  Iran's

267
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
leadership says we will take revenge.   Will take

268
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,040
revenge at a very bad level.

269
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,800
What could be the Iranian response?  Again Iran

270
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,560

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
can also attack Israeli infrastructure and gas fields.   It

272
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,720

273
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,120
can launch attacks through its proxies, Hezbollah and Houthis.  Meaning, it is difficult to

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,279
predict how much the war will spread.

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
But again, if you look before this, there had been

276
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,000
one or two very big attacks like this.

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,720
For example, there was the Aramco attack

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,880
in which the Houthis and Iranian

279
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
drones attacked Saudi Arabia's oil

280
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,600
plant.

281
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Due to which global oil shock occurred again.  So

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,440
whenever such things happen,

283
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,440
you see disturbance globally.  And

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
this is a big reason and India too will have to

285
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
prepare itself somewhere.  So I

286
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,240
hope you guys understood it

287
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,079
and before leaving can you tell me an

288
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
interesting question here that which

289
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,519
of the following countries do not border with the

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,519
Strait of Horromos?  Which of the countries does

291
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,120

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,959
not share border with the Strait of Hormos?  And

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
you all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram,

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600

matter.  You can get its

296
