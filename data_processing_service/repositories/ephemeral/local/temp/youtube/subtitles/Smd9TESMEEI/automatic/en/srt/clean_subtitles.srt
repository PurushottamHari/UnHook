Hello Friends.  Friends, it seems that Israel is trying to surround Iran from all sides.  This means that whatever power Iran has , its economic power is also being hit hard.  I am saying this because the world's largest gas field has been bombed and this was actually done by Israel on Iran.  And let me tell you, Iran is very dependent on this gas field. I will tell you in the video but you can watch the news.  Iran Says Production at World's Largest Gas Field Partially Suspended After Israeli Attack. We will know in a little detail which gas field is this ?  This becomes very important from your exam perspective. And this gas field is shared with another country.  I will tell you that as well.  Let's move on.  But before that, let me tell you all friends, today is the last date.  If you want to avail extra discount on our UPSC batches under Great Learning Festival.

You have to use this code Ankit Live to get maximum discount and its link is given in the comment section.  Let's start off by first looking at what just happened.  See, Israel bombed the gas field here which is said to be the biggest gas field in the world and its name is South Parts. I will try to explain this to you a little bit through the map. You can see this is the map of Iran.  Its capital is Tehran here.  And the gas field that we are talking about, you will basically see it down towards the Persian Gulf.  And if you see here, there is their state or there it is called province. Whose name is Bushehr Province.  If you look carefully, this connects a very large province of Iran with the Persian Gulf. Bushehr Province.  And adjacent to this province, i.e. inside the Persian Gulf, here basically you will see this gas field whose name is South Parts.  Again I'm showing you the map a little bit zoomed in. You are getting to see this Bushehr province.  This is the entire Persian Gulf.  And look carefully here, this is Qatar.  And if you know then Qatar is the biggest in the world, listen carefully.  It is the world's largest gas producer.  Natural gas is produced by them.  So what you are seeing here is your upper north part.  We are not talking about this. You are seeing this entire huge area below, this is what is called, this is your South parts.  And it also adjoins Qatar's gas field.  Qatar calls it North Field.  So understand it carefully.  Qatar calls this field North Field.  And Iran is called South Parts.  He is the same in a way.  So this is what we are talking about.  So it is being said that a massive bombing was carried out on this particular gas field due to which the infrastructure was damaged and here you can see a massive fire breakout took place.  If you see this picture, it was being shown from a distance through cameras etc. that how an attempt was made to triple the infrastructure there and through sources it is being told that the production has been partially suspended. Well, how much does this gas field, South Paras, produce?  Is this exactly this?  South Parts, as I told you, is the world's largest gas field and it is said that the production of natural gas there is 1800 trillion cubic feet. And this becomes important because 66% of Iran's total natural gas production comes from this particular gas field alone.  And it also has a large share in Iran's petrochemical feed stock. Look, petrochemical feed stock means petrochemical industry, you must be understanding that where plastics etc are made, the raw material there also comes from this particular gas field.  Apart from this, you will also get to see the fuel for electricity generation and heating in Iran from here. Meaning it is strategic and economic value.  It has a lot of importance in Iran.  And Iran's biggest revenue actually comes from exporting oil and the second most revenue comes from producing gas.  So from this you will be able to understand how important this particular gas field is for Iran.  Why is this a big deal?  The bottom line is that till now Israel was mostly trying to [ __ ] the nuclear facilities or the military infrastructure inside Iran.  He was attacking him. But if you see from yesterday, the news is coming that if you look inside Tehran, which is its capital, in the North Western side, it is being reported here that a bombing was done on an oil depot. Then another oil depot here on the southern side was bombed. And then now the news comes that the South Parts, which is the biggest production hub of natural gas here, has been attacked in a way. So this is unexpected.  So, if you are attacking civilian energy infrastructure, it means you are trying to impact Iran's economy and daily life in some way or the other. This is an attempt to give a signal that the battlefield is getting wider from here and it is possible that Iran too will retaliate on a large scale. Well, what will be its domestic impact on Iran?  Again, as I told you, 66% of all gas production in Iran comes from here. So if a long term disruption happens here, then it can lead to power outages, heating crisis and many other things in Iran. Petrochemical plants can be crippled. Raw material will not reach the industries.   The public's anger may flare up further. Look what Israel wants here.  I made a video this morning and tried to tell you that the unstated goal of Israel is regime change.  Meaning, Israel wants to ultimately get a permanent solution. He wants to overthrow the regime currently running in Iran since 1979, that of the Islamic Republic. So one thing can also happen that by doing all these things and destroying the infrastructure, the public will get angry and come out on the streets, and the entire system of the Islamic Republic that is running at the moment in which the supreme leader is Kamayani, they might be trying to remove all of them in a way. Already let me tell you one thing that this attack which has happened on South Parts, now it will not be that easy to restart it because the thing is that there is already US sanctions on Iran, so the parts etc. which will be replaced for that, will be very difficult for Iran to get them, so it will be interesting to see how it deals with it.  But apart from this, you have to understand another dimension of this that this is also a huge blow on the Iran-Qatar shared resources.  What I mean to say is that here this North, if you see the North Field, which I was telling you about, then it is shared with this.  Meaning, both Qatar and Iran share this thing.  So what does attacking here mean?  This means that there is a huge danger that its impact can reach the other side as well. Because if you are attacking a shared gas field then it will definitely impact Qatar as well.  And because of this, Qatar, as I told you, is the largest exporter of LNG. Exports on a large scale to Europe and Asia.   In fact, India also imports most of its LNG from Qatar. So because of this, the matter can go beyond Iran as well.  In fact, if you look, news is also coming here that Iran has threatened that it can also close the Strait of Homeus. Can cause a blockage.  Again if you look, it is the Persian Gulf.  So here is your State of Holmouse.  Now this is a very important particular state.  Especially because 30% of all oil exported in the world comes from here.  Qatar is also able to carry out LNG shipments through this.  So think about it, if any kind of disturbance occurs here then it will bring a huge disruption in the energy market of the entire world. And the prices etc. will fall so fast that we probably can't even believe it.  In fact, some estimates say that it can go up to $120 per barrel.  It can go up to 150, it can even go up to 200. Meaning, such speculations are being made based on the situation that currently prevails in the Middle East.  Already, if you see, due to this news the price of crude oil has increased by 9%.  The future prices of natural gas in European and Asian exchanges also increased suddenly.  So in a way the market is afraid that a chain reaction may also be seen.  It is possible that due to the exchanges taking place between Iran and Israel, in the future, many oil fields of Saudi Arabia, UAE, even the oil fields of Iraq may be hit in a way.  So if this starts happening then there will be a huge change reaction and ultimately it can trigger a global energy crisis. So this is a small thing and it is obvious that if we talk about India, then India imports 85% of its crude oil from here. We import 55% of natural gas from here.  We mean whatever our requirement is and if you look at the supply from the Middle East, 60% of India's crude oil comes from here. Especially if we look at Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE, what could be its possible outcome ?  If the oil prices increase, then ultimately it will impact India's trade deficit, physical deficit or inflation. And suppose if the State of Hormos is closed then it will be even more dangerous because 40% of all the oil that comes to India comes from this particular state.  So if Iran retaliates here, like blocks Homeus, then the shipping cost here will increase.  The insurance that has been done will go up very fast because it is often seen that whenever there is a conflict, the ships etc. that are coming, the cost of their insurance suddenly increases very rapidly. India's energy supply may be disrupted.  We will also have to try to look for some alternatives.  As far as India's reserves are concerned, look, we have reserves only for 9 to 10 days. We are talking about oil.  So ultimately its impact will be on India and the entire world.  If we talk about its geopolitical implications, then look, because of this war that has started, the last hope that there were to be talks between Iran and the US regarding peace, that too has been cancelled now.  A discussion was to be held here regarding this today but it has been abruptly cancelled.  Iran's leadership says we will take revenge.   Will take revenge at a very bad level. What could be the Iranian response?  Again Iran can also attack Israeli infrastructure and gas fields.   It can launch attacks through its proxies, Hezbollah and Houthis.  Meaning, it is difficult to predict how much the war will spread. But again, if you look before this, there had been one or two very big attacks like this. For example, there was the Aramco attack in which the Houthis and Iranian drones attacked Saudi Arabia's oil plant. Due to which global oil shock occurred again.  So whenever such things happen, you see disturbance globally.  And this is a big reason and India too will have to prepare itself somewhere.  So I hope you guys understood it and before leaving can you tell me an interesting question here that which of the following countries do not border with the Strait of Horromos?  Which of the countries does not share border with the Strait of Hormos?  And you all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram, if you are not there it doesn't matter.  You can get its correct answer from Telegram.  And as I told you, it is the last date.  If you are taking UPSC course then please do avail it by 12:00 pm tonight.
