I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, Israel has launched a huge attack on Iran and has killed the chief of their IRGC, Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Hussein Salami.  Now this is a huge escalation.  I just took a lecture, you might remember, two weeks ago.  In that I told you that Israel can attack Iran.  Because here Donald Trump is having a meeting with Iran. He is holding a meeting with Iran on the nuclear program and behind his back Israel has played the game. Now we will take more lectures on this.  Is there going to be a war?  In this second part, the clouds of war have once again started hovering over West Asia.  And Iran straight away said, look, remember we have not done this before.  You have done this. America was already evacuating its people from Baghdad. So it was clear somewhere. Although America has denied that it has no involvement.  Mark Rubio has issued a statement saying, look, we have not done anything.  Israel did this unilaterally.  America is talking nonsense. I can't believe this.  No one can believe that America does not know; it is simply in denial mode so that the matter does not come to us because we are about to strike a deal with Iran.  Now the question is why did Israel do this?  We will talk about it, we will discuss each and every thing. But at the moment a very big attack has been carried out by Iran.  Now look, in this lecture we will focus more on the news. I made many lectures on Israel and Iran.  In the second lecture, we will go a little deeper into what the problem is and why there is war in West Asia.  But do you know the outline of why all this has happened?  All this happened because of their nuclear reactor. Iran has almost made a nuclear bomb, friends. Centrifuges are very important in that.   In a way, you are the churner.  It is like when you extract butter, there is whey in it, how do you extract butter, similarly uranium is churned in a similar way, so proper nuclear material is extracted from it, so the centrifuge is the most important, those centrifuges were blew up by Israel here and their nuclear program got set back again, but this is not all, friends, they attacked Iran at many places, now see, this is happening, this country Israel is not afraid of anyone, they have named it Operation Rising Lion and Benjamin leader Yau has clearly said on his face that they will attack.  Now what will happen after that is that Israel will also be attacked.  Iran will attack 110%.  So there could be an attack by drone , there could be an attack by missile.  So Israel told its people, look, there will be an attack.  Emergency was already declared by Israel Cardoso, who is their Defense Minister.  He said that no attack is going to happen, a big attack is going to happen. But friends today we will end the coupon code positively finally.  So Dark Psychology will no longer be on sale.  So if you want to learn dark psychology, how to manipulate , how to avoid it?  Mind games, psychological warfare, exploitation â€“ all this has been explained very well by psychologist Dr. Monika Das.  The link to the course is given in the description and comment box. So when I woke up early in the morning I said what happened?  Here I was watching the Air India crash. But then I saw, oh my god, very big news is coming.  Ok.  And the capital of Iran is very scary. Isn't it?  Friends, such a terrible explosion has taken place in the Capitol and after that they had almost completed their nuclear program, but it was not understood, America was just about to deal, the oil prices have again increased by 6%, when this attack happened, it was obvious that all this was bound to happen.  International Atomic Energy Agency has passed a resolution that look at this type of move that Iran is continuously making regarding nuclear weapons because IAE is keeping an eye on Iran. When the revolution took place in Iran in 1979, before the revolution, America was with Iran.  But the revolution in Iran came because of anti-America and because of Israel.  Isn't it?  Khomeini, Ayatollah Khomeini, used to speak a lot about America, used to give speeches and he was expelled from Iran but after that he came back and was given a warm welcome and then Iran became an Islamic nation and he is still there till now.  Is it okay?  At the top is religious leader Khomeini.  Isn't it?  Now what happens is that their nuclear program starts here. Nuclear program: As soon as America realizes that once someone gets the nuclear weapon, there will be a problem and Iran is no longer under the control of America.  Israel is also scared. America does not do this work directly.  He gets it done from Israel.  So after that there is a long session.  But then Iran feels that this way won't work anymore.  So then the closeness with America starts increasing and then Barack Obama brings the JCPOA so that you can use your nuclear energy in a peaceful manner.  But then in 2016 when Donald Trump comes, Jesse makes a POA plane and blows it up.   He says nothing will happen.  And from then till now 2024 has arrived.  Iran's relations with America are getting worse every day and Israel has become a new actor in it.  And brother, you know about Israel, it is a threat to survival.  So here Benjamin Netan Yau has also said that he should take back the statement.  Netan Yau has said that we have launched Operation Rising Line and the whole world has seen what we can do.  This is a military operation which is a threat from Iran, not Israel. This operation will continue until we remove this threat. So such a big thing was said here by Benjamin Netan Yahoo and there were such pictures.  Ok?  There was a huge loud explosion here and after that everything turned into smoke.  So, one of their spokespersons from Israel Defense Force also issued a statement that we have attacked nuclear targets here. But obviously there have been casualties.  The most important thing is that their military chief has been killed, the main chief of the IRGC has been killed.  So now this will be the point of escalation here.  But friends, Iran does not have anything special to retaliate.  But they have Houthis and Hezbollah and those are the two main points from where oil goes to the whole world; Iran can block them if it wants. So don't take Iran lightly. Iran can also do a lot strategically and will do it as it has clearly said this and it will not sit quiet.  But friends, you will remember that even in 2018, when America killed the chief of IRGC, many such things had happened. Iran had fired a few missiles and then became silent because Iran does not have the power that Israel and America have.  So the military chief of Israel has said that we are deploying thousands of soldiers on our borders and definitely we are preparing for war.  We have no problem with this.  And if anyone challenges us, then there will be a huge price.  It will pay a heavy price.  I cannot promise people that we will achieve success.  The Israeli regime will definitely attack us in response and the expected cost may vary but we have been planning this operation for a very long time.  Well, this was just in the news, friends, two weeks ago there was news that Israel will attack Iran. I told you two weeks ago.  Ok ?  That Israel is going to launch a big attack and this news was circulating in the corridors about the way Iran's nuclear program is progressing. Israel will attack right there in the building. Wherever they have a nuclear program. Well, India also did the same.  India also did the same but we are a little reluctant because Pakistan is a nuclear power. If Pakistan was not a nuclear power. By the way, if we had not paid any attention to nuclear rhetoric, we would have blown it up by now.  But still because India thinks about everyone.  The whole world thinks about us and we are not an aggressive nation. Israel has an aggressive nature.   It is an expansionist nation.  We are expanding it. He wants all the areas that were taken away from him.  But India is not like this.  So Israel has said that the attack was an independent decision.  And America has also said that brother this was a unilateral decision. Ok?  So Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon has said that we are in continuous talks with America. But this was our own decision.  America did not say anything.  But see, will anyone believe this?   It is impossible that Donald Trump does n't know this.  The CIA may not know.  Is it okay ?  Mossad and CIA carry out all these operations together. So this is very difficult.  Well, Mark Rubio's direct response was that it was a unilateral decision.  We did not do anything and we are we were not involved Israel, it advised us that they feel it is actually necessary for self-defense, that if America defends itself, then in the name of self-defense it says okay kill them.  So Donald Trump has taken all the necessary steps to protect the forces.  And let me be very clear.  Now Iran is there, at least they have given the threat.  Do not target America or America's interests. If it does this then America will also be involved in it.  So this is a matter of threatening brother.  Iran said, look, we will build the Third U Enrichment Facility.  You keep hitting and we'll upgrade our centrifuges. Israel has said that we should not make weapons.  But now we will make the weapon.  Go and uproot whatever you want to uproot. Two Iranian scientists have also been killed in this. And the biggest thing is that the chief of IRGC has been killed. Commander in Chief Hussain Salami has been killed. After that, Ali Khamenei's senior advisor is critically injured.  Right now it had good commercial fights flying in it. Israel has not fought commercial fights in advance.  She was flying comfortably.  Is it okay ? So all this can be seen. You can see the military strength of Israel and Iran; it is obvious that Iran has more numbers.  But Israel has the technology.  If we talk about technology reserve and in Israel there are 1.5 crore Jews in the entire world and everyone of them has to give military service.  You ca n't avoid it.  Concryption is mandatory in Israel.  If you do 12th, you should concentrate on military, if there is war tomorrow then everyone should go to the border, son.  So the paramilitary is 35,000.  Their intelligence agency is that of Iran and Israel and their technology is far ahead of Iran.  So maybe you may see more of these numbers.  Brother, it is obvious that Iran has a larger population. So if you look at the total reserve, active and paramilitary, it is around 7 lakh. Ok?  You might be saying 7 lakhs, it is close to 10 lakhs. But Israel has more power.  Is it okay?  There is more technology.  If we talk about aircraft, fighter aircraft, Israel has all these top notch aircraft.  Their dome system, their protective system, tanks, armoured vehicles, rockets, artillery are no match. And if we talk about Navy, Israel is good in that too.  It is quite far ahead. Ok?  So this is the thing.  But now I will take another lecture on what will happen next?  Will this be a war, a full blue war?  Is West Asia once again facing problems? There are already problems there but will a new problem arise now?  So, we will talk about this.  Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off.
