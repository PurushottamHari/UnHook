1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
I kind of joke like I haven't met a

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,839
process in a business that I can't teach

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,440
to AI. Like I I literally have not met

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,360
something I can't do that. That's Rachel

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
Woods and she's about to blow your mind

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,160
about what's possible with AI in

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
business. One of the most common

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,840
pitfalls is people will have that

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,720
implement role also be the AI operator

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,640
role. But most likely your

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,119
implementation person is going to be so

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
in the technical weeds and details that

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
they might miss out on the process.

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,239
She's discovered that the most valuable

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,360
role in AI transformation is not what

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
you think. Again, if you're

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
processoriented,

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,239
like project manager type likes AI, this

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,460
is like your moment to shine cuz this is

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,079
such a needed skill.

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,120
[Music]

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,239
Hey everyone. I'm here today with Rachel

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,520
Woods, who I consider one of the

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,520
absolute leading experts on what I think

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,520
is going to be an incredibly important

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,040
field of AI, which is AI ops, AI

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
operations.

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
Welcome to the channel. Thank you.

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
Thanks so much for having me. Yes. So,

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
we've spent now a few days together um

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
at an entrepreneurial retreat and

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
mastermind and there's so many

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,280
fascinating I mean I have just a list

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
here of frameworks and concepts and

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
stories and projects you're working on.

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,320
First start with a bit about your

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
background and how you came to AI ops.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,680
Zooming back a bit in my career. I

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,520
started in AI almost a decade ago. Um,

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
and was lucky to be exposed to this

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
flavor of AI that's kind of underlying

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,520
behind ChatgBT.

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,399
Um, and my mind was blown then. And so

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,360
I've kind of stayed involved in language

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,479
models and AI uh over the last several

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,399
years. I started at at Facebook and

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,119
their AI research team and then was able

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,520
to do different AI stuff at uh tech

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,759
startups. Fast forward now, I make

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
content online. Um, I run a community

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
called the AI Exchange and we have an

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,720
agency doing all this stuff around AI.

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,680
Yeah, I'm a I'm a proud loyal member of

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,239
the AI exchange. It's one of the just a

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
handful of sources of like knowledge and

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
community around AI that I really trust

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,239
and look to. So, thank you for creating

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,319
that that platform. Well, the people in

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
there are incredible. So, yeah. What I

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,959
what I see in your background is that

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
you were very early to this field that

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
is now kind of taking over the world.

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,840
What made you decide out of all the

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,760
little sub fields and avenues you could

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
have gone down, what is it about

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
operations or how did you even find out

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
and and enter like the the niche of

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,879
operations?

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,200
So I feel like it was just out of my own

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,599
pain because anybody who's run a

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,920
business or an entrepreneur is like the

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,599
hardest thing is just running the

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,800
business, scaling the business, getting

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,040
everything to like operate well like you

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
know it's easy to have it's easier to

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,200
have ideas but then when the rubber

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
meets the road like how well you can

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
execute is where the value gets created.

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,440
And so, um, I've been constantly

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,400
applying AI, uh, to basically go and do

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
processes and do operations, um, once I

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,120
defined them. And that kind of just

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,599
became this, uh, like hook for me,

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
right, where like if I could define what

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,440
I wanted done, if I could define how I

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
wanted my business to run, then I could

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
get AI to go run it that way, operate it

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
that way. Um, and that's just been the

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,760
path we've been on since. So, I'm

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,280
curious um like how does your mind work?

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,000
Does let's say pre-AI operations, did

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
that come naturally to you? Did it make

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,720
sense or or did you personally have a

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,840
lot of trouble with it? I feel like it's

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,760
just the way my brain works. Mhm. Yeah.

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,159
Um I've had people say, "Rachel, you

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
just seem to think like an AI." And I

98
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
don't know if that's like a good thing

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,239
or a bad thing, but um I've heard it

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
from multiple people. So, uh, but what's

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,000
been really incredible is I feel like

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
that's just the like intuitive way that

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I look at problems, but then so much of

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920
our work has been on how to bubble that

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
up into stuff that's usable for

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
everyone, for everyone to have some of

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
the mindset shifts and some of the ways

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
of looking at things a little bit

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,440
differently. Um, so that they can start

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
using AI in this way, right? Where you

111
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,720
don't have to always be the one doing

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
the work you define or doing the

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,120
processes you define. Like AI can go and

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,360
actually run that a lot. Yeah. So, so

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
how do you if you had to train someone

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
to see the world like an AI like it

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,680
sounds like you do or think about

118
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,800
problems or come up with solutions like

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,560
an AI, how how do you do that or how did

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
you learn that way of seeing and

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,000
thinking? Where does that come from? So,

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,960
this is one of the nerdy parts for sure.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,440
Um because at its core, what these

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,360
language models are doing is they have

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,360
converted words into numbers and learned

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
patterns of how all of those words fit

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
together so that when you give a prompt,

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,240
it's predicting what the next most

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
likely word and the next word and the

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,680
next word should be based on everything

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,039
that it's learned. Um, and so even if

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
you can kind of start to really

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,280
conceptualize that, things get a lot

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
easier for you to think about, well, if

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,039
I put these words in, is that going to

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,639
be most am I going to be most likely to

137
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,720
get the words that I want back? Um,

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,240
another crazy analogy, this this I

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
learned a long time ago when I first got

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,120
exposed to this uh tech, and it's kind

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,560
of a simple one, but actually um if you

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,400
take the word king Mhm. and you subtract

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,600
the word man and you add the word woman,

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
you roughly get the word queen in these

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,880
like language models and the way that

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,479
they think cuz it's just all numbers and

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,720
patterns and math and stuff. So, um, you

148
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,759
don't need to know like that so deeply

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
to get value out of stuff, but the more

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,840
that we've seen people slow down and try

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,560
to kind of just think about what AI is

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
doing, then um, yeah, you can get, I

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
mean, really incredible results. I mean,

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,639
my my favorite way to think about AI is

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
it's just like thinking about people and

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
like working with people. I've noticed

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,120
this is one of your your like go-to

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,600
frames and it's very it's surprising how

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
powerful it is, isn't it? Which tells me

160
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,240
we really don't think of it that way.

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Yeah. Well, like there's so many

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,800
pitfalls or struggles that people have

163
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,120
with AI. But if you look at people's

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
experience managing people, hiring

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
people, working with people, creating

166
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,720
processes for people, those same

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,720
struggles are also in that. Um, and it

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,520
makes sense in a way because AI is

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
trained off of people and what the words

170
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,639
we've written, right? Yeah. It also

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,199
speaks to the difficulty of it, which is

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,840
it's not just a a switch that you flip.

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
There's training and design and strategy

174
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
and all these things, which you expect

175
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
of people cuz we know people are

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,319
complicated, but then somehow we think

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
AI is going to be not not complicated.

178
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,160
Yeah. Yeah, I mean one of my favorite

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,160
analogies is like um I think especially

180
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
someone new to building a business or

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
new to building a team thinks like, "Oh,

182
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,800
I have a marketing problem. I'm going to

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,639
go hire a CMO at a fortune, you know,

184
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,319
100 company to now be my marketer for my

185
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,039
small business." Like you kind of think

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,759
about um or you look for the easy magic

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,759
pill solution to your problem.

188
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
But anybody who's tried to hire people

189
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
like you know it's so much more

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,759
complicated than

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
just that. Like you have to think about

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,599
okay what's the level of experience you

193
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,680
actually need? What are the you know

194
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,960
jobs you need them to do? What's your

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,280
specific business challenges like? And

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
then um especially the more you map that

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,039
stuff out, the more you get specific on

198
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
the job you want someone to do, usually

199
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,840
have a much higher chance of being

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
successful. And that's the same thing

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
with AI. The more specific you get with

202
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
your prompt, the much higher chance it

203
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,080
has at giving you an output that you

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,599
want. Absolutely. Absolutely. People

205
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,919
tend to just not put in all that

206
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
preparation and planning and thinking,

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
go straight to the tool and then blame

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,360
the tool for its failings. Just like

209
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,199
hiring the CMO, CMO maybe doesn't fix

210
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
the problem because they're not magic

211
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,440
and then they blame the CMO for the

212
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,759
problems, right? Yeah. Yeah. I heard um

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
we were talking last night and someone

214
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
reported something that you had said

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,599
which was like when people say oh how

216
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,640
are you using AI in your business that

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,479
you're just like that question doesn't

218
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,880
even make sense it's like asking hey how

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,279
are you using people in your business

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,440
yeah yeah I mean like uh I see them as

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,920
so similar because there's so many

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,000
flavors of AI even outside of just like

223
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
ChachiBT is technically just one flavor

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,560
of AI there's tons of other flavors and

225
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,399
then inside chachi bt you have so many

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,920
different ways and techniques and

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
everything that you can use it,

228
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
different tasks, different prompts,

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
different all this stuff. So, what do

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,240
you think are the main ways they're

231
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,560
different between AI and people? Mhm. I

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
think that something I come back to a

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
lot as being something I don't see being

234
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,480
replaced is that people have this innate

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,240
ability to connect with each other and

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,600
have things around trust and

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
relatability and creation, creativity.

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,160
like there's just a lot that comes out

239
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,839
of humans connecting to each other. Um,

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,360
and so far that's something that AI

241
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,279
can't do, right? That human to human

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,880
connection. But outside of that, I mean,

243
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,279
there's a lot I kind of joke like I

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,600
haven't met a process in a business that

245
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,120
I I can't teach to AI. Like I I

246
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,160
literally have not met something I can't

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,920
do that with yet because I think about

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,680
it like if I were to train a person to

249
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,440
do this, how detailed would I need to

250
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
get? And when you do that, you get to

251
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
the place where AI can actually do it.

252
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,040
Um, yeah. And that that's what AI

253
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,920
operations is to me ultimately, right?

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Is like getting down to where you're so

255
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,839
um specifically designing how you want

256
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
AI to operate in your business. You're

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
making the processes. You're defining

258
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,519
the instructions. Um, and then once you

259
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,519
do that, you can unlock so much. So, so

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,000
one of the most fascinating ideas you

261
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,880
have is actually ironically a human

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
role, which is AI operators. How would

263
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,320
you explain what they are? So I'll start

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,160
with the misconception people have which

265
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
is that one person in your company

266
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,680
should be the one in charge of

267
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,480
implementing or even that everybody

268
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,279
should learn the same uh ways to think

269
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,760
about AI in a company. Um what we've

270
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,839
actually found with all of our uh the

271
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,800
businesses we work with and our clients

272
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
is that everyone needs to have some uh

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
base level of AI and lean in and

274
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,800
everything of course but there are three

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,600
roles that if you set up and really

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,200
codify or like three hats um you get to

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,519
the place where you're able to just

278
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,079
start implementing AI so much faster in

279
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
your business. Um those three roles are

280
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,720
an AI visionary. So somebody who's

281
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,640
setting the strategy and really deciding

282
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
what should be worked on. Um the AI

283
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,120
implement which is the technical person

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,560
plugging the things together. My

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,079
favorite term handling the technical

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,880
underpants of AI. Um but the key role is

287
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,800
actually this AI operator which uh we

288
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,040
define as basically the kind of like

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
operationally minded processminded

290
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,720
person who is going to kind of be the

291
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,320
shepherd of AI coming into a business

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,480
defining the processes with the team um

293
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,279
and kind of running the execution of

294
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
getting AI to uh start doing that work.

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,720
Um, and that's a role that we've seen

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
just once the teams we work with

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,600
implement or have that person really uh

298
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
lean in and take that hat, they're able

299
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
to do so much more with AI so much more

300
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,519
quickly. Um, especially if you want to

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
get to do processes, having like a

302
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
process person at the helm will really

303
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
help with that. So this is this is

304
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,720
amazing. So first let's talk about the

305
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,519
other two roles. So the AI visionary

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,279
is like you mentioned in the case of the

307
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
founder of the company or the CEO who's

308
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
like I am personally going to lead the

309
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,800
charge into AI and that that's not the

310
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,040
best approach. Right. Right. Cuz that

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,079
person doesn't have the time usually to

312
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,279
really uh shepherd this you know

313
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,040
adoption and process. Um but they're so

314
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
important because if you don't have that

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,320
buy in and that excitement then you're

316
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,920
not going to get off of you know step

317
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,440
zero right. Would it be I'm just curious

318
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,000
if you could choose anyone in an

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,560
organization to be the visionary

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,800
is it is this is the person at the top

321
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,600
the best person or just the most common

322
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,519
person that does that? I'd say usually

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,920
it needs to be someone at an executive

324
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,600
level. Um depending on the organization

325
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,760
maybe VP level but um in a small company

326
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
it's usually the owner and maybe a

327
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,120
mediumsized company we see a lot of

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,399
COOH. Uhhuh. Um so again someone that

329
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,440
knows where you want to go with AI in

330
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,760
your processes in your operations but um

331
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,399
isn't the one who's that driving force

332
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,279
for the specific projects. So someone

333
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,279
with some authority some leadership uh

334
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,079
they need to be kind of a visionary type

335
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,000
it sounds like. Okay interesting. So it

336
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,320
depends on the business size. What about

337
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,560
the the impletor? What kind of person or

338
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
role does that tend to be? So again,

339
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
depends on the company and also how

340
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,680
complex they want to go with the AI

341
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,320
stuff they're setting up. Um, it could

342
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,320
be as simple as someone who's really

343
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,320
good at writing prompts could be that

344
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
imple.

345
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
Other teams that want to do more

346
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,240
advanced stuff around AI automation,

347
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,800
might be an automation engineer or an

348
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,560
automation person. Um, or at bigger

349
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,880
companies, sometimes it's actually kind

350
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,040
of a traditional engineering role that's

351
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,959
doing that implementation stuff. Yeah.

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,279
So, it sounds like someone more more

353
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,120
leftrained, analytical,

354
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,680
maybe a technical background, something

355
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
like that. Yeah. Yeah. And again, it

356
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,680
depends on how complex you want to be in

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,760
your uh the projects that you do. Um I

358
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,800
always recommend starting off with just

359
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,800
the the basics. You can always decide uh

360
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,279
how much more technical complexity you

361
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,079
need to add in from there. Yeah, that's

362
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,279
great advice. I tried recently to make a

363
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,360
claude project that could write for me,

364
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
write like me. And then I realized as

365
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
I'm experimenting, oh, I actually have

366
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
many kinds of writing. So, let me just

367
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
do long form blogging. And then within

368
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,079
that, as I'm experimenting, I realize,

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
oh, there's actually like still a dozen

370
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,360
kinds of long form blogging. Let me just

371
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,199
do long form summaries of books as blog

372
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
posts. And that's what I'm iterating on

373
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,240
now. And it's still in a way too wide.

374
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,120
There's actually like so many little

375
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
branches of the decision chart that

376
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,720
exists, I guess, in some form in my

377
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,360
mind. Totally. I mean, that's that's

378
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,040
what operational thinking is, right? Is

379
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,760
that breaking down of processes until

380
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,560
they're in like small enough steps,

381
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,199
small enough components. Um cuz what

382
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,680
you're doing, if you tried to teach

383
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,600
someone how to do it, the way that you

384
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,120
do it, I guarantee you would go end up

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,600
going through the same steps, right?

386
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Yeah. So, yeah, that's cool. It's true.

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
And I'm the thing that's fascinating

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,000
because that all sounds like a lot of

389
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,920
time, and it is, but I'm also learning

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,160
so much about my writing process. I'm

391
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
learning more about how I write than I

392
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
ever knew before. I'm curious, what's

393
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,120
been the most surprising thing that

394
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,959
you've learned from breaking everything

395
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,800
down in that detail? You know what I

396
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,839
think it is? I'm I'm uncovering one

397
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,199
after another. I seem to have like

398
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,600
literally hundreds of like, how do you

399
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,600
call them? I guess like rules of thumb,

400
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,760
really simple little rules, often

401
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,760
binary. Do this, don't do that, or

402
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,760
choose between A and B, or sometimes

403
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,560
it's like three things or four things.

404
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,040
So little like tiny, stupidly mundane

405
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:56,079
things like um like only state each idea

406
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,839
one time. Like cuz I I noticed the AI

407
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,360
would repeat them, which ironically is

408
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,720
what we're taught in school. You know,

409
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,639
say what you're going to say, say it,

410
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,880
and then say what you said. Like

411
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
reinforcement through repetition. But I

412
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,399
think from writing on the internet where

413
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
you have to catch their attention and

414
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,800
then maintain it. So everything has to

415
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,800
be so compressed and tight. I don't have

416
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,320
time or space to mention an idea more

417
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
than once. So I just go from one to the

418
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
next to the next to the next. And I had

419
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,320
to teach it that rule of thumb. Yeah.

420
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,839
Because the way that you do that type of

421
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,759
work is different than the average

422
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
generic way that these models have

423
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,680
learned from. And so um yeah, if you

424
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
wanted to do work your way, you have to

425
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
get to the level oficity. Okay. So the

426
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
tech implement is there anything else

427
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,120
about that role? Is is there anyone you

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
found shouldn't play that role or can

429
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
someone be so technical that they're and

430
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
like not open-minded enough that they

431
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,440
can't fulfill that role? Like what have

432
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,519
you seen? So probably the one of the

433
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,639
most common pitfalls is people will have

434
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,160
that imple

435
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,839
operator role. Um this happens with a

436
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,440
team that's like oh yeah we have one AI

437
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
person they have maybe an engineering

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,000
background or something. Um and it can

439
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
work. I like to describe these are all

440
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,480
hats. So somebody could wear all three

441
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,319
hats or two of the hats, but uh most

442
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,880
likely your implementation person is

443
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,520
going to be so in the technical weeds

444
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,079
and details that they might miss out on

445
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,240
the process. Yeah. And on learning from

446
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,160
the team, what does success look like in

447
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,919
this process? And getting down to level

448
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
specificity of do you repeat ideas

449
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,440
twice? And like there's just so much

450
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,799
there. And that's why it's better that

451
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
these are kind of treated as two

452
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,200
separate hats and two separate roles.

453
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,240
Okay, so let's talk about an AI

454
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,360
operator. Let's maybe start with what

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
kind of person should fill that role. So

456
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
I also say these are my favorite type of

457
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
people to hang out with. Not that I

458
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
don't like the visionaries and the

459
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
implementation, but um I've just found

460
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
so

461
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,720
anybody who has like a processoriented

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,880
mind, maybe has been a project manager,

463
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,240
um if you use ClickUp and you're like

464
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,919
the ClickUp queen or king, like this

465
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,880
role I feel like is built for you if you

466
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,400
have an interest in AI. Um because all

467
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,480
of the uh skills that people don't

468
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
realize they have around breaking down

469
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
something complex into multiple steps in

470
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,559
a process or documenting things or

471
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
staying organized like that's exactly

472
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,400
what you need to be really good at AI

473
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,840
operations in this AI operator role.

474
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,840
I've often found that um processor

475
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,160
oriented people are quite different from

476
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,720
good project leaders. It's almost like

477
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,080
process people they think in continuous

478
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,240
cycles. They're very they're very like

479
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,240
they're systems oriented. They're very

480
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,760
like dependable. But sometimes maybe

481
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,919
this is just a certain kind of project

482
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
you need almost like a SWAT team leader.

483
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
Someone who just like kicks down the

484
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
door has no maybe has no process and

485
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,320
just like does whatever needs to be done

486
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,160
to just move that thing forward. But you

487
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,760
mentioned both of those like project

488
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,120
manager types and processoriented

489
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
people. How do you see how do you see

490
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,360
that working? Yeah. So, um I mean there

491
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
are a million flavors of project

492
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
management of course, but someone who's

493
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,200
going to kick down the door, I feel like

494
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,440
that's really more that AI visionary

495
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,160
role in the best teams that we've seen.

496
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,400
Um because

497
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
I mean even just the thing the breaking

498
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
down the writing and the way that you

499
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,640
were describing that's something that

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,679
requires a lot of detail, a lot of

501
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,480
processoriented thinking, right? Um and

502
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,280
so uh something that like we commonly

503
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,400
see is that AI operator might be running

504
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,320
the projects. If they run into any

505
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
friction of something getting done, that

506
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,679
is also where that visionary can step in

507
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,000
and help support or put the priority or

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
yeah uh knock down those barriers. Um

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
what else can you say about this role?

510
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
Like even things like where should they

511
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
sit in the organization,

512
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,200
how should they be compensated, how much

513
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,120
how much authority and autonomy do they

514
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
need? There's a couple options for how

515
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,880
you structure your AI operator role.

516
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,640
Some companies will set it up as its own

517
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,720
kind of individual silo or um most

518
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,480
likely it's just kind of transforming

519
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
your current operations or project

520
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
management team into a couple people

521
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,080
that do this. Um, but the reason that

522
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,520
it's nice for it to be its own little uh

523
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,679
I guess silo is not quite the right

524
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,360
word, but its own pod kind of like a

525
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,280
working group like a special special

526
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,679
project special forces. Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:36,159
Yeah. Because like if um once you learn

528
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,840
how to do the AI operations process,

529
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
doing it for the marketing team versus

530
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,039
doing it for the sales team versus doing

531
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,679
it for um maybe uh the finance team,

532
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,960
it's all the same process. It's just

533
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,840
different types of processes. M and so

534
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,480
there's a lot of benefit to having one

535
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,080
or a couple centralized people that

536
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,520
almost tiger team into the different uh

537
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
other teams. So that's one way that

538
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
we've seen a lot of companies set it up

539
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,360
and so you don't have each department

540
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,159
like relearning the same things, making

541
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,679
the same mistakes. Yeah. Um interesting.

542
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
And can can that special projects team

543
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,919
how do they have the cognitive

544
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,919
flexibility to go from function to

545
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,280
function to that feels like you would

546
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,880
need to either have experience in all

547
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,480
those domains or or be incredibly

548
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,559
open-minded.

549
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,799
Well, I think the so this role isn't

550
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,200
designing processes from scratch or

551
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,880
isn't the one responsible for even

552
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
coming up with the stuff. We really

553
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,760
describe it as like they're the one

554
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,600
shephering the process. So um usually in

555
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,440
a project you want to identify who's the

556
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,360
subject matter expert that actually does

557
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,120
the process or maybe maybe it's 10

558
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,440
people that do the process and so those

559
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,039
the 10 subject matter experts and so

560
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
this world AI operator what they do is

561
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,559
they spend a lot of time like

562
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,440
interviewing and asking follow-up

563
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,640
questions and mapping out what the team

564
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,000
is currently doing. Um and in that case

565
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,760
it's actually an advantage to be

566
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
somebody that doesn't know that process

567
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,960
because you're going to ask better

568
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
questions. you're gonna know what's not

569
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
clear enough for you to follow. And if

570
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,200
you can't follow it, the AI is probably

571
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
not gonna be able to follow it either.

572
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Fascinating. So it it becomes this

573
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,880
really powerful role because then um

574
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,480
once somebody gets good at this or a

575
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
team gets good at this AI operations

576
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,200
stuff, they can make impact across the

577
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,280
whole organization. Yeah. So then that

578
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
makes me think they need to be well

579
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,080
compensated. They need to have respect

580
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,679
and authority and all those things.

581
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
Yeah. So, one of the things I love is

582
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,120
how many of our clients, the AI operator

583
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,360
that we started working with and

584
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,360
training, um, multiple of them have

585
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,600
gotten promotions and they're now the,

586
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
you know, director of a a team. They

587
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,840
have other AI operators are training up

588
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,360
underneath them. Um, I kind of feel like

589
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
this is again, if you're

590
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,679
processoriented,

591
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,640
like project manager type likes AI, this

592
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,799
is like your moment to shine cuz this is

593
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,200
such a needed skill. Wow. And produces

594
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,720
so much ROI once a company set it up.

595
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,320
Yeah. Is there anything else you would

596
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
ask? Like I imagine someone watching

597
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,640
this video, they're like, "Am I that

598
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,480
kind of person? Is this my moment?" Like

599
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,240
is there any other criteria or

600
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
qualifications or even just like

601
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
personality traits that you think are

602
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
important?

603
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
Um, I think one of the biggest

604
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,960
misconceptions is people think they need

605
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,159
to be technical to do this and you

606
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,360
really don't because you can do AI

607
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,960
operations with just prompts. Mhm. Um,

608
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,080
so I feel like that's where people get

609
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
stuck a little bit is that they're not

610
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,520
technical or not techsavvy enough. Um, a

611
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,840
funny one we get is, uh, when do I ask

612
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,480
for the raise?

613
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,240
What do you say? Um, yeah. I mean, I

614
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
think after you do a couple of projects

615
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,000
and you can map out the ROI of what

616
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,799
you're creating, the ROI for AI is is

617
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,280
really high when you get to do processes

618
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,720
like this. Um, so it becomes really easy

619
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,360
to say, I'm going to keep doing this for

620
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,080
the company, so we should talk about how

621
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,600
I can uh, you know, be compensated for

622
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
that. That's how business owners think,

623
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
just what's the ROI? I don't need to

624
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,679
know anything else. If it's positive, if

625
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,919
it's high. Yeah. They're like, I'm in.

626
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,240
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. And you've

627
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
mentioned to me that the AI exchange has

628
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,200
has kind of pivoted from like anyone

629
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,760
interested in AI to this kind of person,

630
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,559
right? What had you make that change?

631
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,799
So, we started the AI exchange. It was

632
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,360
technically a website up before chatbt

633
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:33,120
launched. Huh. Yeah. Huh. Yeah.

634
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,559
That's real street cred. Yeah. I um

635
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
Yeah. I have a lot of things that we

636
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,600
were doing just a couple months before

637
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,600
CHGBT. And I promise I had no insider

638
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,200
information.

639
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,919
At first, we really just wanted to

640
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,720
create a space for everybody who was

641
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,120
really early in AI and to do that

642
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,039
knowledge sharing. And there was um just

643
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,600
a lot of like foundational concepts that

644
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,880
I we wanted to help seed into the

645
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
community. And so that's what that how

646
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,200
that started. Um what's been amazing is

647
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,679
how many people were in that community

648
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,440
and have gone on to do very different

649
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,840
things across the space building AI

650
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,200
products uh a lot of AI consultants all

651
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,039
this stuff. Um but we first started

652
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,679
calling what we were focusing on AI

653
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:19,120
operations in like March of 2023. Also

654
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,200
still pretty early. Yeah. Um, but I will

655
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,360
be honest, with everything being so new,

656
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
sometimes it's hard to know that you're

657
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,960
really sure about something until you've

658
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,880
been noodling on it for a while. Like,

659
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,400
so, um, I feel like we've just started

660
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,080
to really really um, be like, cool,

661
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,919
we're going to officially consider this

662
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,640
AI operations, officially consider this

663
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,840
AI operator role and stuff. um over the

664
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,960
last like six to nine months. I think

665
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,400
it's just by the way incredibly smart

666
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,559
like everything I'm learning this in my

667
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,960
own business the importance of the ICP

668
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,760
the ideal customer profile

669
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,799
um that it's just like everything tells

670
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,240
you where to focus so much more

671
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,919
profitable so much more um like it's so

672
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,000
much less demanding on your time cuz you

673
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,520
can just focus like I think that's a

674
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,120
brilliant move it sounds like that's

675
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,960
going to be the most important role one

676
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,799
of the most important roles in the

677
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,720
coming AI wave I I approve even though

678
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,039
I'm not that really role. I think I'm

679
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,520
probably more the visionary. But like

680
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,360
the second that we have that person, I'm

681
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
going to send them there. And I love

682
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,960
that there's an existing resource, an

683
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,279
existing community of similar people for

684
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,440
them to talk to. Yeah. I mean, we want

685
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,360
every company to have an AI operator, at

686
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
least one, right? Actually, that's

687
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
that's an interesting question. Where do

688
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,120
you see where do you see this ending up?

689
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,440
Just one AI operator for an entire

690
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,000
organization. Won't every team and

691
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,240
department need one? So, I love the

692
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,559
question. The thing that I think again

693
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,960
there's so many important pieces of

694
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,720
being, let's even just name it, the AI

695
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,000
first organization, the ones that are

696
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,919
leaning into AI operations and um doing

697
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,520
a lot of AI.

698
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,919
There's so many different roles you

699
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
need. Um we've mentioned briefly the

700
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,559
subject matter experts. I actually think

701
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,799
that if you were to take every person on

702
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,200
your team and make them become AI

703
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
operators, you miss out on those people

704
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,400
becoming even more subject matter

705
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,919
experts in their zone of genius.

706
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,039
Interesting. Right? So, somebody's

707
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,440
extremely good at content.

708
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,919
Make them and give them the space to go

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,919
be even better at content. Right? And

710
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,400
then they can work with an AI operator

711
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,039
to codify the expertise and the stuff

712
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,360
that they've created. and then they can

713
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,600
have more free time to go work on the

714
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,440
next and bigger things in content,

715
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,360
develop their expertise even more. And

716
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
it kind of becomes this cycle that you

717
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
miss out on if you have one person

718
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
codifying stuff for themselves. Oh,

719
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,600
interesting. Cuz you don't want a

720
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,000
company that's just all AI experts, but

721
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,440
they don't know anything else, right?

722
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,120
Like there's always going to be a

723
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,880
subject matter, some connection to

724
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,919
outside reality that you need to know

725
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,320
about. Yeah. Otherwise, you're what are

726
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,399
you teaching the AI, you know? Yeah.

727
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah. And I guess maybe if you wanted an

728
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,960
AI operator on a team that should

729
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,919
probably be an AI agent or something

730
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,559
itself at some point, right? Yeah. I

731
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,720
mean, I think all of these all of these

732
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,880
roles are also going to evolve a lot as

733
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,120
I mean the AI operator can make an AI

734
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,039
agent that does AI operations, you know,

735
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,360
like there's a lot of meta stuff there.

736
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,520
Endlessly recursive. Yeah. Okay. We've

737
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
talked about the who, who you want on

738
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,039
your team, how you want that team

739
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,880
structured, etc.

740
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,200
Let's talk about now. Okay, let's say

741
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,520
that there's a company, let's say a

742
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,799
mid-size company. They've identified

743
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,320
those three people at least or at least,

744
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,159
you know, their current versions of

745
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,720
those roles and they're like, "Okay,

746
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:51,120
we're ready to go." Um, how do we AIFI,

747
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
I think is the term you've used, our

748
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
processes? Like, where do you even

749
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,919
start? Yeah. So through a lot of trial

750
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,799
and error, we have found that if you do

751
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,440
these five steps on repeat, you will be

752
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,279
able to get AI to do your processes. Not

753
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,360
saying it's the only way to do it, but

754
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,840
we found it's a pretty uh reliable way

755
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,000
to just start cranking this stuff out.

756
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,760
Um we call those five steps our craft

757
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,559
cycles. Uh which C stands for getting a

758
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,399
clear picture up front. Mhm. R stands

759
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,360
for taking that clear picture, making it

760
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,200
a realistic design. A clear picture of a

761
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,799
single process of a process. Yeah. And

762
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,279
then a realistic design of that single

763
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,200
process of that process. Unless and you

764
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,039
can dig into this more you might find

765
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
your process is actually a really big

766
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,880
process and there's a lot of complexity.

767
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,440
So what might be realistic is to do a

768
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
piece of that. Oh yeah. Okay. So a

769
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,279
single process from beginning to end or

770
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,880
a piece of a process. Yeah. Um, and if

771
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,640
you do this kind of planning up front

772
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,120
before you jump into using AI for stuff,

773
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,120
then you're gonna have a much uh higher

774
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,360
success rate of getting AI to even do

775
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,559
those things. Yeah. So once you have a

776
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
clear picture and then you have a

777
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,240
realistic design, the A in the craft

778
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,240
cycle stands for AI. Mhm. So this is

779
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,840
where you actually do the building and

780
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,000
implementation.

781
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,080
And then the F stands for feedback. And

782
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,399
this is the coolest part. This is my

783
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
favorite part. It's your time to shine

784
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,600
because the feedback is really where you

785
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,399
get the AI to be really great at stuff.

786
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Um, then the T is the team roll out

787
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,360
stage. And what we've learned is even if

788
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,080
you're building a process for an entire

789
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,360
team, being really cognizant of getting

790
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,159
um at least an MVP or first version

791
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,880
built first before you try to go roll it

792
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,880
out to a whole team. Um you'll have a

793
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,159
lot higher success rate because then you

794
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
can improve and iterate on people's

795
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,159
feedback instead of needing to be slow

796
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,960
through the whole process. So um we keep

797
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,799
that for the the last step. But yeah,

798
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,919
did you use AI to come up with the craft

799
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,159
acronym? Of course I did. Okay, good.

800
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
Okay, it makes complete sense. Um, well,

801
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,520
the funniest thing is so the um the

802
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,200
realistic design uh one was the hardest

803
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,399
to come up with cuz we were trying to we

804
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,399
were like, it's the design, it's the

805
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,520
outline, it's the all the stuff. And

806
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,799
then we looked at how we do it and we

807
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,159
actually usually like uh narrow in what

808
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,799
we're trying to work on into something

809
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,720
that feels realistic. M. And so that's

810
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,320
like, oh, it's a realistic design, not

811
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
just this crazy design you have in your

812
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,960
head. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So I just

813
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
think I want to like pause here. This is

814
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,799
so incredibly valuable because it's like

815
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,679
a road map that you're giving to

816
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,600
to AI to add AI into your operations.

817
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,760
But then it's like a loop also because

818
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,360
you keep going through it and you start

819
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,519
with one and then you do a group and

820
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
then you do many and eventually do

821
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,080
eventually do you just do every process

822
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
in your organization. I mean yeah that's

823
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,799
the potential that's the potential and

824
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,840
it's why it's a cycle. So we talk about

825
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,480
this is it's continuous development and

826
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,559
continuous improvement and you know your

827
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,960
businesses your business and the work

828
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,559
you do is always changing and so by

829
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,600
doing it in a cycle you can kind of keep

830
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,519
up with that change as well. Oh yeah

831
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,600
like three or four or five part

832
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,080
frameworks I think run the world until

833
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
something is in a some number part

834
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,320
framework it's like okay you're just

835
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,640
like telling me a word cloud you know.

836
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,120
Yeah. Um, so when you work with

837
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,720
companies as part of divvy up, what

838
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,240
percentage of them are you just running

839
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,000
through? Not just, but like is is craft

840
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
a prerequisite? Is it the first thing

841
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,840
you do with every client or is it just

842
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,320
like some of them? Every single client

843
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,279
we put through the craft process and in

844
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,039
our first call with them, we say, "We're

845
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,360
going to run this alongside you at

846
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,200
first, but our goal is that you guys can

847
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,679
start running this internally yourself

848
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,320
and we'll be running alongside you." M

849
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,559
um and so yeah that first craft cycle is

850
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,720
our most important thing where we uh

851
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,320
teach everybody how it all works cuz in

852
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,320
the second one it feels familiar even if

853
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,480
we're doing an entirely new process.

854
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,399
Interesting. Okay. So let's talk a bit

855
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,480
about these these letters. So

856
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,720
what does it look like to develop is the

857
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
clear picture of the current process

858
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,840
before AI?

859
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,080
It's so it depends. Sometimes you want

860
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,080
AI to do the process the way it's

861
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
currently being done. That's always a

862
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,080
safe place to start. But if you already

863
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,039
in your head have ideas of what you want

864
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,120
the AI to do or my favorite question is

865
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,640
if you had unlimited time in that

866
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,360
process, what would you have the AI

867
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,039
doing? All of that should be answered up

868
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,600
front to get a really clear picture of

869
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,600
like what's the goal here? M um some of

870
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,519
the things we recommend people do are

871
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,840
turning on Zoom and recording it and

872
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,640
then putting that transcript into chat

873
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,840
GBT after. Um where on that Zoom call

874
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
you're basically just walking through

875
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,519
that process and you're asking each

876
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,279
other questions about all the steps. Um

877
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,519
you can get a very clear picture of what

878
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,679
a process is that way. And would you

879
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,679
recommend do you have the AI operator

880
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,279
interview the subject matter expert on

881
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,039
Zoom? Exactly. Okay. So they have

882
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,760
someone to interact with. Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,280
Okay. Yeah, brilliant. Makes complete

884
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,879
sense. And so you dump that all into

885
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,879
because it's going to be a bit messy. So

886
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,440
you dump it in the chat GPT or some

887
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,159
model and ask it to just turn it into a

888
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,960
a checklist or a process. Yeah, process.

889
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,359
If you want to use uh the word SOP,

890
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,320
standard operating procedure. Catch

891
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,800
knows what that is really well. Okay. Um

892
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,720
we call ours AI playbooks, but it's all

893
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,280
the same thing. You just want it to be

894
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,839
here's the steps that this process is.

895
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Yeah. Okay. So then there's realistic

896
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,560
design. And do you have that step

897
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
because people tend to come up with

898
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,280
unrealistic initial designs? How could

899
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,200
you guess? Yeah. Um well and it's so

900
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,399
tempting to be like this process is 10

901
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,480
steps. We must do all 10 steps with AI.

902
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,280
And you can get really stuck if you have

903
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,200
that binary thinking that way because

904
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,520
sometimes you if you just got step two

905
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,079
and three done by AI that's already

906
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,640
going to start unlocking value or time

907
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,240
for your team and then you can go back

908
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,400
through another craft cycle and work on

909
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,240
step four and five or kind of just keep

910
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
going that way. M and so we really coach

911
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
our clients that the goal is to get

912
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,320
through the craft cycles pretty quickly.

913
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,200
So you can keep unlocking value and keep

914
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,280
unlocking time. Yeah. Uh instead of

915
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,520
getting bogged down in like a sixmonth

916
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
craft cycle that just is bogged down in

917
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,200
bureaucratic stuff. Totally. Cuz there's

918
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,119
also risk that it doesn't work at the

919
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,079
end. Yeah. And then you've spent 6

920
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,640
months when it could have been 6 days or

921
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,800
6 hours, you know? Right. So getting to

922
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,079
where you have a more realistic first

923
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,560
chunk Amazing. Okay. So, sort of scaling

924
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,160
it down, scoping it, right? Maybe making

925
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,480
an MVP. And then let's say now you've

926
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,280
done all that. How do you recommend they

927
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,720
approach AI ification?

928
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,599
So, totally depends on your level of

929
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,920
comfort with AI and automation tools and

930
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,359
stuff. I'd say at a minimum you can do

931
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,160
this with writing prompts for each step

932
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,200
in that process. and you're already

933
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,960
doing this work of AI

934
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,400
whatever that process is. Um, if you

935
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
write really good prompts and they work

936
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,839
really well, then uh it's pretty

937
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,800
manageable to take those and plug them

938
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,240
into a tool like Zapier or learn how to

939
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,680
um add them into automations. One of my

940
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,640
favorite things about YouTube is there's

941
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,640
so many tutorials these days on how to

942
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,320
take your chat GBT prompts and put them

943
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,960
in to some of these tools. Yeah. Yeah.

944
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,920
And so if you do that then your process

945
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
can be run by AI automatically. Um and

946
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,079
then as you get uh more technical or you

947
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,640
have um access to more tools or honestly

948
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,280
as the tools get easier um you can use

949
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,839
things like AI agents uh or other more

950
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,160
advanced AI stuff in that process.

951
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,240
That's so interesting. So, so something

952
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,480
like Zapier, is that what is that your

953
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,280
go-to tool for like the the actual

954
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,320
execution of an SOP or is it just the

955
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,560
easiest like the first one you try? So,

956
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,800
we use a variety of tools. Um, and

957
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:20,320
actually most of our AI stuff is built

958
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,040
in code. Uh, kind of a nerdy side. Okay.

959
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,079
But, um, we use Zapier a lot as like the

960
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:30,160
connective glue. Mhm. Um or if we're uh

961
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,920
sometimes internally we just want to do

962
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,760
craft cycles to get things done and we

963
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,040
don't want to

964
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,200
uh do a very technical setup. So we'll

965
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,920
just do that prompt method or we'll do

966
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,079
um putting it in Zapier. But yeah, it's

967
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,480
like a good it's like a good kind of

968
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,680
test of a process, right? Yeah. And then

969
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,800
you run up against limits and you're

970
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,560
like, okay, we have to move this to

971
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,079
custom code. Yeah. Is that how it works?

972
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,920
That's a great way to put it. Yeah.

973
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,680
Interesting. Okay. Okay. So, let's say

974
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,440
that succeeds. You're like, "This is the

975
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,320
value. You've proven it on your first

976
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,839
test process. Now, it's time for the

977
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
feedback, which you said is the most

978
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,520
exciting fun part." Yeah. Why is that

979
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,599
the most fun part? Cuz I feel like um at

980
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,839
least for me, and I feel like people who

981
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,160
really like this AI operator role. It's

982
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,839
like the um it's so clear whether the AI

983
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,599
understood your instructions or not, you

984
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,960
know? Yeah. you write the prompt, puts

985
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
it, spits it out, and then you're like,

986
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,440
"Oh, it's writing in bullet points, and

987
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,760
I wanted paragraphs, right?" And so, you

988
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,160
just have all these little things that

989
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,720
you start seeing now that it's working.

990
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Um, and the biggest hack is if you can

991
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,359
learn to take that feedback, the things

992
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,359
that you notice, and you actually go

993
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,280
back into your original prompt and you

994
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,920
edit your prompt and then run it again.

995
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,400
Yes. And see if it stops doing that bad

996
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,560
behavior. Yeah. then um all of a sudden

997
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,040
you're going to have AIs that are really

998
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,400
good at what you want um just by kind of

999
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,520
giving it that feedback and going

1000
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,960
through that cycle. I agree this is I

1001
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,160
don't know if I would say fun but I

1002
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,720
would say for me but I think it's so

1003
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,720
critical. It's so important. Um, I found

1004
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,720
this with my my experimentation with

1005
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,960
writing is for example, it's amazing how

1006
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,839
I think my like master prompt, my

1007
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,160
context for like basically my AI style

1008
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,000
guide is like 21,000 words which I've

1009
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,520
developed iteratively and I put that in

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,920
and I say make a piece of writing but

1011
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,839
then I say now judge your own writing

1012
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,000
according to these criteria even if

1013
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,240
those criteria are already in the

1014
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,920
original like master prompt the original

1015
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,160
context it finds really clear

1016
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,839
improvements, makes those improvements.

1017
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,760
So, even with me practically out of the

1018
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,359
loop except saying, you know, check

1019
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,599
yourself,

1020
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,520
why do why is that even like why can't

1021
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,800
it just create those results in the

1022
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,599
first place? Why does it need to check

1023
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,000
its own work? Yeah, I mean, it's a great

1024
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,599
question and it kind of depends on the

1025
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,839
use case. In this one, it's probably

1026
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,920
that the AI is trying to do a lot in one

1027
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,520
first go. Yeah. And so then when you

1028
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,520
give it a more focused task as that

1029
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,839
second one that's able to do it with a

1030
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,440
higher precision. Oh my gosh. I think

1031
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,880
that's exactly what it is. Yeah. But you

1032
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,119
never would have been able to do that if

1033
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,400
you weren't able to define the feedback

1034
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,720
that you wanted to give the AI in the

1035
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,800
first place, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1036
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,480
That starts to be the risk with too much

1037
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,760
upfront context is it can't prioritize

1038
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,320
which is not even a it's not even a like

1039
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
information science. No, it is an

1040
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,520
information science problem. It's not

1041
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,680
even like a technical limitation. It's

1042
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,760
that you literally like according to the

1043
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,560
laws of information and physics can't

1044
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,480
equally prioritize 100 things. Mhm. It's

1045
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,480
just it's like mathematically

1046
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,079
impossible. I mean I describe it like

1047
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,720
it's if you were to train someone, you

1048
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,800
just gave them like a giant 400page book

1049
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,720
and said great now start doing the job.

1050
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,920
Yeah. And even if you told them like

1051
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,079
that they read the book and then they

1052
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,079
started doing the job like they have to

1053
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,880
conjure up exactly what those things

1054
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,040
were. So again, just like people like

1055
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,599
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I find there always

1056
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,000
needs to be a hierarchy in every in the

1057
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,640
document as a whole in the ordering of

1058
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,319
headings within each heading within each

1059
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,920
point the sub bullet points. It has

1060
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,800
which you would do with a human too. You

1061
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,480
need to know any given two guidelines or

1062
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,160
principles which one is more important

1063
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,839
or in which situation is it more

1064
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,200
important. Yeah. Yeah. Wild.

1065
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:26,920
Okay. So feedback um how do you do also

1066
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,920
like is it always simple and obvious

1067
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,839
to trace a mistake or error in the

1068
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,160
output back to its origin in the initial

1069
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,280
context like what if it's unclear like

1070
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,640
how did it even arrive at that like how

1071
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,400
are there cases where you don't even

1072
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,920
know where to go back to or what to

1073
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,560
change

1074
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,319
yeah I mean all the time um the best you

1075
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,040
can have is some heruristics So, like

1076
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,040
some of the ones we use are, is this a

1077
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,119
substance issue or a style issue?

1078
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,960
So, is it saying like totally wrong

1079
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,599
things or do I just not like how it's

1080
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,520
saying it? If it's a style issue, then

1081
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,720
usually you can fix that with looking at

1082
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,359
your examples or your response format or

1083
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,760
any kind of like checklist of an output

1084
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,760
criteria that you're um that you put

1085
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,839
into your prompt. But if it's a

1086
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,319
substance issue, then it's either not

1087
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,240
understanding your instructions or it's

1088
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,119
getting confused by the context or

1089
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,880
doesn't have enough context. And so

1090
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,040
sometimes the best thing to do is just

1091
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,240
delete a bunch of stuff and then kind of

1092
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,599
try again and uh isolate the problem

1093
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,920
from there. But um yeah, again, that's

1094
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,640
why I think this whole process gets

1095
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,440
really fun. Um but yeah, probably have

1096
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,200
to be the right type of person to uh

1097
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,400
find it that that fun. It strikes me

1098
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,880
that like existing organizations pre-AI

1099
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,280
were not good at feedback

1100
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,760
like it's not an existing capability for

1101
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,920
a lot of organizations and even people

1102
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,400
like people don't do feedback well

1103
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,720
giving it receiving implementing it. Do

1104
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,880
you ever have to like start way upstream

1105
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,359
and be like this is how this is what

1106
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,960
feedback is this is how you give it?

1107
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:14,640
Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz like um a good

1108
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:17,440
example is uh if AI writes maybe a email

1109
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,319
hook for you or a subject line then

1110
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,200
you're like ah this needs more pizzazz

1111
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,520
or this is off-brand or like something

1112
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,079
that's not, you know, specific enough

1113
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,839
and actionable. um a person would

1114
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,800
struggle with that as well unless they

1115
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,960
know what you mean because of some other

1116
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,319
like background uh information that they

1117
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,839
have. Same thing with AI. We have a

1118
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,480
couple again of things that we coach

1119
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,079
people through around um we have like a

1120
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,720
can framework like can AI actually do

1121
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,359
anything with this? Uh again I we could

1122
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,440
go for 10 hours frameworks but you know

1123
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,200
is it clear uh the feedback is it

1124
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,119
actionable and is it necessary because

1125
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,599
sometimes you know it's like hey I got

1126
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,680
the the period wrong here and it's like

1127
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,599
okay well is that is that necessary do

1128
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,800
you really want to spend the time Mhm.

1129
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,520
on those types of things like

1130
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,000
diminishing returns. Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,319
Fascinating. Wow. Okay. Uh let's talk

1132
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,400
about tea. Uh which I'm guessing is the

1133
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,200
hardest part.

1134
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,359
It depends on the team. Yeah. Um team

1135
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:25,440
roll out, right? Yeah. T stands for team

1136
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:27,680
roll out. And this is where um you want

1137
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,440
to upfront, especially in that clear

1138
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,079
picture phase, try to start getting at

1139
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,680
least a draft idea of how you're going

1140
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,079
to integrate

1141
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,119
what you're setting up into the team's

1142
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,119
workflow. Who needs training? Who's

1143
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
going to use this? Who's going to be

1144
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,720
reviewing this? kind of answering all

1145
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,280
those questions. That way then by the

1146
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,640
time you're in the team rollout stage,

1147
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,240
uh you're kind of putting all of those

1148
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,920
pieces together. Um a lot of people will

1149
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,200
skip this or just kind of assume that

1150
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,280
this will happen. But you have to be

1151
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,400
really intentional about, okay, we're

1152
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,920
going to have this training, we're going

1153
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,760
to have these success metrics and all

1154
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,480
that stuff. Otherwise, you risk not

1155
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,040
getting the ROI of what you just spent

1156
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,599
time setting up. Totally. Oh my gosh. I

1157
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,480
can I can just imagine or maybe I can't

1158
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,880
imagine the obstacles and things that

1159
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,680
happened. So So you said you sort of

1160
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,560
plan out those things when in the in the

1161
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,000
earliest stages at the CNR or once the

1162
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,440
whole thing's been validated then do you

1163
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,160
sit down and like okay how are we going

1164
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,160
to create a rollout plan? So we usually

1165
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,640
start talking about it in the clear

1166
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,079
picture phase. For example the subject

1167
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,079
matter expert that you interview is

1168
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,480
probably going to be the person using it

1169
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,240
or one of the people using it. Um, but

1170
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,160
then we make the final plan on the team

1171
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,400
roll out because if you make that plan

1172
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,920
too early, you just might not know

1173
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,280
enough about what you actually set up.

1174
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,800
Um, but you can get really complicated

1175
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,079
with all this stuff. You can also be

1176
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,319
really simple. Like if this is a process

1177
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,240
that's in your task management tool

1178
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,480
already, like every Tuesday you write

1179
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,040
this newsletter and here's the ClickUp

1180
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,880
task or SA task for it. Team rollout

1181
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,040
could be as simple as putting a little

1182
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,119
visual indicator, remember we use AI for

1183
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,319
this and then linking the AI process

1184
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:16,400
that you just set up in that template so

1185
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:19,280
that anytime that task uh comes up, it's

1186
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,480
a reminder that we have this process. So

1187
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,839
there can be really simple things like

1188
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,920
that. Oh, interesting. Or like a

1189
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,119
recurring calendar entry that has in the

1190
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,520
notes or in the location a link to the

1191
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,960
SOP. Totally. Yeah, habit stacking,

1192
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,280
right? like um anything you're currently

1193
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,880
doing, how do you just have that be the

1194
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,520
the trigger for remembering that you can

1195
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,440
now use AI for this that next step?

1196
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,880
Interesting. So that's at a at a

1197
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,480
individual level. What are the what are

1198
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,560
the issues? I'm just trying to imagine

1199
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,880
rolling out like a completely new way of

1200
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,520
working to like a sizable team. Are

1201
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,240
there like revolts? Like what's the

1202
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,000
psychology and the culture clash? I'm

1203
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,760
assuming it's a clash. Maybe it's maybe

1204
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,720
there's times when it's not that that

1205
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,160
happens. So, honestly, one of my

1206
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,200
favorite parts about the fact this is a

1207
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,040
cycle and if you're doing it the way we

1208
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,680
try to do it, you're going after small

1209
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,520
chunks at a time, it feels more like a

1210
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,440
gradual ramp up instead of a like

1211
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,800
overnight we just changed everything.

1212
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,560
Okay. And so even just giving the team

1213
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,480
again if there's 10 steps in a process

1214
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,640
you use AI for two of them you get the

1215
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,240
team using those two they start giving

1216
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,680
feedback on that they also then feel

1217
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,839
bought in as you start adding AI to more

1218
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,079
and more of those steps. Okay. It really

1219
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,359
helps. Yeah. Oh. So the gradual roll out

1220
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,000
is not just because you don't know what

1221
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,760
you're doing. It's to give almost like

1222
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,480
give them time to adapt and come along

1223
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,119
with it. Mhm. Yeah. And you're going to

1224
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,760
learn so much from getting it into

1225
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,359
people's hands as well. And those might

1226
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,920
be things that you try to put in the

1227
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,880
next craft cycle, right? Improvements to

1228
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,359
the process you just set up. What about

1229
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,119
if say the introduction of even a single

1230
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,839
process results in someone losing their

1231
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,920
job?

1232
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,960
So I mean it's the question of the

1233
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,640
century. I feel like um the way that we

1234
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,200
talk to our clients about it is we think

1235
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,400
it's really short-term thinking to think

1236
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,640
about AI replacing people because if you

1237
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,119
have a team of uh 50 people with AIS

1238
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,079
versus a team of 50 people that went

1239
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,520
down to 10 people with those AIs,

1240
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,720
the 50 people are going to out compete

1241
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,480
the 10 people because you have uh like

1242
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,400
we still need people to innovate, to

1243
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,920
drive things, to be those experts, to do

1244
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,359
human connection based stuff like um

1245
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,599
yeah, for most businesses it's very

1246
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,680
short-term thinking to think of it as

1247
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,559
like a trade out as like a cost cutting.

1248
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,079
Oh, just cut to the bone. Yeah. Yeah. A

1249
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
race to the bottom if you will. Oh,

1250
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,680
yeah. Yeah. So, this has been incredibly

1251
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,160
helpful. I mean, this is literally a

1252
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,760
class. This is a mini course on AI

1253
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:59,280
integration. So, thank you. Um, one of

1254
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,200
the kind of zooming out uh for a second,

1255
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,040
one of the most evocative and

1256
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,800
interesting phrases that you mentioned

1257
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,720
this weekend was unlimited time. What is

1258
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:14,559
unlimited time about? So, I think we're

1259
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,280
entering a new era where time is just no

1260
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,720
longer going to be the bottleneck

1261
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,599
because once you define what you want AI

1262
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,079
to do, it can go do it. And so you don't

1263
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,760
have to spend the time doing that. So

1264
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,599
you just have this like potentially

1265
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,800
abundant resource of time, right?

1266
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,440
Especially as you do more and more of

1267
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,680
these processes. And so we really

1268
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,000
challenge especially our clients to like

1269
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,359
think about that when you think about

1270
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,760
your business and the things you're

1271
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,839
investing in, the processes that we're

1272
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,400
setting up. Like what would you be doing

1273
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,359
if you had unlimited time? And those are

1274
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,680
a lot of the things that we should be

1275
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,280
going after. Um, but it's, yeah, it's

1276
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,280
just this cycle that I think is going to

1277
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,359
change the way that we work and how

1278
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,359
business works way more than people

1279
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:01,200
expect. Oh my gosh. Yeah. It's it's

1280
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,640
everything we do and think and all our

1281
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,359
decisions are made in the context of

1282
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,359
time scarcity, right? It's it's like the

1283
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,520
fundamental reality almost more than

1284
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,359
space cuz space you can move around, you

1285
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,319
can build things, whatever, but like

1286
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,000
time marches on. It marches on. You

1287
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,880
can't with no amount of money can buy

1288
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,040
even 1 second. So the billionaire has

1289
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,200
the same time constraints as as anyone

1290
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,280
else. So how do you even is it is this

1291
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,400
just an exercise in pure imagination?

1292
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,079
Like it's almost too it's it's such a

1293
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,680
big question that it's hard to answer.

1294
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,000
Like how do you think about your own

1295
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,119
life? What would you Rachel do with

1296
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,400
unlimited time? Yeah. I mean the first

1297
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,359
and easiest thing is looking at the

1298
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,599
to-do list you never get to, right? Um,

1299
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:48,240
but I think there's even smaller things

1300
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,760
in our day-to-day. Um, a thought

1301
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,839
experiment is what's something you did

1302
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,319
once for this type of project that you

1303
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,400
wish you had the time to do every time,

1304
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,240
but you don't? Or what's something you

1305
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,839
did once for this client that was paying

1306
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,839
you a lot of money that you wish you

1307
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:05,599
could do for every client, but you

1308
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:08,880
don't. Because if you're not the one

1309
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,480
using AI to go after doing those things,

1310
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,400
someone else is going to. And that's

1311
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,680
this like cycle that yeah, you want to

1312
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,000
be on the edge of. Oh, that's so good.

1313
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,079
So, you're almost thinking of like ideal

1314
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,960
scenarios or what's the best case

1315
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,040
scenario or the best it's ever been cuz

1316
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,400
the best it could be is is almost too

1317
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,319
hard to imagine, but like you can look

1318
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,599
to the past basically to find examples

1319
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,000
of excellence, examples of like insane

1320
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,839
attention to detail, like examples that

1321
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,400
were isolated then but now can be

1322
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,520
replicated. Is that kind of Yeah. Uh and

1323
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,599
then also kind of similar to delegating

1324
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,839
work to someone else or managing or

1325
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,200
building a team, often times the

1326
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,400
experience is once someone else is doing

1327
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,559
it, you have a zoomed out perspective

1328
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,839
and you can see new and better things

1329
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,520
and ways to improve it cuz you're not in

1330
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,599
the weeds, right? Has ever happened to

1331
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,119
you? Oh my gosh. Every week, every

1332
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,119
month. So, like that's the same thing

1333
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,960
with AI is once you set it up

1334
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,280
and you get AI to start doing something

1335
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,480
and you're not in the weeds anymore, you

1336
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,480
also get a bigger perspective where you

1337
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,520
can think about now ways to improve it

1338
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,520
or things to add to it. Whoa. And I

1339
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,599
that's why I call it a cycle, right?

1340
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,359
Because the more time you unlock, the

1341
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,480
more time you're going to unlock and the

1342
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,079
more time you're going to unlock because

1343
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,240
you have the time to think about what's,

1344
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,520
you know, there to unlock next. What's

1345
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,359
so funny is everything you just said

1346
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,599
reminds me of being an entrepreneur.

1347
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,000
Having a vision,

1348
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,920
being more imaginative about the future,

1349
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,680
elevating your perspective, delegating

1350
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,119
what you shouldn't be doing. It's almost

1351
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,359
like I wonder if everyone is going to

1352
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,359
become a mini entrepreneur or a mini

1353
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,000
creator or a mini visionary or whatever

1354
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,240
you call it. Mhm. Yeah. I mean, just

1355
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,960
like managing people, right? Exactly.

1356
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,559
Yeah. All right. Well, um, how can

1357
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,440
people follow you if they want to learn

1358
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,960
more about you, your work, um, purchase

1359
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,200
something from you, join your community,

1360
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,920
where are the places they can go? Yeah.

1361
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,319
So, if you're an aspiring AI operator or

1362
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,160
anything that we talked about today

1363
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,599
sounds fun to you, I'd love for you to

1364
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,839
check out the AI exchange. We have a

1365
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,160
free newsletter that, you know, we try

1366
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,720
to share perspectives and put a lot of

1367
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,480
free resources out there. So, um, would

1368
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,280
love for you guys to check it out. I

1369
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,520
also create a lot of content on uh all

1370
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,119
sorts of platforms. LinkedIn as one of

1371
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,760
my main ones right now. So, um yeah,

1372
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,960
Rachel Woods uh and the AI exchange are

1373
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
the two things you can Google to find

1374
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,079
our stuff. Okay. And I'm curious about

1375
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,079
Divvy Up. Um if there was a business

1376
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,000
owner, let's say, or an executive

1377
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,680
watching this and they wanted to know,

1378
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,720
am I the kind of organization or the

1379
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,800
kind of person that would be a good fit

1380
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,000
for Divvy Up? like how do you qualify

1381
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,760
the right kind of clients? Yeah. So, uh

1382
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,680
one thing is we work with small and

1383
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,079
medium businesses. So, if you're an

1384
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,480
enterprise, uh we can give you some good

1385
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,040
resources, but um our focus is really

1386
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,040
enabling entrepreneurs

1387
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,680
uh at that size. Um and we work a lot

1388
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,359
with service businesses. Uh usually are

1389
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,720
very time constrained and wish they had

1390
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,160
a limited time. Um, but if anything uh

1391
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,920
we talked about sounds interesting, you

1392
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,440
can reach out and we're happy to either

1393
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,520
help if we can or point you to someone

1394
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,440
who who can. You have a process for sort

1395
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,599
of telling them, determining whether

1396
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,520
they're a good fit for you or not? Yeah.

1397
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,599
Um, if you go on our website,

1398
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,200
divupaggency.com, we'll ask you some

1399
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,480
questions and then uh we can put you in

1400
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,680
the right direction. Is AI involved in

1401
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,000
this? Of course.

1402
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,200
And so one random thing um that I'm

1403
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,800
curious about is what is the bottleneck

1404
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,800
in the growth of that agency currently?

1405
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,559
Like what is keeping it like what is the

1406
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,720
bottleneck to its growth do you think?

1407
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,599
Um I mean it's a it's a great question.

1408
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,920
We you joke we continuously hire AIS for

1409
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,400
stuff for I mean everything around the

1410
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,920
business. Um there's a part where it's

1411
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,640
just a matter of time of us building out

1412
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,960
our own stuff. But I think for me

1413
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,400
something we think about a lot is like

1414
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,880
human to human connection is really

1415
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,800
important in that service cuz we also

1416
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,720
recognize we're shephering people along

1417
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,160
a path that can feel uncomfortable at

1418
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,280
times. Um and so and that's the thing

1419
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:21,040
that uh AI can't do yet and I I think

1420
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,920
probably more very long ways if ever uh

1421
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,520
