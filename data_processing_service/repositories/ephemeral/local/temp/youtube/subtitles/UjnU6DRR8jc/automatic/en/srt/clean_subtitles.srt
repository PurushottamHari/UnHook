Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, last night, something happened which no one had expected. Suddenly, Iran started firing missiles. They fired 12 missiles at US military bases. Now, the US has claimed that they had intercepted almost all the missiles. One missile fell in an empty place. There was no loss to the USA. No soldier was injured here. But, it is such a strange thing that missiles were fired on American military bases and immediately after that, Donald Trump went on social media and announced, congratulations to everyone, congratulations, a ceasefire has been imposed. Now, a complete and total ceasefire will happen between Iran and Israel within 6 hours. Now, what Trump had said, within 6 hours, it does n't seem that Iran is accepting this.  By the way, let me tell you that Iran has already rejected Trump's ceasefire call. And even now if you go to the Twitter page of the Israeli Defense Force, they are continuously updating that for the fourth time in the last one hour, Iranian missiles have fallen on Israel. Here you will see that these are the scenes from Israel just a few hours ago.  Iran is still raining missiles here. Many residential areas of Israel have suffered considerable damage. You can see this video.  All these visuals are coming from Israel.  But Trump is still saying that both Israel and Iran have agreed for a complete ceasefire.  It clearly seems that Trump is trying to force a ceasefire here by making a major compromise on Israel's long-term interests. You will see Benjamin Nitin Yau is completely silent. I ordered ceasefire from Trump one after the other.  Got the peace done.  Everybody is tweeting this.  There has not been a single tweet from Nitin Yadav regarding the ceasefire and Iran is openly saying that there is no agreement and no decision has been taken here yet. At maximum it can happen that for now we will reduce our attack a little bit and this is what can happen.  But there is something amazing about cease fire. Iran is rejecting all the claims of Donald Trump. Even if you look at Iran's fast news agency, they have said that the ceasefire proposal that Trump is making is completely false and an attempt is being made to divert the attention of the public through this. Why?  Even Iran is saying that USA is facing humiliation.  The Iranian missiles that fell on their military bases were done to hide their losses. Now, the US is talking about ceasefire to a large extent because it has understood that Iran can also attack US military bases.  Now again, I am not saying this, Iran is saying this.  Okay, I am conveying to you what both the parties are saying today. I told you earlier that Iran is prepared for a long war.  It has been said many times in the Iranian media that Iran is prepared for a long war with Israel which will last from two to six months and the whole world finds it strange that Natania is completely silent.  Because if you look at the case of India-Pakistan.  Trump's statement came. After that, Jaishankar Sahib, PM Modi and Shahbaz Sharif from Pakistan were all saying one thing or the other and it seemed that the hostility would end for now.  But there is nothing like this in the case of Israel and Iran.  It is clearly visible that Trump is forcing a ceasefire here and is publishing absurd things here. He is saying that history will remember this war as the 12 Day War and he is saying that I would like to congratulate both the countries and he has said such things in his tweets which Israel will never tolerate. You guys will be able to see this here.  I mean, whatever tweets he does, I don't know if he might not be doing them himself. Someone must have done something on their behalf. But what language do you use?  Just look here, Donald Trump says both Israel and Iran came to me.  They all came together almost simultaneously. Both of them said peace at the same time and at that very moment I understood that the time had come.  All these people from the world, the Middle East are real winners.  These two countries are Iran and Israel.  Now it will see a lot of love, peace and prosperity in the future.  They have so much to gain.  These countries will gain so much and everything is just great.  You know the future of Iran is ultimate etcetera.  This was the man.  You all might remember the person who was openly tweeting that he will get the regime changed in Iran.  I mean, you should think about it once. What was the point of this whole operation, Rising Line?  Because Nitin Yau himself confirmed that Iran's nuclear program was not destroyed. Ok?  Then the name Rising Lion itself shows that a coup was being talked about.  Trump himself had tweeted about this a few days ago and now I am showing you the sources of American media here.  Here you will see that the CNN article is in front of you.  Trump floats Iran regime change even as true impact of US strikes is far from clear.   The New York Times has published a detailed report on this, that if you look at the satellite images, it does not seem that there has been complete destruction of the dam.  It seems that Iran's nuclear program will survive and right now many people say that Iran had already hidden the enriched uranium somewhere.  When will it be available and as I told you, Russia has also said that it is possible that some other country may use its nuclear warhead on Iran.  I am coming with another video on this. Trump got very angry with Russia on this issue too. Threatened with nuclear submarines. But all you will see here is if Iran's nuclear program survives.  Ok?  Nor did the regime change in Iran.  No Shah of Iran returned.  The government that was in power in Iran remained there.  So what happened to Trump suddenly ?  Saw Iranian missiles coming to their military base at night and within a few hours they declared cease fire cease fire. Whereas Iran itself is saying that they are lying. I mean what even is this?  And if you see Trump's social media, he loves his own image so much.  Continuously posting such images.  My own painting. They are posting posters like Trump was right about everything.  Brother, you yourself are Trump.  And see, Trump will sleep comfortably in the White House.  Now after tweeting cease fire cease fire, missiles are still raining on Israel. You will see that in the tweet that I just showed you, 12 minutes ago, again an update has come from Israel that sirens are sounding in Israel due to missile launch from Iran.  Iran is constantly raining missiles on Israel.  And I can imagine how demotivated the Israel Defense Forces must suddenly be feeling. Because at a time when Israel and US could have caused huge damage to Iran.  Suddenly taco happened here. Trump chickens out.  And if you are asking me here that why there is taco this time ?  Why does Trump always chicken out?  And why did you chicken out this time?  Look, if you look at Trump's tweet from a few hours ago, it is clearly visible that Trump was very worried that if the oil prices increase too much, it will lead to global inflation, US growth rate will get a further setback, Trump will not be able to take the US economy in the direction he wants to take it and I think somewhere many big countries including India and China must have told Trump that we do not want this conflict to continue for long, we do not want the State of Herboss to close down Iran, so resolve this quickly and that is why you saw that Trump had tweeted this 15 hours ago.  This tweet is before the ceasefire. He was repeatedly saying, everybody listen, keep the oil prices down.  I am watching you all. If you raise oil prices you are supporting the enemy.  Trump himself admitted that this was Iran's game plan.  Raise oil prices internationally so much that the US starts facing problems. And here Trump also tweeted, drill baby drill, I mean now, to his energy department to extract more oil and after that Trump must have clearly seen the mathematics of inflation and he might not have found some things right and immediately it is clear without consulting Nitin Yahoo because Israel is just silent, Nitin Yahoo seems that he is just shell shocked that what has happened, suddenly this man himself has announced cease fire on behalf of both Iran and Israel and Iran is still continuously raining missiles on Israel and that is why I would say that at least in India's case we did say that we will not restore the Indus Water Treaty and secondly, Operation Sindoor has not ended yet.  It has just been paused right now.  You will remember that India had repeatedly given this statement that this was not a ceasefire.  This is just a pause. We can restart this operation at any time. And it clearly seems that Don Trump is losing his credibility.  And now it remains to be seen what statement Israel ultimately gives regarding this ceasefire, whatever you may call it. Many Israeli people will say against Nitin Yau, what did we get?  Neither the regime changed nor did you completely destroy their nuclear program here. What did we get in the end?  So it will be difficult for Nitin Yadav to convince his people. So now see, many developments related to this topic will come.  This is truly remarkable and Trump, like I told you, is just unstable, that's the only word I can use here.  Completely unstable, two different statements in the same day, whatever he says, very very unpredictable. Well anyway this is good news for India. As an Indian I will welcome this cease fire or whatever it is, I don't know what this is. But whatever it is, At Least Strait of Hermos will not close now.  The flow of oil will continue continuously here.  Oil prices have already started crashing. Crude oil has fallen by 6-6 7%.  This will cause the Indian stock market to run away. We will get more ease in India's budget. Obviously this is great news for India.  But I don't know how long this ceasefire will last and finally a very important message for you all, India needs data scientists today, so you must have seen that IITs of our country have also started offering certificate programs related to data science and the reason behind this is very simple.   The global economy is now largely data driven.
