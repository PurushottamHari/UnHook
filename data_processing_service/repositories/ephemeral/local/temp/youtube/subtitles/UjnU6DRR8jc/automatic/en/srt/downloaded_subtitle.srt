00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,800
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,519
Prashant Dhawan. Now, last night, something happened which no one had

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,080
expected. Suddenly, Iran

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,600
started firing missiles. They

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,439
fired 12 missiles at US military bases. Now, the

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
US has claimed that they had

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,400

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,640
intercepted almost all the missiles. One missile

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,880
fell in an empty place. There was no

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,480
loss to the USA. No soldier was injured here.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,760
But, it is such a strange thing that

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,719
missiles were fired on American military bases

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,079
and immediately after that, Donald Trump

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,840
went on social media and announced, congratulations to

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,960
everyone, congratulations, a ceasefire has been imposed.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Now, a complete and total ceasefire will happen between Iran and Israel

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,800
within 6 hours.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,199
Now, what Trump had said, within 6 hours, it does

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
n't seem that Iran is

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,840
accepting this.  By the way, let me

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
tell you that Iran has already rejected Trump's ceasefire call.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
And even now if you

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
go to the Twitter page of the Israeli Defense Force, they are continuously updating

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,520
that for the fourth time in the last one hour,

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,600
Iranian missiles have fallen on Israel.

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,560
Here you will see that these

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,720
are the scenes from Israel just a few hours ago.  Iran is still

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
raining missiles here.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
Many residential areas of Israel have suffered considerable damage.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
You can see this video.  All these

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,360
visuals are coming from Israel.  But

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,159
Trump is still saying that both Israel and

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
Iran have agreed for a complete ceasefire.  It

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
clearly seems that

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,759

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,840
Trump is

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,560
trying to force a ceasefire here by making a major compromise on Israel's long-term interests.

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
You will see Benjamin Nitin Yau is completely silent.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,040
I ordered ceasefire from Trump one after the other.  Got the

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
peace done.  Everybody is

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
tweeting this.  There has not been a single tweet from Nitin Yadav

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,159
regarding the ceasefire

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,560
and Iran is openly saying that there is no agreement and no

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,439
decision has been taken here yet.

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,159
At maximum it can happen that for now

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,719
we will reduce our attack a little bit

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,160
and this is what can happen.  But there is something amazing about cease fire.

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,319
Iran is rejecting all the claims of

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Donald Trump.

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,720

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
Even if you look at Iran's fast news agency, they have said

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,400
that the ceasefire proposal that Trump is making is

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
completely false and an attempt is being made to divert the attention of the public through this.

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,520
Why?  Even Iran is saying that

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,920
USA is facing humiliation.  The

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
Iranian missiles that fell

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,360
on their military bases were done to hide their losses.

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
Now, the US is talking about ceasefire to a large extent

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
because it has understood

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
that Iran

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,680
can also attack US military bases.  Now again, I am

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
not saying this, Iran is saying this.  Okay,

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,080
I am

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
conveying to you what both the parties are saying today.

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
I told you earlier that Iran is

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
prepared for a long war.  It has been

69
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,440
said many times in the Iranian media that Iran is

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,080
prepared for a long war with Israel which will

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,879
last from two to six months and the whole

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,599
world finds it strange that Natania is

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,480
completely silent.  Because if you

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,280
look at the case of India-Pakistan.  Trump's statement came.

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,920
After that, Jaishankar Sahib, PM Modi and

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Shahbaz Sharif from Pakistan were all

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
saying one thing or the other and it seemed that the

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,000
hostility would end for now.  But there is nothing

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
like this in the case of Israel and Iran.  It is

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,879
clearly visible that Trump is forcing a

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,800
ceasefire here and is

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,519
publishing absurd things here.

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,720
He is saying that history will remember

84
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,640
this war as the 12 Day War and he is saying

85
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
that I would like to congratulate

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
both the countries and

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
he has said such things in his tweets which

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
Israel will never tolerate.

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,159
You guys will be able to see this here.  I mean, whatever tweets he

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
does, I don't know if he might not be doing them himself.

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,400
Someone must have done something on their behalf.

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,440
But what language do you use?  Just look

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,799
here, Donald Trump says both Israel and Iran

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,760
came to me.  They all came together almost simultaneously.

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,599
Both of them said peace at the same time

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,040
and at that very moment I understood that the

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,000
time had come.  All these people from the world, the Middle East are

98
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,079
real winners.  These two countries are Iran

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,120
and Israel.  Now it will see a lot of love, peace and

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,919
prosperity in the future.  They have

101
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,639
so much to gain.  These countries will gain so much

102
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,360
and everything is just great.  You know the

103
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,479
future of Iran is ultimate etcetera.  This

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,720
was the man.  You all might remember the person who was openly tweeting

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
that he will get the regime changed

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,120
in Iran.  I mean, you should think about it once.

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,440

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,280
What was the point of this whole operation, Rising Line?  Because Nitin

109
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,360
Yau himself confirmed that

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,040
Iran's nuclear program was not destroyed.

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Ok?  Then the name Rising Lion

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,360
itself shows that a

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
coup was being talked about.  Trump himself had

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,320
tweeted about this a few days ago and now I am

115
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,400

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,120
showing you the sources of American media here.  Here you will see that the CNN

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,000
article is in front of you.  Trump floats

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Iran regime change even as true impact of

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,919
US strikes is far from clear.   The

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,639
New York Times has published a detailed report on this,

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,960
that

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,360
if you look at the satellite images, it does not seem that there has been

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
complete destruction of the dam.  It seems that

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
Iran's nuclear program will

125
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,479
survive and right now many people

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,039
say that Iran had

127
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,720
already hidden the enriched uranium somewhere.  When will it be

128
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,800
available and as I told you, Russia has

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
also said that it is possible that

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,520
some other country may use its nuclear warhead

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
on Iran.  I am coming with another video on this.

132
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,080
Trump got very angry with Russia on this issue too.

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,639
Threatened with nuclear submarines.

134
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,199
But all you will see here is

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,639
if Iran's nuclear program

136
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,600
survives.  Ok?  Nor did the

137
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,160
regime change in Iran.  No Shah of Iran

138
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,960
returned.  The government that was in power in Iran

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,600
remained there.  So what happened to Trump suddenly

140
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,919
?  Saw Iranian missiles

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,759
coming to their military base at night and within a few

142
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,280
hours they declared cease fire cease fire.

143
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
Whereas Iran itself is saying that they are lying.

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
I mean what even is this?  And

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,000
if you see Trump's social media, he loves his own image

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
so much.  Continuously

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
posting such images.  My own painting.

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,479
They are posting posters like

149
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
Trump was right about everything.  Brother, you

150
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,039
yourself are Trump.  And see, Trump will

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,160
sleep comfortably in the White House.  Now after tweeting cease fire

152
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,560
cease fire, missiles are still raining on Israel.

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,120
You will see that in the tweet that I just

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,680
showed you, 12 minutes ago, again

155
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,840
an update has come from Israel that sirens are

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,080
sounding in Israel due to missile launch

157
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,319
from Iran.  Iran is constantly

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,639
raining missiles on Israel.  And I can imagine

159
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720

160
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
how demotivated the Israel Defense Forces must suddenly be feeling.

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
Because at a time when Israel

162
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,319
and US could have caused huge damage

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
to Iran.  Suddenly taco happened here.

164
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,120
Trump chickens out.  And if you are asking me here that

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,160
why there is taco this time

166
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,759
?  Why does Trump always chicken out?  And

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,319
why did you chicken out this time?  Look, if you

168
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,800
look at Trump's tweet from a few hours ago, it is

169
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,440
clearly visible that Trump was

170
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,919
very worried that if the oil prices

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,720
increase too much, it will

172
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,680
lead to global inflation, US growth rate will

173
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,240
get a further setback, Trump will not be able to take the US economy

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,319
in the direction he wants to take it

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,880
and I think

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,199
somewhere many big countries including India and China must have

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,199
told Trump that we do not want

178
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
this conflict to continue for long, we do not want the

179
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,599
State of Herboss to close down Iran, so

180
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,639
resolve this quickly and that is why

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,560
you saw that Trump had tweeted this 15 hours ago.  This

182
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,479
tweet is before the ceasefire.

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,440
He was repeatedly saying, everybody listen,

184
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,599
keep the oil prices down.  I am watching you all.

185
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
If you raise oil prices

186
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,840
you are supporting the enemy.  Trump

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,400
himself admitted that this was Iran's game

188
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,639
plan.  Raise oil prices internationally so much

189
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
that the US starts facing problems.

190
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,599
And here Trump also tweeted,

191
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,680
drill baby drill, I mean now, to his

192
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
energy department to extract more oil

193
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,759
and after that Trump must have

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,240
clearly seen the mathematics of inflation and

195
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,280
he might not have found some things right and

196
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,280
immediately it is clear without consulting Nitin Yahoo

197
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,879
because Israel is just

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,680
silent, Nitin Yahoo seems that he is

199
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,639
just shell shocked that what has happened,

200
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,960
suddenly this man himself has announced

201
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,680
cease fire on behalf of both Iran and Israel

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,440
and Iran is still continuously raining missiles

203
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
on Israel and that is why I would say that

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,440
at least in India's case we did say

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,800
that we will not restore the Indus Water Treaty

206
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
and secondly, Operation Sindoor has not ended yet.  It has

207
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,839
just been paused right now.  You will remember

208
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,480
that India had repeatedly given this statement

209
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,959
that this was not a ceasefire.  This is just a pause.

210
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
We can restart this operation at any time.

211
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
And it clearly seems that Don Trump is

212
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,560
losing his credibility.  And now it remains to be

213
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,360
seen what statement Israel ultimately gives regarding this

214
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,279
ceasefire, whatever you may call

215
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
it.

216
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,959
Many Israeli people will say against Nitin Yau,

217
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,600
what did we get?  Neither the regime

218
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,920
changed nor did you completely destroy their nuclear program here.

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399

220
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,480
What did we get in the end?  So it will be difficult for Nitin Yadav to

221
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
convince his people.

222
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
So now see, many developments related to this topic will

223
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
come.  This is truly

224
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,839
remarkable and Trump, like I told you, is

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,120
just unstable, that's the only word I can

226
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,320
use here.  Completely unstable,

227
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,839
two different statements in the same day, whatever he

228
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,320
says, very very unpredictable.

229
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,480
Well anyway this is good news for India.

230
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
As an Indian I will welcome this cease

231
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,080
fire or whatever it is, I don't know what this is.

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,959
But whatever it is, At Least Strait of

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
Hermos will not close now.  The flow of oil will

234
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
continue continuously here.  Oil prices have

235
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,160
already started crashing.

236
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,560
Crude oil has fallen by 6-6 7%.  This will cause the

237
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
Indian stock market to run away.

238
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,200
We will get more ease in India's budget.

239
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Obviously this is great news for India.  But I don't know

240
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,200

241
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
how long this ceasefire will last and finally a

242
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
very important message for you all,

243
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,320
India needs data scientists today,

244
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,200
so you must have seen that IITs of our country have

245
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,880
also

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
started offering certificate programs related to data science

247
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,720
and the reason behind this is very simple.   The

248
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,959
global economy is now largely data driven.

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,360
Unless the company has

250
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,120
proper knowledge of data, that company cannot

251
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,079
progress further and that is why you must have seen that

252
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,560
almost every startup today

253
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,519
wants a data scientist and you have an opportunity to

254
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,240

255
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,880
make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a

256
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,040
data scientist yourself as a data

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
scientist, the doors of the whole world are open for you.

258
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,000
You can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
Express, Accenture.

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,640
Because frankly

261
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,200
you will find the need for Data Scientists everywhere

262
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,320
and Career 247 brings you our

263
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,959
flagship Data Science and Machine Learning with

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Generative AI course. We have specifically

265
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,839
included Generative AI here because

266
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,079
today, you cannot master Data Science and Machine Learning without Generative AI

267
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,640

268
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,120
and hence our online course will run for 6

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,079
months. There are 260 hours of live

270
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,240
classes here. Usefully see what are the

271
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,240
courses available online today

272
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
because Google and Harvard are offering Data Science courses.

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,560
You will

274
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,079
get pre-recorded classes and their

275
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,279
quality is also not that good.  Where as

276
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,079
when you get a live class, you

277
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,240
can openly talk to the teacher yourself.  Through a webcam

278
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,480
or a microphone.  You will be

279
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,120
able to ask the question immediately that

280
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,200
when will this topic be taught in the syllabus?  What

281
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
tools do you need to learn?  You will be able to understand Pandas,

282
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,480
Amazon, Web Services, Jupiter

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
properly.  And then of course,

284
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
under this course you will

285
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,920
also do projects with us so that you will

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
properly understand

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,839
how to actually use the skills.  So

288
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,480
what do you have to do here?  Simply

289
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,639

consultant will call you.  You

301
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,120
can talk to them about the eligibility for this course

302
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,200
?  Is this course

303
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,040
for you?  And by the way, let me tell you that if you are

304
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,600
a working professional.  Right now you are already

305
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
working somewhere.  If you want a better job

306
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,279
, a better paying job, then

307
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,360
definitely you should do Data Science and Machine

308
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,079
Learning course.  It will really boost your

309
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,480
career.  And let me tell you that

310
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,000
mostly working professionals come to us.

311
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,639
Because the one who has not got a job yet

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,399
cannot understand what impact skilling

313
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,279
brings.  Only that person who has worked somewhere once,

314
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,000
knows that the more

315
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,639
skilled you are, the better you will be paid.  So

316
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,639
our Data Science and Machine Learning Vi Gen

317
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,160
course is starting very soon.   The

318
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
first class will start in a few days.

319
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,560
If you want to start your career in data science then

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800
join this

321
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,480
course.  And on this note, the video

322
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,560
ends.  Thank you for listening.  And as I

323
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
always say, may God watch over
