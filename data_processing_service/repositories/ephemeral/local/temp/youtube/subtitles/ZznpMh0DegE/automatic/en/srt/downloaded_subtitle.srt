1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,120
I've read through a decade of your

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,440
research to figure out what the best

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
investment is so anyone can get rich in

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
the future. And you've predicted that

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,559
this will grow by at least 5,000%.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Yes. And my conviction is so high

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
because of what I do on a day-to-day

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
basis. Is there a woman on planet Earth

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,439
that manages more money from an

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,800
investing capacity than you? Maybe not.

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm overseeing nearly $30 billion. Okay,

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
so I might have $500. What should I be

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
doing with that? So, this is all you

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
need to know. Kathy Wood built a

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,800
multi-billion dollar fund by spotting

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
trends before anyone else. And now, with

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
over 40 years of market insight, she's

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,480
showing you how and where to invest,

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,960
too. AI is the biggest technological

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,039
disruption in history. And this

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,200
incredible rate of change is making

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
people uncomfortable. But if you are on

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
the right side of change, investment

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,079
opportunities and job opportunities are

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
going to be enormous. But people don't

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,840
know what to do. For example, many

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
people think Apple is a very safe

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
investment. It's probably going to be

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
disrupted by artificial intelligence,

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
but yet Tesla is going to be the

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
biggest. You've invested just over 2

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,760
billion in Tesla. Yeah. Because Tesla is

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,560
the largest AI project on Earth. So AI

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,560
has to be a top priority, not an

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
afterthought. So I've got questions.

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
What's your top 10 public stocks that

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,600
anybody could invest in? What's the

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
philosophy towards investing that will

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,759
make one rich over time? And then if I

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
want to invest in AI, how should I be

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,880
investing my money? According to our

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,680
research, these investments will go up

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,000
more than 10fold in the next 5 to 10

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,799
years and create incredible

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
opportunities for investors. So, number

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
one,

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,720
this has always blown my mind a little

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,880
bit. 53% of you that listen to the show

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,720
regularly haven't yet subscribed to the

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
show. So, could I ask you for a favor

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
before we start? If you like the show

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
and you like what we do here and you

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
want to support us, the free simple way

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
that you can do just that is by hitting

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
the subscribe button. And my commitment

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,759
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
everything in my power, me and my team,

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,040
to make sure that this show is better

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,800
for you every single week. We'll listen

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
to your feedback. We'll find the guests

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
that you want me to speak to and we'll

62
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,060
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
much.

64
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,360
[Music]

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,440
Kathy Wood, is there a woman on planet

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Earth that manages more money from an

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,400
investing capacity than you? Well,

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,440
there's probably not someone overseeing,

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,519
yes, nearly $30

70
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,959
billion. Uh, but I know there are teams

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
out there, including women, that manage

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,519
maybe a lot more than that. What is it

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,800
that you do? invest in companies that

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
are going to that are technologically

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,200
enabled and that that are going to

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
transform the world as we know it.

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Robotics,

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,440
energy storage, artificial

79
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,159
intelligence, blockchain technology, and

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,959
multiomic sequencing in the life science

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
space. The last is the most complicated.

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,879
And how long have you been an investor?

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,920
I started when I was 20 years old at a

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,879
company called Capital Group and I was

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,200
introduced to the firm by Art Laugher.

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,120
Now Art Laugher, he's one of the most

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
important economists of our time. He

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,760
created something called the Laffer

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,519
Curve. He's advised most presidents

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,560
since President Nixon and he's advising

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,720
President Trump as well. And how is

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
these five big innovation platforms that

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,879
you speak of, how is that going to have

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,480
an impact on the average person's life?

95
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,120
Like why do they need to know this

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,920
stuff? How is it going to change their

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,680
decision-m and change their career?

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,280
Now that the world is moving so quickly

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,599
into this new world uh and Bitcoin has

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,120
become uh so successful an investment

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,280
many people are trying to figure out

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,319
okay how how do I get involved with the

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,920
new world and when I say get on the

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,319
right side of change we think there's

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,599
going to be a lot of disruption to the

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,600
traditional world order when I say that

107
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,320
in terms of people understanding What I

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,360
mean? I think many people think Apple is

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,440
a very safe investment because huge

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,000
hoarde of cash, very successful

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,479
smartphone, you know, number one market

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,320
share of smartphones in terms of

113
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,919
profitability by far. And yet we can

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,639
tell you and this was one of what's

115
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,639
called the mag six that led the stock

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,800
market over the last few years. The top

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,080
six stocks the top six stocks the market

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,600
was very narrowly focused on this ilk of

119
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,320
stock. And we were saying you know what

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,360
Apple is probably going to be disrupted

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,680
by artificial intelligence. And one of

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,400
the reasons we started asking questions

123
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,280
very early is what is the ultimate

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,560
mobile device? Ultimately, it's going to

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,320
be an autonomous

126
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,880
vehicle. Apple should have been all over

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
that and they were trying and we saw one

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,880
management turnover after another. This

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,280
is an AI project and what we were

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,000
learning as they were turning that team

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,320
over uh time and again is they they

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
weren't getting AI right. They were not

133
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,479
positioning correctly. Your concern for

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,320
Apple? I think Apple it has so much

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,479
cash. It has such a loyal customer base.

136
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,240
uh it will be fine but maybe it's

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,320
revenue growth has slowed to almost

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,639
nothing and so maybe it'll be a mature

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,720
cash cow that's not what we do we invest

140
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,960
in technologically enabled disruptive

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,360
innovation AI is the biggest dis

142
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,440
technological disruption in history and

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
if they're not going to get it right

144
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,919
we're not going to be there so if I want

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,360
to invest in AI if I agree with you

146
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,800
Kathy and I said you know I think I

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
think you're right that AI is the

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,919
biggest technological wave coming into

149
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,800
shore and the biggest opportunity h how

150
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,080
should I be investing my money in in in

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
your view how are you investing your

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
money to capitalize on AI many people

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,560
used to invest in AI through one stock

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,280
that was Nvidia that was the check the

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,479
box I own the GPU the chip manufacturer

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,000
which is the most important uh chip

157
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:48,560
manufacturer in the AI age and its

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,240
valuation meaning its uh price relative

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,880
to earnings um really got up to very

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,680
heady levels and we were saying at the

161
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,000
time well if Nvidia's valuation is

162
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,440
correct there there there are going to

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,840
be a lot of other winners who are they

164
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,199
uh well our largest position and the

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,199
flagship strategy ARK is Tesla and as we

166
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,759
were trying to help people understand

167
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,880
why we were swapping away from Nvidia to

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,800
stocks like Tesla and Palunteer which is

169
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,720
a software provider. Um we were trying

170
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,919
to explain that this new world around AI

171
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,680
is going to happen very quickly and uh

172
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,360
Tesla is the largest AI project on

173
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,400
earth. Uh I posted that on X and Elon

174
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,960
liked it. So it must be

175
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,880
true. But it is true if our research is

176
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,080
correct. Uh we believe that um the

177
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,160
entire ecosystem associated with

178
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,919
autonomous uh taxi networks is going to

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,639
be worth 8 to10 trillion dollars in

180
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,039
terms of revenue generation in the next

181
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,479
5 to 10 years. And if you want to put

182
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,520
that in context, the the entire GDP of

183
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,400
the world today is about 130 trillion.

184
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,240
So 10 trillion is going to move the

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,240
needle. Tesla are launching their first

186
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,360
cyber taxi, I believe, in Austin in June

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,360
potentially. Yes, it so the Cyber Cabs

188
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,879
will launch next year, but in Austin in

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,120
June, those will be Model Y's. and I'm

190
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,000
looking to buy another Model Y because

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,080
it will in effect be a cyber cab. Okay?

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,200
And if I chose to, I could have my Model

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Y drive me to work and then let it out

194
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
for the day and earn money on it, have

195
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
it pick me up at the end of the night.

196
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
And some people will do that. And Tesla

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
will provide the platform for that. I

198
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
think a lot of people don't realize just

199
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,519
how much of the economy is about

200
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,279
driving. Yes. So taxis, deliveries,

201
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,320
these kinds of things. It's a hu is it

202
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,680
the single I think it's the single

203
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,839
biggest employer in the world. Yes.

204
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,320
Transportation broadly defined. Yes. And

205
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,040
and it's not just on the ground of

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,440
course. Uh as we've studied uh

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,200
autonomous taxis uh moving forward uh we

208
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,760
believe the cost of transportation will

209
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,480
come down fairly dramatically. So, uh,

210
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:31,920
in the US today, an Uber costs roughly

211
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,160
$2 to4 per mile. Mhm. Um, at scale. Now,

212
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,480
this may not be for 5 to 10 years, but

213
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,720
this is the direction that Tesla

214
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,519
certainly is headed. Uh, we believe that

215
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Tesla will be able to offer a service

216
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:49,120
for 25 cents per mile. And because of

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
that, we think there will be much more

218
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,880
congestion in the roads. When you cut

219
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,080
the price of something, you get more of

220
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,720
it. Yeah. And that led us into the air.

221
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,519
And so we've been stud studying EV

222
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,200
talls. Um what's an EV tool? EV tall is

223
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,760
an electric vehicle takeoff and landing

224
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
like a drone type. A drone but for for

225
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,760
people. Yeah. So we own Archer in our

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,959
portfolio. And of course AI is a part of

227
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,480
this new world as well. Um, and it's a

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:24,959
part of the defense world as well as we

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,279
are trying to save our soldiers and um,

230
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,040
and move out there with autonomous

231
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:34,079
drones. So, autonomous uh, mobility on

232
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,839
the ground, in the skies, ultimately on

233
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,279
the water. So, so Tesla, so that's one

234
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,880
big we we think that's going to be the

235
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,800
biggest in the short term in terms of

236
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,120
revenue generation. The biggest

237
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,200
application of AI. We think the most

238
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,640
profound application of AI is going to

239
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,160
be in healthcare because of AI and this

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,120
is already beginning to happen. uh we

241
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,399
are able to

242
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,640
diagnose cancer with a blood test in

243
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
stage

244
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,200
one. Think about that. If you discover

245
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,200
cancer in stage one, you can save most

246
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,880
people, right? And maybe even before

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:24,160
stage one. Why? This is the convergence

248
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,720
of sequencing technologies. So DNA, RNA,

249
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,760
protein sequencing

250
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,760
uh technologies and then the third uh

251
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,640
technology that is breakthrough and

252
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,600
already making a difference is crisper

253
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,279
gene editing. The convergence of those

254
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,720
three technologies is beginning to cure

255
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,880
disease. So, uh, a company called

256
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,519
Crisper Therapeutics, which is one of

257
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,240
the largest in our ARKG fund and in the

258
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:02,079
top 10 in our ARK fund, uh, has

259
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:05,519
developed a therapy uh, to cure sickle

260
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,480
cell disease with and betthalmia. Both

261
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,440
of those are blood related diseases with

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,200
one treatment. Think about that. Now,

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
the preconditioning for that is

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,240
gruesome. It's it's it involves it's

265
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,720
almost like chemotherapy which is going

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
to change. Uh but nonetheless there's

267
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,399
huge demand for it because you know

268
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,920
these people go to the emergency room 10

269
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,279
to 20 times per year for blood

270
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,480
transfusions to save their lives. Of

271
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,800
course they're going to go through a

272
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,959
tough regimen. They want to live a more

273
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
normal life. Uh so it's already

274
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,120
generating revenue. Both both of those

275
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
are already generating revenue for

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,760
Crisper Therapeutics and a company

277
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,560
called Vert.Ex. So there's there's well

278
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
there's three or four different

279
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,240
companies you've mentioned here. Tesla,

280
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
the other one was Archer. Archer is the

281
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,160
EV tall company. Yes. Which is your

282
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
flying cars, basically your drone cars.

283
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,639
Yes. And Chrisper and Tesla. So if I

284
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,720
start with Tesla, you were bullish on

285
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,320
Tesla. You were making big predictions

286
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
about Tesla before pretty much anyone

287
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,839
else out there. I think in 2015. Mhm.

288
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
And at the time in 2015, you said that

289
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,800
you believed the stock would get above

290
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,399
4,000 roughly right on the old stock.

291
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,760
Yeah. On the before the stock split. And

292
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,920
you were right by some significant

293
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
margin. Um I think you predicted it

294
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,959
would be 4,000 before the stock stock

295
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,720
splits. And I think at its peak that

296
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,160
equates to about 18,000 maybe 12,000 at

297
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,360
its peak. Yes. Well, in that region, we

298
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,959
we we were right about two early years

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,720
or Tesla was got to where we believed it

300
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:48,240
would go two years before most expected.

301
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,760
You know, in 2018 and 19, many people,

302
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,320
as Elon was des discussing and

303
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,040
describing production hell for the Model

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,279
3, um, many people thought the company

305
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:06,399
would go bankrupt. And uh and yet we

306
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:10,600
knew that if Elon Musk could create a

307
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,800
reusable rocket that could land on a

308
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,000
barge in the water, he would be able to

309
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,000
figure out how to produce at scale the

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,279
Model 3. That was to us a simple um

311
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,959
conclusion. Now as in hindsight as we're

312
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,040
learning from Tesla production hell and

313
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,880
they themselves were worried that's why

314
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Elon slept on the floor in the

315
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
production factory and just became

316
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,279
maniacally involved which is how he

317
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,920
works uh as uh so yes and now our

318
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,920
prediction the stock is I'm not going to

319
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,480
be exactly right on this 270 280 uh

320
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,639
dollars uh our prediction in five years

321
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,120
is 2600

322
00:14:52,639 --> 00:15:00,639
And 90% of that valuation comes not from

323
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:05,199
the electric vehicle but from this robo

324
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:08,800
taxi platform. Uh because the electric

325
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,360
car if you think about it is you know a

326
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
one-shot sale. You know sell and hope

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
they come back when they're replacing

328
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,959
their car. This essentially means that

329
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,320
we'll be driving cars that we can click

330
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,399
a button and then then it becomes an

331
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,880
autonomous taxi. So I go on holiday, I

332
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,639
have my my Tesla car at my house. When I

333
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
go on holiday, the car turns into a taxi

334
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,160
and starts chauffeering people around.

335
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
It makes me money. But also from the

336
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,600
consumer's perspective that are trying

337
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,440
to hail a taxi. At any point I can go on

338
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
my Tesla app, I press a button, a

339
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,480
autonomous car comes to me with no one

340
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
driving it and it takes me to my

341
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
destination with no driver at all.

342
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,720
Right. Um and then the recurring revenue

343
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,839
model I believe is you sub you

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,839
subscribe. It probably could it it could

345
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,639
be a sub you could subscribe to the

346
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,000
network or they could uh you know maybe

347
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,360
it could be either or subscription or

348
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,959
allocart if you don't think you're going

349
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,040
to use it that much. So now when I'm

350
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,000
here in the UK and Europe many people do

351
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,279
not believe what what you just said and

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,040
and they don't because your regulators

353
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,320
have not allowed FSD here. I think they

354
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,800
might I somewhere in Europe I think

355
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,800
they're beginning to consider it. Maybe

356
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,759
even in the UK here they have are

357
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,680
considering it. Um in St. Petersburg,

358
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:37,120
Florida where we're based, um I can go

359
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,360
from my house to anywhere and flawlessly

360
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,959
the car will take me there. Now, we

361
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,720
still have to sit in the driver's seat

362
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,000
for now, but in June,

363
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,959
uh, or soon thereafter, when they turn

364
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,600
the system on, if regulators permit,

365
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,199
right now we're state byst state. I

366
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,199
think that's going to change so that

367
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,000
we'll have federal regulations so that

368
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,440
this can happen a lot faster. One other

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,480
thing about Tesla though in that 2600 uh

370
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:12,240
dollar number, we do not include much

371
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,919
for humanoid robots. Now I this and and

372
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,959
this is happening faster than we

373
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,959
thought. Um h and the reason it's

374
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,880
happening faster is humanoid

375
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,799
robots they are the convergence of the

376
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,760
same three technologies or innovation

377
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:33,280
platforms as robo

378
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,679
taxis robots robotics so actuators and

379
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,600
so forth getting them to work energy

380
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,400
storage battery operated and AI

381
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,480
so Tesla is way ahead of the game on

382
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
humanoid robots and yet we have very

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,320
little. Now, Elon thinks that the

384
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,520
humanoid robot business is going to

385
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,640
dwarf the robo taxi business and we

386
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,919
think he's right. Uh, but longer term.

387
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,000
So, as I mentioned, we expect all in

388
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,960
around the world, including China, not

389
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,120
just Tesla, but the entire ecosystem, an

390
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,039
8 to uh 10 trillion dollar market uh in

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,880
the next 5 to 10 years. for humanoid

392
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:19,360
robots. Uh we expect a $26

393
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,080
trillion revenue market. Now that's

394
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,120
going to be a little further along. Uh

395
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,799
robo taxis will happen faster, but it

396
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,039
may not be as distant as we were once

397
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,440
thinking. For anyone that doesn't know,

398
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,760
humanoid robots are basically robots

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
that we'll have in our home and at work.

400
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,280
Mhm. So these are there was a video that

401
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,039
I think um Elon retweeted the other day

402
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,039
showing one of the human humanoid robots

403
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,080
dancing. Dancing. Yes. Was that real? I

404
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,000
was like looking at that video thinking

405
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,320
surely that's not real. But he confirmed

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,320
I believe that it was real. Yes. Yes.

407
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,799
Now when we went to the Cyber Cab event,

408
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,480
uh there were some humanoid robots

409
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,799
dancing there, but they were tethered

410
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,840
and they were remotely controlled. Yeah.

411
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,120
Uh now Cyber Cab, I think was about a

412
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,320
year ago. Yes. Maybe. So since then

413
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,720
they've been able to untether them and

414
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,960
uh I do believe that those that dancing

415
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,880
robot was was um not tethered and not

416
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
remotely controlled. It was quite

417
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
shocking to see a robot doing that

418
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,400
because if a robot can have that

419
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,840
dexterity and

420
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,280
mobility and then you overlay that with

421
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,679
the AI technologies that are

422
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,840
accelerating rapidly, it begs the

423
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,200
question and the question is quite clear

424
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,720
which is what about humans? Yes. Um, and

425
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,960
just to put a finer, you know, note on

426
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,640
this, um, Elon will not be satisfied

427
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,799
until these robots can thread a needle.

428
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,200
So, that's where we're going. What does

429
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,240
that mean for humans? So, you know, the

430
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,840
history of

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,360
technology is that it has been a net job

432
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,520
creator throughout history, but humanoid

433
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,640
robots are getting awfully close to what

434
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,960
we do, right? So, it's a good question.

435
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,600
I I think creativity is a big part of

436
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,760
that. Ingenuity and creativity. And, you

437
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,240
know, I think there's going to be a

438
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,559
there are going to be a lot of new

439
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,640
inventions uh in the future. So, let's

440
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,720
see what those are. But even today

441
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,080
there's something called vibe coding.

442
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,039
Have you heard of it? Okay. Because

443
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,640
we've moved into the world of natural

444
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,919
language programming. What is vibe

445
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,600
coding for someone that doesn't know?

446
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,000
It's vibe coding means you know a

447
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,320
natural language. I know we all know a

448
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,280
natural language. Ours is English for

449
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,159
the most part but could be any language.

450
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,240
Um, we're going to be able to go to

451
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,000
chatgbt or to especially now they just

452
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,880
launched I think last week something

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,480
called codeex replet uh and anthropics

454
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,480
fantastic for for um programming and

455
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
we'll say this is what I'm attempting to

456
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,080
do in English language and and I've seen

457
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,240
demos of this just internally we we're

458
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,720
going to replace some of our software

459
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,360
that we're buying from outsiders and

460
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,320
customize it for us because, you know,

461
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,080
we don't have to buy offtheshelf

462
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,799
anymore, one sizefits-all. I think

463
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,120
there's going to be a lot more

464
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:29,440
customization and personalization and

465
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
creativity explosion here. You know,

466
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,600
it's interesting that this is happening

467
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,520
when the demographic profile of the

468
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,320
developed world is as it is. We have a

469
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,000
very low unemployment rate in the US. I

470
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,880
know the unemployment rates in Europe

471
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
and the UK have been dropping. to much

472
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,559
lower levels than where where they were

473
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,159
stuck for years. I remember thinking,

474
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:55,440
"Wow, double digits." Uh we have a

475
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,640
demographic issue. I mean, if you if you

476
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,039
watch what uh Elon Musk worries about

477
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
the most, he he worries about the

478
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,640
population implosion

479
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,679
uh because collapse collapse in

480
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,880
population in the developed world um

481
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,520
because we're not uh u we're not

482
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,240
producing children above the fertility

483
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,559
rate. We're we are setting up for a

484
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,840
shrinkage with China is going there,

485
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,840
Japan is going there. And so we're going

486
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,760
to need productivity

487
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,720
uh productivity to help us if we can't

488
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,320
find human

489
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,400
beings. Uh okay. So you're so you're

490
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
saying that the robotics and AI could

491
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,600
actually fill the gap that we lose in

492
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,520
terms of productivity because our

493
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
society is going to be like an inverted

494
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
pyramid. It's going to be more um

495
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
elderly people and less young people.

496
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,240
Yes. Yes. So the robots are going to

497
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,640
Yes. Absolutely. It's productivity is

498
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,880
going to be essential. So, as we're

499
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,520
looking at real growth ahead and when

500
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,960
you think about real growth,

501
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,400
uh you should be thinking, okay,

502
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,559
somebody's benefiting from this. Um, and

503
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,120
I'm going to set what I I'm going to set

504
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,919
up the number here, uh, by describing

505
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,640
what has happened historically. If you

506
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,120
look from 1500 to

507
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,080
1900 and you try and figure out what

508
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,320
real GDP growth was back then, real

509
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,120
economic growth, um, as best as uh,

510
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Brett Winton, our chief futurist in

511
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,159
consultation with academics can

512
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:39,520
determine, it was roughly

513
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:43,280
0.6% per year. And then we had the

514
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,200
industrial revolution. Uh we had the

515
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,960
internal combustion engine, telephone,

516
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:54,360
electricity. And for the past 125 years,

517
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:59,200
real GDP growth has been

518
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:02,000
3%. And and most li living standards

519
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,640
have gone up over time. Some more than

520
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,799
others. I know that's a debate, but most

521
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,320
have gone up.

522
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,120
If we as we look forward based on the

523
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,760
five innovation platforms around which

524
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,520
we have centered our research and

525
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,520
investing, if we're right, real GDP

526
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,440
growth in the next five years could

527
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:27,440
accelerate to

528
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:31,279
7.3%. And that gives you a sense of uh

529
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,880
the economic e uh activity wealth

530
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:38,400
generation out there. And what when we

531
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,679
are presenting to investors, we are

532
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,039
actually presenting to them not only

533
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,600
because they're investors, but because

534
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,159
they have children or grandchildren who

535
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,400
need to adapt to this new world. And our

536
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,919
mantra in giving away our research,

537
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,840
which we do, is get on the right side of

538
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:03,120
change. We also do podcasts. Um we we

539
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,720
try we do a lot of outreach because we

540
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,600
think this is a very important moment in

541
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,559
time. Uh seize the moment grab hold of

542
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,120
these new technologies because that

543
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,200
growth rate is more than twice where

544
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
we've been. And if you are on the right

545
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,520
side of change, we think the

546
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,919
opportunities are going to be enormous.

547
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,559
Uh investment opportunities and job

548
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,279
opportunities. Yeah. I I feel like I've

549
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,279
I feel like

550
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:36,799
um I feel like I can't figure out what

551
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,279
how the displacement rate meets the

552
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,080
creation rate. So the destruction rate

553
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,240
of of current jobs will meet the

554
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,480
creation rate of new jobs because many

555
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
of these new jobs I I guess there's some

556
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
of them we can't predict yet. I

557
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,000
understand that. But even the ones that

558
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,679
we can't predict yet would need to be

559
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,159
inherently human i.e.

560
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,000
need the skills of a human for them to

561
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,440
be occupied by by humans. Um, so what

562
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
category of stuff is that? Like my my

563
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,799
girlfriend's a breath work practitioner.

564
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,559
She's upstairs now with 10 women and

565
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,559
she's teaching them breath work. Okay.

566
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,000
So she's fine. Yeah. Like cuz they're

567
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,240
doing that in person. What? Whatever.

568
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,799
She's fine. Well, and maybe she's not if

569
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,159
people decide to do it on. Yeah. On

570
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:24,559
chachi. But but if they want to be with

571
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:28,080
a group of women Yeah. and you know

572
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,640
learn from an expert whom they respect.

573
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,400
There's as much the social experience

574
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,240
that's going to become more important.

575
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,880
Relationships are going to become more

576
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,480
important. Many people in our business I

577
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,200
think are going to be out of jobs

578
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,440
because uh the business has become

579
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,120
really nothing I I shouldn't be this

580
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,480
disrespectful and it's not not quite

581
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,279
right but uh at all uh but you know so

582
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,400
many are just hugging benchmarks

583
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:02,240
uh whether it's S&P 500 or MCI world or

584
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,400
the NASDAQ that a machine can do that a

585
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,880
machine can do that easily and that is

586
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,320
what passive investing is is machines

587
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,720
doing it. I think in order to earn a

588
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,840
place in the new world, you've got to

589
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,000
add a lot of value, more value than a

590
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,200
machine can. So, in our case, we're

591
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,760
saying, okay, well, our stocks are not

592
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,679
in those benchmarks. Uh, and

593
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,760
therefore, you know, they're they're we

594
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
are doing original research trying to

595
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
figure out who they are and where they

596
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,320
are. these these companies that are

597
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,559
going to transform the world. Why can't

598
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
AI replace what you're doing in terms of

599
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,200
so and we think about that all the time.

600
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,720
So

601
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,120
AI

602
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,480
can use pattern recognition. It's all

603
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,760
based on history, right? Uh it can use

604
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,480
pattern recognition maybe to do what

605
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,200
we're doing. What are the three

606
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,240
characteristics that define an

607
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,520
innovation platform for us? The most

608
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,720
important one is they follow something

609
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,880
called rights law which measures the

610
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,320
learning curve. How fast the costs are

611
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,240
going to decline with this new

612
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,640
technology. Technology is deflationary.

613
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
Costs fall over time and they're passed

614
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,640
through into lower prices or better

615
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,279
performance one or the other. Um that is

616
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,440
the most important. A machine can figure

617
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,559
that out I'm sure. But asking the

618
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:38,080
questions are going to be important.

619
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:42,000
Like there wasn't before 2014 when we

620
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,919
started arc much on autonomous mobility

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,440
or EV talls or for that matter AI. AI

622
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,600
had become science fiction. There

623
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
weren't any breakthroughs in recent

624
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,120
years but then we got some

625
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,640
breakthroughs. So could so rights law is

626
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
the first figure out that cost curve

627
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,880
decline and and see how quickly the

628
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,919
technology can prolificate uh

629
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:08,039
proliferate across sectors. That's the

630
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:11,600
other criteria criterion here. The

631
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:14,159
technologies that we are following are

632
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,399
going to cut across economic sectors and

633
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:22,240
apply uh to more than one group of

634
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,799
people. And then the third is that these

635
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,360
technologies serve as launching pads for

636
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:31,480
new technologies. So in the case of DNA

637
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,440
sequencing, which was the base

638
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,159
technology, we needed that before

639
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,640
crisper gene editing uh could be

640
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,720
created. We needed to be able to

641
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,039
understand what was mutating in the

642
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,399
genome, where the programming errors

643
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,600
were so that gene editing could come in

644
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,200
and edit out those programming errors.

645
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,039
And do you think in five 10 years from

646
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,039
now that unemployment is going to be

647
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,200
higher or lower?

648
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,279
In five or 10 years,

649
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,600
um let's let's assume we don't have a

650
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,520
policy mistake and and a recession. So

651
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:15,840
just just steady state I think it will

652
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:19,039
be the same or lower and most of this is

653
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,039
because those baby boomers are retiring.

654
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,960
Uh so they come out of the employ they

655
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:28,080
come out of the labor force and uh and

656
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,840
the generations following them are

657
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,399
smaller. Even now what's happening is uh

658
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,640
we're we're passing through the baby

659
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,039
boom echo meaning the children of the

660
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,720
baby boom that cohort

661
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:45,200
was I don't think it was any bigger than

662
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,039
the baby boom uh the baby boom

663
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,320
population. Do you think there's because

664
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,159
of the speed of and the acceleration of

665
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,679
AI the like just the the length of

666
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,120
careers has radically reduced because

667
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
you would go to like you would go to

668
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,200
school then you go to university you

669
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,200
qualify as I don't know an accountant

670
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,320
and that's like a 10 15 year process you

671
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
get a job as an accountant you start

672
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
working your way up but now with AI

673
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,120
coming in these some of these jobs are

674
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,200
being completely

675
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,600
annihilated extremely quickly at the

676
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,240
same time vibe coding yeah is booming.

677
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
So I think what's going to happen and

678
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,520
this will be very healthy for

679
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,520
productivity. We're going to have a lot

680
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,880
more experimentation and people taking

681
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,679
risks on themselves. Uh and maybe this

682
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,720
idea of a corporation as we know it is

683
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,200
going to change radically. You know

684
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,919
crypto is enabling distributed

685
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,080
autonomous organizations.

686
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:48,799
uh just like Bitcoin there's there's no

687
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:52,559
no one governing it right uh that it's a

688
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:57,200
distributed network and you know let's

689
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:01,840
see how these do and how vibe co coding

690
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,200
and AI integrate into the crypto I and

691
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,480
I'm going to stop calling it crypto

692
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,440
because it's really should be called

693
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,760
digital assets world which legitimizes

694
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,919
it more crypto sounds nefarious

695
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,880
digital assets is where you know more

696
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:19,440
than young people and I'll say young

697
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,880
people are spending more than half of

698
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,960
their discretionary their free time

699
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,000
online and so property ownership online

700
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,320
is becoming more important it's it's

701
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,159
being legitimized by the way people are

702
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,840
spending their time on this point of

703
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,600
robotics and AI your your biggest

704
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,559
position I believe is Tesla isn't it in

705
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,760
your fund yes um but obviously Elon

706
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,080
decided Ed that he wanted to go into

707
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,519
politics and he wanted to do oh Elon the

708
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,440
department of government efficiency

709
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,840
called Doge. So teaming up with Trump to

710
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,399
try and eliminate government waste. Now

711
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:58,320
as an investor Mhm. you

712
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:00,399
must not love that. Well I I have two um

713
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,760
I have because it did impact two points

714
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,279
of view performance of the company. Do

715
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,679
you know I have I drive a Tesla when I

716
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,279
go to America and it was the first time

717
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,240
ever on the last trip to America in

718
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,320
January. I live in LA now um where I'm

719
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,480
driving my you know my cyber truck. It's

720
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,559
the full self-driving. It's incredible.

721
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,880
But it was the first time ever I thought

722
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,799
I like I could be attacked. So I

723
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,159
probably shouldn't get a cyber truck. I

724
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,279
should probably get something else cuz I

725
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,120
heard of all these reports of people

726
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,480
being attacked. And so it was quite

727
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,480
interesting to hear in the earnings

728
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
report which I listened to that there's

729
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
been this decline in revenue um in

730
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,679
profitability in vehicle sales growth

731
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,600
etc. in Q1 of this year which I think

732
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,720
even Elon in that in that earnings call

733
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,840
highlights is a consequence of him

734
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:48,559
becoming political. Yes. Uh I think that

735
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,960
surprised him. Um so I have many

736
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,360
thoughts about this. Our government has

737
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,799
become so bloated. It is scary and uh

738
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,440
our indebtedness is growing. And if we

739
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,000
want to remain the reserve currency of

740
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,919
the world, we're at risk of of losing

741
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,079
it. And and on our tail is the whole

742
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,359
digital asset world, right? So, um,

743
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,639
government spending is taxation. It's

744
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,879
either taxation that's going to happen

745
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,800
immediately or will happen in the future

746
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,000
or will happen through inflation, which

747
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,919
is the most regressive tax at all. So I

748
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,839
think his that the the sentiment was was

749
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,399
right in terms of you know getting in

750
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,839
there and seeing what technology can do

751
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,639
for the government which is really

752
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,599
what's happening. I'm watching it in the

753
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:45,440
FDA how they're starting to use AI. It's

754
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,200
phenomenal what's happening. Uh so the

755
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,159
question I usually get so I I'm very

756
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,159
happy that ha half of the solution is

757
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,079
understanding the problem that someone

758
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,040
is in there with that focus and

759
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,480
determination. He of course has said

760
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,400
he's stepping away uh this month as a

761
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,320
matter of fact to spend more time with

762
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,160
his companies which you must be happy

763
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,359
about. Well, of course I'm happy about

764
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,640
it, but I I have with the exception of

765
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,160
this political dynamic, I don't think

766
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,599
that Elon uh not being there on a

767
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,920
day-to-day basis is what has caused the

768
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,480
problem in the first quarter. It was

769
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,040
much more macro. We had a negative

770
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,359
quarter in real GDP growth in the first

771
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,720
quarter. So macro which is hitting

772
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,520
everyone and the overlay of this

773
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,040
political dynamic the news cycle thank

774
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,119
goodness moves fast and so we'll we'll

775
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,520
be through that I think and by the way

776
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,160
there are news reports even this weekend

777
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:54,160
saying those who were feeling about him

778
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,880
you know as it relates to Doge and you

779
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,440
know one party are having a change of

780
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,000
heart because tax rates are going to

781
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,400
come down because we're being more

782
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
disciplined on the on the government

783
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:13,599
spending side. Elon's way

784
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,480
of managing his companies is to attract

785
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,599
the best and the brightest not only

786
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,280
scientists, engineers but also business

787
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,280
people. Uh they these are people who

788
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
want to solve the hardest problems in

789
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,960
the world.

790
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:34,760
um he sets a timeline that seems uh

791
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:38,560
reasonable to him for milestones to

792
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,800
occur and he doesn't interfere unless

793
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,520
they start missing those milestones or

794
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,839
the timing of those milestones. Then he

795
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,839
gets involved and that's where you hear

796
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,520
he'll go in and he'll just fire people

797
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,320
wholesale and you know and and you know

798
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,280
get the program going again. And he's

799
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,520
he's done that certainly at Tesla. He's

800
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,800
done that at all of his companies. And

801
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,560
so he's really troubleshooter in chief.

802
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,320
Once he understands and has set a

803
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,160
strategy, he then becomes troubleshooter

804
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,040
chief. Have you met him? Oh, yes, we

805
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,240
did. Actually, our uh first podcast with

806
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,839
him was in 2019. Oh, I saw that during

807
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,200
during production hell. Yeah. And uh we

808
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,280
were so happy. So, as you know, we have

809
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
a social strategy. So, we push our

810
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,160
research out through social media as we

811
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:36,079
give it away or as we're evolving it.

812
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:39,599
And uh he liked a piece of research that

813
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,079
Tasha Keiny had put out on autonomous

814
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,760
back then. And I was on a phone call. I

815
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,440
couldn't get off, but I heard this

816
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,160
whooping and screaming through the

817
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,400
office. And I I I thought it sounded

818
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,160
good. It wasn't an emergency, so I I

819
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,560
didn't have to leave that call. But I

820
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,320
got out. I said, "What happened, Elon?"

821
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,640
And I said, "Okay, ask him if we can do

822
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,800
a podcast." And we were there the next

823
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,359
week. Oh, incredible. Yeah. What do you

824
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,079
think of him as an entrepreneur? I think

825
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,599
he's the Thomas Edison of our age in

826
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,640
terms of uh in terms of his

827
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,320
um in innovative

828
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,119
ingenuity.

829
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,839
And I also think having met him a number

830
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,400
of times, I think he's a very good

831
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,320
person. He wants to do the right thing.

832
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,920
If I had to say one thing, he wants to

833
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:36,400
do the right thing to transform the lot

834
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,599
of most of humanity. And he started

835
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,960
uh w with Tesla, SpaceX and Tesla. SP

836
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:46,160
Tesla, you know, was a an environmental

837
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,200
move, which I think a lot of people

838
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,200
attacking his cars, who are probably

839
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,480
very um supportive of the environmental

840
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,960
movement, uh they they've forgotten

841
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,720
sending a a rocket to Mars and with

842
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,359
humanoid robots and ultimately people um

843
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,599
he thinks will

844
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,359
transform life on Earth as well Because

845
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,359
as we've learned from space history, uh

846
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,079
what we learn about material science and

847
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:24,480
technologies that help us break through

848
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,359
into these very difficult or problems to

849
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
solve is going to help us here on earth

850
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,280
as well. Uh so I think he's a very good

851
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,359
person and wants to do the right thing

852
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,440
that if I had to describe him that's

853
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,119
what I say other than genius of our

854
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,560
time.

855
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
I often wonder I you know because he's

856
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,359
had such a profound impact on the world

857
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,680
in many many ways through the companies

858
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,760
he started. I think the uh the biggest

859
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,400
risk really is just his own his own

860
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
health. He doesn't seem to sleep much

861
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,359
you know though he he says that he does

862
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,040
sleep. I think he he he he recommends I

863
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,839
think if I'm right on this getting seven

864
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:05,079
hours sleep a night. Uh uh and yes but

865
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:09,359
when when he is

866
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:12,400
focused you know it I mean people even

867
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,920
look they they there were many pictures

868
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,960
of him whether it was standing you know

869
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,800
with other policy makers and then he

870
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,520
zones into something and you know he's

871
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,240
zoned in and thinking about only that

872
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,760
and a problem that he wants to solve. So

873
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,079
you've invested what? Just over two

874
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,960
billion in Tesla. Let's see. So it would

875
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,920
be roughly Yes. In that region. Mhm.

876
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,760
Bitcoin. Mhm. You invested in Bitcoin

877
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,000
very very early. What was the the first

878
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,560
price what that you bought Bitcoin for

879
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,320
in I think it was 2015.

880
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes. It was in um the summer of 2015. Uh

881
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,800
we got in at roughly

882
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,040
$250. Uh today it's

883
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:03,319
$104,000 I think roughly. So we did get

884
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:06,480
in very early and we knew we were on to

885
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,480
something really when people were making

886
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,480
fun of us saying okay that's a marketing

887
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
trick. You're you're new to our business

888
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,160
and you know new to our to the new fund

889
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,319
world and uh you're trying to attract

890
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,160
attention. And we were thinking wow they

891
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,440
have no idea how much research we've

892
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,040
done on this. and Art Laugher,

893
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:31,520
uh, my professor again from USC, we had

894
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,560
him, uh, we had him read our first white

895
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,640
paper on Bitcoin. Bitcoin, could it

896
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,599
serve the three roles of money? So means

897
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,000
of exchange, what we use every day uh to

898
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,599
to buy

899
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,640
things, store of value, uh like gold,

900
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,520
and unit of account, would prices be

901
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,480
quoted in terms of Bitcoin? Chris

902
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,599
Berniski was our first analyst on

903
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,040
Bitcoin, wrote the paper, art

904
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:05,440
read, and you know, from added to it

905
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,440
enormously in terms of economic theory,

906
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,920
which was great for us.

907
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,400
And then he said to us, he said, "This

908
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,040
is what I've been waiting for since the

909
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,440
US closed the gold window in

910
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,920
1971. A

911
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,319
rules-based

912
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,520
global monetary system like Bretton

913
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,920
Woods under the gold exchange

914
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,920
standard." And I said, "Art, that's a

915
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,079
very big

916
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,240
idea. How big is it?" and he said,

917
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,359
'Well, how big is the the monetary base

918
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:44,079
of the US? Back then it was 4 and a.5

919
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:48,160
trillion and Bitcoin's market cap or

920
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,280
network value was 6 billion. And I said,

921
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,040
"Okay, that's a very big idea." And we

922
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,400
were trying to get it into our

923
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,599
portfolios. regulators were hesitant and

924
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,880
uh but I bought it right then for for

925
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,400
myself and haven't sold it and I'm very

926
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
happy with it. You bought it for

927
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,359
yourself personally personally because

928
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,680
we couldn't buy it

929
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:13,280
$250. So, we couldn't buy it back then,

930
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,880
but we finally got through the

931
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,040
regulatory process and we were able to

932
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,040
put the New York Stock Exchange said,

933
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,880
"Okay, you can put a 1% position in the

934
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,800
portfolio and it was of a grantor trust

935
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
called

936
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,560
GBTC." So, we did and we just never sold

937
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,839
it. They didn't tell us we had to keep

938
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,880
it at se at 1%. So, Oh, it's risen to be

939
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,480
more than Yes, it it ballooned. And what

940
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,119
is it about Bitcoin that you believe was

941
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,440
and is still a a good investment

942
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:51,280
opportunity for the average person? Yes.

943
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,960
So at this at this price it's about a $2

944
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,119
trillion

945
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,640
uh market cap and so halfway to that

946
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,000
original $4.5 trillion. But our price

947
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:08,160
target actually has expanded since then.

948
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,680
Um because it's not just a global

949
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,599
monetary system. It is a new asset

950
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,720
class. And that's a very big idea as

951
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,640
well. What makes a new asset class? And

952
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,280
we haven't had one truly since uh

953
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,880
equities in the 1600s. When you say a

954
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,000
new asset class, you mean a completely

955
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,640
new category of of funding companies.

956
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,079
Yes. Right. And so an asset class would

957
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,640
be something like technology is an asset

958
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,079
class, right? No, it would be like

959
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,920
stocks, bonds,

960
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,920
commodities, real

961
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,520
estate. This is a new asset class and

962
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,680
most people will agree with that. We we

963
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:55,040
did a study on it. If this asset does

964
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:58,359
not perform like other assets, in other

965
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:03,160
words, it provides diversification for

966
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:05,599
funds and because it is behaving

967
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,400
differently, institutions have to

968
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,839
consider it uh because they're competing

969
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,119
against each other and if one puts it

970
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,359
in, they all know they're competing

971
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,839
against each other. So others have to

972
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:23,200
consider it. And uh we believe that part

973
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,400
of the opportunity has not been tapped.

974
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:30,640
And just to put some numbers on this,

975
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,920
right now we're approaching 20 million

976
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,319
Bitcoin outstanding, which means the

977
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,319
number of Bitcoin that uh have been

978
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:43,520
minted over time

979
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,680
uh by Bitcoin miners. So there's 21

980
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,520
million in total, right? There will be

981
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,960
at the end of the minting process

982
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:59,160
21 million. So we have only 1 million to

983
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:02,560
go. Yeah. Uh 1 million would be what is

984
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,400
that? That would be a hundred billion

985
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,240
dollar worth a little more than that

986
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,520
right now. So, just for someone that

987
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,480
might not know much about Bitcoin,

988
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,400
Bitcoin is mined using computers and so

989
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,960
far they've mined 20 million of them and

990
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,400
there's 1 million of them left to mine.

991
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,119
Yeah. So,

992
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,880
institutions really just started

993
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:27,079
considering Bitcoin because the SEC gave

994
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:31,040
the great uh the the green light uh to

995
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:34,079
Bitcoin with uh the the approval of the

996
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,319
spot Bitcoin ETF in January of last

997
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,480
year. And it takes a while for

998
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,480
institutions to do their research and

999
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,720
and commit. Uh and so they're just now

1000
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:51,119
committing. And there's only a hundred

1001
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:55,280
billion dollar of new market cap uh that

1002
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,560
is going to be created whereas they have

1003
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,599
trillions of dollars under

1004
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:05,359
management. Um and so we think there

1005
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:08,880
will be a lot of incremental demand and

1006
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:11,359
uh to satisfy a lot of that demand

1007
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,920
someone's going to have to sell which

1008
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,480
means the price goes up which yeah if

1009
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,440
people don't want to sell because

1010
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,720
Bitcoin's been awfully good and our

1011
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,319
forecast right now it's um right now the

1012
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,560
Bitcoin is around 100

1013
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:33,720
105,000 our forecast

1014
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:37,160
uh for 2030 is $1.5

1015
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,920
million. And we do that

1016
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:43,119
uh the building blocks for that, the

1017
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,560
three biggest building blocks are

1018
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,440
institutional, we just barely

1019
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:54,400
started. Uh store of value or digital

1020
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:58,720
gold. Young people are much more uh

1021
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,040
comfortable with digital gold than gold.

1022
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,880
So on the institutional side that means

1023
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,720
institutions, investment institutions

1024
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,880
start investing in it, young people

1025
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,839
start investing it in it as a way to

1026
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,400
save and store their money. Yes. Yes.

1027
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,400
And then uh the the the

1028
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,839
the very important use case that many

1029
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,920
people do not discuss is how important

1030
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:27,040
bitcoin and stable coins which are

1031
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,800
backed by US treasuries are going to

1032
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,280
become to the emerging markets. uh in

1033
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:38,160
emerging markets, many of them are at

1034
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,480
the whim of policy makers who uh show no

1035
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,800
discipline in fiscal or monetary policy.

1036
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,880
And so they they're used to going

1037
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:50,079
through booms and busts and booms and

1038
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,000
bailed out by the IMF and they need an

1039
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,599
insurance policy. So if you're in

1040
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,640
Venezuela, you need a currency that's

1041
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:00,720
going to be stable. Exactly. Well, this

1042
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:06,400
Bitcoin is uh so stable coins are stable

1043
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,960
visav uh the dollar u Bitcoin is more of

1044
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,920
an investment

1045
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,079
because it does appreciate over time.

1046
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,599
Now you go through it's volatile no

1047
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,079
question and that's the first thing

1048
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,000
people have to know about it. Uh but it

1049
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,000
is becoming less volatile as more and

1050
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,640
more investors hold it. So, you think

1051
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,640
Bitcoin will

1052
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:32,240
potentially multiply in value by 15

1053
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,559
times in the next five years?

1054
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,680
Wow, that'd be pretty crazy. It's a very

1055
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,000
big idea because it is a new asset

1056
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,440
class. It does represent a global

1057
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,359
monetary system unlike any other digital

1058
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,400
asset out there. Um, it is backed by the

1059
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,359
largest computer network in the world.

1060
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,680
the the layer one which is the base

1061
00:49:53,359 --> 00:50:00,000
layer has not been hacked. Think about

1062
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:03,200
that since 2009 when it was released not

1063
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,520
been hacked. How many ho how many

1064
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,520
systems can say that? And it is a

1065
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,960
technology. It is native to the

1066
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,160
internet. And

1067
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,480
again digital assets or any Bitcoin,

1068
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,480
Ether,

1069
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,200
Salana, all of them exist because

1070
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,720
they're vying to be the native

1071
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,480
currencies to the internet and to to

1072
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,880
enable smart contracts and really

1073
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,920
transform the financial services

1074
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,640
industry. Why did you invest in

1075
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Coinbase?

1076
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:44,280
Coinbase is

1077
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:48,119
um an exchange for for digital

1078
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:51,800
assets and uh and increasingly

1079
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:55,119
derivatives. It has just it has gone

1080
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:59,000
global. It just bought Darabit which is

1081
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:03,040
the largest options uh exchange out

1082
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,319
there. uh and it owns a futures. So,

1083
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,480
it's really going after uh the

1084
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,640
derivatives market where there's a huge

1085
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,400
amount of activity which is fantastic

1086
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,640
because it's all legitimizing digital

1087
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:20,240
assets and it is the most regulatory

1088
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:24,400
compliant exchange in the world. Um,

1089
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,720
Binance is a another major exchange, but

1090
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,400
has had more run-ins with regulators

1091
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,760
around the world and really hasn't been

1092
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,839
allowed into the United States. It also

1093
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,359
wants to

1094
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:38,640
become part of the new payments

1095
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:41,920
infrastructure and so is evolving

1096
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,760
strategies that way as well. Um, we've

1097
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,960
gotten to know management very well.

1098
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:50,000
They fought the fight against regulators

1099
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,760
in a magnificent way and they have

1100
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,280
educated policy makers um importantly

1101
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,119
who understand that this innovation we

1102
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,800
almost lost this innovation to the rest

1103
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,480
of the world because of our regulatory

1104
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:08,319
stance. uh they've helped policy makers

1105
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,599
understand that hey you know this this

1106
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:15,200
infrastructure is what developers did

1107
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:17,040
not build in to the internet in the

1108
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,000
early 90s because they didn't know

1109
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,359
finance or commerce would take place

1110
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,960
that's all this is that simple right so

1111
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,240
if I'm trying to invest in just to

1112
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,480
summarize then if I'm trying to invest

1113
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,839
in AI that your key positions there and

1114
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,200
your key thoughts are companies like

1115
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,440
Tesla I heard you invest in Twilio. Uh

1116
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,480
we we had invested in Twilio. They had a

1117
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,599
ma they had a management turnover. So we

1118
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,480
moved away from that. But uh Palunteer

1119
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,440
Palanteer Yes. Palanteer is a platform

1120
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,599
as a service company which we think uh

1121
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,280
is not only going to help governance

1122
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,920
move governments move into the digital

1123
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,079
age like our defense department and now

1124
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,000
it's moving into other departments but

1125
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,280
also these huge huge

1126
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,280
enterprises because it's not forcing

1127
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,440
them to rip and replace anything.

1128
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,760
they'll build on top of whatever

1129
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,280
technology infrastructure is there and

1130
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,800
over time just usurp the role of the

1131
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,280
legacy technologies. So very important

1132
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,319
company we think in uh the digital age

1133
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,960
it's had a very big run. We have taken

1134
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:28,480
profits and you know while it was having

1135
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,280
a big run Nvidia was selling off it was

1136
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,079
down more than 50% so we put some of our

1137
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,079
Palunteer proceeds in back into Nvidia.

1138
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,480
Is there anything else in the AI bucket

1139
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,319
when you're thinking about stocks? Well,

1140
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,720
when you're thinking about uh chip

1141
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:49,160
companies in particular,

1142
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:52,079
uh TSM is the platform for chip

1143
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,319
manufacturing. It doesn't matter who

1144
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,200
wins. We we do think there are going to

1145
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,880
be many more competitors to Nvidia.

1146
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,839
Nvidia is still number one. Have you

1147
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,920
heard about Grock? Oh, yes. Grock we are

1148
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:08,640
invested in in our um in our private

1149
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,720
fund. Oh, okay. So, just for people that

1150
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,640
might be confused, do you mean with a Q?

1151
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,880
Oh, yes. That's that's in our private

1152
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,720
fund. We don't we do own Grock and

1153
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,119
that's a very important company on the

1154
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,720
inference side of um of the equation.

1155
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,040
I've invested in Grock as well. Yeah, I

1156
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,480
should probably disclaim that. Well, I

1157
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:31,119
think I think you're going to do very

1158
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:34,079
well. Um so TSM though is where all the

1159
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,240
chip manufacturers go uh for production.

1160
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,200
It is the most sophisticated

1161
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,440
manufacturer of chips uh in the world.

1162
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,599
Uh there is geopolitical risk there.

1163
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,319
Most of its business is in Taiwan. It is

1164
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:52,880
diversifying into uh certainly into the

1165
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,880
US and I think even into Europe. Uh so I

1166
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,559
think uh that will continue to be a very

1167
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,440
important company as well. So, what are

1168
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,960
the what are your what's your top 10 in

1169
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,119
terms of public stocks that anybody

1170
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,760
could invest in if you had to give me

1171
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,319
your top 10? So, I'd have to give you

1172
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,880
and they're listed on our website and I

1173
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,240
won't go in order, I'm sure, but of

1174
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:18,640
course Tesla, Coinbase,

1175
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:22,079
uh Robin Hood, uh Roku is uh an

1176
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:25,240
operating system for connected TVs,

1177
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:28,800
highly misunderstood stock. Crisper

1178
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:31,440
Therapeutics which uh is gene editing

1179
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,839
gene editing for cickle cell disease and

1180
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,960
uh betaththalmia

1181
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:40,800
uh palunteer I think I've mentioned uh

1182
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:44,720
in the AI software space archer just

1183
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,599
moved into the top 10 it's the EV tall

1184
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,839
company which and it also signed a deal

1185
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,720
an exclusive deal on both sides which

1186
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:56,599
was quite impressive uh with anderol

1187
00:55:52,720 --> 00:56:00,640
which anderil which is the u most

1188
00:55:56,599 --> 00:56:03,839
sophisticated defense tech play uh and

1189
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:07,920
is growing like gang busters. So so

1190
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:11,680
that's terrific. Shopify

1191
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:16,799
uh which is a shopping platform back end

1192
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:19,920
and really using uh AI Roblox. Oh that's

1193
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,440
the one we're missing. Roblox

1194
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,680
which is a game right? Yes. It's a

1195
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,440
usergenerated gaming company. Uh the

1196
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,119
fascinating and it's also a social

1197
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,640
platform. Uh it started for children

1198
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:38,160
younger than 13 years old. And what's

1199
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:41,040
interesting about it is uh they've

1200
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,760
stayed with it because 60% of its user

1201
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,760
base now is above 13 which is very

1202
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,359
interesting. It's the largest

1203
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,599
userenerated

1204
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:54,240
uh um content provider out there.

1205
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,359
And what is fascinating about it is I

1206
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,640
know one of my friend's daughter has

1207
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,559
started her own dress shop on Roblox and

1208
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,640
what she doesn't understand is that

1209
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,880
she's she's learning about business but

1210
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,839
she's also learning how to code

1211
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,440
especially in this new vibe coding

1212
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:14,240
world. So I think it's going to be a

1213
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,599
very important uh company going forward.

1214
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:20,319
The the interesting thing about

1215
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:24,119
gaming and technology transitions is

1216
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:28,960
that it is the only entertainment medium

1217
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:31,280
medium that has not fallen apart with

1218
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,960
technology transitions.

1219
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,400
Um it has actually grown because those

1220
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,880
who love their games from 25 years ago

1221
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,480
still play them. It's grown with each

1222
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:48,319
technology revolution. So, uh, and user

1223
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,359
generated content in gaming is,

1224
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:53,119
um, the next big thing. A business is

1225
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,720
only as good as the people inside it.

1226
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,880
So, how do you make sure you're hiring

1227
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,640
the best? Our sponsor, LinkedIn, can

1228
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,799
help you find these applicants quickly.

1229
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,880
I believe in taking time to hire slowly,

1230
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,559
but I also understand that once you've

1231
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,720
decided to hire, you want to get the

1232
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,240
ball rolling and get the best candidates

1233
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,760
in front of you to start interviewing.

1234
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,119
And that's where paying to promote your

1235
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,359
role on LinkedIn makes all the

1236
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,760
difference because you'll get applicants

1237
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:18,079
seven times faster than if you post your

1238
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,240
job for free. And even though slower,

1239
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,760
more considered hiring is important, you

1240
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,760
never want your hiring platforms to be

1241
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,000
what's holding you back. LinkedIn keeps

1242
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,920
pace. It takes care of the heavy

1243
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,200
lifting, sending you highly skilled

1244
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
candidates that you wouldn't find

1245
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,200
anywhere else. So when the time comes to

1246
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,040
make your next hire, make it count and

1247
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,000
promote your job on LinkedIn. Head to

1248
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,640
linkedin.com/doac. That's

1249
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,799
linkedin.com/doac and terms and

1250
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,880
conditions apply. Make sure you keep

1251
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:47,040
what I'm about to say to yourself. I'm

1252
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,040
inviting 10,000 of you to come even

1253
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,319
deeper into the diary of a CEO. Welcome

1254
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,839
to my inner circle. This is a brand new

1255
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,440
private community that I'm launching to

1256
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,839
the world. We have so many incredible

1257
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,680
things that happen that you are never

1258
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,880
shown. We have the briefs that are on my

1259
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,880
iPad when I'm recording the

1260
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,400
conversation. We have clips we've never

1261
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,920
released. We have behind the-scenes

1262
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,240
conversations with the guests and also

1263
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,520
the episodes that we've never ever

1264
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,280
released and so much more. In the

1265
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,799
circle, you'll have direct access to me.

1266
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,640
You can tell us what you want this show

1267
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,079
to be, who you want us to interview, and

1268
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,799
the types of conversations you would

1269
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,799
love us to have. But remember, for now,

1270
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,960
we're only inviting the first 10,000

1271

1272
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,520
if you want to join our private closed

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,640
description below or go to

1275
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,640
daccircle.com.

1276
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,839
I will speak to you then.

1277
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,640
If you had $1,000 to invest Mhm. and you

1278
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:43,920
had to invest it somewhere, where would

1279
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,440
you be investing it?

1280
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,760
Well, and how would you be like the

1281
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,920
general philosophy towards wealth

1282
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,079
creation at such a stage? If you had

1283
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,880
$1,000, how would you be thinking about

1284
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:59,960
creating wealth for yourself? A couple

1285
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:05,240
of things. averaging into

1286
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:09,200
um either an ETF. What's an ETF? ETF,

1287
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:14,040
exchangeraded fund. So, it treats a

1288
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,559
group of stocks like one stock. Mhm. So,

1289
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:21,440
ARK

1290
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:26,400
is it's nearly it's 35 36 stocks, but

1291
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,760
you can buy them by purchasing ARK. And

1292
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,880
you can do that on your mobile phone by

1293
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,160
download. You can do it on your mobile

1294
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,839
phone. A bunch of different apps allow

1295
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,440
you to just buy that one ETF, which

1296
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,200
means you own 35 stocks. Yes. And and

1297
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,839
your team are basically choosing what

1298
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:43,440
those 35 stocks are. Yes. Based on your

1299
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:46,079
research, right? and ARK are our highest

1300
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,839
conviction stocks. Uh, and they they

1301
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,839
they offer an exposure to all of the

1302
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:57,000
innovation platforms that we've talked

1303
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:59,839
about. Whereas ARKI here in Europe is

1304
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,880
focused primarily on artificial

1305
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,880
intelligence and robotics because we

1306
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,119
think that convergence is going to be

1307
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:12,359
pretty explosive. what you don't get

1308
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:16,160
there uh and you do get in

1309
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:20,400
ARK we also have in another very focused

1310
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:24,000
fund ARKG which is really healthc care

1311
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,160
applications of AI um and and other

1312
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,040
health care other healthcare names that

1313
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:32,160
we think uh are going to be pretty

1314
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,240
transformative in the new world as

1315
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:38,400
regulators really understand how

1316
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:42,880
important AI is going to become to

1317
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,920
discovery uh research trials development

1318
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,599
uh to diagnostic tests and to curing

1319
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,960
disease. Another question popped up

1320
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,400
which is about Ethereum and these other

1321
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,720
cryptocurrencies. Do you invest in any

1322
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,440
of these these others? Yes, we have uh

1323
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,319
we have well in our public funds we've

1324
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,799
put them I I don't think we can own them

1325
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:05,200
here in the UK yet, but in the in the US

1326
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:08,640
uh we have them in um some of our funds,

1327
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:12,640
both of them. They're key to the

1328
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,160
financial services revolution. So, uh to

1329
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,240
get people to understand and feel

1330
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,799
comfortable with that, uh we don't call

1331
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,960
it the crypto revolution. It's the

1332
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:23,720
digital assets revolution. And it's

1333
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,960
simply the internet, the financial

1334
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,400
internet. Okay. So that so we do we do

1335
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,559
and do you believe are you more bullish

1336
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,559
on the price potential of Bitcoin than

1337
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,720
Ethereum? Yes, we think Bitcoin is the

1338
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,240
biggest idea. It serves the three three

1339
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:44,319
revolutions. Global monetary system,

1340
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,760
they do not. Um new asset class, they

1341
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,760
are part of a new asset class, but

1342
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,520
Bitcoin is going to be the biggest. and

1343
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,200
new technology. It's the most secure uh

1344
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,799
blockchain technology out there. What

1345
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,040
about all these other Salana and all

1346
01:02:54,799 --> 01:03:00,000
these other So, Ether and Salana. So,

1347
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,599
the big three are the are those are the

1348
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,240
the big three. Um and we think they'll

1349
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,480
all be successful, all three of them.

1350
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,240
Bitcoin the most. We're very interested

1351
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,960
in stable coins, but that's just like

1352
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,440
cash. Uh and you know, there are

1353
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,440
millions of crypto assets out there. We

1354
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,640
think most of them die. Is there any way

1355
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,119
to invest in stable coins? Like how do

1356
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,599
you invest them in? So indirectly right

1357
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:29,920
now it is through Coinbase. They have a

1358
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:33,520
deal with Circle. Um any any revenue

1359
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,680
that Circle generates it's it's stable

1360
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,440
coin is USDC.

1361
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:42,240
Yeah. Any revenue they split 50/50 uh in

1362
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:45,119
the US. uh circle itself has announced

1363
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,039
that it is going public and so we're

1364
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,359
looking forward to that and what's

1365
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,280
what's the the sort of psychology or

1366
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:54,960
mentality one has to adopt to be a good

1367
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:58,000
investor depends what you've bought if

1368
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,119
you buy a strategy like ours which would

1369
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,920
be in the aggressive growth

1370
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:05,760
strategy put it in you know averaging in

1371
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,559
over time just like with Bitcoin as I

1372
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,720
mentioned earlier uh averaging in over

1373
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,000
time what does averaging in Averaging in

1374
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,720
means, you know, buy a little every

1375
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,319
month, maybe every

1376
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,960
payday. I think one of my daughters was

1377
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,640
buying Bitcoin every week, but not a

1378
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,640
Bitcoin. She couldn't do that. A

1379
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:29,599
Satoshi, you know, so and close your

1380
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,720
eyes. Like you're this is a long-term

1381
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:35,440
investment. If we're right, uh,

1382
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,920
according to our analysis, now you this

1383
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,200
is our research, our analysis. No

1384
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,280
promises. We can't do that. But

1385
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,280
according to our research, the

1386
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,520
technologies around which we have

1387
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,960
centered our research

1388
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:54,319
uh and which have focused our

1389
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:58,760
investments, they we believe will go up

1390
01:04:54,319 --> 01:05:02,400
more than tenfold in the next five to 10

1391
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:05,039
years. And that's how much explosive

1392
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,319
growth we have ahead of us as these

1393
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:11,359
technologies converge and create

1394
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,599
incredible opportunities for investors.

1395
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:17,520
And you know I'm hearing a lot of invest

1396
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:19,559
a lot of people um as they get into

1397
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:24,799
investing of course they have their day

1398
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:27,200
jobs but once they have acred enough you

1399
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:29,440
know they're making choices about

1400
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,760
dialing down their day jobs and spending

1401
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,119
more time investing. You asked what are

1402
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,920
some of the jobs of the future going to

1403
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:39,039
be. I think individual investors are

1404
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,799
going to be providing for themselves if

1405
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,480
they are investing on the right side of

1406
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,839
change. So if you're right, that means

1407
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,119
that by investing your fund, I would

1408
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:49,440
make a,000% return roughly. Yes. No

1409
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:52,200
promises. But this is all based on

1410
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:56,400
research and you can find it in our big

1411
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:59,079
ideas. Uh big ideas 2025 is on our

1412
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,480
website

1413
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:07,119
arc-invest.com. Uh, and you can find a

1414
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:09,680
lot more of information about our funds

1415
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,839
on arc-funds

1416
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,799
uh.com. And I should probably say this

1417
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,799
is not in investing advice. It is not.

1418
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,000
And and I want to do your own research.

1419
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,520
Do your own research. You can lose all

1420
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,960
of your money. Yes, you can lose all of

1421
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,280
it if you decide to do any of these

1422
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,119
things. But that's why we put Arc Dash

1423
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,520
Invest separate from the fund site

1424
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,319
because that's just research. learn

1425
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,960
learn what you're investing in or learn

1426
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:36,400
why we've invested

1427
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,760
uh the the way we have you know that's

1428
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,520
that's what we do all day long is we try

1429
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,359
and help well first of all we're doing

1430
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,359
the research we are making the

1431
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:49,280
investments but I think one of the most

1432
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:53,440
important things we do is communicate

1433
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:56,319
what we're doing and why we're doing it

1434
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,680
what do you think of Trump tariffs

1435
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,520
everything that's going on in America at

1436
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,839
the moment, what's, you know, for the

1437
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,720
average person, should they be

1438
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:04,880
concerned? Are you bullish? You think

1439
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,359
Trump's got it right? If you look at

1440
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,680
what happened to the equity market when

1441
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:12,480
Trump was elected, the stock market,

1442
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:15,280
yes, the stock market, it went crazy to

1443
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,359
the upside, as did our strategy.

1444
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:21,680
And why the promise

1445
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:24,079
was deregulation and that I think is

1446
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,920
underestimated uh how important it is

1447
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,200
because we're strangling in regulation.

1448
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:33,920
It's just this is not our DNA. We we got

1449
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,920
to get out from under this. Lower

1450
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:42,160
taxes, lower interest rates is what he

1451
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:45,599
wants, of course. Um and lower tariffs.

1452
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,200
What he didn't tell us was exactly how

1453
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:53,000
he was going to go about that

1454
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:55,760
process. And it has it has felt

1455
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,559
chaotic. And I've had to go out and

1456
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,359
explain what's going on. Try to explain

1457
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:05,640
what's going

1458
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:08,799
on. And I I have to tell you, it scared

1459
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:11,079
me silly to see what was going on

1460
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:14,319
because I knew that

1461
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:18,199
businesses were paralyzed and that we

1462
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:20,679
could have a mess on our hands. And I

1463
01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:23,359
certainly communicated through my

1464
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:25,759
channels. Art communicated through his

1465
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:29,120
channels. In fact, I think in one

1466
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:32,319
publication he said, "I have never been

1467
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:37,359
more scared in my career." And we were

1468
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:39,600
trying to really get into Trump's head

1469
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,600
and and I know President Trump listens

1470
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,279
to art, but he also listens to a lot of

1471
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,560
other people, one of whom was Peter

1472
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:52,319
Navaro, who seemed to have a hold on

1473
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,440
Trumpet when it came to tariffs. And yet

1474
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:58,159
when I saw Treasury Secretary Bessant

1475
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,480
really push aside Navaro and that could

1476
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:02,480
only happen with Trump, I knew we were

1477
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,640
going to be okay. I knew we were going

1478
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,799
to be okay because throughout all of

1479
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:14,199
this chaos, I think what he is trying to

1480
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:16,679
do is not only get tariffs on the US

1481
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:19,799
down throughout the

1482
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:23,319
world, but maybe more important, get

1483
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:26,080
non-tariff trade barriers down. Like for

1484
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:29,560
example, I didn't even know the UK would

1485
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:32,319
not accept our beef or ethanol.

1486
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,719
Well, now you're accepting our beef and

1487
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,480
ethanol. I I don't know if I don't know

1488
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,759
if people in the supermarkets will buy

1489
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:43,359
it, but uh anyway, this one, but other

1490
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:47,040
countries much many many more non-tariff

1491
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:50,679
trade barriers. And so he is just trying

1492
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:53,199
to bust that up, you know, make it more

1493
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:57,440
visible. You know, for example, Canada,

1494
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:58,960
I think they charged a 250% tariff on

1495
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,840
our milk.

1496
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,199
And one of President Trump's promises

1497
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,840
was to take care of the farmers. Okay,

1498
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:11,400
that's why you see the rhetoric around

1499
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:14,560
Canada. Now, do I agree with his

1500
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:17,560
style? I would never do it that way. I'd

1501
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,080
never do it that way. I And it was

1502
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,199
unfathomable, you know, for me because

1503
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,159
he is sensitive to business and he must

1504
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:30,239
have known that everything was going to

1505
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:33,360
stop. And uh but he also knows that he

1506
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:35,840
has to sound crazy for other people to

1507
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,920
take him seriously. And he has and

1508
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,320
people have to believe he will do crazy

1509
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,280
things in order for people to take him

1510
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,960
seriously. And he does do crazy things.

1511
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,800
So do you think it's going to work out?

1512
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,360
I do. You do? And I think the stock

1513
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,960
market is beginning to smell it. If I if

1514
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,640
I just had to invest in one stock right

1515
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,640
now, what stock would you recommend I

1516
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,640
invested in?

1517
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,159
Okay. Well, I have to give you our

1518
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,480
portfolio pick. So, it would be Tesla.

1519
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:03,760
It would be Tesla if I if I had to give

1520
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:07,320
you one stock. Okay. Interesting.

1521
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:10,719
Because think about it. It is it is a

1522
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:13,280
convergence among three of our major

1523
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:17,280
platforms. So, robot robots, energy

1524
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,520
storage, AI, and it's not stopping with

1525
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,719
robo taxis. There's a story beyond that

1526
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,320
with humanoid robots. and our $2,600

1527
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:27,840
number has nothing for humanoid robots.

1528
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,800
We just thought it'd be an investment

1529
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,280
period and you know the re but I think

1530
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,040
he's going to start generating not only

1531
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:39,280
productivity gains internally but

1532
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,440
revenues from humanoid robots. What are

1533
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,360
you concerned

1534
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,480
about in terms of the way that the world

1535
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,679
is going and everything that's

1536
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,040
happening? What are the things that keep

1537
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,199
you up at night? I've got many a

1538
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,640
concern. So, I've got many unanswered

1539
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:53,600
questions and worries about how things

1540
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,760
might play out, but keen to hear yours.

1541
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,159
I am such an optimist. I really do have

1542
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,640
to dig down deeply. If you had asked me

1543
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:03,040
this a few weeks ago, I would have said,

1544
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,920
you know, this tariff situation is going

1545
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:09,199
to blow the global economy up if we're

1546
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:12,320
if we're not careful. So, I'm much more

1547
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:14,440
settled about that right now. I'd have

1548
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,280
to say I am

1549
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,760
concerned that there are going to be

1550
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,679
people caught out

1551
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,840
um by these new technologies and for

1552
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,199
whatever reason not willing to adapt

1553
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,239
because there are going to be huge

1554
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:33,040
opportunities if they do. And so one of

1555
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:36,159
the reasons we give away our research,

1556
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:39,120
you know, I'm very honored to do a

1557
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:42,239
podcast like this is to get that word

1558
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,159
out. There is so much information

1559
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:47,600
available. You can just go to our site

1560
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:51,360
and listen to our podcasts and if

1561
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:54,159
anything inspires you. Go for it because

1562
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,719
it's going the opportunities are going

1563
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,640
to be enormous. When you say you're

1564
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,159
concerned people might get caught out

1565
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,159
caught out in you know disrupted

1566
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,040
industries. I mean we think the whole

1567
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:10,640
transportation industry is going to be

1568
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:13,920
disrupted. Um we think retail as we know

1569
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:16,320
it's going to be disrupted as we retail

1570
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,360
is in like shops and stuff and yes

1571
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,760
although if they adapt with more social

1572
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,760
personal experiences I think that

1573
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,800
anything physical you'll want to have a

1574
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,880
social dynamic associated with it but in

1575
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,000
terms of what I think is going to happen

1576
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,520
to retail is we're going to have our

1577
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,320
personal shopping assistants and they're

1578
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,080
going to they're going to anticipate ate

1579
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,440
what we want, which I can't wait. I hate

1580
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,920
shopping. Uh, anticipate what we want.

1581
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,320
Uh, or basically flag something that

1582
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,920
they know we would like if we knew it

1583
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:53,199
were available. And they'll be

1584
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,600
disintermediating all of the traditional

1585
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:59,199
sources because they can go anywhere in

1586
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,040
the world. Um, so just think about

1587
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,640
almost every sector is going to be

1588
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,920
disrupted. Healthc care is going to be

1589
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,880
disrupted enormously, I think, for the

1590
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,600
better. for the better. But those who

1591
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,800
are wedded to doing things the old way

1592
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,320
are probably going to be disrupted, you

1593
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,440
know.

1594
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:21,360
Yeah, that is my concern as well and and

1595
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:25,480
just how we handle that as a society.

1596
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:28,719
But I think if we can help people

1597
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:31,760
understand that they have a lot of

1598
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:34,239
control over this if they're willing to

1599
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,239
learn and dream and use their

1600
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,920
imaginations. Not everybody is though as

1601
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,920
you know but they have to do it for

1602
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,600
their children at least right if we took

1603
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,679
the general population in London and

1604
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,920
said 100 people how many of you

1605
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,000
understand what AI is or how many of you

1606
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,679
use chat GBT we'd have a certain

1607
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,159
percentage maybe I don't know 50% or

1608
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:57,679
more if I went to the countryside yes

1609
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:59,199
and I stopped a lovely person shopping

1610
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,239
in their local village and said do use

1611
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:04,719
chat GBT it'd probably be significantly

1612
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:07,280
lower percentage they they would care

1613
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:10,440
about that? What is that? Whatever. Um I

1614
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:14,000
I wonder about the inequality of

1615
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:16,080
like education but just initiative and

1616
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,320
how those that really do have a

1617
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,560
proclivity to lean in and to experiment

1618
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,000
and to mess around and to learn because

1619
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,360
maybe there's an incentive because they

1620
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,280
work in a city and their employees

1621
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,120
asking them to will or be off to the

1622
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,280
races with this disruptive technology.

1623
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,440
And there's just like a lot of the rest

1624
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:34,440
of society of middle America and the

1625
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,719
countryides and those types of people

1626
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,280
who are just not even going to see it

1627
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:42,080
coming. But that's why we're out there.

1628
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:45,280
And the the important word that you used

1629
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,719
was initiative because I really think

1630
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,480
you know when people hear the word

1631
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:52,320
inequality

1632
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:55,440
uh they like to blame something, right?

1633
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,960
There will be no reason for this. I'm

1634
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,520
sure someone's going to come back at me

1635
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,440
for saying that, but of course there are

1636
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,320
people who who we have to help along the

1637
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:08,560
way. No question about it. But for those

1638
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:13,199
who are healthy and uh are listening to

1639
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:15,199
this podcast and are saying uh you know

1640
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:17,120
I don't I don't know exactly what she's

1641
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:20,960
talking about but I'm going to start

1642
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:23,360
reading up on some of these new ways of

1643
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,640
doing things and make sure to at least

1644
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,960
understand it. I think within that kind

1645
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,800
of initiative they'll find it. They just

1646
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,239
will find it. There's going to be so

1647
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,760
much opportunity. It's going to be so

1648
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:40,080
exciting and I think again creativity

1649
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,400
and you know especially young people

1650
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:45,280
using their imaginations you know

1651
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:48,000
they're they're not held back by any

1652
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,120
preconceived notion. So I ask all the

1653
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,719
questions I ask because I'm trying to

1654
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,320
like solve little question marks I have

1655
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,679
in my head about the future and it's

1656
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,040
really difficult at this time to see

1657
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,880
around the corner because so much is

1658
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,400
changing so quickly and there's all of

1659
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,320
these converging technologies as you

1660
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,840
describe like robotics and AI and then

1661
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,840
when I put robotics and AI together I go

1662
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,840

1663
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,760
do you know what I mean? Because there's

1664
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,480
like I keep coming back to this question

1665
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,760
of like what am I going to do and not in

1666
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,480
you know what's good about that? You

1667
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,640
know what's really good about

1668
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,960
that? That will motivate you. It does.

1669
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,640
Of course it does. It's great. It

1670
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,719
motivates me to ask people like you the

1671
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,040
questions 17 times in a row to try and

1672
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,800
find the answer. But it's a real point

1673
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,239
cuz I run businesses. We have at our

1674
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,960
headquarters which is around the corner.

1675
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,239
It's about 25,000 foot office. we have,

1676
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,640
you know, hundreds of people in that

1677
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,400
building and I'm thinking about the

1678
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,520
roles that we're hiring for and I'm

1679
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,400
we're now looking at them through the

1680
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,920
lens of agentic AI, so AI agents and and

1681
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,800
then if I overlay that with robotics and

1682
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:52,040
AI and you know I'm what roles would we

1683
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,320
need to hire in the future because

1684
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:57,760
theoretically like can you name a single

1685
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,199
role in a media company that would when

1686
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,719
I'm talking about in the robotics era

1687
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,280
that would really need to be done by a

1688
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:06,480
human I guess other And one could say

1689
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,719
humanto human sales will still have some

1690
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,280
kind of element of human touch to them.

1691
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:16,120
You know though I mean we've learned a

1692
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:20,480
lot from the ancient game of go. Yeah.

1693
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:26,239
So you've heard about Alph Go which was

1694
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:30,000
uh Alphabet Google um basically devising

1695
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:32,320
a program to compete against the Go

1696
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,239
champions. Go is much more complicated

1697
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,040
than chess. Yeah. It's like a game, a

1698
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,360
board game basically, right? So I think

1699
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:42,400
the the champion of the world at the

1700
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,800
time was a South Korean and he was sure

1701
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:48,239
he was going to beat this m machine.

1702
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,320
Well, the machine bit beat him and he

1703
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,920
was

1704
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,040
crestfallen.

1705
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:58,719
And then he got

1706
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:02,159
his to use New York word back and he

1707
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,560
said, "Wait a minute. I'm going to start

1708
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,520
playing against

1709
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:10,560
machines." And so now he's playing

1710
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,960
against machines. His game is so much

1711
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,920
better that when he competes against

1712
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,960
humans, and those competitions are the

1713
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:22,480
more important ones, right? when he

1714
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,960
competes against other human beings, the

1715
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,040
machine has kept him at his champion.

1716
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,920
And of course, everyone's using the So,

1717
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,840
we're all we're going to artificial

1718
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,360
intelligence. But he still can't beat a

1719
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,679
machine, can he? He still can't beat the

1720
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:38,280
best machine in the world. No, he can't.

1721
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:41,760
And but I mean, he can occasionally, but

1722
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:44,320
but people don't want to go see machines

1723
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,880
competing against machines. I get that

1724
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,239
in because human humans like human error

1725
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,840
and they like to be able to relate and

1726
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,120
to aspire. But as it relates to the

1727
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,880
world of work, the incentive is

1728
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,239
productivity. And my my humanoid robot

1729
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,840
isn't going to get sick and it's going

1730
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,679
to have a PhD in everything. So I don't

1731
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,800
want to see a human failing at their

1732
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,280
desk. I want the humanoid robot. Right.

1733
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:11,600
Right. Right. Right. Right. But then you

1734
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:14,400
your your robot and your AI is really

1735
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,719
focused on the past. Right? That's what

1736
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,960
it's ingested. It can make predictions

1737
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,320
though based on that pass pattern

1738
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,679
recognition, which is how my brain

1739
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,120
works, right? Like a neural network.

1740
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:28,640
But that's why we chose the word

1741
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,120
disruptive. Disruptive means the

1742
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:34,400
traditional world order and patterns

1743
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:37,960
therefore that you know the the robots

1744
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,960
and others will recognize is going to

1745
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:44,280
change. Right. I'm sorry. What does that

1746
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,880
mean? as so what when we're doing our

1747
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:50,159
research we have a white sheet of paper

1748
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,159
there's no history for this right and so

1749
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:55,600
we're doing a lot of original research

1750
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:58,159
so AI machines might use our research as

1751
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,920
there because we put it out there but

1752
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,840
how does the AI think differently to to

1753
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,840
a human though in terms of is I thought

1754
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,400
the human brain was building you know

1755
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,120
predicting essentially something based

1756
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,159
on lots of information and AI is

1757
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,840
basically doing the same thing with

1758
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:13,600
neural networks It's making a prediction

1759
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,520
based on lots of new information and

1760
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,400
therefore if we get to AGI it can create

1761
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:22,800
new information. Yes. And and and it

1762
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:25,920
will but I mean AGI Elon will say it's

1763
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,760
two years away and it does seem you know

1764
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:32,640
we're able to generate PhDs and rocket

1765
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:36,080
scientists now in the AI world. So he's

1766
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:39,199
probably right. But I also think about

1767
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:43,600
this as giving us super intelligence.

1768
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:45,440
So, could chat GBT do what we've done?

1769
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,360
Maybe. I don't know. Actually, it's a

1770
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,360
very interesting exercise. I'm going to

1771
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:53,440
ask our team to do that before I put it

1772
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:55,840
out. uh to do to do a model, a SpaceX

1773
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:58,600
model, financial model, income

1774
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:02,000
statement, balance sheet, cash flow

1775
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:06,400
statement between now and 2050 when we

1776
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:10,639
have in 20 in the 2040s Elon, if not

1777
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:13,520
sooner, to colonize Mars. Uh I I'll see

1778
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:15,280
what kind of model it comes back with in

1779
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,760
terms of how much in terms of how

1780
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,440
correct it is and what it uses to get

1781
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,239
there.

1782
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,960
Okay, I'll do that now. SpaceX,

1783
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:28,080
a financial

1784
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,679
model or income statement. Okay. Income

1785
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:34,080
statement. That's the really smart

1786
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:36,560
model. Let's do 3.0. Make a space.

1787
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,600
You're an investor in SpaceX. Yes. In

1788
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:43,520
the private fund. Yes. So am I. Make a

1789
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,520
SpaceX uh income

1790
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:52,719
statement. income statement based on uh

1791
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:55,360
Elon's predictions. Yes. Elon's

1792
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:59,760
predictions. Yeah. This will be very

1793
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,280
interesting now until 2050. Mhm. Okay.

1794
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,760
I'll put that on the screen so everybody

1795
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,280
can watch. And this is essentially going

1796
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,679
to look at everything he said about

1797
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,760
going to Mars and colonizing Mars and

1798
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,639
then tell you how valuable that

1799
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,840
company's going to be essentially. Yes.

1800
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,400
I'm not sure if you asked the question

1801
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,000
that way. Did you Did you say I just

1802
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,440
said make a SpaceX income statement

1803
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,440
based on Elon's predictions from now

1804
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,960
until 2050 and then I can ask it what

1805
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,480
the market cap would be. I wonder how

1806
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,000
long it's going to think. It's thinking

1807
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,920
for a while. Yeah, it's going to think a

1808
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,719
long time, I have a feeling. And then

1809
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,320
it's going to take you through. And I

1810
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,320
think uh you know what was interesting?

1811
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:37,120
Deep Seek

1812
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,080
uh the breakthrough it had on the

1813
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,760
reasoning side was it kept asking

1814
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,080
questions so it could get to the right

1815
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,320
answer faster. Mhm. I think they're all

1816
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,560
adopting it now because because Deep

1817
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,480
Seek's open source. Yeah. And they

1818
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,080
didn't need to spend much as much money

1819
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,000
on the training side because they That's

1820
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,280
what they say. They said $6 million

1821
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,679
trained on a high-end workstation. And

1822
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:03,520
that that of course caused a trillion

1823
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:06,840
dollars worth of damage in the US market

1824
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:09,040
with Nvidia, one of the biggest uh

1825
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,800
casualties because people said, "Well,

1826
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,239
wait a minute. We're doing these data

1827
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,679
centers. You mean we don't need all

1828
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:19,360
those big data center servers to to do

1829
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,480
this work? We could do a high-end

1830
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:26,400
workstation for $6 million. The answer

1831
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:30,560
is the pre-training for that model was

1832
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:34,159
done on a 50,000 GPU cluster that the

1833
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:38,040
hedge fund had. And the last step of the

1834
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,920
large language model was the $6 million

1835
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:43,040
step.

1836
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,480
Okay, it's made its mind up now. Oh, so

1837
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:50,560
it says Starlink revenue in 2050 would

1838
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:53,600
be 250 billion. Mhm. It says launch and

1839
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:57,560
Starship revenue would be 120 billion.

1840
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:00,480
So the total revenue would be 370

1841
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,719
billion. Cost of goods sold would be 172

1842
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,440
billion. Gross profit therefore would be

1843
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:07,840
200 billion. Operating expense is 37

1844
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:10,239
billion. Operating income would be 161

1845
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:14,120
billion. after tax. So the net income

1846
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:17,120
would be 128 billion. All

1847
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:19,600
right. And I have to to be honest I

1848
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,280
haven't seen the last stage of this

1849
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,159
model. We haven't that would be very

1850
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:26,639
interesting. I'd love to get a a copy of

1851
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,159
that. If you could send it to me 100%

1852
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,840
I'll email it to you straight after. You

1853
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,560
know when I asked Chat GBT earlier I

1854
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,800
said who is the number one woman in the

1855
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,840
world in investing? It repeatedly said

1856
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,800
your name. So that's a pretty remarkable

1857
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:43,520
thing to have accomplished, especially

1858
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,280
in a male-dominated industry where there

1859
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,560
isn't many women that managed to rise to

1860
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,239
the top of that

1861
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,000
industry. So what what is it about you

1862
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:54,560
in hindsight? You know, it's difficult

1863
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,400
to be objective about oneself, but what

1864
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,120
is it about you that meant that you were

1865
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,400
successful in a male-dominated industry,

1866
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,199
in an industry that's incredibly

1867
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:06,159
difficult to be successful in? My advice

1868
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:08,159
to all young people getting into their

1869
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:12,960
first job especially, but even later

1870
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:17,280
jobs is my mission when I started was to

1871
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:20,000
make my boss look brilliant. Now, why do

1872
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:22,880
I why do I say that? It's much more

1873
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,360
applicable today and possible today than

1874
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,520
it was back when there were no computers

1875
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:31,040
and no cell phones, which is when I

1876
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:33,080
started, right? But what did I do? My

1877
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,679
boss wanted to communicate. He was an

1878
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:39,120
economist. Wanted to communicate in

1879
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:42,719
charts that, you know, he couldn't find.

1880
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:45,600
So, I figured out a way. I went to our

1881
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,840
time sharing system. That's all you

1882
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,600
could do back then. Time sharing is an

1883
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:54,560
ancient mainframe technology. And I

1884
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,080
figured out a way to make these charts

1885
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:00,159
and delight him.

1886
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,840
And and and I loved doing it. And I

1887
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,400
loved learning. I loved learning about

1888
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,280
technology. I learned tech and about

1889
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:10,000
economics uh through him. So that was

1890
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:13,360
the first thing. And then why is it

1891
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,920
important to make your boss look good?

1892
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:21,199
Well, I think because if you do make him

1893
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:24,639
look good, um first of all, you should

1894
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:26,800
you owe him a debt of of gratitude if he

1895
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:30,639
turns around and gives you more grow

1896
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:33,520
growth opportunities. So, but if he or

1897
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:35,600
she doesn't, then you know it's time to

1898
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,199
go to the next place where you make that

1899
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,440
next boss look brilliant and maybe you

1900
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:44,320
have the growth trajectory. I had bosses

1901
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:47,520
who they they love the fact that I loved

1902
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:49,760
what I was doing that I had such high

1903
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,600
conviction in what I was doing and I and

1904
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:55,120
I'm going to give Art Laugher a lot of

1905
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,440
credit for that. When I walked in to the

1906
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,360
financial

1907
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:01,920
world, I knew more about economics than

1908
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,639
most of the people in the room. And that

1909
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:07,840
was a great source of confidence. A

1910
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:10,639
great source of confidence. And when I

1911
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,880
was leaving that firm, uh, someone said

1912
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:16,320
my my boss at the time said, I was

1913
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,719
moving from LA to New York. My my boss

1914
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,719
said, "You've only been doing this for

1915
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:24,560
three years. You're not ready to become

1916
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:26,480
their economist." And um and I just

1917
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,560
thought I was ready. And more important,

1918
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,080
the company to which I was going thought

1919
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:35,600
I was ready. And as I was leaving um

1920
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,840
both he and and others said, "Remember,

1921
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,560
you know more about economics than

1922
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,960
anyone else in the room. You'll so take

1923
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:46,000
that with you." And I did. And I think

1924
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,760
that sense of confidence in

1925
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,080
understanding the way the world works

1926
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,560
from a macroeconomic uh point of view

1927
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:55,719
was critically important. Now when I got

1928
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:59,080
to New York, I could not even speak Art

1929
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:02,400
Laugher's name because the LER curve

1930
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:06,159
says if you cut tax rates that are too

1931
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:09,120
high, you will get more revenue. And

1932
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:12,159
what had happened is Ronald Reagan had

1933
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:15,040
cut tax rates, but Paul Vulkar at the

1934
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:17,040
Fed was trying to starve the economy of

1935
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,440
inflation. So we were in backto-back

1936
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,239
recessions and no, the government wasn't

1937
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,600
getting more revenue. So Art Laugher

1938
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:27,840
was, you know, on I I couldn't say

1939
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,840
anything, but you know, it was fine. I I

1940
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,600
knew he was going to be right and we

1941
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,760
were right. That was the story of the

1942
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,920
80s and 90s. And that's why uh Jennison

1943
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:42,239
Associates and the chief investment

1944
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:44,320
officer there uh Sig Sagalis um gave me

1945
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:46,719
an opportunity to get into equity

1946
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:50,719
research. I wanted to grow. I loved the

1947
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:53,280
stock market and he loved my conviction

1948
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,120
and so he started me on cyclical

1949
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:59,880
companies which of course I would know a

1950
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:02,719
lot about. But Jennison was primarily a

1951
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:04,639
techoriented firm and of course knowing

1952
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,639
that I wanted to delight the boss. I

1953
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,360
wanted to get into the technologies and

1954
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:12,960
I made it my business to know as much

1955
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,960
about them and and I was the only one

1956
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:20,719
willing to uh research stocks outside

1957
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,480
the US. Think about that now.

1958
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,120
Art

1959
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:27,920
Lather Arthur Ler. Yes. He wrote this

1960
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:32,320
letter. Oh, he did. He wrote this letter

1961
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,920
describing you. Oh, to you? To me? Oh.

1962
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,800
He said, "There was this young lady

1963
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,400
named Kathy Duddy, later Kathy Wood,

1964
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,080
whose face was the map of Ireland, and

1965
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,320
whose ambition was over the moon. I was

1966
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,760
a tough teacher and grader, and Cathy's

1967
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,840
first steps were shaky, but in short

1968
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,320
order, she rose to the occasion and aced

1969
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,880
the course. impressed as I was and

1970
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:52,480
believe me I was very impressed. I

1971
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,960
helped Kathy land her first job at

1972
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,800
Capital Group in LA and from that point

1973
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,800
in time it was game on. I followed her

1974
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,800
career closely after Capital Group then

1975
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:05,360
on to Tillo and her final job as an

1976
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:07,360
employee at Alliance Alliance Bernstein.

1977
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,080
As you may imagine, she was the star

1978
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,920
investor at each stage. And in 2014,

1979
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,960
Kathy took a giant entrepreneurial leap

1980
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,120
in the founding and funding of Arc

1981
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:20,000
Invest. And the letter goes on to say,

1982
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:22,639
"She's a mega success and God bless her.

1983
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,080
She never has forgotten her now aged

1984
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:29,920
professor."

1985
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:33,600
Well, that was very nice of him. Um

1986
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,120
uh so he he has been so important to my

1987
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,400
career. Now I'm going to get a little

1988
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:43,760
weepy, but um I gave him 1% of my

1989
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:45,600
company when I started it. And uh so he

1990
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,840
deserved it. He deserved it because he

1991
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,760
gave him a big big break. He believed in

1992
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,360
me first. Why does that make you

1993
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,320
emotional?

1994
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:56,000
I don't know. We have we've gone through

1995
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:59,719
our life together and what's so

1996
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,800
interesting now is

1997
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:06,120
um so interesting and and fun

1998
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:10,679
is Bitcoin has

1999
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:14,880
rejuvenated art. He's 85 years old or

2000
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:16,560
84 and I'm seeing his excitement and he

2001
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,880
wants to spread the word around the

2002
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,239
world and now we're going into stable

2003
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:26,480
coins together

2004
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:30,320
and he just started an account on X. He

2005
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:32,159
has a flip phone. He doesn't do email

2006
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:35,920
and yet he has just started an account

2007
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:37,760
on X. And so we now have this technology

2008
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:41,520
relationship because he wasn't going to

2009
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:45,000
technology but he knows he's seen like

2010
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:49,040
Arc alto together we have 3.3 million

2011
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:51,679
followers and he's seen the reach that X

2012
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,679
has and he's also I think the other

2013
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,520
thing and I'm I'm haven't answered your

2014
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:59,199
question. It's just very nice of him to

2015
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,760
do that you know I see it's a typed one

2016
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,880
page and very sweet. We have a closing

2017
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,000
tradition on this podcast where the last

2018
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,120
guest leaves a question for the next

2019
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,760
guest not knowing who they're leaving it

2020
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,760
for. And the question left for you is

2021
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,560
great question for you. What is the

2022
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,040
craziest

2023
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:17,120
idea you ever had that turned out to be

2024
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,520
right?

2025
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:22,320
Well, there are just a a few one thing

2026
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:25,840
that it's it's not that crazy, but it

2027
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:29,800
just gives you a sense of how not

2028
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:34,520
obvious in the early days of

2029
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:39,120
ARC. I remember saying I remember

2030
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:41,840
saying, "Well, you know, autonomous

2031
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:44,880
vehicles are robots."

2032
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:47,199
And I was in a research meeting and

2033
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,960
everybody said, "No, they're not." And

2034
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:51,040
of course they are. You know, it's a

2035
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:54,000
crazy idea, but and there was something

2036
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:56,800
I mean there some things I'll say and

2037
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
the reason that's important from our

2038
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:03,120
point of view is this convergence idea,

2039
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,400
robotics, AI, energy storage. It's wait

2040
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:09,679
a minute, this is a very big idea. So it

2041
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:12,480
seemed it seems like no. It's like I

2042
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:14,880
think it is. And and so it was like we

2043
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,920
were we were, you know, feeling our way

2044
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:20,159
in the dark because that was 2014 and

2045
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,960
nobody was really talking about them.

2046
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:24,080
And there's something like that very

2047
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,080
recently. Oh, we were talking. It's not

2048
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:29,000
a crazy idea. It's just we're trying to

2049
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:31,520
solve problems. Um

2050
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,760
someone as we were going on and on at

2051
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:38,000
our brainstorm on Friday about humanoid

2052
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,880
robots, uh someone he he's our um what

2053
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,560
do we call him? What do you call

2054
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,760
kermagin? Uh, no. Good way. In a good

2055
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,480
way. I don't even know what kmagin

2056
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:50,000
means. Kromagin means kind of contrarian

2057
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:53,040
or kermagin like yeah yeah yeah that's

2058
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,080
not going to work you know. Um he

2059
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,000
humanoid robots. He said he said I don't

2060
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:01,840
think that's going to be a thing. He

2061
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,800
said, "We really need robots that are

2062
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:07,600
going to be able to carry a lot more in

2063
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:10,400
terms of weight than those things will

2064
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,480
on those stilts." And in my mind, kind

2065
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:16,480
of flashed

2066
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:18,719
um transformer robots, they'd have legs

2067
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,199
and all of that. You'd be able to fold

2068
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,159
them up so they look like a tamp tank.

2069
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:26,000
Mhm. And so that's what I said on uh I

2070
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,199
know this doesn't sound so crazy to you,

2071
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,760
but uh I don't I just imagining the

2072
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:34,320
future going to Disneyland when I'm 11

2073
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:37,760
years old. We had just come over uh from

2074
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:41,120
Ireland and seeing someone holding a

2075
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,679
phone on the carousel for progress and

2076
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:46,320
you know saying I'm going to have one of

2077
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:49,440
those. Um, it sounded crazy at the time

2078
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,560
and I felt a little crazy but always.

2079
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,120
So, you think we're going to have

2080
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,520
transformer robots? Yeah. So, the robot

2081
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:58,000
that cleans my house can transform and

2082
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,480
maybe become and everybody laughed at me

2083
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,760
but I think that's going to happen.

2084
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:06,000
Another one was and this was on these

2085
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:10,480
are just little ideas in terms of how

2086
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,560
things hit my brain but uh someone was

2087
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,120
talking about boring which is another

2088
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,199
one of Elon's companies the underground

2089
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:20,960
transportation thinks tunnels and stuff.

2090
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:22,520
Yeah, I forget what someone said in a

2091
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:29,120
post on

2092
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:31,679
X, but I my answer was Mars obviously.

2093
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,280
And people were laughing at that. And

2094
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,360
then as they were talking about they're

2095
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,920
saying, of course they're going to put

2096
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:40,080
that transportation system underground.

2097
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,679
We learned why you shouldn't have it on

2098
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:45,440
top of the ground from Earth. So just a

2099
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,199
little things look catch me in a funny

2100
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,040
way. It's not the craziest. They're just

2101
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:51,360
like, "Oh, maybe that is the way things

2102
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,040
are going to work." I wonder if if Elon

2103
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,320
dies before we get to Mars, or if he

2104
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,560
just dies in the next 10 years from

2105
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,760
anything, from any cause, how much of an

2106
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,480
impact that will have on our rate of

2107
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,719
progress generally with space and

2108
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:04,639
electric vehicles and humanoid robots

2109
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:08,719
could be quite profound. He is getting

2110
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:11,280
us so far along that, you know, there's

2111
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,040
just going to be a runway he's created

2112
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:17,679
for years and years. Think about it.

2113
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:19,440
Mars 2040 50 you know

2114
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,040
Kathy thank you thank you for doing what

2115
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:24,159
you do and um that's a a sort of

2116
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,560
multifaceted point of gratitude because

2117
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:28,719
you do so much um you do so much in

2118
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,840
educating all of us in terms of

2119
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,239
innovation investing and what the future

2120
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,119
looks like but also from your fund's

2121
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:37,119
perspective and your company's

2122
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:38,400
perspective you do so much in open

2123
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,760
sourcing and putting the research and

2124
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,679
the work that you guys do out into the

2125
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,520
world when you don't necessarily have to

2126
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:45,440
but as I've heard you say it's a great

2127
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,920
benefit both to the world but also you

2128
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:50,080
do it because it also brings people to

2129
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,440
your fund right and um it certainly did

2130
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,199
for me that's how I came across you many

2131
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,360
many years ago when I had was reading

2132
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:57,199
some research with my brother um around

2133
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,960
investing in the future and innovation

2134
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,239
and understanding your thesis around all

2135
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,480
of those things but also from the

2136
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:05,760
education side you're distilling this

2137
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:07,840
complex research into simple um language

2138
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,000
and information that the next generation

2139
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,440
can understand so that this moment of

2140
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,880
transition doesn't catch them off guard

2141
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,960
and that's an incredible thing but I but

2142
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,560
I have to say as well you're such an

2143
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,080
inspiration for the very fact that you

2144
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,239
have achieved what you've achieved in

2145
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,480
your life. It's it's exceed it's

2146
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:24,000
extremely rare for someone and I don't

2147
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,600
always like to talk about gender or race

2148
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,679
or the those kinds of things but it's a

2149
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,760
point of it's a particular point a

2150
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:32,320
pertinent point in this case because you

2151
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,320
have succeeded in a very maledominated

2152
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,840
industry and I think just your presence

2153
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,600
your existence alone is going to inspire

2154
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:42,880
lots of women um and men people like me

2155
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:45,119
um to pursue finance and investing as a

2156
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,239
career. So thank you so much for doing

2157
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,520
what you do and thank you for being who

2158
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,040
you are. It's incredibly important and

2159
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,719
you've demystified so many things for me

2160
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,800
over the years even though we've never

2161
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,000
met. Um, but watching your videos and

2162
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,199
reading the research that you guys put

2163
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,199
out. So, I'm going to link all of that

2164
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,560
below and linked your websites and your

2165
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:00,639
funds and all those things so people can

2166
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,560
learn more. But yeah, thank you. Thank

2167
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:05,679
you, Stephen. Thank you for doing what

2168
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,960
you do and and it's been an honor and a

2169
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,440
privilege and I know you have an

2170
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:11,679
incredible audience. So, you've built a

2171
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,440
fantastic business here, and I have a

2172
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:17,440
feeling uh that this new world that that

2173
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:22,360
you're fearing is going to be very good

2174
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:22,360
to you. I hope so. Yes. Thank you.

2175
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,440
The hardest conversations are often the

2176
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:29,679
ones we avoid. But what if you had the

2177
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:31,280
right question to start them with? Every

2178
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,400
single guest on the diary of a co has

2179
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,679
left behind a question in this diary.

2180
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,679
And it's a question designed to

2181
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:39,440
challenge, to connect, and to go deeper

2182
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,520
with the next guest. And these are all

2183
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,679
the questions that I have here in my

2184
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,000
hand. On one side, you've got the

2185
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,440
question that was asked, the name of the

2186
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,320
person who wrote it. And on the other

2187
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:52,719
side, if you scan that, you can watch

2188
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:54,880
the person who came after who answered

2189
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,719
it. 51 questions split across three

2190
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,199
different levels. The warm-up level, the

2191
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,880
open up level, and the deep level. So,

2192
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,800
you decide how deep the conversation

2193
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,800
goes. And people play these conversation

2194
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,600
cards in boardrooms at work, in

2195
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,840
bedrooms, alone at night, and on first

2196
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,280
dates and everywhere in between. I'll

2197
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,719
put a link to the conversation cards in

2198
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,119
the description below, and you can get

2199
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:16,320
yours at the

2200
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:19,040
diary.com. This has always blown my mind

2201
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,719
a little bit. 53% of you that listen to

2202
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,639
this show regularly haven't yet

2203
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,920
subscribed to the show. So, could I ask

2204
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,119
you for a favor? If you like the show

2205
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,800

want to support us, the free simple way

2207
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,159
that you can do just that is by hitting

2208
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,000
the subscribe button. And my commitment

2209
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:33,600
to you is if you do that, then I'll do

2210
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,040

to your feedback. We'll find the guests

2214
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,239
that you want me to speak to, and we'll

2215
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,239
continue to do what we do. Thank you so

2216
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,239
much.
