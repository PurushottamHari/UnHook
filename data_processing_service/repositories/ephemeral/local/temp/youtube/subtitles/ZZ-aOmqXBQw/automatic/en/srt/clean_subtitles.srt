I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, there are a lot of updates, but now you just count that at anytime America can attack Iran or vice versa, Iran can attack America, because Iran too has given a warning to Khamenei, Syed Ali Khamenei, who was a student of Rohilla Khamenei, ever since he threatened them, they have completely gone into war mode. Ok?  And he said, come and kill me, kill me.  Let's see how much strength you have and we will attack now.  Now they are giving statements that we will attack America's bases. So now you count the days, an attack can happen any time, within hours or minutes.  America might jump into the war.  He will jump for sure. Ok?  And Russia has warned America not to help Israel. In January, Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership treaty. But where is the Strategic Partnership Treaty?  Where did Russia go?  Where is it?  I am not visible.   The biggest news is that a report has come from Israel which has been published by the Wall Street Journal and this newspaper says that Israel is falling short of missiles. This Israel might run out of missiles. They have only 101 days worth of stock left.  And this news is very shocking because now a lot will be said about Israel based on this news. But Iran fired a hypersonic missile. Israel has said that we have destroyed their one third air defense system.  We have destroyed their missiles.  We have just sent 50 fighter jets to Israel and destroyed their nuclear sites.  So Israel has said that we destroyed their defence system.  America says that we have control over their airspace.  But friends, it is said that Iran still has around 2000 to 2500 missiles and Iran has fired around 400 missiles on Israel.  Which has a hypersonic missile. Iran is saying that Israel would never intercept such a fast missile and an American journalist is also saying this.  A defense analyst is also saying this.  Now we will listen to everyone.  So it is told here that more than half of the stock is still with Iran and this report has been published here because their air defense system is considered to be one of the best of Israel. Ok?  And in that, you know, there's Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow System, US supplied Patriot Third.  Well, America knew, it is also printed in this report that America knew that their supply was decreasing.  So they refilled it quickly.  Is it okay? They have been continuously supplying missiles to Israel for the last one month.  We are providing batteries. Because all this runs on batteries.   It runs on missiles.  Brother, you will shoot the missile that is coming at the missile itself, right?  Ok?  You must have seen many videos showing a missile coming from behind.  Here the air defence system is active and here songs are playing. Germany has said that Israel is doing our dirty work.  He is doing the dirty work of the world. That means that is what happens, killers are hired.  That Sonam Raghuvanshi case. He did not kill himself.  Israel is getting people killed and is doing this for the world. is eradicating terrorism.  So it is being told that it costs around Rs 124 crore to hit one missile. And it has also been told that the entire missile defense operation system costs approximately $285 million, and when the Arrow system alone intercepts, it costs $3 million, so it is a good amount of money for one missile. $3 million is the cost.  Okay and every day Iran's missiles are being launched, they are being launched by drones. So this is what is printed in this report that for 10 to 12 days, this Israel is here and I will also tell you what I think right now. Israel will survive what it is.  After that, friends, it has also been said in the Israel Defense Forces that here Tom Carraco is the director of the missile defense project.  He has said that look, both America and Israel cannot stop the missiles for very long. But this is applicable to Iran as well. Does Iran have that many missiles ?  Not there.  No matter how much Iran talks, no matter what it says, wars cannot be won with words. Wars are not won with slogans.  The truth is that Iran has suffered huge losses.  But you should praise Iran.  He is still fighting, okay it's okay. Because now there is no choice.  But I told you this is the climax. He has no choice left.  He knows we will be killed.  So that's why hit me, throw whatever you have.  So Iran is fighting.  Its top leadership is gone.  Now, you can't say anything about Khamenei as well.  Israel nearly killed them, too.  Donald Trump vetoed it and now Donald Trump is saying that if we know your whereabouts, we will kill you.  And since this was said, Khamenei gave a public speech that if there is no concern about my life then let it happen, it doesn't matter.  And after that he said, okay go ahead and kill me and we too are ready to kill you. So it is also said here that Tom Koreko is also saying that America will have to do something as soon as possible. Otherwise, Israel's stockpile of weapons could be destroyed. Now friends, I feel that this will not happen.  Why?  Now take the example of Ukraine. Everyone including me thought that within a week, this war started in 2022, on 28 February and then on 22 February and one more week, Russia would defeat Ukraine.  But the UK and America came in support of Ukraine. Gave money, gave missiles and Russia is suffering the consequences today. This is brother and that is Israel.  Israel is not an ordinary country.  Its defense capabilities are very high.  There is a lot of technology.  Not only in America but in the entire Europe, it has plenty of lobbyists.   They lobby for Israel.  We support you. They create pressure.  So America is standing back.  To give plenty of weapons. America has jumped into the war. Just because of Israel.  In fact, America has no war at all.  If you look at it, this is a threat to Israel's survival. But Israel said hey listen and he said okay okay we are coming, we are coming.  Wait wait let me come.  So this is what has happened and the whole of Europe and if you see, the whole West supports Israel and has been doing so. Ok?  Because as Germany said that Israel is doing our dirty work. So this is absolutely true.  Ok?   The whole of Europe doesn't need to get its hands dirty. Israel is doing all that. Her mother is doing it.  So that is the accounting.  So even if they have a 10 day or 12 day missile.  You see, America may know this and that is why America is jumping into the war.  Because Iran 's victory will prove to be very dangerous for the entire West. And Iran is in very trouble as the Ultimatum and Unity China are not in its support.  So it is highly unlikely that Russia is in support.  Ok ?  So it is obvious that if America and Europe know this, then they will get support here and that too in a strong way and Israel's defense forces are themselves capable.  This is not the first time he is fighting a war.  Ever since Israel became big in 1948, it has been fighting wars. They are fighting a war every two-three years.  The biggest war was in 1967 which is called the Six Day War.  When today's Israel came into existence.  In fact, they had captured other areas also.  Is it okay?  They had to return it and then there was the World War II in 1973 and then in 1980 when Hamas was formed, they have been fighting this war continuously.  They have been fighting this war. This is it.  So the support is huge.  Whatever reports are published, whether it is 10 days or 12 days, that many missiles will remain.  But actually, even 10 to 12 days are a lot. And Iran also has less of these things. You should also assume that this is not planning.  There is no planning for war.  Their defense system is S300.  Neither did they create any defense system of their own, due to which the Human Rights Wars are saying that more than 550 people have died there.  450 have not died.  Israel also suffered losses, friends.  Their Iron Dome could not save them.  Their defense center was attacked.  24 people have died.  This is the official figure, unofficial figure may be higher.
