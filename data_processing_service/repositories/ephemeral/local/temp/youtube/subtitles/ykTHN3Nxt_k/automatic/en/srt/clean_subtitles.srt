Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ and I am Varun Zehri.  Hail India.  You all know that Israel carried out a very precise strike on Iran's nuclear sites under Operation Rising Line. Almost all the nuclear sites of Iran were destroyed in this strike.  But do you know when it started?  How did Israel have such precise information about the location of Iran's nuclear sites?  Its story actually started in 2018.  A secret raid of 2018 which is said to be the most brilliant and most secret operation of Mussad Intelligence till date. How Mossad captured Iran's top secret warehouses where Iran had built nuclear sites. He was traced to one such top secret warehouse.  And the second thing, within 6 minutes and 29 seconds, in one night from around 10:30 pm to before 5:00 am, how such an operation was carried out, a most secret operation, when Mossad stole more than 500 secret documents from Iran's nuclear warehouse and brought them to Israel safely while keeping all its operatives alive, how this entire operation was carried out, today we are going to tell you about the very secretive Mission Mosat which was carried out in Iran and only after which Israel showed it at the world level against Iran and only then finally, the strike has been carried out by Israel on the basis of these information.  So let me tell you about this operation.   Let's start today's episode and if you guys are available on Twitter or Instagram then do follow us.  There we exchange information.  The conversation will continue with you there and whatever you want the next topic on which the video should be made, do comment for it.  Please tell us your view point so that the exchange of information can continue between us in the comment section as well. Now let's start today's episode. So, it starts from 1999.  From 1999 to 2003, Iran carried out its nuclear weapons program, named Project Amad, secretly from the whole world.  You all must be aware of this, if you follow Iran Israel, this entire topic, then for Project Amad, Iran was continuously running its nuclear weapon programme at full speed, hiding it from the world. Well, in the meantime, Iran not only told about its scientists, it is also mentioned in the reports which came out later and all these reports are those where you will get to know the information, we are not telling this on our own, here when this strike took place, a raid was conducted, 500 documents were taken out, from there, all this information came out that how Iran was working on its nuclear weapon programme at this time. So at this time, Iran not only worked with its own scientists, but it is also said that through the network of Pakistan's nuclear scientist AQ Khan, Iran was also working on its nuclear weapons along with other foreign experts. Hiding from the world.  Iran 's focus at this time was to somehow make nuclear warheads so that they could be fitted on the Sahab Three missile. Underground nuclear test sites should be built so that weapon testing can be done there. Iran's entire focus was on building such nuclear weapon sites in Project Amad from 1999 to 2003. During this period, Fodo, which was called Algadar at that time, is a nuclear site in a village in Iran, it was built secretly. The construction of Fordo also started at that time. Iran started all the underground activities there continuously.  Well, there were also high explosive tests that were carried out in this area during Project Amat.  This whole thing goes on continuously.  Another very crucial information came to light that uranium detonation is a substance which is the neutron initiator of nuclear weapons.  In a way he is used for that. So Iran had also started using the new uranium detroid here. All these things were happening at this time and it was the same time when many nuclear scientists of Iran were later assigned and killed by Israel's Mossad. Another such scientist was Masood Ali Mohammadi. Masood Ali Mohammadi had suggested this during the time of Project Amat in around 2003, when Iran was working secretly in this program on how to hide from the eyes of the world. He had developed a strategy himself and presented it here as to how to split the parts of the weapons covertly while avoiding internal and international scrutiny and how this would be done and where would they be kept after that.  So this entire strategy that Mohammaddi had made was made at this time.  Well, however in 2010, Israel had Musad Mohammadi, an Iranian scientist, assassinated. All this continued secretly till 2003. Iran kept working on it.  But suddenly in 2003, Project Amad was closed down. Due to international pressure, Israel was continuously applying pressure.  He was telling the world that Iran is working on its nuclear weapon in Project Amad. So because of this it was closed in 2003 to show the world that we are officially closing Project Amad. But Iran did not actually shut it down. Later, in the secrets that came to light , in the official documents that came to light, it is told that Iran issued a political mandate internally under which it was said that this upcoming project will remain closed from the world but covertly we will continue to run it secretly at different sites so that the international pressure can be avoided.  Well all these things happened in 2007, when it was shut down in 2003, after four years, a US intelligence report was published in 2007.   It was revealed in that too.  It was also confirmed in that that Iran is continuing its nuclear program; it has slowed down somewhere but has not stopped completely.  All these facilities, at that time, were mentioned as Partiyam Military Base, the same Partiyam Military Base of Iran where joint chambers were built for nuclear testing, for weapon testing, for high explosive tests.  All these things were in front of the whole world.  Everyone knew that Iran had not completely shut down Project Amad.  Well, time goes on. 2015 arrives.  In 2015, Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This was signed between Iran and the US.  Iran signed it along with the US and other European powers. And under this, there was a relief fund, basically a big relief fund was signed that Iran would get that money.  Apart from this, Iran will also send IAEA for inspection of all its nuclear sites.  IA is actually the International Atomic Energy Agency. So now after going to Iran, after this agreement, after the JCPOA, she has got this right that now she can go here and inspect Iran.  All these sites can be checked to see whether Iran is actually working on any of its nuclear programs. But after the signing of this agreement, IAPA, IAA started continuously inspecting suspected nuclear sites and military bases, but Iran started doing something else to avoid this. Actually Iran was already working on its nuclear program. Here he made a plan as to how all the nuclear weapon manufacturing documents that we had secretly collected from across the country could be fitted into a missile.   The documents related to this, how is it detonated ?  All its documents will be collected at one place.  And what did Iran do after this ?  Built a low profile warehouse near Tehran.  At a place in a district of Tehran where no one paid any attention.  There was a place which was not noticed by the rest of the world and it was close to Tehran. A low profile warehouse was built at this place by Iran and all the documents, more than 1 lakh documents, were there. How are nuclear weapons made? How is it detonated and fitted into the missile?  All these documents were brought here to these warehouses and settled.  It was hidden here in the pay. This site was kept completely ordinary.  No major security has been shown here so that no one gets suspicious.  247 There were no guards.  Even this site was far away from the declared archives of Iran's Ministry of Defense. So this warehouse was built completely secretly by Iran. And after this, IAEA was also invited and they can do whatever inspection they want. All these things can be done. We are not working on any nuclear weapon in Iran. But in reality all the things were hidden in the warehouse.  Well let us tell you about this warehouse that 32 Iranian made safes were made there.  In this, safe means a kind of cupboard, such things were made there so that all these secrets were kept in them inside black binding files.  There were more than 1 lakh documents.  So about 32 safes were made for this by Iran and the critical designs of the nuclear weapons were kept inside those black binding files. Iran felt that the whole world was unaware of the fact that we are operating this warehouse secretly. All the things are hidden here.  But Iran had a misconception that only it knew about it. Actually, Israel's intelligence agency Mossad is also called a top secret agency. Musad had already set his sights on this warehouse.  Now let me tell you how this happened.  In fact, when Iran signed the JCPOA agreement with the US and European powers in 2015, a year ago, Musad had understood from that time itself that Iran will not stop producing its secret nuclear weapons. He won't stop doing that. Somewhere they would have built such a facility or a site where they will shift it.  I will work on it there.  And another thing that has come to light is that Israel 's Mosat itself had spy agents inside Iran who were not Israeli themselves.  He was a resident of Iran.  There were government officers of Iran itself who worked for Mossad for the greed of money.  And this has been going on for many years now.  So this is the point due to which any country becomes weak.  It becomes weaker with time if its agents create another enemy country.  Mossad had started doing this here and it is said that when Iran built this secret warehouse in 2015 after signing the JCPOA agreement, Mossad got the news of this in February 2016, i.e. after just a few months, and from this time onwards, in February 2016, Mossad started keeping an eye on this warehouse with its Iranian spy agents. Here, this entire order was given to whomever, this order that you have to keep an eye on this warehouse was given by none other than Musat chief UC Kohin himself. On the orders of UC Cohen, Mussad's agents started shifting goods into this warehouse.   The work of shifting the material started and from then onwards the movement of these files, the movements of these people in Iran, the warehouse and the shifting of the material were continuously monitored by Mussad's agents using hidden cameras. In the meantime, Mussad's agents observed the daily routine of the workers who are now working here, after the entire shifting is done, what is their daily routine, what time do they come and what time do they leave, they also came to know that the guards of the morning shift come around 7:00 a.m. This site has been designed in such a way that no 247 guards are posted so that no intelligence agency of any country in the world, especially Mossad, can pay attention to it, but the attention had been drawn.  Well, all these things were told to the Mussad agent UC Kohin, the chief in Israel.  He also said that we have fully analysed the alarm system and we have also learnt how to disable it. We have also got this.  Apart from this, he said that we also know what is kept in which safe and especially their priority was the black binding files in which secret designs of nuclear weapons of Iran were kept.  So all the work done here took approximately 10 months.  This had arrived in 2017 after 10 months of work. He started work from February 2016.  In 2017, Musad had completely finalised his planning.  I had fixed it. Well, what did they do during this time in Tel Aviv ?  That entire war warehouse in Tel Aviv inside Israel, this entire warehouse was at a site in Tehran, Iran. A replica of it was made, an exact same model, so that all the agents who were going there could practice in it for the final mission. If you remember, to kill Osama Bin Laden in Aptabad, the US Navy Seals had made a similar replica of that Aptabad compound and had practiced there.  I practiced there continuously for many times before executing the final mission. Mussad did the same thing.  Mussad's agents built a replica of that warehouse in Tel Aviv.  We rehearsed our entire operation there and after the rehearsal it was finally decided that now we are going to execute this mission here. Meanwhile, the location of each safe, its arrangement , its contents, all those safes were mapped out.  In what ways and where are they kept safe, which black bindings can be safe.  All these things were here in front.  Well in the meantime Yossi Kohen who was the chief of Mossad said that this mission that is going to happen now will not be a small mission.  Nor will we do anything this time like going to the enemy country and bringing back whatever secrets are there by copying their photos or videos or copying their documents. Clicking his photo. We are not going to do this.  This time our entire plan will be about theft. Whatever documents there would be, and these people here knew that there were approximately 500 pages.  There are 163 compact discs, series. This time we will steal all of these so that when we will have the original files, this was Mosat's plan that when we will have the original files, then it will be easy to counter the fake claims of Iran that we are not working on nuclear weapons, plus at the international level we will have solid proof in front of international groups, so this entire plan was of Musat and after this, when these things were finalized, these people were fully ready, January 2018 had come, now one day the final fix is ​​made, friends before moving ahead in the video, I definitely want to give you an announcement.

So this day is decided by Mosat, the 31st of January 2018. The night of 31st January 2018 was the night when the whole of Tehran was sleeping.  At this time Musat's agents started their operation here.  It is said that Musat had around 20 agents and all of them were non-Israelis.  All of them were residents of Iran, so that if anyone has to be brought back or something like this happens and something goes wrong, the name of Mosatka Israel does not appear here.  So that's why all the agents here were non-Israelis. 20 agents each set out on their mission. This was the night of 31 January 2018.  Meanwhile, I was watching this entire operation live in my high command center on live feed, Chief Mosat's Yossi Cohen was watching it all live in Tel Aviv in Israel. Around 20 agents had 6 hours and 29 minutes of time and they knew about this operation. They had a main in who knew that you have only this much time, 6 hours and 29 minutes and you have to carry out this operation in between this time because after this, the first guards from Iran, come to this warehouse in the morning.  There was no guard here throughout the night.  Well in the meantime there was 6 hours and 29 minutes. This operation was started at 10:30 in the night and had to be completed exactly before 5:00 in the morning. This operation is now initiated. These agents had special torches from Mossad that could burn up to 3600 degrees.  There were plenty of those secret coins and apples to crack open in those Iranian safes.  This much heat was necessary. Before this, when they had torches and finally they started working, these people, agents.  Before this, Mussad agents hacked the alarms.  The alarm was manipulated to appear working.  If any Iranian office officer is monitoring them.  These may appear working but will not issue an alert.  If anybody comes or goes from there and touches the safe, the alarms will not go on alert.  These won't make any noise. You will only appear active.  It will seem like everything is normal, just like every day.  After this the final work was started.  The warehouse had two main gates.  Two hard gate heavy doors, both of these are broken first. Even after breaking these, no alarm remained because it had been disabled.  The alarm had been hacked.  After breaking these two gates, work on the safes was started. Mossad agents gave priority to the black binding, which is safe because all the designs of the nuclear side are present in it.  Because of this, there were many such safes which had to be abandoned.  So it is also said that there are lakhs of such documents which are still with Iran. Their secret documents were at the nuclear weapons command center in Tel Aviv, where the chief of Mossad, UC Ko, was sitting.  He was watching the whole thing.  Gradually the safes started being opened by these 20 agents. After this, after taking the initial photographs of many safes, they were sent directly to UC Kohinoor and it was sent there so that it is finalized that the site on which we are working, the operation on which we are working, we have full intelligence that all the secret documents are there, but after sending them, they will be inspected there to find out whether these documents are really of nuclear weapons.  As soon as these documents were sent earlier, their photographs were sent, after looking at those documents and CDs, whatever was written on them, whatever was the full text, after looking at the images, it was confirmed that these are the core documents of Iran's military nuclear program.  And only after this, UC Cohen told his entire staff and these 20 agents that we are on it.   There is no stopping now. Take out all the documents.  The team then started working continuously with these 20 agents.  Lucy Kohin had told her team that we are on it. Now you have to work as quickly as possible.   The agents quickly began opening all the safes that were there using the 3600 degree torch. Started burning it.  There were approximately 500 pages, more than 500 pages, and 163 series containing videos, plus memos from Iran, all of which were collected.  Well, in the meantime, there was another thing, Mossad's plan was so strategic, they had done such good planning here, you see that in the meantime Mossad had started running multiple decoy trucks on the borders of Tehran and around Tehran; why were they started running so that if any Iranian security guard comes here in between or whenever they come to know about this, their full attention can be diverted so that their attention goes on these multiple decoy trucks to ensure that no document is being lost in them, when here their agents collected all the 500 documents, 163 CDs. Collected all the videos and everything. After this, the decoy trucks were just a decoy.  Basically there was a single truck. A big truck in which all these things are loaded by the agents.  And finally this truck is made to cross the border.  After crossing the border by road they tell here that this has been sent.  A truck belonging to some Iranian officer, some military man, Iran's forces did not notice this. Israel had completed its entire work very smoothly in before 6 hours and 29 minutes.   The next day, on 1 February 2018, early in the morning at 7:00 AM, the Iranian guards who were on duty here, reached the spot.   The scene he saw was that the gates and heavy doors were broken.  All the apples were half burnt in some places and half burnt in other places. They were broken and all the documents were missing.  Especially the black binding files were also missing. Whatever was Israel's main agenda, whatever was Israel 's main focus, was its target.  All these things were missing.  The guards who came raised the alarm.  When I saw that it had been hacked here. Finally he was stabilized.   The alarm was sounded and the rest of the Iranian authorities finally arrived here.  The entire country came to know that secrets of nuclear documents had been stolen here. Only after this, Iran put thousands of its officers, security personnel and police personnel on investigation. All the exit points were closed. But till now all the operators were from Iran and Israel.  Some 20 of the operatives had disappeared inside Iran.  They had become mingled together.  The rest of the people from outside had reached Israel.   The documents had reached Israel safely. Musad had delivered them and the entire plan was over.  In a way, it means it was made successful. In April 2018.  Well in the meantime you see this happened in February. Two months pass from February to April. Iran in the middle of two months because the condition was such that I was beaten up and couldn't even cry. That thing is here.  So he did not tell anyone in the entire country. Especially, nobody in the entire world came to know that such a huge incident had taken place in Iran because how could they tell as they had always been hiding the fact that no work was being done on nuclear weapons here. This matter was kept hidden for two months. But after this, Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netan Yau visited the US in April 2018. Reach the White House.  He meets President Trump and in a private briefing, he told him about this entire operation, this secret mission. When Trump was informed about this mission, the reality of Iran was revealed, that Israel has always been saying that Iran is working on its nuclear weapon and this is wrong, and if they are doing such things, then it could be a threat to us. So this matter was told to Trump there and only after this a press conference was held. You all must have seen that press conference of Netaji in 2018.  In that, he clearly said about this bust, about this entire operation, and disclosed it and said that this is one of the greatest intelligence achievements in the history of Israel, it is the greatest achievement in the intelligence history.  This is the proof that despite signing the JCPOA, Iran was working on its weapons. Iran lied to the world about its civilian program and claimed that it was a program for its civilians and that it was working on it. We don't work on Nuclear Purple. All these things were lies.  In Iran's program, it was also shown through those documents that till 2003 they were working on it very strongly. After that, how he has been working continuously since 2003 in secret, till now in 2018. Netan Ya showed all these things in front of the whole world. After all this, the US pulled itself out of the JCPOA in the very next month, in May 2018. This was a complete agreement in which along with the US and European powers, two other countries were also included in it.  The US pulled itself out of the entire agreement that Iran had with them.  Trump pulled himself out, and all these documents also revealed that the then President, Hassan Rouhani, had formed a Council for Advanced Technology, because he was a member of it at that time, and he was continuously approving this entire program. He approved it.  Iran's nuclear weapons program.  With the support of IRGC, which are their Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds Force, this entire nuclear program was run covertly, and they were working continuously.  Israel did not stop here even after this.  He got all these things done.  The US was removed from JCPO A. It is reported that in the last week of April, under the guidance of Benjamin Nitin Yahoo, the Israeli government called three reporters to a secret location.  One of them was a reporter from the New York Times and he was shown all these documents in a secure intelligence facility at this secret location. These three reporters were selected. When this was shown to these three, why was it shown from here so that this news could spread across the world. All these things could be published in big newspapers like New York Times about how Iran was working.  All these documents were shown and it came to light that the IAEA inspectors who regularly went to Iran to suspect whether these people were doing any such work on the nuclear sector, it was also revealed later how they worked secretly so that the IAEA inspectors could not catch Iran.  All these things came to light.  In addition, Israel had one Robert Kelly, a nuclear engineer and inspector for XIA.  I showed these documents to him also in Vienna. When this document was shown to him, Robert Kelly said, it's quite good.  The paper shows the guys working on the nuclear bomb.  This was his statement from here.  It went very viral all around the world.  American and British intelligence officers also detected that from these documents it is clear that Iran was working on its nuclear weapon. And finally these were the files that were stolen in 2018. In a secret operation, Israel extracted these secrets from that warehouse in Iran within one night. After this it is coming to light that the recent strikes have been done with such precise shooting by Israel on all those nuclear sites of Iran. Whether it was in Parchim, whether it was in Fodo, whether it was somewhere else.  These locations have been extracted under these documents on all those military bases. This is such a secret mission that not only exposed Iran's nuclear mission and its process of making a bomb, but it also showed to what lengths Israel can go.   There was a complete secret mission of 2018 which was finally used in 2025 when it came to carrying out a nuclear strike. Also tell me how you liked the video.
