00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,000
Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
and I am Varun Zehri.  Hail

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,719
India.  You all know that Israel carried out a

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,359

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,439
very precise strike on Iran's nuclear sites under Operation Rising Line.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
Almost all the nuclear

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,680
sites of Iran were destroyed in this

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
strike.  But do you know

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,640
when it started?  How did

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,960
Israel have such

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,200
precise information about the

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,079
location of Iran's nuclear

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,920
sites?  Its story actually started in

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,000
2018.  A secret raid of 2018 which is said to be the

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
most brilliant and most secret operation of Mussad Intelligence till date.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,360

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,360
How Mossad captured Iran's top secret

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,680
warehouses where Iran had built nuclear sites.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,320

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,480
He was traced to one such top secret warehouse.  And the

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,120
second thing, within 6 minutes and 29 seconds, in one night

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,159
from around 10:30 pm to

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,720
before 5:00 am, how such an operation was

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,680
carried out, a most secret operation, when Mossad stole more than

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,360
500 secret documents from Iran's nuclear warehouse and brought them to

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,560

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,840
Israel safely while keeping all its

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,920
operatives alive,

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
how this entire operation was carried out, today we are going to

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,560
tell you about the very

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
secretive Mission Mosat which was carried out in Iran

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
and only after which

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,920

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
Israel showed it at the world level against Iran and only then finally, the

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
strike has been carried out by Israel

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,840
on the basis of these information.  So let me

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,600
tell you about this operation.   Let's

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
start today's episode and

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600

exchange of information can

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
continue between us in the comment section as well.

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,560
Now let's start today's episode.

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
So, it starts from 1999.  From 1999

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
to 2003, Iran carried out

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,760
its nuclear weapons program,

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
named Project Amad, secretly from the whole world.  You all must be aware of this,

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
if you follow Iran Israel,

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,560
this entire topic, then

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
for Project Amad, Iran was continuously running

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,160
its nuclear weapon programme at full speed,

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,480
hiding it from the world.

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Well, in the meantime, Iran not only

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,239
told about its scientists, it is also mentioned in the

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
reports which came out later and all these

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400
reports are those where you will get to know the information,

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
we are not telling this on our own,

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
here when this strike took place, a raid was conducted,

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
500 documents were taken out, from

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
there, all this information came

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
out that how Iran was working on

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
its nuclear weapon programme at this time.

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,080
So at this time, Iran

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,599
not only worked with its own scientists,

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
but it is also said

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,519
that through the network of Pakistan's nuclear scientist AQ Khan,

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,920

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,599
Iran was also working on its nuclear weapons along with other foreign experts.

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Hiding from the world.  Iran

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,640
's focus at this time was to somehow

80
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,800
make nuclear warheads so that

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,920
they could be fitted on the Sahab Three missile.

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
Underground nuclear

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,640
test sites should be built

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
so that weapon testing can be done there.

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,519

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,319

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,959
Iran's entire focus was on building such nuclear weapon sites in Project Amad from 1999 to 2003.

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,360
During this period, Fodo, which was called Algadar at that time, is a

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,159

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
nuclear site in a village in Iran,

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
it was built secretly. The

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
construction of Fordo also

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,720
started at that time.

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,599
Iran started all the underground activities there

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,640
continuously.  Well, there were also high explosive tests

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,959
that were carried out

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,000
in this area during Project Amat.  This whole thing

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,720
goes on continuously.  Another very crucial

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
information came to light that uranium detonation is a

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,319
substance which is the neutron initiator of nuclear weapons.  In

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,080

102
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,439
a way he is used for that.

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,519
So

104
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,319
Iran had also started using the new uranium detroid here.

105
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
All these things were happening at this time and

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
it was the same time when many

107
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,639
nuclear scientists of Iran were later

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
assigned and killed by Israel's Mossad.

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,919
Another such scientist was

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,639
Masood Ali Mohammadi. Masood Ali Mohammadi had

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,560

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,800
suggested this during the time of Project Amat in around 2003,

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
when Iran was working secretly in this program on

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,960
how to hide from the eyes of the world.

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,680
He had developed a strategy himself and

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,639
presented it here as to how to split the

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,960

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
parts of the weapons covertly while avoiding internal and international scrutiny and

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,639
how this would be done and

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
where would they be kept after that.  So this

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,440
entire strategy that Mohammaddi had made was

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,080
made at this time.  Well, however

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
in 2010, Israel had Musad Mohammadi, an

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,160
Iranian scientist, assassinated.

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,199
All this continued secretly till 2003.

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,000
Iran kept working on it.  But

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,080
suddenly in 2003, Project Amad was closed down.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Due to international pressure,

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,720
Israel was continuously applying pressure.  He was telling the

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
world that Iran is

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
working on its nuclear weapon in Project Amad.

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
So because of this it was closed in 2003

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
to show the world that

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,600
we are officially closing Project Amad.

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
But Iran did not actually shut it down.

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
Later, in the secrets that came to light

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,880
, in the official documents that came to light, it is

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
told that

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,080
Iran issued a political mandate internally under which

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,840
it was said that this upcoming project will

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,639
remain closed from the world but

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,039
covertly we will continue to run it secretly

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,160
at different sites so that the international

144
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,960
pressure can be avoided.  Well

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,759
all these things happened in 2007, when it was shut down in 2003,

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,919
after four years,

147
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
a US intelligence report was published in 2007.   It was

148
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,479
revealed in that too.  It was also

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,360
confirmed in that that Iran is

150
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,120
continuing its nuclear program;

151
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
it has slowed down somewhere but has

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
not stopped completely.  All these

153
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,440
facilities, at that time, were mentioned as

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Partiyam Military Base, the

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,759
same Partiyam Military Base of Iran where joint

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
chambers were built for nuclear testing, for

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
weapon testing, for high

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,919
explosive tests.  All these things were

159
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
in front of the whole world.  Everyone knew

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,759
that Iran had

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,520
not completely shut down Project Amad.  Well, time goes on.

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,960
2015 arrives.  In 2015, Iran signed the Joint

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,199
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,600
This was signed

165
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,680
between Iran and the US.  Iran signed it along with the US and other

166
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,880
European powers.

167
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,759
And under this, there was a

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,919
relief fund, basically a big relief

169
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
fund was signed that Iran would

170
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,360
get that money.  Apart from this, Iran will also send

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,560

172
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,840
IAEA for inspection of all its nuclear sites.  IA

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,479
is actually the International Atomic Energy Agency.

174
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,599
So now after going to Iran,

175
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,000
after this agreement, after the JCPOA, she has

176
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
got this right that now she can go here and

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,360
inspect Iran.  All these sites

178
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
can be checked to see whether Iran is actually

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
working on any of its nuclear programs.

180
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,960
But after the signing of this agreement,

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,039
IAPA, IAA

182
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,039

183
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,080

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,840
started continuously inspecting suspected nuclear sites and military bases, but

185
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,400
Iran started doing something else to avoid this.

186
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Actually Iran was already

187
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,080
working on its nuclear program.

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,199
Here he made a plan as to how

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,319
all the nuclear weapon manufacturing documents that we had secretly collected from across the country could be

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,560

191
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,639
fitted into a missile.   The

192
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,039
documents related to this, how is it detonated

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,520
?  All its documents will be

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,240
collected at one place.  And what did Iran do after this

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
?  Built a low

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
profile warehouse near Tehran.  At a place

197
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
in a district of Tehran where no

198
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,000
one paid any attention.  There was a place

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,440
which was not noticed by the rest of the world

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,280
and it was close to Tehran.

201
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
A low profile warehouse was built at this place

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
by Iran and all the documents,

203
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,520
more than 1 lakh documents, were there.

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
How are nuclear weapons made?

205
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
How is it detonated and fitted

206
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
into the missile?  All these

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
documents were brought here to these warehouses and

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,160
settled.  It was hidden here in the pay.

209
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,160
This site was

210
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
kept completely ordinary.  No

211
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,319
major security has been shown here so that no

212
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,319
one gets suspicious.  247 There

213
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,000
were no guards.  Even this site was far away from the declared archives of Iran's

214
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,919
Ministry of Defense.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399

216
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
So this warehouse was

217
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,800
built completely secretly by Iran.

218
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,399
And after this, IAEA was also invited and

219
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,599
they can do whatever inspection they want.

220
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,360
All these things can be done.

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
We are not working on any nuclear weapon in Iran.

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
But in reality

223
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,680
all the things were hidden in the warehouse.  Well let us

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,480
tell you about this warehouse that 32

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Iranian made safes were made there.  In this, safe

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,600
means a kind of cupboard, such

227
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
things were made there so that

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,120

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,880
all these secrets were kept in them inside black binding files.  There

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
were more than 1 lakh documents.  So about

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,320
32 safes were made for this by Iran

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,240
and the critical designs of the nuclear weapons were

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,959
kept inside those black binding files.

234
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,920
Iran felt that the whole world was

235
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,240
unaware of the fact that

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,560
we are operating this warehouse secretly.

237
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
All the things are hidden here.  But Iran had a

238
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,399
misconception that only it knew about it.

239
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,279
Actually, Israel's intelligence agency

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,480
Mossad is also called a top secret agency.

241
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,959
Musad had already set his sights

242
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
on this warehouse.  Now let me tell you how this happened.  In

243
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,240
fact,

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,880
when

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,760
Iran signed the JCPOA agreement with the US and European

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,040
powers in 2015, a year ago, Musad had understood from that time itself

247
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,360
that Iran will not

248
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,360
stop producing its secret nuclear weapons.

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
He won't stop doing that.

250
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
Somewhere they would have built such a facility or a

251
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
site where they will shift it.  I

252
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
will work on it there.  And

253
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,440
another thing that has come to light is that Israel

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
's Mosat itself had spy agents inside Iran

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
who were not Israeli themselves.  He was a

256
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,680
resident of Iran.  There were government officers of Iran itself

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,839
who

258
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,920
worked for Mossad for the greed of money.  And this has been

259
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,560
going on for many years now.  So this

260
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,440
is the point due to which any country becomes

261
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,200
weak.  It becomes weaker

262
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,920
with time if its agents

263
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
create another enemy country.  Mossad had

264
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
started doing this here and it is

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
said that when

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,600
Iran

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,079
built this secret warehouse in 2015 after signing the JCPOA agreement, Mossad got the news of this in

268
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,880
February 2016, i.e. after just a few months,

269
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,360
and from this

270
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,200
time onwards, in February 2016, Mossad

271
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,839
started keeping an eye on this warehouse

272
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,680
with its Iranian spy agents.

273
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,839
Here, this entire order was

274
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
given to whomever, this order that you have to

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,240
keep an eye on this warehouse was given by none other than Musat

276
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,079
chief UC Kohin himself.

277
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,720
On the orders of UC Cohen, Mussad's agents

278
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,120

279
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
started shifting goods into this warehouse.   The

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,279
work of shifting the material started and

281
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,160
from then onwards the movement of these files, the

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,880
movements of these people in Iran, the

283
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,160
warehouse and the shifting of the material were continuously monitored by

284
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Mussad's agents using hidden

285
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,800
cameras. In the meantime, Mussad's

286
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,399
agents

287
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
observed the daily routine of the workers who are now working here,

288
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
after the entire shifting is done, what is

289
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
their daily routine, what

290
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,079
time do they come and what time do they leave, they

291
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
also came to know that the

292
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,519
guards of the morning shift come around 7:00 a.m.

293
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
This site has been designed in such a way

294
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,600
that no 247 guards are posted so that no

295
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,680
intelligence agency of any country in the world,

296
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,720
especially Mossad, can pay attention to it,

297
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,120
but the attention had been drawn.  Well, all these

298
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,760
things were told to the Mussad agent UC Kohin, the chief

299
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,240
in Israel.  He also

300
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,399
said that we have

301
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
fully analysed the alarm system and

302
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,640
we have also learnt how to disable it.

303
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
We have also got this.  Apart from this,

304
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,240
he said that we also know

305
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,560
what is kept in which safe and

306
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,800
especially their priority was the black

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,519
binding files in which

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,839
secret designs of nuclear weapons of Iran were

309
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,839
kept.  So all the work done here

310
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,240

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,480
took approximately 10 months.  This had arrived in 2017 after 10 months of work.

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,880

313
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
He started work from February 2016.  In 2017, Musad had

314
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,639
completely finalised his planning.  I had

315
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,440
fixed it.

316
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,920
Well, what did they do during this time in Tel Aviv

317
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,560
?  That entire war warehouse in Tel Aviv inside Israel,

318
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,720
this entire

319
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,800
warehouse was at a site in Tehran, Iran.

320
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
A replica of it was made, an exact same

321
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
model, so that all the agents

322
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,760
who were going there

323
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,720
could practice in it for the final mission.

324
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,720
If you remember, to kill Osama Bin Laden

325
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,639
in Aptabad, the US Navy

326
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
Seals had made a similar replica of that

327
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
Aptabad compound and had practiced there.  I

328
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279

329
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
practiced there continuously for many times

330
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,399
before executing the final mission.

331
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,800
Mussad did the same thing.  Mussad's agents

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,120
built a replica of that warehouse in Tel Aviv.  We

333
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,680

334
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,160
rehearsed our entire operation there and after the rehearsal

335
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,480
it was finally decided that now we are going to

336
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,959
execute this mission here.

337
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,320
Meanwhile, the location of each safe, its arrangement

338
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,320
, its contents, all those safes were

339
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
mapped out.  In what ways and

340
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
where are they kept safe, which

341
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,800
black bindings can be safe.  All these

342
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
things were here in front.  Well in the meantime Yossi

343
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,160
Kohen who was the chief of Mossad said

344
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,839
that this mission that is going to happen now will

345
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
not be a small mission.  Nor will

346
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
we do anything this time like going to the enemy country

347
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,720
and bringing back whatever secrets are there by

348
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,560
copying their photos or videos

349
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,320
or copying their documents.

350
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,279
Clicking his photo.

351
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,560
We are not going to do this.  This time our

352
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,320
entire plan will be about theft.

353
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,920
Whatever documents there would be, and these people

354
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,880
here knew that there were approximately 500 pages.  There are 163

355
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,880
compact discs, series.

356
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,639
This time we will steal all of these so that

357
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320
when we will have the original files, this

358
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,480
was Mosat's plan that when

359
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
we will have the original files, then it will be easy to counter the

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
fake claims of Iran that we are not working on nuclear weapons,

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,800

362
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,279
plus at the international level

363
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,480

364
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,399

very best. So this day is decided

394
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,399
by Mosat, the 31st of January 2018. The

395
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,440
night of 31st January 2018 was the night when the whole of

396
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,440
Tehran was sleeping.  At this time Musat's

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,160
agents started their operation here.  It is

398
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,720
said that Musat had around 20 agents

399
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,880
and all of them were non-Israelis.  All of them

400
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,839
were residents of Iran, so that

401
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,079
if anyone has to be brought back or something like this happens and

402
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
something goes wrong, the name of Mosatka Israel does

403
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,240
not appear here.  So that's why all the

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,480
agents here were non-Israelis.

405
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,279
20 agents each set out on their mission.

406
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,759
This was the night of 31 January 2018.  Meanwhile, I was

407
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,800
watching this entire operation live in my high

408
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,120
command center on live feed, Chief Mosat's

409
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,720
Yossi Cohen was watching

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,079
it all live in Tel Aviv in Israel. Around 20 agents had

411
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,880
6 hours and 29 minutes of time

412
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,079
and they knew about this operation.

413
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,880
They had a main in who knew

414
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,199
that you have only this much time, 6 hours and 29

415
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,920
minutes and you have to carry out this operation in between this time

416
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,160
because after this, the

417
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,160
first guards from Iran,

418
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
come to this warehouse in the morning.  There was

419
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
no guard here throughout the night.  Well in the meantime there was

420
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,360
6 hours and 29 minutes.

421
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,759
This operation was started at 10:30 in the night and had to be

422
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,480
completed exactly before 5:00 in the morning.

423
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
This operation is now initiated.

424
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,399
These agents had special

425
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,199
torches from Mossad that could burn up to 3600 degrees.  There were

426
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,759

427
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,839

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,160
plenty of those secret coins and apples to crack open in those Iranian safes.  This much heat was necessary.

429
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,839
Before this, when they had torches and

430
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
finally they started working, these

431
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,559
people, agents.  Before this, Mussad

432
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,480
agents hacked the alarms.  The alarm was

433
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,959
manipulated to

434
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,839
appear working.  If any Iranian

435
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,439
office officer is monitoring them.  These may

436
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,439
appear working but will not issue an alert.  If anybody

437
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,360
comes or goes from there and

438
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
touches the safe, the alarms will

439
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,600
not go on alert.  These won't make any noise.

440
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,440
You will only appear active.  It will seem like everything

441
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,840
is normal, just like every day.  After this the

442
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,559
final work was started.  The warehouse had

443
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,799
two main gates.  Two hard gate heavy

444
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
doors, both of these are broken first.

445
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
Even after breaking these, no alarm remained

446
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
because it had been disabled.  The

447
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,360
alarm had been hacked.  After breaking these two gates,

448
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,679
work on the safes was started.

449
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,440
Mossad agents gave priority to the

450
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,440
black binding, which is safe because

451
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
all the designs of the nuclear side are

452
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
present in it.  Because of this, there were

453
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
many such safes which had to be abandoned.  So it is

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,840
also said that there are lakhs of such

455
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
documents which are still with Iran.

456
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Their secret

457
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,960
documents were at the nuclear weapons command

458
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
center in Tel Aviv, where the chief of

459
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,440
Mossad, UC Ko, was sitting.  He was

460
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,200
watching the whole thing.  Gradually the safes

461
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
started being opened by these 20 agents.

462
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,240
After this, after taking the initial photographs of many safes, they were

463
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,400
sent directly

464
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
to UC Kohinoor and it was sent there so that

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
it is finalized that the

466
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
site on which we are working, the operation on which we are

467
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,840
working, we have

468
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
full intelligence that all the secret

469
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,600
documents are there, but after sending them, they will be

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,200
inspected there to find out whether

471
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,120
these documents are really of nuclear

472
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
weapons.  As soon as these documents were

473
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,000
sent earlier, their photographs were sent, after

474
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,440
looking at those documents and CDs, whatever was

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320

476
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,120
written on them, whatever was the full text, after

477
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,360
looking at the images, it was confirmed that

478
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,160

479
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,480
these are the core documents of Iran's military nuclear program.  And only after this,

480
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,600
UC Cohen told his entire staff

481
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,600
and these 20 agents that we are on it.   There

482
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
is no stopping now.

483
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,240
Take out all the documents.  The team then

484
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
started working continuously with these 20 agents.  Lucy Kohin had

485
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,520
told her team that we are on it.

486
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,240
Now you have to work as quickly as possible.   The

487
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,280
agents quickly began opening all the safes that were there using

488
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,840
the 3600

489
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,880
degree torch.

490
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,520
Started burning it.  There were approximately 500

491
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,400
pages, more than 500 pages,

492
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,039
and 163 series containing videos,

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,280
plus memos from Iran, all of which were

494
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,520
collected.  Well, in the meantime, there was another

495
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,240
thing, Mossad's plan was so

496
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,160
strategic,

497
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
they had done such good planning here, you see

498
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,320
that in the meantime Mossad had started running multiple

499
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,240
decoy trucks on the

500
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
borders of Tehran and around Tehran;

501
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,919
why were they started running so that

502
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,760
if any Iranian security guard

503
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,919
comes here in between or whenever they come to

504
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,160
know about this, their full

505
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
attention can be diverted so that their

506
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
attention goes on these multiple decoy trucks to ensure that no

507
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,559
document is being lost in them,

508
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,280
when here their agents collected all the 500

509
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,440
documents, 163 CDs.

510
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Collected all the videos and everything.

511
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,200
After this, the decoy trucks were just

512
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
a decoy.  Basically there was a single truck.

513
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
A big truck in which all these things are

514
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,360
loaded by the agents.  And

515
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,600
finally this truck is made to cross the border.  After

516
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,799
crossing the border by road they

517
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,200
tell here that this has been sent.  A truck belonging to

518
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,039
some Iranian officer, some military man,

519
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
Iran's forces did not notice this.

520
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,480
Israel had completed its entire work very smoothly in

521
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,919
before 6 hours and 29 minutes.   The

522
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,159
next day, on 1 February 2018, early in the morning at 7:00

523
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,000
AM, the Iranian guards who were on

524
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,159
duty here, reached the spot.   The

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,720
scene he saw was that the

526
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,600
gates and heavy doors were broken.  All the

527
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,679
apples were half burnt in some places and half burnt in other places.

528
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
They were broken and

529
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,240
all the documents were missing.  Especially the

530
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,200
black binding files were also missing.

531
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,000
Whatever was Israel's main agenda, whatever was Israel

532
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,880
's main focus, was its target.  All these things were

533
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,440
missing.  The guards who came

534
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,919
raised the alarm.  When I saw that it had been hacked here.

535
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,000
Finally he was stabilized.   The

536
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,799
alarm was sounded and the rest of the Iranian authorities

537
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,600
finally arrived here.  The entire country came to

538
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,760
know that

539
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,280
secrets of nuclear documents had been stolen here.

540
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,280
Only after this, Iran put thousands of its

541
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,440
officers, security personnel and

542
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,120
police personnel on investigation.

543
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,080
All the exit points were closed.

544
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,559
But till now

545
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,200
all the operators were from Iran and Israel.  Some 20 of the operatives had

546
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,280
disappeared inside Iran.  They had become mingled together.  The

547
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,280
rest of the people from outside had

548
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,760
reached Israel.   The

549
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,480
documents had reached Israel safely.

550
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,039
Musad had delivered them and the

551
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,159
entire plan was over.  In a way, it

552
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,480
means it was made successful.

553
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,080
In April 2018.  Well in the meantime you

554
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,919
see this happened in February.

555
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,919
Two months pass from February to April.

556
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,280
Iran in the middle of two months because the

557
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,280
condition was such that I was beaten up and couldn't even cry.

558
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,799
That thing is here.  So he did

559
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
not tell anyone in the entire country.

560
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,200
Especially, nobody in the entire world came to

561
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,120
know that

562
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,880
such a huge incident had taken place in Iran

563
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,799
because how could they tell as they had always been

564
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,120
hiding the fact that

565
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,640
no work was being done on nuclear weapons here.

566
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,880
This matter was kept hidden for two months.

567
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,559
But after this, Israel

568
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,760
's Prime Minister Benjamin Netan

569
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,520
Yau visited the US in April 2018.

570
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
Reach the White House.  He

571
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,520
meets President Trump and in a private

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,400
briefing, he

573
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720

574
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
told him about this entire operation, this secret mission.

575
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
When Trump was informed about this mission, the

576
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,240
reality of Iran was revealed,

577
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,919
that Israel has always been saying that

578
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,720
Iran is working on its nuclear weapon

579
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,000
and this is wrong, and if they are doing such things, then it

580
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,080
could be a threat to us.

581
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,080
So this matter was told to Trump there and

582
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,039
only after this a press conference was held.

583
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,520

584
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,600
You all must have seen that press conference of Netaji in 2018.  In that, he

585
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
clearly said about this bust,

586
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,320
about this entire operation, and disclosed it

587
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
and said that this is one of the greatest

588
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,799
intelligence achievements in the history of Israel, it is the

589
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,039

590
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,919
greatest achievement in the intelligence history.  This is the proof

591
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,559
that despite signing the JCPOA,

592
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,480
Iran was working on its weapons.

593
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,240
Iran lied to the world about

594
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,400
its civilian program and claimed that it was a

595
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600

596
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,960
program for its civilians and that it was working on it.

597
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,440
We don't work on Nuclear Purple.

598
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,280
All these things were lies.  In Iran's

599
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
program, it was also shown

600
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,440
through those documents that till 2003 they were

601
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,360
working on it very strongly.

602
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,600
After that,

603
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,080
how he has been working continuously since 2003 in secret, till now in

604
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,000
2018.

605
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,280
Netan Ya showed all these things in front of the whole world.

606
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,880
After all this, the

607
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,720
US pulled itself out of the JCPOA in the very next month, in May 2018.

608
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,320
This was a complete agreement

609
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,960
in which along with the US and European powers,

610
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,120
two other countries were also included in it.  The

611
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,280

612
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,440
US pulled itself out of the entire agreement that Iran had with them.  Trump

613
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,120
pulled himself out, and all these

614
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,760
documents also revealed that the

615
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,520
then President, Hassan Rouhani, had formed

616
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
a Council for Advanced

617
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,679
Technology, because he was a member of it at that time, and

618
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,919
he was continuously approving this entire program.

619
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
He

620
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,400
approved it.  Iran's nuclear weapons

621
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
program.  With the support of IRGC, which are their

622
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,960
Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds

623
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
Force, this entire nuclear

624
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,080
program was run covertly, and

625
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,679
they were working continuously.  Israel did

626
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,679
not stop here even after this.  He got all these things done.  The

627
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,720
US was removed from JCPO A.

628
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,279
It is reported that in the last week of April,

629
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
under the guidance of Benjamin Nitin Yahoo, the Israeli

630
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,039
government called three reporters to a

631
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,720
secret location.  One of them was a

632
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,760
reporter from the New York Times and

633
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,880
he was shown all these documents in a secure intelligence facility at this secret location.

634
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,799

635
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
These three

636
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
reporters were selected.

637
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
When this was shown to these three, why was it shown from here

638
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
so that this

639
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,159
news could spread across the world.

640
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
All these things could be published in big newspapers like New York Times about

641
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,200
how Iran was

642
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,159
working.  All these documents were shown

643
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,400
and it came to light that the IAEA

644
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,480
inspectors who regularly went to Iran to

645
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,159
suspect

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,400
whether these people were doing any such work on the

647
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,559
nuclear sector, it was also revealed later how

648
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
they worked secretly

649
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,720
so that the IAEA inspectors could

650
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,440
not catch Iran.  All these things

651
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,000
came to light.  In addition, Israel had one Robert

652
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,039
Kelly, a nuclear engineer and

653
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,440
inspector for XIA.  I showed these documents to him also in Vienna.

654
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,960
When this document was

655
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,480
shown to him, Robert Kelly said,

656
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,360
it's quite good.  The paper shows the

657
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,039
guys working on the nuclear bomb.  This was

658
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,279
his statement from here.  It

659
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,600
went very viral all around the world.  American and

660
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,760
British intelligence officers

661
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,360
also detected that from

662
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
these documents it is clear

663
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,559
that Iran was working on its nuclear weapon.

664
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,480
And finally these were the files that were stolen in 2018.

665
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,480

666
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
In a secret operation, Israel

667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,600
extracted these secrets from that warehouse in Iran within one night.

668
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,520
After this it is coming to light that the recent

669
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,679
strikes have been done with such

670
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,440
precise shooting

671
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
by Israel on all those nuclear sites of Iran.

672
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,159
Whether it was in Parchim, whether it

673
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,080
was in Fodo, whether it was somewhere else.  These locations have been extracted under

674
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,679
these documents on all those military bases.

675
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,000

676
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,640
This is such a secret mission that

677
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,880
not only exposed Iran's nuclear mission and its

678
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,640
process of making a bomb,

679
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,679
but it also showed to

680
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,640
what lengths Israel can go.   There was

681
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,039
a complete secret mission of 2018 which was

682
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,880
finally used in 2025 when it came to

683
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,360
carrying out a nuclear strike.

684
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,120
