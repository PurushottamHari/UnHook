And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, the tragic incident that happened yesterday, the kind of plane crash that happened in Ahmedabad, you all saw that hardly anyone will ever be able to forget it because it was the biggest crash here in recent times.  Just think, 241 people lost their lives. It is a miracle that a person's life was saved here.  How it happened, what happened, we will know later.  But here you need to understand one thing that the plane which has crashed is basically a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is being said since yesterday, you must have been seeing that everywhere on social media news, it is being said that it was being called the safest plane till date. But here I would like to tell you that last year a very big news came related to this plane, that is, this 787 Dream Liner is made by Boeing, here the whistle blowers who have already worked on Boeing 787 Dream Liner, they told about it that there are some flaws in it and somewhere, after the plane crash yesterday, a lot of discussions started happening about it. So in this video I will tell you in detail what exactly happened ?  What do the whistle blowers here have to say and can we relate this to the plane crash that happened yesterday.  There is a lot to know.  Let's move on.  Look, first of all you all must know that yesterday the Air India AI171 7878 Dreamliner which was going from Ahmedabad to London, crashed and as I was telling you, there is one survivor which is a big miracle in itself. And leave it for just a few minutes.  That is, exactly, if you look at the Ahmedabad Airport, you can see that when it started taking off from the runway, that is, it left the ground, then from there to the hostel of BJ Medical College, if you see the distance, the timing is just within 32 seconds, which means the pilot did not have even 1 minute to save this plane in any way.  And it is a very sad incident that after take off, it hardly reached an attitude of 625 feet and then it started going down and crashed completely.  In fact, let me tell you a little bit, till now you can see that between 2005 and 2023, some data was taken that whatever incidents happen related to airplanes, at what time do they happen? So whether it is during landing, during take off, or when it is cruising in the air. Does it crash when it is several thousand feet high?  When does it happen exactly?  So in most cases you will see this at the time of landing and tapecuff.   In fact, you can see the maximum 53% of accidents that happen here in commercial civil aviation, you will see that most of them happen at the time of landing. Then second comes your time of take off.  So one thing you have to understand is that landing and take-off are very crucial because the time available during these phases means the pilot has very little time to react. For example, suppose there is a plane flying at 36,000 feet.  So here the pilot has time and space. Like I will give you an example here that suppose any plane has two engines. For example, this 787 Dream Liner also had two engines.  So if this fails, but if the flight is at 36000 feet, then it is not the case that if both the engines fail, the flight will crash right there.  It is not like that. It basically glides on.  To glide means that suppose if you are falling down for 1 mile, losing attitude, then this 10 miles also decides your distance. Meaning it keeps you gliding. So because of this, if you look at it this way, at 36,000 feet, the pilot has approximately 8 minutes to handle things.  So here there are chances that it may be landed somewhere.  Many lives of people can be saved.  So there is a lot of opportunity. And that is one of the biggest reasons here, as you can see, during the crucial period of landing and takeoff, if any problem occurs here, then the chances of an accident are the highest.  Now the question is, why is this incident that happened yesterday with Boeing 7 87 so crucial ?  The first thing is that for the first time, your Dream Liner, your entire aircraft, crashed.  You will see this for the first time in the last 13 years because the Dream Liner was launched for the first time in 2011. And because of this the question arises about its long term reliability, maintenance and structural issues which I will discuss with you further.  And in fact if you say as I told you that this was the biggest tragedy in recent years.  Not just in India but in the entire world if you look at all the aircraft- related incidents, you will see the highest number of deaths right now. Well now the question arises that what happened last year?  Exactly, if you see, almost 1 year ago, 1 year before this accident happened yesterday, in April 2024, there was an engineer here who had worked on the Dream Liner 787.  The engineers were doing this work with Boeing. His name is Sam Selepor.  And if you see this, he had tested this before the US Congress. Meaning, just like there is Parliament in India, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, similarly there is US Congress and in front of them, this engineer had tested and exposed the manufacturing defect in 787 Dreamliner.  In a way he said that shortcuts were used in making it. What was his allegation here?  Let me tell you a little bit in detail.  Basically, whatever he mentioned about the defect here, it was regarding the fuselage joints. Well what is this?  Look, you are seeing this complete aircraft, its main body structure, this entire main part to which the wings, tail and everything is attached.  So this part is what we call fuselage.  For example, I just made a video also. Just a few days ago, the news came that the fuselage of the Rafale fighter aircraft will now be manufactured in India jointly by Tata and Dassault.  This will be the first time that the main body part of Rafale, which is outside France, is being manufactured in India.  So it is obvious that the fuselage you are seeing is not made in its entirety in one go. It has different sections as you can see here.  So what happened here is that the engineer, Sam Selpore, said that this fuselage section is not properly joined.  There is a gap in this.  The sections that you can see, there is some gap in these sections , this is a manufacturing defect, he told about it here and he told about the danger that as this aircraft gets used, its joint may gradually increase.  And because of this the entire plane can break at any time.  It might break in the middle. He talked about this and also said that the Boeing employees here made some changes to make the test results pass. They did some misalignment due to which it does not fail in the test result.  And he also said that I tried to raise my voice regarding this within the Being company and I was told to retaliate and say keep quiet and don’t tell anyone about it. Look, these two companies in the world, whether it is Airbus or Being, these are very big companies.  It takes many years to build planes etc. and millions and billions of dollars are spent on it.  So she is never going to back down. Many times they have been accused of silencing their employees.  If any whistle is blown or someone tries to tell anything then they are silenced ultimately for profit making. So what actually happened here? They had made an urgent call and the regulator in America, the aviation regulator FAA, had appealed to them that this Boeing 787 Dreamliner should be stopped on an immediate basis, that is, all such aircraft should be grounded because issues are arising in it, as I told you.  Well, what was Boeing's reaction to this, and what was the FAA's reaction?  Boeing denied all these issues and said that there is no safety threat from this.  He further added that as per our engineering assessment, there is no evidence where you will find gaps in the sections and the company acknowledged that there are some minor production inconsistencies which will get resolved in the future.  There is not going to be any major problem in this and as far as the US regulators are concerned, they have initiated the internal audit and also created the independent review panel, but the US regulators also did not ground the fleet of 787, allowed it to fly and said that in future we will do more quality checks and whatever things are required. But the question here is, is the crash that happened yesterday in Ahmedabad different?  Because the Air India crash that has happened here is the first fatal accident, as I told you, of 7 87 Dream Liner. So immediately the speculation that arises here is whether Sam Selepore was right, whether the incident that happened yesterday happened because of the doubts raised by him, because now look, there will be an investigation regarding this, things will be found out, so here somewhere or the other you will find a coincidence that this aircraft which has crashed, it is among the first batch of 787 deliveries because the 787 that was delivered was acquired by Air India in 2014.  So what happens is that the earlier deliveries, the starting deliveries, are the most vulnerable. Guess Boeing might have improved a few things here. She would have improved things in the future. So the initial deliveries will be whatever the issues are in it.  So somewhere or the other you get to see this coincidence.  Well here, when this investigation is done then who is the main focus going to be on? Look at this very carefully.  This will be seen here first.  Was there any kind of pilot error in the incident that happened in Ahmedabad yesterday?  Was there a system malfunction?  Was there any engine failure? Then secondly here you might have also seen since yesterday that there is a lot of discussion about flaps. Basically you must have noticed that you get to see such flaps in the wing of any aircraft.  The flap is at the top, sometimes at the bottom.  So yesterday I was seeing some experts saying that when the flight is taking off, the flaps should be at 5°.  But in the videos that are coming out of the plane, it appears that the flap is not raised.  It is on the bottom side.  So, somewhere it will also be found out whether the flaps were in the right place or not.   The landing gear, the wheels with which it takes off, after that you have to immediately put the landing gear in.  Was it done inside or not?  Apart from this, the Rolls Rycet 1000 engine installed in the aircraft, was it able to provide proper thrust or not?  Was there any type of bird strike?  And ultimately there will also be a discussion on whether the disbonding was due to structural issues and whether the mid-air breakup of the aircraft happened because of that. Efforts will be made here to find out all these things. Now see why does this matter so much globally? Because if you see, Boeing has been continuously in the news for the last few years regarding negative things.  For example, in 2018, 2019, Boeing's 737 Max crashed.  Two major accidents had happened. And again here the ongoing issues are regarding quality control, deliveries are getting delayed.  Fines have also been imposed by regulation. So, somewhere here, there was a lot of criticism against Boeing that profit first, safety first, this kind of culture has become formed in the company.  In fact, there are some series etc. related to this on Netflix, you must watch them. Your eyes will be opened to a lot about how these aviation companies are doing wrong things also.  Here questions also arise regarding aviation safety.  This dream liner was being called a symbol of advanced aviation engineering.  So, was the warning of Salepur not taken into proper consideration?  Will the rest of the airlines also be affected or not?  Because you must understand that Air India has left its remaining 7-87 Dreamliners for inspection and until they get clearance, they will not fly them.  So, this could have an impact on the remaining 787 Dreamliners and as I told you, it will also have an impact on Air India.  But the biggest impact you will see at this time is on Boeing shares.  In fact, when this Ahmedabad crash broke out yesterday, the market in America, if you look at it as per Indian timing, it opens at around 7:30 am.  So even before that, Boeing's share had crashed by almost 8% in the pre-market.  But last night when I was recording the video, the drop was around 5%. So it is obvious that you will clearly see that when a plane crashes, its direct impact is seen on the shares of that company. And that is why if you look at the families of the victims, they somewhere say that there should also be a criminal investigation against Boeing to find out whether they did anything wrong.  In fact, if you look at Boeing shares in the last 5 years, they are not able to rise and somewhere or the other you will find all these reasons. Well, when I was making this video, I thought that many of you might be wondering that in India, our aviation companies, airline companies, which company's aircraft are used by them.  So you can see this, through this you will understand very well which airline company uses which company. use flight. So for example, if we talk about Indigo, then Indigo does not have any Boeing airplanes.  And all the airplanes are actually narrow bodied ones, they are mostly used in domestic purposes.  So you will get to see the A320 family that belongs to Air Bus. As far as Air India is concerned, you all know Vistara and Air India Express, they are the same company.  It comes under Tata Group.  So you will get to see a mix with them. A lot of Boeings are used by them and some Air Bus planes are also seen with them. SPIJet is done, Alaska is done. You will see only Boeing planes near them.  Now what is go first is it is grounded.  The flight has not taken off yet. But they had air buses. So if you look at the present, Indigo is the only company which has all the planes and air buses. Look, I am not doing any ad or anything.  I am just giving you the information because many people might think that, hey, I am telling you to choose this flight or there is nothing like that. I am just trying to give you information. And here, if we compare, Boeing was founded in 1916, AirB is a European company.   It was founded in France.  Boeing is an American company.  Please take care.  So Airb was founded in 1917. If you look at the market share now, Boeing's market share is 42%.  Airbnb is 58%.  Infact there was a time when there was nothing greater than Boe.  Meaning AirB was nothing in front of Boeing. Gradually the trust in Air Bus increased and today you can see how big the market share has become and even in commercial aircraft you will be able to see which one is narrow bordered, white bordered, which one is with Boeing and which one is with Air Bus. So I hope friends this video would have been helpful to you, you must have got to know a lot from it and before leaving, a very interesting question here, we just talked about Boeing 787 Dream Liner, two statements related to this are given here, you have to tell which one is correct and its right answer, you all know, you will find it on my Instagram brother, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Twitter.
