1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,519
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,600
Hello Friends.  Friends, the tragic

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,000
incident that happened yesterday, the kind of

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
plane crash that happened in Ahmedabad, you all saw that

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
hardly anyone will ever be able to forget it because

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,160
it was the biggest crash here in recent times.  Just

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,399
think, 241 people lost their lives.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
It is a miracle that a

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
person's life was saved here.  How it happened,

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,440
what happened, we will know later.  But

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
here you need to understand one thing that the

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,239
plane which has crashed is basically a

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
Boeing 787

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,879
Dreamliner, which is being said

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
since yesterday, you must have been seeing that

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,439
everywhere on social media news, it is being said that

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,360
it was being called the safest plane till date.

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,640
But here I would like to tell you that

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,360
last year a very big news came

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,520
related to this plane, that is, this 787 Dream

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
Liner is made by Boeing,

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,400
here the whistle blowers who have

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,400
already worked on Boeing 787 Dream

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,119
Liner, they told about it

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,680
that there are some flaws in it and

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,759
somewhere, after the plane crash yesterday, a

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,439
lot of discussions started happening about it.

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
So in this video I will

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
tell you in detail what exactly happened

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,759
?  What do the whistle blowers here have to

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
say and can

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,240
we relate this to the plane crash that happened yesterday.  There is

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
a lot to know.  Let's

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
move on.  Look, first of all you all must

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,439
know that yesterday the Air India

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,640
AI171 7878 Dreamliner which was going from Ahmedabad to London,

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,880
crashed and as

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,880
I was telling you, there is one survivor which is

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,759
a big miracle in itself.

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,399
And leave it for just a few minutes.  That is,

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,960
exactly, if you look at the Ahmedabad

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,440
Airport, you can see that when it started taking off from the runway, that is, it

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,239

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,040
left the ground, then from there to the

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,040
hostel of BJ Medical College,

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,239
if you see the distance, the timing is

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,040
just within 32 seconds, which means the pilot did

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,599
not have even 1 minute to

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,160
save this plane in any way.  And it is a

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,280
very sad incident that after take off, it

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,319
hardly reached an attitude of 625 feet

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
and then it started going down and

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,239
crashed completely.  In fact, let me

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
tell you a little bit, till now you can see that

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,760
between 2005 and 2023, some data was

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
taken that whatever incidents happen

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,120
related to airplanes, at what time do they happen?

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,040
So whether it is during landing, during take off, or

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
when it is cruising in the air.

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,040
Does it crash when it is several thousand feet high?  When does it happen

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,680
exactly?  So in most cases you will

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,519
see this at the time of landing and tapecuff.   In

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
fact, you can see the maximum

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,879
53% of accidents that happen here in

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
commercial civil aviation, you will

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
see that most of them happen at the time of landing.

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
Then second comes

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,599
your time of take off.  So one thing you have to understand is

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,920
that landing and take-off are very

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,120
crucial because the

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,920
time available during these phases means the pilot has

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
very little time to react.

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,519
For example, suppose there is a plane

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,080
flying at 36,000 feet.  So here the

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,239
pilot has time and space.

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,280
Like I will give you an example

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,640
here that suppose any plane has two engines.

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
For example, this 787 Dream

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Liner also had two engines.  So if this fails,

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,720
but if the flight is

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,879
at 36000 feet, then it is not the case that if both the engines

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
fail, the flight will

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,280
crash right there.  It is not like that.

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,680
It basically glides on.  To glide

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
means that suppose if

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,519
you are falling down for 1 mile, losing attitude,

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,080
then this 10 miles also decides your distance.

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
Meaning it keeps you gliding.

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,720
So because of this, if you

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,360
look at it this way, at 36,000 feet, the pilot has

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,439
approximately 8 minutes to

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
handle things.  So here there are chances

105
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
that

106
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,919
it may be landed somewhere.  Many

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,080
lives of people can be saved.  So there is a lot of opportunity.

108
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
And that is one of the biggest reasons

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,479
here, as you can see,

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
during the crucial period of landing and takeoff,

111
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,199
if any problem

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,440
occurs here, then the chances of an accident are the

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
highest.  Now the question is,

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479

115
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,360
why is this incident that happened yesterday with Boeing 7 87 so crucial

116
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,280
?  The first thing is that for the first time, your

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,759
Dream Liner,

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,560
your entire aircraft,

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,800
crashed.  You will see this for the first time in the last 13 years

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,360
because the

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Dream Liner was launched for the first time in 2011.

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,680
And because of this the

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,160
question arises about its long term

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
reliability, maintenance and structural issues

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
which I will discuss with you further.  And in

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,800
fact if you say as I told you that

127
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,639
this was the biggest tragedy in recent years.  Not

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
just in India but in the entire world

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,560
if you look at all the aircraft-

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
related incidents,

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
you will see the highest number of deaths right now.

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
Well now the question arises

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,479
that what happened last year?  Exactly, if you

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,160
see, almost 1 year ago,

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,360
1 year before this accident happened yesterday, in April 2024, there was

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,639
an engineer here who had

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,800
worked on the Dream Liner 787.  The engineers were doing this work with Boeing.

138
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
His name is Sam

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,759
Selepor.  And if you see this, he had

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
tested this before the US Congress.

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,320
Meaning, just like there is Parliament in India,

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, similarly

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,199
there is US Congress and in front of them,

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
this engineer had tested

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,639
and exposed the

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,560
manufacturing defect in 787 Dreamliner.  In a

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
way he said that shortcuts were

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
used in making it.

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
What was his allegation here?  Let me tell you a little

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
bit in detail.  Basically,

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,199
whatever he mentioned about the defect here, it was

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
regarding the fuselage joints.

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,360
Well what is this?  Look,

154
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
you are seeing this complete aircraft, its

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,319
main body structure, this entire

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,880
main part to which the wings, tail and

157
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,479
everything is attached.  So this part is what

158
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
we call fuselage.  For

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,319
example, I just made a video also.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,880
Just a few days ago, the news came that the

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,720
fuselage of the Rafale fighter aircraft will

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
now be manufactured in India

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,680
jointly by Tata and Dassault.  This will be the first time

164
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,080
that the main body part of Rafale, which is outside France, is being

165
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
manufactured in India.  So it is obvious that the

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,160
fuselage you are seeing is

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
not made in its entirety in one go.

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,240
It has different sections as

170
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,520
you can see here.  So what

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,479
happened here is that the engineer, Sam Selpore,

172
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,759
said that this fuselage

173
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,240
section is not properly joined.  There

174
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,639
is a gap in this.  The sections that you can

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,199
see, there is some gap in these sections

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,960
, this is a manufacturing

177
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
defect, he told about it here

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,560
and he told about the danger that

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,280
as this aircraft gets used,

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,000
its joint may gradually

181
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,560
increase.  And because of this the

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,880
entire plane

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960
can break at any time.  It might break in the middle.

184
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,520
He talked about this

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,599
and also said that the

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,240
Boeing employees here made some changes to make the test results pass.

187
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,800

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,880
They did some misalignment

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,880
due to which

190
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,599
it does not fail in the test result.  And he also

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,080
said that I tried to raise my voice regarding this

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
within the Being company and I was

193
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,639

194
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,479
told to retaliate and say keep quiet and don’t tell anyone about it.

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,879
Look, these two companies in the world,

196
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,080
whether it is Airbus or Being, these are

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,479
very big companies.  It takes many years to

198
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
build planes etc. and

199
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,280
millions and billions of dollars are

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
spent on it.  So she is never going to back down.

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
Many times they have been accused of

202
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,199
silencing their employees.  If

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,120
any whistle is blown or someone

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
tries to tell anything then they are silenced

205
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,599
ultimately for profit making.

206
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
So what actually happened here?

207
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,479
They had made an urgent call and the

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,759
regulator in America, the aviation

209
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,560
regulator FAA, had appealed to them

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,039
that this Boeing 787 Dreamliner

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
should be stopped on an immediate basis, that

212
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,120
is,

213
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
all such aircraft should be grounded because issues are arising in it,

214
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
as I told you.  Well,

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,240
what was Boeing's reaction to this, and what was the FAA's

216
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,159
reaction?  Boeing denied all these issues

217
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
and said that there is

218
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
no safety threat from this.  He further added

219
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
that as per our engineering assessment, there is

220
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,360
no evidence

221
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,519
where you will find gaps in the sections

222
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,880
and the company acknowledged that there are some

223
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,880
minor production inconsistencies which will get

224
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
resolved in the future.  There is not going to be any

225
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,279
major problem in this and as far as the

226
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,000
US regulators are concerned, they have

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,000
initiated the internal audit and also

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,560
created the independent review panel, but the US

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,560
regulators also did not ground the fleet of 787, allowed

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,200
it to

232
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,920
fly and said that in future we will do

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,160
more quality checks and whatever things are required.

234
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
But the question here is, is the

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,040

236
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
crash that happened yesterday in Ahmedabad different?  Because the

237
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,440
Air India crash that has happened here is the

238
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,839
first fatal accident, as I

239
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
told you, of 7 87 Dream Liner.

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,560
So immediately the speculation that

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
arises here is whether Sam Selepore was

242
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,920
right, whether the incident that happened yesterday

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,160
happened because of the doubts raised by him, because now look, there will be an

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
investigation regarding this, things will be

246
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
found out, so here somewhere or the other

247
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
you will find a coincidence that this

248
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,880
aircraft which has crashed, it is among the

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,320
first batch of 787 deliveries because the

250
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,399
787 that was delivered was

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
acquired by Air India in 2014.  So what happens is that the

252
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,320
earlier deliveries, the starting

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,320
deliveries, are the most vulnerable.

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,800
Guess Boeing might have improved a few things here.

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
She would have improved things in the future.

256
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,320
So the initial

257
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,480
deliveries will be whatever the

258
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,200
issues are in it.  So somewhere or the other

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,360
you get to see this coincidence.  Well

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
here, when this investigation is done

261
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
then who is the main focus going to be on?

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360
Look at this very carefully.  This will be seen here first.  Was there

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,320

264
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,240
any kind of

265
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
pilot error in the incident that happened in Ahmedabad yesterday?  Was there a system

266
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,880
malfunction?  Was there any engine failure?

267
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
Then secondly here you might have also seen since yesterday that there is

268
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,959
a lot of discussion about flaps.

269
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
Basically you must have noticed that

270
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,959

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,880
you get to see such flaps in the wing of any aircraft.  The

272
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,360
flap is at the top,

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
sometimes at the bottom.  So yesterday I was seeing

274
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
some experts saying

275
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
that when the flight is taking off, the

276
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,279
flaps should be at 5°.  But in the

277
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,120
videos that are coming out of the plane,

278
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,279
it appears that the flap is

279
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,440
not raised.  It is on the bottom side.  So,

280
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
somewhere it will also be found out

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
whether the flaps were in the right place or not.   The

282
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,240
landing gear, the wheels with which

283
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,320
it takes off, after that

284
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,040
you have to immediately put the landing gear in.  Was it done

285
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,959
inside or not?  Apart from this, the

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,480
Rolls Rycet 1000 engine installed in the aircraft, was

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,000
it able to provide proper thrust

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
or not?  Was there any type of

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,720
bird strike?  And ultimately there will

290
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,360
also be a discussion on whether the

291
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,560
disbonding was due to structural issues and

293
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,079
whether the

294
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,320
mid-air breakup

295
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,079
of the aircraft happened because of that. Efforts will be made here to find out all these things.

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Now see

297
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
why does this matter so much globally?

298
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,640
Because if you see, Boeing has been

299
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,600
continuously in the news for the last few years

300
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,440
regarding negative things.  For example,

301
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,920
in 2018, 2019, Boeing's 737 Max

302
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,480
crashed.  Two major accidents had happened.

303
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,800
And again here the ongoing issues are

304
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
regarding quality control, deliveries are getting

305
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
delayed.  Fines have also been imposed by regulation.

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
So, somewhere here, there was

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279

308
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,360
a lot of criticism against Boeing that profit first, safety first,

309
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,760
this kind of culture has become formed

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
in the company.  In fact, there are some series etc. related to this on Netflix,

311
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
you must watch them.

312
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,320
Your eyes will be opened to a lot about how

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,880
these aviation companies are doing wrong things

314
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,639
also.  Here

315
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
questions also arise regarding aviation safety.  This dream liner was being

316
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440

317
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,079
called a symbol of advanced aviation engineering.  So, was the

318
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,240
warning of Salepur

319
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
not taken into proper consideration?  Will the rest of the

320
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,079
airlines also be affected or

321
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,399
not?  Because you must understand that Air India has

322
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,120

323
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,880
left its remaining 7-87 Dreamliners for inspection and

324
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,959
until they get clearance, they will

325
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,360
not fly them.  So, this

326
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,440
could have an impact on the remaining 787 Dreamliners

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
and as

328
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
I told you, it will also have an impact on Air India.  But the biggest

329
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,600
impact you will see at this time is on Boeing shares.  In

330
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,920
fact, when

331
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
this Ahmedabad crash broke out yesterday, the

332
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
market in America, if you

333
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,000
look at it as per Indian timing, it

334
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,480
opens at around 7:30 am.  So even before that,

335
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,760
Boeing's share had

336
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,200
crashed by almost 8% in the pre-market.  But last night

337
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,680
when I was recording the video, the

338
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,519
drop was around 5%.

339
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,920
So it is obvious that you will

340
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,760
clearly see that when a plane

341
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
crashes, its direct impact is

342
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,279
seen on the shares of that company.

343
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,920
And that is why if you look at the families

344
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,920
of the victims, they somewhere

345
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
say that there

346
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,440
should also be a criminal investigation against Boeing to find out

347
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
whether they did anything wrong.  In fact,

348
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
if you look at Boeing shares in the last 5 years,

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,200
they are not able to rise and somewhere or the other

350
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
you will find all these reasons.

351
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,639
Well, when I was making this video,

352
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I thought that many of you might be

353
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,760
wondering that in India, our

354
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,360
aviation companies, airline companies,

355
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,519
which company's aircraft are

356
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
used by them.  So you can see this,

357
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,240
through this you will understand very well

358
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
which airline company uses which company.

359
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
use flight.

360
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,160
So for example, if we

361
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,920
talk about Indigo, then Indigo does not have any

362
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,600
Boeing airplanes.  And all the

363
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
airplanes are actually narrow

364
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
bodied ones, they are mostly

365
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
used in domestic purposes.  So

366
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,639
you will get to see the A320 family that belongs to Air Bus.

367
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,639
As far as Air India is concerned,

368
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,480
you all know Vistara and Air India

369
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,480
Express, they are the same company.  It

370
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,120
comes under Tata Group.  So you will get to see a mix with them.

371
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,199
A lot of

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,519
Boeings are used by them and some

373
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,920
Air Bus planes are also seen with them.

374
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,480
SPIJet is done, Alaska is done.

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,399

376
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
You will see only Boeing planes near them.  Now what is go first is

377
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,920
it is grounded.  The flight has not taken off yet.

378
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,839
But they had air buses.

379
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,240
So if you look at the present,

380
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,800
Indigo is the only company which

381
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480
has all the planes and air buses.

382
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
Look, I am not doing any ad or anything.  I am

383
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,160
just giving you the information

384
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,000
because many people might think

385
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
that, hey, I am telling you to

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
choose this flight or there is nothing like that.

387
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
I am just trying to give you information.

388
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,839
And here, if we compare,

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,560
Boeing was founded

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,279
in 1916, AirB is a European company.   It was

391
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,279
founded in France.  Boeing is an

392
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,000
American company.  Please take care.  So

393
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,680
Airb was founded in 1917.

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
If you look at the market share now, Boeing's market

395
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,760
share is 42%.  Airbnb is 58%.  Infact there was a time

396
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,760
when there was nothing greater than Boe.  Meaning

397
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,480
AirB was nothing in front of Boeing.

398
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,720
Gradually the trust in Air Bus

399
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
increased and today you can see how

400
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,480
big the market share has become and

401
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,199
even in commercial aircraft you will be able to see

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
which one is narrow bordered, white bordered, which one is with Boeing and which one is

403
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
with Air Bus. So I

404
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,279
hope friends this video would have been

405
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,800
helpful to you, you must have got to

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480

407
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,279
very interesting question here,
