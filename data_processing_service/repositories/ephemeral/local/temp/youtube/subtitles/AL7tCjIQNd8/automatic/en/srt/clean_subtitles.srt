In 1992, Papa had a stock broking business.  In the same year, Harshad Mehta scam happened and the entire business closed down overnight. Papa had to collect money from some people and give it to some others. Calls are coming from those to whom it was to be given.  And the people from whom we were supposed to take the phone are not picking up the phone.  It was winter time. My sister was one and a half years old.  So papa told mummy that let's take this with us. go to his house.  Maybe he will take pity on me and return the money.  This was the situation at that time. I was born that same year.  Now why am I telling you this entire Rama Katha ? Because my parents worked hard for the next 30 years so that I would not have to beg before anyone. They walk so that I can run.  I am not asking what is the time duration you have used.  5 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 seconds, you use strike footage without my permission.  I put a claim on YouTube, they have put a strike, copyright strike.  ANI has put pressure on me that if I do n't pay ₹50,000, my channel will be deleted.  I will just be okay, if you want to do it sir, your channel is going, it is going but now there will be a ruckus. I will tell you everything that Ana told me and show you the emails that she sent, so let's start now. I got my first copyright strike on 20th May for my video on the Kolkata rape case. I made this video many months ago. Who sent the copyright strike? ANI. Why? Because I used 11 seconds of their footage in a 16-minute video. My team members told me that other creators are also getting copyright strikes.  But honestly I didn't think much about it because I thought it should come under fair use.  Fair use is basically a terminology that if you want to make a commentary, then if you take a few seconds of someone's video for a 30 or 20 minute video, then it is allowed.  And I also knew that the worst case is a copyright strike.  We will appeal, it will be solved.  I want multiple copyright strikes like the one sent by ICC in this video. Now in such cases, sometimes the video gets deleted or sometimes it gets demonetized.  That means you cannot make money from it.  But ANI did not stop this problem. A few days later I received another copyright strike for my Operation Sindoor video.  why? Because I used 9 seconds of footage of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in the 38 minute video. According to YouTube, if you get three copyright strikes, your channel gets deleted immediately.  So I was just one strike away from this happening.  At the same time I came to know about an article where it is written that ANI is doing this thing with many other users and asking them Rs 1520 lakhs to remove these strikes.  In fact, my Chief of Staff even spoke to the creator who had received more than three copyright strikes and had his channel deleted.  He spoke to ANI and ANI said give us Rs 22 lakh plus GST and we will solve all this matter for you.  That creator negotiated and eventually paid Rs 18 lakh plus GST.  Why?  Because he used only a few seconds of footage.  This creator then gave me the number of ANI employee who is handling all this.  Two days ago my team member called this man and said brother, we have got the copyright. How to solve it?  Immediately he gave an email and said to email on this. You will receive our response on this and we will remove all the strikes of the channel.   If you don't give, the channel will be deleted.  ANI did not say that we want the revenue from those videos.  He said that we will get the channel deleted if you do not give this money.  So they say give 45 lakh plus GST.  Your penalties will also be included in this and you will get annual subscription of ANI footage. What kind of a method is this to increase your revenue, give a copyright strike and then say give ₹50 lakh and you will get subscription. Then my team member called that ANI employee.  He would ask, how many copyright strikes have you received? I told you to give it.  He said ok just give it to me. You will get six more now.  We have filled total eight. He said brother it's been 15 minutes. I don't give more time than this to anyone. will talk tomorrow.  You can think as much as you want. They know that only two strikes have come so far. So I am not that desperate. Once three strikes come and the channel gets deleted, then he will be desperate. That's why they want the negotiations to continue extending day by day. Once the channel is deleted, they will accept whatever number I say. But the poor guy doesn't know who he is talking to.  The US has a policy that they don't negotiate with kidnappers. At least officially this is the policy and I feel that is my policy also, you have to delete this channel, do it. In the evening itself my team member called that ANI employee and said, boss, you do one thing, then we can do one thing instead of one year, make it for 2 years for this price, 2 years for what 40-45 pay two years, even then that does not make sense, no like think about it suddenly given you 50%, right, what is the deal brother, I am giving you 50% discount, I told Ajeesh that I will not give him even a penny, but you talk to him.  The point being we will never be able to recover that money.  That is if it is a if it is a fair amount like I said if we have to pay Rs 1 lakh per month that is something we can recover some how 30 is a number that we cannot recover.  We will never be able to make that money that investment back.  In the end he would again say to wait for a while.  I will call you back. What should I say? Hmm just hold on hold on.  Ya Ashish can I call you in 2 minutes or ya shore yes I will call you and says leave it now 40 lakhs for two years best deal we have given the discount if we go for the two years I will make it in the 45 ok 40 for 2 years if you are agree ok if you want to go for the one year I will make it 30 plus GST Azish then asked for the breakdown that from where did it come to 40, tell me the breakdown then this guy said that eight copyright strikes have been given.  The penalty for each strike is Rs 5 lakh.  So it becomes 40 lakhs. So either pay Rs 40 lakh as penalty or take a subscription of Rs 40 lakh for 2 years. I wanted to understand what was the breakdown of that 45 lakhs.  See if I will give you the complete breakdown then I am not going to negotiate with them again.  I told you no 4 5 less per month is charges for the subscription penalty is different.  We have stride some seven videos, if you consider that one then 8 5 40 is the penalty and subscription is different, now tell me that, and this is their business model, put a strike and get the channel deleted, tell me this is the condition of our country that businessmen are thinking about how to extort money from other people and not that we should do creative things, solve problems, adopt good methods to earn revenue, and brother there is no logic in his words.  There is no logic.  My team member said that if you use a song from T Series, then T Series just takes the revenue of that video. It is not that you take our subscription of Rs 1 crore.  This doesn't work.  This guy from ANI says that our business model is different.  We don’t follow that. We are a different model.  We don't claim the revenue.  We put the strike.  If you ask the penalty.  You are ready to pay the penalty.  Ok.  You want to take a subscription, then we can consider the wave of on penalties.  And do you know what that guy says at the end, I like Mohak's channel, that's why I talked to him so much, otherwise I would n't have given this much attention to anyone friend Ashish, the best I could have done was I have given that, I have given a lot of discount friend, I didn't even talk to anyone this much boss, but I am considering, come on friend because I love your channel, basically that's why I am talking to you, yes brother he is doing a great favor, he had asked for a deal of 45 lakhs for one year, now he has made it 40 lakhs for two years, who are you brother, who are you to threaten, so the last deal he offers is that if you want one year, give ₹ one lakh and if you want 2 years, then give ₹40 lakhs.  And in the end he tells about a very big creator who recently gave ₹ lakhs to ANI. Last week he told us the name and they paid 50 lakh for one year only 50 lakh plus GST they paid that.  ₹ Lakhs given to sort out this whole matter.  You know, the crazy thing is that ANI has done this same thing with many creators.  Irrespective of their ideology.  And friend, I don't even have any personal enmity.  Neither have I made any video against him nor have I created any content. You can delete my channel, you can ban me on YouTube, you can take away my titles, everything.  I know that I am so smart and hard working, that I will be successful, no matter what.  And you know what?  Our government should know about this.  This is why I wrote an email to the PMO and to IAB Minister Ashwini Vaishnav.  The government should know what is going on in their world.  This is the exact screenshot of the email I sent.  Now I have done my part.  I told all the facts to our ministers. Now it is up to them.  It's not in my control what decision he takes. Maybe he will favour ANI.  If that's true then it will come out in front of everyone what is going on in our country that if you want to become a creator and you make a video on Operation Sindoor, take 8 seconds of footage, for a 30 minute video you will have to pay Rs 50 lakh, this will not happen secretly, now I don't use this and ask so much to subscribe, like and share and it has been a long time but for this video I need your help, first share this video, I want this message to be spread to as many people as possible but avoid any personal attacks, I don't have any personal enmity with those apple choices, you should avoid any personal attacks if they are low we will remain high.  SECOND TARGET ANI WHERE IT HURT THE MOST.  So if you are following on any platform please unsuspectingly subscribe and block them.  Third, if you are a creator and if I have brought any positive change in your life, then please share this message.  Especially those people who appeared in ANI podcasts have become sharp or skilled.  Because friend, the most embarrassment occurs when people around you also say, brother, what are you doing?  So, if these people criticize ANI, maybe they will think that I need to change my behavior.  Finally, if you are a creator who has received a copyright strike from ANI and ANI has behaved similarly with you, then record all the evidence.  Ok?  Emails have been done, call conversations have been done.  Whatever details you have, who was in the email, from whom did the email come, what did they say, make evidence of everything.  In the description and pin comment there are no email addresses of INB Minister and his relevant officials, please send it to them.  Look, if all of us email the Ministry with evidence, then the matter will reach the Minister.  So I would collect all this evidence and share it.  ANI found that several creators had received threats.  I myself know many creators who have donated Rs 12, 15, 18 lakh. As I said, a big creator has given ₹50 lakhs to a creator.  So just imagine how much money ANI would have earned. NI thought I would beg. I will not ask for anything.  The degrees that I have collected in my life, I have not collected them to hang on the wall.  Rather, I have done this so that whenever I encounter such people in life, I can deal with them. So thank you for watching.  If this channel gets deleted don't worry.  A new channel will be created and I will be equally successful.
