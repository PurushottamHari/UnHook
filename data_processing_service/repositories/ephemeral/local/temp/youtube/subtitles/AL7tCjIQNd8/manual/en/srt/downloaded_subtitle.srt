1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
In 1992, Papa had a stock broking

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,560
business.  In the same year, Harshad Mehta scam

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,200
happened and the entire business closed down overnight.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,280
Papa had to collect money from some people and

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,440
give it to some others.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
Calls are coming from those to whom it was to be given.  And the people from whom we were supposed to take the phone are

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,320
not picking up the phone.  It was winter time.

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,400
My sister was one and a half years old.  So papa

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
told mummy that let's take this with us.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,199
go to his house.  Maybe he will take pity on me and

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,359
return the money.  This was the situation at that time.

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
I was born that same year.  Now why am I telling you this entire Rama Katha

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
?

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,239
Because my parents worked hard for the next 30 years

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,960
so that I would not have to beg before anyone.

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,200
They walk so that I can

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,079
run.  I am not asking what is the time

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,280
duration you have used.  5 minutes, 10

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,840
minutes, 10 seconds, you use strike

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
footage without my permission.  I put a claim

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000
on YouTube, they have put a strike,

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
copyright strike.  ANI has

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
put pressure on me that if I do

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
n't pay â‚¹50,000, my channel will be deleted.  I

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,920
will just be okay, if you want to do it sir, your channel is going, it is

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
going but now there will be a ruckus. I will

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,799
tell you everything that Ana

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
told me and show you the emails that she sent, so let's start

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
now. I

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
got my first copyright strike on 20th May

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
for my video on the Kolkata rape case.

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,720
I made this video many months ago.

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
Who sent the copyright strike? ANI.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,680
Why? Because I

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,600
used 11 seconds of their footage in a 16-minute video. My

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
team members told me that other creators are

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
also getting copyright strikes.  But

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
honestly I didn't think much about it

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,520
because I thought it

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,320
should come under fair use.  Fair use is basically a

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,960
terminology that if you want to make a commentary, then if

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,960

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,600
you take a few seconds of someone's video for a 30 or 20 minute video, then it is

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,920
allowed.  And I also knew that the

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
worst case is a copyright strike.  We

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
will appeal, it will be solved.  I want multiple copyright

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
strikes like the one sent by ICC in this video.

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
Now in such cases, sometimes the

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,240
video gets deleted or sometimes it gets

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,479
demonetized.  That means you

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,799
cannot make money from it.  But ANI did not stop this problem.

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
A few days later I received

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
another copyright strike for my Operation

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
Sindoor video.  why?

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Because I

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
used 9 seconds of footage of Defence

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
Minister Rajnath Singh in the 38 minute video.

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
According to YouTube, if you get three copyright

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
strikes, your channel gets

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,239
deleted immediately.  So I was just one

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
strike away from this happening.  At the same

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,200
time I came to know about an article

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,400
where it is written that ANI is doing this thing

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
with many other users and asking them Rs 1520

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
lakhs to remove these strikes.  In

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
fact, my Chief of Staff

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
even spoke to the creator who had

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,760
received more than three copyright strikes and had

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,879
his channel deleted.  He

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,160
spoke to ANI and ANI said

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,080
give us Rs 22 lakh plus GST and we will solve all this

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
matter for you.  That

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
creator negotiated and eventually paid Rs 18 lakh plus

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,120
GST.  Why?  Because he used only a few seconds

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,160
of footage.  This creator

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,720
then gave me the number of ANI employee who is

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
handling all this.  Two days

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,519
ago my team member called this man

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
and said brother, we have got the copyright.

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
How to solve it?  Immediately he

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
gave an email and said to email on this.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
You will receive our response on this and

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
we will remove all the strikes of the channel.   If you

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,040
don't give, the channel will be deleted.  ANI did

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
not say that we

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,879
want the revenue from those videos.  He said that we will get the

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,120
channel deleted if you do

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
not give this money.  So they say give 45 lakh plus

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
GST.  Your penalties will also be included in this

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
and you will

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
get annual subscription of ANI footage.

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
What kind of a method is this to increase your revenue,

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,599
give a copyright strike and then

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
say give â‚¹50 lakh and you will get subscription.

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
Then my team member

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
called that ANI employee.  He would ask,

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
how many copyright strikes have you received?

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,319
I told you to give it.  He said ok just give it to me.

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
You will get six more now.  We have filled total eight.

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,799
He said brother it's been 15 minutes.

101
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,959
I don't give more time than this to anyone.

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
will talk tomorrow.  You can think as much as you want.

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
They know that only two strikes have come so far.

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,159
So I am not that desperate.

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,000
Once three strikes come and the channel gets

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,760
deleted, then he will be desperate.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,239
That's why they want the negotiations to continue extending day by day.

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Once the channel is

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,720
deleted, they will accept whatever number I say.

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
But the poor guy doesn't know

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,560
who he is talking to.  The US has a policy that they don't

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
negotiate with kidnappers.

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
At least officially this is the policy and I feel

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
that is my policy also, you have to delete

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
this channel, do it. In the evening itself my team member

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
called that ANI employee and said, boss, you do

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,600
one thing, then we can do one thing

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,520
instead of one year, make it for 2 years for

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,160
this price, 2 years for what 40-45 pay two

120
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,280
years, even then that does not make sense, no like

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,240
think about it suddenly given you 50%,

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
right, what is the deal brother, I am giving you 50% discount,

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,160
I told Ajeesh

124
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,360
that I will not give him even a penny, but you

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,560
talk to him.  The point being we will never be

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,120
able to recover that money.  That is if it is a if it is

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
a fair amount like I said if we

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,639
have to pay Rs 1 lakh per month that is something we

129
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,880
can recover some how 30 is a number that we

130
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,440
cannot recover.  We will never be able to make that

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,440
money that investment back.  In the end he would again

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,199
say to wait for a while.  I will call you back.

133
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,000
What should I say?

134
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:15,600
Hmm just hold on hold on.  Ya Ashish can

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,960
I call you in 2 minutes or ya shore yes I will call

136
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,919
you and says leave it now 40

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,360
lakhs for two years best deal we have given the

138
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,000
discount if we go for the two years I will

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,560
make it in the 45

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,960
ok 40 for 2 years if you are agree ok if you want to go

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,919
for the one year I will make it

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,320
30 plus GST Azish then

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,800
asked for the breakdown that from where did it come to 40, tell me the

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,320
breakdown then this guy said that eight copyright

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,039
strikes have been given.  The penalty for each strike is Rs

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
5 lakh.  So it becomes 40 lakhs.

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280
So either pay Rs 40 lakh as penalty or

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
take a subscription of Rs 40 lakh for 2 years.

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
I wanted to understand what was the

150
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,800
breakdown of that 45 lakhs.  See if I will

151
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,440
give you the complete breakdown then I am not

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,520
going to negotiate with them again.  I told you

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,240
no 4 5 less per month is charges for the

154
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,880
subscription penalty is different.  We have

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,720
stride some seven videos, if you consider that one then

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,840
8 5 40 is the penalty and

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,319
subscription is different, now tell me that,

158
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
and this is their business model, put a strike and get the

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,680
channel deleted, tell me this is the condition of our country

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,840
that businessmen are thinking about how to

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
extort money from other people and not that we should do

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
creative things, solve problems,

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
adopt good methods to earn revenue,

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,479
and brother there is no logic in his words.  There

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,639
is no logic.  My team member

166
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,960
said that if you use a song from T Series, then

167
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,039
T Series just takes the revenue of that video.

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
It is not that

169
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,759
you take our subscription of Rs 1 crore.  This doesn't

170
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
work.  This guy from ANI says that our

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
business model is different.  We donâ€™t follow that.

172
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,120
We are a different model.  We don't

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,120
claim the revenue.  We put the strike.  If

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,199
you ask the penalty.  You are ready to pay the

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,599
penalty.  Ok.  You want to take a

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
subscription, then we can consider the wave of

177
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
on penalties.  And do you know what

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
that guy says at the end, I like Mohak's channel,

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
that's why I talked to him so much, otherwise I would

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,400
n't have given this much attention to anyone friend

181
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,400
Ashish, the best I could have done was I have given that, I have given a

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
lot of

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
discount friend, I didn't even talk to anyone this much

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,759
boss, but I am considering, come on

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,080
friend because I love your channel, basically that's why

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,120
I am talking to you, yes brother he is doing a

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,960
great favor, he had asked for a deal of 45 lakhs for

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
one year, now he has made it 40 lakhs for two

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
years, who are you brother, who are you to

190
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,960
threaten, so the last deal he offers is that if you

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,360
want one year, give â‚¹ one lakh and if you want 2 years, then give

192
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,080
â‚¹40 lakhs.  And in the end he

193
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,520
tells about a very big creator

194
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,160
who recently gave â‚¹ lakhs to ANI.

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Last week he told us the name and they

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,319
paid 50 lakh for one year only 50 lakh

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,160
plus GST they paid that.  â‚¹ Lakhs given to

198
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
sort out this whole matter.  You know, the

199
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,639
crazy thing is that ANI has done this same thing

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
with many creators.  Irrespective

201
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,800
of their ideology.  And friend, I don't

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
even have any personal enmity.  Neither have I

203
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,479
made any video against him nor have I created any content.

204
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
You can delete my channel, you can

205
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,520
ban me on YouTube, you can take away my

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,199
titles, everything.  I know that I am so

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
smart and hard working, that I will be

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
successful, no matter what.  And you know

209
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
what?  Our government should know

210
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
about this.  This is why I wrote an

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
email to the PMO and to IAB Minister

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,640
Ashwini Vaishnav.  The government should know

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,479
what is going on in their world.  This

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,560
is the exact screenshot of the email I

215
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,800
sent.  Now I have done my part.  I

216
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,360
told all the facts to our ministers.

217
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,519
Now it is up to them.  It's not in my

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
control what decision he takes.

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe he will favour ANI.  If that's true then it will come out in

220
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,600
front of everyone what is

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,640
going on in our country that if you want to

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,200
become a creator and you make a video on Operation Sindoor,

223
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,839
take 8 seconds of footage, for a 30 minute

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,080
video you will have to pay Rs 50 lakh,

225
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
this will not happen secretly, now I don't use this and ask

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
so much to subscribe, like and share and it has been a

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,519
long time

228
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,399
but for this video I need your help,

229
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,760
first share this video, I want this message

230
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,000
to be spread to as many people as possible but

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,839
avoid any personal attacks, I don't have any personal

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
enmity with those apple choices, you

233
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,680
should avoid any personal attacks if they are low we will

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,519
remain high.  SECOND TARGET ANI

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
WHERE IT HURT THE MOST.  So if you are

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
following on any platform please

237
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
unsuspectingly subscribe and block them.  Third,

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,720
if you are a creator and if

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I have brought any positive change in your life, then

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,080
please share this message.  Especially those people who

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
appeared in ANI podcasts have become sharp

242
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
or skilled.  Because friend, the

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
most embarrassment occurs when

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
people around you also say, brother,

245
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
what are you doing?  So, if these people

246
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,360
criticize ANI, maybe they will think that

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,279
I need to change my behavior.  Finally, if

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,760
you are a creator who has received a copyright strike

249
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,160
from ANI and ANI has

250
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,880
behaved similarly with you, then record all the

251
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,200
evidence.  Ok?  Emails have been done, call

252
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
conversations have been done.  Whatever details you

253
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,680
have, who was in the email, from whom did the

254
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,320
email come, what did they say,

255
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
make evidence of everything.  In the description and pin comment there are

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,120
no email addresses

257
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
of INB Minister and his relevant officials, please

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
send it to them.  Look, if all of us

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,160
email the Ministry with evidence, then the

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
matter will reach the Minister.  So

261
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
I would collect all this evidence and

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800
share it.  ANI found that several creators had

263
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
received threats.  I myself know many creators

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,959
who have donated Rs 12, 15, 18 lakh.

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,440
As I said, a

266
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
big creator has given â‚¹50 lakhs to a creator.  So just

267
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,680
imagine how much money ANI would have earned.

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,839
NI thought I would beg.

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,839
I will not ask for anything.  The degrees that I have collected

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,760
in my life, I have

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
not collected them to hang on the wall.  Rather, I have done

272
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
this so that whenever I encounter such people

273
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,480
in life, I can deal with them.

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
So thank you for watching.  If this channel

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,040
gets deleted don't worry.  A new channel will be created and

276
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I will be equally successful.
