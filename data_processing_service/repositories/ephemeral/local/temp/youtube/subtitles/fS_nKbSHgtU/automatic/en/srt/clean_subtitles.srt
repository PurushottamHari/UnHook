I want to understand. First of all, what do you think about this 11a Miracle? its this this You don't think it's a little strange? Meaning What are the chances of someone surviving? Brother, no one is left, only that man is left. So, I don't know if there was a guy in 11 before Yes, he was saved. This one survived too, brother, What do you mean God has to save him, save him Took it. This crash happened earlier also in the same 11 It's saved. Was left on 11A. this is the same emergency The exit window is the side seat. I slept no this much that the seat above the wings happens, from there a structurally sufficient The ship becomes stronger from there. but this case I just fell completely down Terry If I survived then I have no idea brother how I survived What is strange and what does it mean Walking out of it playing video Brother, he is jumping out of the fire balloons and it seems as if it is going on Like what in the brother what is his life What would the rest of the people think, brother? Imagine his body burning next to his seat It's been four yes and she has it here too There was no fracture even in the finger Insane means friend can you pull up His visual? I mean, I don't know if anyone I have not seen this. Do you not know who you are talking about I am the one who survives, I mean I It seems that friend God has to save someone No, I would have saved him. anything means yes Here it is. And he just walks out. no brother He has a fracture in his leg or something. Meaning The guy is able to walk, friend. it's in his mind he can brother it looks like he came out of a crash This has happened. brother in car accident I have seen worse people than this, brother. Oho Brother to whom yes. Look at this. Yes. so this is where it stops Generating left that's going down. I have also heard brother that double engine Being a failure is one in a billion I would say it will be trillion of billion. I have Didn't see it. Why is it like this? why are you two The engine is so secure that both of them cannot fail Can. friend first no trans atlantic Flights and Pacific flights four engines Ships with these used to run. if you look now at boeing 340 Travel 747 so the regulation said that friend four If one of the engines is made of three or two flowers, then then we said our technology so advanced that Two engines will never fail at the same time we saw when boeing triple 7 was made for him Direct approval was given that you can fly over There is no water because there is no chance two engines one We have made it so much that we fail together If you can't advance, you can't fail so much There is more trust on technology that two engines Cannot fail and there is no operational reason maybe because i mean if my car engine ends I'm using a very stupid example can fail any time what is so special about to I am not feeling my love my engines are in such a state that there is a lot of redundancy And that's why they are so expensive right Now if you own a Maruti Do you buy a car and a Rolls Ryce? So there is redundancy in that, so both Brother, both A to B will be delivered. Right? Which has more safety? in an expensive car It must be that your air bag has come out, friend will come. This will happen. you must escape the sirens Will go. If you fall asleep it will set an alarm will give. The car will stop automatically. So safety Majors are built into the system. we have given R set of the art machines. Billions Of Dollars have been spent to make such machines. has that been another case of a dual engine FAILURE EVER IN AVIATION HISTORY? can you Check Dual Engine Failure in Aviation History. Brother it is a dual engine but Like the stall is done or the birds have come. By the way It has happened. I didn't even know this happened brother What? It's called a flame out. Right? Ok. it's a flame out that's going on and It stopped. It never happened like that. Some? All the indicators must have gone to zero It is in front. yes all the bells rang ton ton ton It will be completed. and when both ends fail all the The NECESSARY PANELS The screen in front of you. Everything Goes Dark Except Captain Side Only the rats which used to be there, the rat came. The rat only moves that much. what is rat Brother? Dude, it's a ram air turbine. Good. so it's a small fan which drops down from the belly of the aircraft when there is there no electrical supply to the Aircraft. me and that too a particular Runs up to speed. like there's a lot of talk If it is rat then rat is electrical When I saw it in my childhood it looked like this The fan used to come. we used to do it outside the car That toy seller used to move around on his own. we we So the wind is blowing around the rat, brother. Rat Koi There isn't an engine like that. The rat is small and it requires a minimum air speed It is there to perform the function. Ok. So Below as you land in the Airbus 149 ns that gives even less power. Then you touch If you turn it down it stops immediately. So the wind is blowing it around. he by himself No one is generating power by taking any fuel. Hum to rat aya aircraft speed 184 There were knots. If he is going down then reduce the speed It must be happening. So what did the rat do? Must have done it. Then the aircraft is on batteries Done. which would be two 25 volt batteries It is in the air bus. I don't know how much it costs Is. Hmm. so very minimal The pilot will have controllability. this fan What is the purpose of a rat? this is the rat No? yes what is its purpose? So when lets say you have no so two engines Went. Right? The engines have generators. Generator one generator two. if we fail in exam then The generator is also not working. From lats Both generators provide AC power. Now Where does the ship get its electrical supply from? Will I get it? he gives a rat then he goes down through the Rotation through the rotation. He gives very little Brother, that. it is just that it will power one Hydraulics and Your Bare Minimum Systems It will work. good gear up she don't go It would require a lot of power to gear up and you don't want to waste gear up You just have to land in it safely right right right right right then Everything Goes Off Captain's PFD Walk This must have been his stand-by instrument It must be going on and that's it brother in the name of God Take it and land it, it has so much power then the captain probably gives a maid a call boss everything is closed do something well there is a question like me After the video people said that I should I tell you yes yes please tell me that If you give me a summary then friend, one in the aircraft The system is AD DSB at every point of time instantly it sends out The Signal That's How ATc Comes to Know your position your height your speed and Everything and there is a third party company cold radar 24 radar 24 if you pull up radar 24 he will pull you up of all the aircraft in the world Shows the position live, where and what is going Where is he not going then Radar 24 This data was made live and it came to us Whatever 30 seconds it took from Air India 171 I was in the flight so they were saying that yaar it Took a really long time to lift off from the Runway. so let's say this is what The distance you take when you have both inches Running. hum if you have one engine fail you will Take Slightly Long Distance. power is low Went. This ship travelled a greater distance than that Took it. That is what the data is suggesting. So it's V1, friend. V1 is my decision Speed. Ok? before V1 if i had any major problem occurs late if i lose n Engine before V1 hum i will reject take off i can stop i can stop you have enough Runway to stop after V1 if engine fails if it happens then I don't have enough runway to stop ok i have to take off after v1 we are here so i am flying I have my hand here on the first lever I have it in my hand I can do pull ups hun so my first officer gives the call 100 nots 100 nots means that now I am I Entering a high speed regime. where things are Critical Now. No problem with high speed If it is there then it is critical. Below 100 knots So I can even solve a small problem Reject. I will come back after getting the go back corrected. I'm go minded at over 100 knots. Now when I reach we one he gives a call we one the important step i i remove my Hands from the Thrust Layers. because mistake Don't reject it even from there. Because Incent It would have happened. ok ok ok ok. Yes. Some? It happened that the bell rang or he said something. Sir I it's a very crypto i remove my hand from the first sleeves even by his mistake Don't reject me I'm 100% gone minded so after v1 i am go minded Even if the engine fails, we are here start rotating wheel of pay is my Lift off rotating edge in the engine start I start I start ok you start I will also do pulling of pulling ups pull ups A little over the top but the point is where I leave my ground is wheel off okay okay so the engine is there so the plane has taken off So everything was fine before V1, right? For V1 then we are sure that before V1 all It was ok. Got it. Now what happened after V1 yes brother. That's right. So my theory is that As far as I understood from my mind A little bit so I am saying that friend V1 After that one of its engines failed. Got it. Yes. Ok? And he rotated. thats why he took little lager to lift off from The Ground. Right? Now he rotated it so His speed decreased. and then another thing bro This is not an everyday story. Now he is the captain Came to him. Friends retire even once They do it. Not a single engine fails. Retire with 25-25,000 hours. If people don't happen, nothing happens. and in the sim Dude you have practiced enough times. In the sim What happens? as we sit and talk Are. An instructor will come and give a briefing Every one hour. Gaurav today we had an engine failure do. One engine failed for me I am a V1 I will give it first. I'll give it to you after a V1. V1's First you have to reject it. Maintain Central Line. Give a call. if there is a fire Will evacuate. Happened after V1. then dead Foot dead engine. maintain the central line of The Nose. see your ship and then take The Auto Pilot Trims the Aircraft and Aftill 400ft No Action Just Gear A plena and then give a maid a call tell him To Stand By and Reach the Acceleration Altitude Level up and then clean up complete procedure I'm revising okay okay okay Alright brother, when I'm sitting in the plane I know it will give in swimming, yes, yes In a real situation, even a little bit The bell bursts in the man's ship I may be the one who started by the The effect was that one engine failed during take off did some reach 100 feet something unusual must have happened to him there attention must have been that friend what happened If it happens then you gear up at 100 feet and you put gear up is landing air landing air there is a call out i'm flying hill he will say positive climb and only after His call I'll say gear up and this has happened to me in the same that guy If you don't say positive climate then I will gear up I will not say it, I will initiate that call got It He Must Not Have Said Positive Climb Because when there is a positive climate my Vertical speed is going up I'm climbing so he might have seen a slight drop and you Only Say Positive When You Are Amative that this guy is becoming positive. It must have looked to him like he was fickling. so you must have said that I will wait This is only becoming positive. I then I call I will get it out. he wouldn't have called out Till then maybe I will give him something There might have been some trouble. So friend, there is one in Boeing There is a procedure that happens in any engine A malfunction occurs. you have to secure that engine. And it should not get damaged. and one Such an incident has happened before in Gore At 3000 feet in Delhi. they lost engine one Due to birds. whatever engine got damaged hua in the process of securing the Secure the Wrong Engine. Oh shh it's done. Oh wow that plane didn't land. Yes Brother that day the biggest accident happened in India Would. But that did not happen. So Captain Senior Was. Yes. And so this was He cut the wrong reason brother first The officer did. and there is a little tense situation No. It is difficult to explain this in a podcast It becomes difficult. a jab in a cockpit A little later, things move very fast. these 150 Work would have been going on at the speed of 200 notes Is. the ship is moving forward and you are falling There is a lot of work behind it. End Take off and landing is a critical phase. Right? There are 1000 tasks to be done and even in that if If you get stuck then those 1000 tasks are missed. These Was left. Then you are more stressed. so like this They say friend that the first sense you lose is The Sense of Hearing. We are here, right? you class I am the teacher teaching or she is speaking In your ears. But if your attention If it is happening somewhere then you will not hear it You. so he did every action in the cockpit with Concerning critical systems is a backup that you ah you're the captain. I am the first officer Am. So engine one has failed. I have to Secure Engine Two. I will say captain confirm Number two. so you are supposed to look and confirm that i am holding the right and then You said confirmed captain. So the guy saw it Even after seeing it I said wrong. He said Confirmed. He grabbed two. He had to cut the forest. So the bird entered the forest. We are that flame I am out. Two he caught the captain confirmed and if it cuts it then the aircraft is in Flight without any engine. oh wow captain He says this is Airbus' redundancy So the spool was going down on engine number two and This is so if you have not come below 43% If you put it again, it will come again. get up I will go again. He will get up. ok ok ok. Sir, just need to add fuel. yes right. Ok. That's wind milling. just add fuel Is. Ok. Got it. It is not so in this At Boeing. Well, it is in Boeing only. Yes. Correct. So he saw what was happening The captain noticed because there was sound as well yes, everything happens. you lose also she If I put it again then I put it in another Bar start well fault occurred and it tore a bit more He did that by pitching the aircraft down so that wind milling ho again it came back then they land it back safely oh wow they did if If he is not there that day then another what Be in Delhi Be in Delhi Yes Think and Land and why did he land near them brother they were at 3000 feet they had the altitude these guys had altitude It was not there friend, I was at 400 feet, what could I do You can do it not at 400 feet but at 3000 feet What difference would it have made if it had happened, brother? manubar can you do something can you do a little something Brother, I would say that Sabarmati is right there But if I had gone, something would have happened to Hasan Something would have happened, there would have been a field somewhere if there was a farm somewhere I would have dropped it right right right right right right now in that case Friend, that incident which happened with Go Air I took that as well very conveniently. Narrated it to you or as much as the audience is watching By making a pilot error you close the chapter can you do it brother yes you can yes, as much as I have just told you the facts I told you yes ok but but friend there is that is not a purpose of Investigation. Those guys were bored at night Had taken off. Had come to Delhi. Landed at 3:00. 5:00 Then the departure was at 8 o'clock and we were going to Bombay. so now that's why the one who is now Air India's of scheduling which they can of The bombs have been opened. Scheduling opens Brother. What are you guys doing back there? Are you guys making a schedule like this? Brother, the guy who took off at night 12:00 Landed at 3:00 and arrived at 5:00 I have taken off. it is not a very good time To be attentive. You would even measure our fatigue yes. Is this a routine thing for the airline? You are making the pilots fly like this. Are you following the regulations? Are you even scheduling? how is the rostering going Is it happening? So that's why all these letters are opened And then it turns out friend it is more of a part of what is your culture The airline's? I get it. Isn't it? If I I am making you fly every night. So It won't work, brother. I am also following Am. Because it is proving that psychedelics You are not very attentive in law. Psychadion Law is from 3 to 6 in the morning. Right? No matter how much you sleep during the day, brother brain That much you are not that identical. so here What I am saying is that firstly on the ground India failed. Let's Come Back Band. Failed after a V1. He took off what happened and the same thing might have happened with the aircraft his attention was diverted from the landing gear and He and Boeing have systems that you can use to power the engine Do you secure it? and brother in airbust then Yes it is not a memory item. you book When you open the iPad, everything comes out. And It appears completely on your screen. Aircraft Tells you what to do. it's that smart and once you do it it knows what you have done it will remove that from ji theek hai na got got it tuck it's way easy or boing me It says this is a memory item, remember it, remember it If you keep it then there are some memory items like if i remember the whole airbus in airbus there are only nine memory items These are the things you have to remember, everyone else Brother, try to use your brain after looking at some books. Memory is not good in this case brother If it is an item then it says memory item that let's assume the pilot flying is the captain Pilot non flying and pilot monitoring say is a first officer do action Two actions of the First Officer and two of the Captain The captain says to turn off the thrust lever will give because the thrust levers are automatic It moves. him off and then put thrust Levers to idle. Thrust lever control Always the pilot is flying and all that Emergency Pilot Haze. So, an emergency occurred. This guy puts thrust lever to idle. pilot Non flying and pilot monitoring. his work The fuel shut off valve is cut. we sleep Cutting off the fuel. and then there is an engine The secure or fire damage button is the push. So those are non-reversible actions. If this Number one has also been cut which we have failed and That brother gave good engine fuel set of help If you cut it then both of them are gone, brother. Good write right right to that extant human There might be an error. yes so to me what we are I have included it in the video because brother its I don't understand anything other than It is possible after that it might happen again This must be wrong. Right? But as much as my knowledge I will try to analyse till that. so me So, I understand that this is what happened, brother. will be. and that's the only reason they could have It was in Gone Down Go Air that they I posted it again, it's here but it's irreversible Actually, because you are at 400 feet height. So you don't have time, hey it's irreversible Be it 400 or 1000, it is irreversible I cut off the fuel shut off valve and it started to fire The button you pushed is irreversible He came back to the ground and the engineer was fine can do it well okay so if you have fuel If you close the valve you can't open it again I can do that. Then there is another button which says Engine There is some damage to the button. well that's secure The button is done. Yes. After that he is what i have proposed this that may be that must have happened but coming back to that if Even if there is height, so there is a lawyer guy Handling my case also. he has filed Lot of PIL in Mumbai High Court. He Said there are lots of buildings which should not Be there. Airports Authority of India has Given left right center permission. where is he Did you give it to me? Land is expensive in Mumbai. Hmm hmm. and you know nobody wants to leave I will build 10 floors on the land, I will make five floors. It is not approved there Because that is an airport area that is empty Should be. You will go to any other country So it does not happen that the airport is finished. A building has again been constructed on the perimeter wall. They It happens here. but then that The builder thing is such a big society that no one wants to talk about it Someone wants to get into it. take the matter Brother, same thing happened in Ahmedabad too. No. I just woke up and asked sister, how come she is so beautiful How did big buildings come? If not even There would have been a little forest and trees as well Would have been. Brother, even trees would not have absorbed it There is impact. if there were trees or forests No, hmm. There would have been damage, but we wouldn't have Lost so many lives. we lost everyone Life Actually. Only one is left. Butt so much loss There isn't an off life. in case if this jungle or if it were an open field, would this land Would? Yes, land. of crash landing It's a procedure, brother. The procedure remains It's good to practice crash landing Practice crash landings. No so you are telling me if here There are no buildings and if there is empty ground If it had happened then all this wouldn't have happened. yes then take it off giving damage where the ship breaks landing If the wing breaks, we will save ourselves by evacuating Would go. Good. What else? Brother it feels like that that once that visual comes and not now It's going straight like this. at that point End. Nothing can be saved. at this point Like now your death sentence has been written. but I didn't know if that was because a There is a very famous story about Sali who The plane landed in Hutson. he became a hero after that and i thought that was the The exception is that you can do something like this. Water landing was exception. Good Water Landing is an exception. Ditching Procedure Yes bro proper. This is the procedure of ditching. What happens in that? a you have to Secure the aircraft. first of all that What can you secure in the cockpit? now i don't remember that much if one Add the bar. yes please write. Procedure Airus 320 Dali QRH And So For Now Your guess is that he first needs to remove the engine valve He had to shut down the other engine The first engine had already gone off because that It took a long time to take off after V1 so that led to dual engine failure that's your guess probably that's my guess i also think brother as a pilot you know what you will be Weather that be yes there is also a ditching button I remember now yes that was the ditching Procedure Q QR Put QRH QRH Quebec Romeo Hotel at Capitol Yes This quick reference hand will not come in this yes look in this it came down quickly The reference handbook would be the complete procedure hey bro yes this out flow well stop it Everybody close this cabin or this is the exact Procedure Ditching Button Switch Airbus aircraft of ditching buttons and switches that When activated automatically then ditching button If Airbus has made it, yes, then it is a procedure no bro yes right right right na outflew This is the out flow valve which is your Cabin pressure to pressure ram air pressure Whatever is maintained, it maintains it It has to maintain proper cabin pressure is it planted ditching or unplanted ditching how are you bringing the crew inside joe lead crew hoti u brief her that now We are ditching. so brace for Impact is the command for ditching. you si like this and then all that procedure is done Ditching ok very interesting. Post Ditching actions are planned and unplanned ditching everything happens. After end ditching Mostly we just evacuate. Yes. So We brief the crew everything. The Crew Briefs Passengers then she reshuffles that yaar emergency I will make the abled body sit at the exit Can you help me also? so de de de go through give all their procedure turn but ditching hota Is. but from a sim experience if i say am at 33 and 29 which is generally what people we are flying at and suddenly i begin to Experience and I will have to ditch it. how much time do i have before i am touching Around? so bro for every 1000 feet eye Can cover two nautical miles. so to him calculate if I am on 30000 then I I can I have a distance of 160 nautical Miles I can go left right two 2.3 60 Nautical Miles Distance Wise and Time wise because I have to brief you by briefing you Give me all the instructions brother, I will be saved in that I will take the plane, don't worry, yes there is a pilot If you get 3000 feet of time I have had so much training that I If I save myself then I will have confidence in myself too I have confidence in my training Sorry, I have confidence in my training and then my scanning starts that Where will I stay, I will land the ship and it will be like this Not even when I'm flying normally I am there and I don't have anyone at 60 miles We will find an airport, friend, right? Surely, somewhere, someone is telling me a little You will find a field, right right right brother When ours is one and not inbuilt some things happen i'm going over I'm going to Iran or I'm going to Turkey I'm going somewhere I'm going to Europe I'm flying over some country what do I do in my free time What do you do in your free time, brother? That map let's take it out and see ok i can fly here I am doing it right now, if I fail then I I can go here, ok put it here How much time will it take so we keep doing this calculation ok ok ok so it's not like that We are sitting unprepared. right right Right right right right right. So we We are prepared every time. at everybody check point i calculate my fuel which Is it matching what happened or not? Interesting. Ok. So, it means 10 hours like this What will you do during the flight? What would you do? Yes. We also chatted a bit. brother what are you doing I have done that too in my life, but only a little Got the work done also. and that work is that How I know where I am going. I What options do you have basically. Right. Right right right. So like Pakistan I fly over the. I'm here bro So I will not take it off. see this after Where is the next airport coming? Straight Brother, we will land you in Amritsar only, either Amritsar or Hey brother, things happen sometimes in Iran Is. Sometimes there's some trouble, right? Brother, I will not get down here later I will download it or I will download the page first. Yes right so you always have that in mind that Sometimes it comes to your mind that I am not I would have been sitting idle like this, looking outside Am. So it's not like I'm looking outside. so i'm thinking what if i lose an engine Now. So this is going on in my mind. When I take off from Assam There is a big island in the middle of the Brahmaputra We do take off in the rain I think it might be better if I drop it here hmm what does your mind keep on doing something or the other If the mischief continues, then brother, we will We are prepared to land the ship You will lose the landing in Ko and Crashing gear but everything else will kind of Survive yes means people will survive anything I will loose but I am so damaged Property may be damaged but there is damage of life It won't happen that much because brother is the most I'll protect myself first right? Sure if I survive I will be behind Those left behind will be saved. And I have my own Life is dear to me. right then for yourself I will definitely save you. Sure sure, right? So that's why you tell yourself first Save because if you are saved everyone will be saved. well so in this case attitude was also no issue because you are only at 400 meters If you are at 400 feet then you cannot do anything Got it. 400 ft Ahmedabad Elevation 200 ft And 65 is what reports are saying they were At. So you were at 400 feet. 400 feet or something It doesn't exist. You don't have the time. Such a heavy ship. so you are the heaviest at tech Off, right? Right. You burn 55 tons of fumes at landing then You then became at least 55 tonnes lighter. here it is That too is fuel and they are carrying fuel Yes you are. That's why that firewall became so big Because that fuel is fuel. 55 60 tonne So the fuel is on you. hum hum what do you think about who captain smith is and this This is my observation. Ok? I Purely From somebody sitting on this side. You x Aviation ex pilot that captain steve probably Isn't that his name, Captain Steve? actually can you also check which pilots are this His experiences during the flight were 7 8000 hours 8000 were not pilots but captains The first officer of the 1100 hours were yes so That means it is experienced only, yes right so i think pilot guy is probably more Likely to be like this issue happened in pilot Maybe like this one from Captain Steve say they used flaps instead of non or slats please explain something to me What to Say Exactly But I am sure that if you are an engineer If you talk to him, he will find the engineering fault If you speak to an airliner, the airline Like these are whistle blowers. it might also be a proximity think about what you do Think for? You Know But what did Captain Steve say that there has been some error in the sense that They didn't put those wheels up or anything yes I think there was a video of him where But they say that So flap landing has to be done air up After take off positive climb gear up. So In this case, the gear itself takes the flaps up. so flap is something which generates more Lift at a slower speed. I am but that I don't think that would have happened bro because and i made a video also about that end I don't even know why he said that Because there were three or four reasons for that. one is the gear Nor does it happen further. so if i am the first Officer I have to reach out. end flap right here It happens on pay. So it is not the case that both buttons I will make mistakes here and there. So number one reason that number two even by mistake Doge na Jahaz will sing 50 feet and then Start It Again Slime Won't Go Down Because we call it Murphy's Law that something which has a probability to go wrong will go wrong this happened this happened We have new ships with us The first officer comes and makes a mistake If you do it in sim also then and the Aircraft Surfaces Are Electronically simulated but they move with hydraulic pressure and it takes time that pressure Gaya, they are moving. it's a big motor It rotates. So do the flap at zero It comes slowly. so this happened to me had put flaps zero. I said brother What are you doing? I pulled it again. He has come. what is a flap brother? Brother he The wing which stays like this keeps moving. Sir that's above the wing, that's the angle of the wing Let me change it. ok ok ok. because whatever we land on Times become straight. same for the track There is a flap. That's fine. so what is the flap He says that friend even at low speed it gets more It generates lift. good you are Landing at slow speed but you want more So what is the disadvantage of lift? The drag is greater. Ok? so then if What will happen if I straighten the flaps? That will basically increase the drag. a little bit Your lift must be loose, friend. But if the engine He is running at full power and overtaking will take it. He will pull it off, brother. means going like this Yes you are. It will happen. Then you will go upstairs. talk I didn't understand it, it was a flash, friend. And What are slats? So the slats wing are in the front and flats are at the back. So Yaar is slat slabs system. one comes yes this one is coming. Yes. so they increase the Chamber of the Wing. So the Bernoulli principle is You must have read it. Didn't he read it? Bernoulli's Yes. Bernoulli I know about him. yes so It is that one, right? So wing it happens like this right yes. So the stage moves faster from top than from bottom In physics he can change the shape of the wing Gives. yes i see and it increases the Lift. I am amazing. ok at least. Now Like this was Flight 171 Air India 171, right? Now when will its investigation take place? that when is pay like when will we get any kind of Certainty because we are still in theory land and the dominant theory is that it's a Double engine failure right that's a dominator Now I know from some YouTube videos I have seen sometime that there is a black in it The Box That Is Always Recovered which probably contains Audio recording or punching in the machine all that happened and then there is something else called an acr ams cvr cvr meaning something like this there is some equipment which those who come out of the cockpit Now investment is done on this basis. Cause The nail is down. What is the timeline and something like that? when would we know about something like that would you expect for this to be the case Things? yaar initial report i think 30 It should come in days. but i was surprised to know who will give the CVR and DFDR R to boxes. CVR & DFDR. CVR is cockpit voice recorder. Ok? So When I used to fly, there used to be last two Communication for hours was recorded. Now it can even last for 25 hours. be advance Everything is gone. And then there is a DFDR including whatever happened on your flight Some such action has taken place which was done by the pilots I did not take it but I do software internally too Are. Everything is recorded. His Pitch Bank Roll Engine Power How Much Fuel Gone are the left, right, everything. well it's locked Complete. He is completely locked. what did the aircraft At what speed did you take off? What happened? Meaning There is very extensive data on flights. We both have to recover. That was done. but then surprisingly they said That it got a little more damaged. So we Cannot process this. He also worked in the U.S. sent it to him So that was a bit shocking that Boeing There is a ship and you sent it there So only now will we know the conflict of Interest type of right but then good thing Is this also true or is it the case when M Cash is at fault If it happened then its investigation was also done there It happened there and then they did the right investigation i think its mcsh's fault what happened was lioner went down and ethiopian also Went down Boeing 737 but it had no address what is nts also which is de r independent organization they don't fall under the government of there here who is your AAIB That government is under the civil action government If she comes then the fight has been going on for a long time Make him independent, my friend, that government is under some administration if it is under some minister then things change can happen change can happen so I came was talking to this captain amit singh his He is a big expert, 18000 hours and now he is safety pay he has dedicated his life to Flight safety says investigation is on he is also in touch tell the people of AIB Yes sir, the engine has failed. Both The engine has failed. Both engines have failed. and when If there is an impact then at the time of impact Why do you study? why is there a seal do you do it? Because you have to see What was the situation at the time of impact? What was the condition of the engine blades? if you Engine blades Engine was running at the time of The impact must be moving around. and if you turn around If there is an impact then a different type of deflation will occur It will be. If it is not working it will be idle So it will fall just like that. then there will be damage below The top one won't have blades. if yes then it is ok Gives a lot of information. so over there Information came that the engine blades were not impacted mean at the time of crash engine Was not running. Ok. Both both. both engines He crashed because of failure. Yes. They keep on saying yes dual engine failure dual Engine failure. They will not change the report overnight It's done. When it gets published they say Inger running. that pilot some how put it in a Stall. and he drove deep so It crashed. But the deep drive will definitely take place It is not there anymore. Didn't it hurt? deep drive then It is not visible at all brother. No. No. I Talking about Ghatkopar crash, sorry cash wale cash Yes yes this was a crash in Ghatkopar There was another one like this in Mumbai long back crash was discuss in my video so much Earlier there was a union minister, he was a ship I say that the report says that the pilot Went into the cloud he lost situational Awareness itself could not control the aircraft and it went down again in the same way When you explain the report you list all What was the situation that day? So meteorological There is also a page of. it is saying in There is no weather at all. In Hum and Conclusion He is saying that he entered the cloud. so weather If not, then which cloud is it? we we so Please give me those reports which are made as well, my friend Not made so that future accidents can be Avoided in India. what they are made to save Someone. We are not getting any benefit from this Of the investigation. Then friend, it is a very dark situation Brother. It is dark brother. does it mean where is the respite? I am thinking yes that this conversation means some time has to be some leg to hold on to you know I think India as a developing country V don't necessarily want these kinds of things neither domestically nor for public Safety nor for international visibility. meaning it does not board as well in any It doesn't make sense either internally or internationally. and like I'm sitting with an ex pilot somebody who scene aation so closely somebody who is known to take his voice to the courts and the public wherever he thinks fit and he is telling me there is nothing to like there is no There Are Silver Linings to the Clouds Literally what what Brother So it's a double engine failure in this case because it's clear we know that double There is engine failure brother look at me I have experience of 9-10 years now I don't understand hot core I may be Tot Li Rong seems to have become quite strong. Like right now we are talking about software Is there a problem or is it the fuel? There are fuel shut off valves. Yes. Is No? So when you're in the car, They are hitting the accelerator. you are basically controlling the amount of gas that Is entering the engine. ok ok ok. End Petrol gets vaporised. With the Air You get a mix. there is a fuel air Mixture that goes inside the engine. Fuel Set of the wire that controls how much fuel is Going inside the engine. You added power. Take If you turn it off then you will get power only then it will take off Did. and then they said there was some Problem which cuts the AC buses in the Aircraft. so when the ac buses are qudd that fuel set of valve is Controlled by the AC buses. So he is absolutely It was reset from . There were batteries in flight Are. but it takes one second to switch on to The Batteries. so that's why that fuel shut up well went into close position because their The default position is close. but i don't buy That. because I think that dude is Boeing must have thought this much that if my AC Well, I failed in the air also. so that I think the fuel will shut off, it will not shut off also in such a critical fuzz because critical The aircraft in the fuzz also knows it is critical He is very fuzz and he takes care of himself too he will not do it, meaning even if he has to fail Neither a safe way to fail is to fail in an open Position Rather Than to Fail in a Closed position or right that consumes more fuel Let it go, that's not a problem, yes my fuel If it overflows then that is not a problem Think even if it fails but it is still going on hay rumours but Brother, should I tell you the truth? I don't understand anything. are you not coming i am also eagerly Waiting to See What Has Happened Do You Land send any creedence to joe conspiracy land is there any meaning around it, look there are two types This is a conspiracy. Ok? a conspiracy then This is the whistle blower regarding Boyan from a long time Blowing is going on. that there are safety This is particularly with this airliner. The second is that this has been done to tarnish India's Image. Correct. and frankly the the second one i am less likely to believe because I think India's media sector Even if people are talking on informal Twitter Or a formal journalist, a little paranoid Is. It takes all our time to find someone He is interested in fingering. and so on Perhaps no one thinks about India. There might be some people in some rooms Do you think about India? but large neither any public nor any public offices of the The world is concerned about India What an image. so this one still seems to me It looks a bit inflated. One A Sense of Self is a Continuous The inferiority complex that India has Which is now becoming a superiority complex This is his manifestation. Butt with Boeing Many question marks are associated. My who thinks there might actually be questions there They are there but there will be no one to pick them up. yes it is you can bro because The US economy depends on Boeing No. They are not just Boeing. give me He probably bought Lockett Martin. If I am not wrong. it's a very big company End There are couple of law makers who are initially ET Boeing. now they are in congress so they have like has power they have power boing a has Power So He had an I think facility somewhere They have made a new facility in South Taxis followed there a guy had a camera He had also taken some videos with him I had made it, check the whistle taxes, friend This is one of their facilities The same was in the North or Mid US and one down there too They built a new facility there But someone had entered with a camera on a search You should do that, he installed a hidden cam And then he took it and entered inside because he also had something like that but there are couple of whistle blowers who have called Yes for Boeing and what are the problems? I have pointed it out, do you know friend, that this They are taking approvals from FA in such a hurry I am taking it and FA is also giving approval And he's doing a little arm twisting as well they approve the FA because they Such a big good FS Federation of Joe Here is DC, well there is Federal Aviation Administration yes ok ok and brother The world sees the FA like this, if the FA If our DG approves then if FA If the DCP approves it, then he will say yes It is approved, approve sir, approve, approve yes yes DDCA has no technical knowledge that new regulations by yourself or something If we can do research then we will do what the FIA ​​says Sir, we accept your orders after tying the bandage on our wrist Just think, someone comes to audit the FI. Brother, DGCA gives us ratings, yes Well that's how competent it is ok ok ok one thing is done IO when Sometimes brother, some things happen what you find out makes you feel weird and Then for so many years and everybody else you Around you, you think this is the norm if it happens then why do you become okay with it When I reacted to the thing I said FA is the body of their country, we why is he giving rating or rating be it such a thing or an international organization ho as she is she is also an I K.O. but she is someone I don't give rating to everyone like F.A. Choudhary Goes to countries and gives ratings to everyone America has an old belief that yes, it is right to become a Chaudhary. So he comes and gives us ratings and now your improvement has been done otherwise five 6 Till a year ago I used to keep it in level three They. We are now at level two. Yes. that level When I kept it in three, I used to say that friend yes We have more flights to your country than this I will not send it because of your safety It is very weak. He used to limit flights And for us also there are limited flights there. Slots were available for sending. yes, what is this? Do it up. there have been Reports of Boeing whistle blurs racing Safety Concerns and Some How to Die and Face Legal action. one whistle blower john bard was Found Dead and Was Self-Inflicted Wound. After Giving Evidence Against Boeing Another whistle blower Sam Salepore. Testified before a US Senate committee about Manufacturing Shortcuts in 77 and 7 87 The aircraft was a 7 87 or a 787 FS Investigating Quality Claims Made By some whistle blowers some Boeing whistle blows have Come Forward with Serious Allegations Who went with the camera in this, did you find it friend I saw that, there is no evidence, but that This is what we are talking about. Good John Bard that John Burnett's might have blown up He might have given it in full from the internet It was a long time ago but there is still a whistle Brother brothers here and in Air India also there was another whistle lower i think he will release in 2022 something in He had done that Air India's Triple 7 which They are not coming here from the US Compliant with the oxygen requirement on The board should be of 15 minutes or 12 minutes Taking it all, something like this was happening with us. so then you If you come to India from the US, there are three or four routes It can be done by you, right? So he was saying that You cannot take an extended flight over water Can. Because you have less oxygen. We With in some two or three aircraft. that's it told called the dispatch said you give please Fire a new routing for me. so they weren't Happy with him ki yaar last minute pe The flight got delayed. you did extra work I gave it. so when he landed he was called something happened to him and i don't know about him There was friction with Corey management. Then I fired him, what did you do but then His case is going on in Bombay High Court And some Bombay High Courts also gave some rulings thi hum you shoulda pull it up aa jayega actually look it up air india whistle bower Triple 7 Oxygen Requirement Add Now It was trending on Twitter as well Because what happens when such accidents happen right bro so for the past 5-6 years those people who it happens to me that yes it happens to me now It also happened that all those people come forward there There are sufficient videos that the AC is not working or the entertainment setup is not working Customer version of it not with us The problem has occurred. yes yes this Exactly this one is a whistle blower pilot race Concerns about the emergency oxygen Supply on Air India Boeing 7 of 12 minutes right yes 12 minutes 12 minutes oxygen supply the pilot this amount of was insufficient for Sep operation. So if you know this, What is? Hey Sir, this one has two engines No. Was there a failure in 10 years? take it Even today. and as a pilot my job is bhaiya yes Hasn't happened for 10 years. It happened today. Right Right right right right. you once probability yes you want one failure for Everything to go. he is saying that sir 12 It will not give oxygen for a minute and why 12 minutes? because at the level you fly Are you planning to be late level 410390 The safe altitude from there is 10,000 I don't need supplemental for Rs 10,000 Oxygen. From there I can reach 10,000 in 12 minutes I will not be able to come. I will come in 16 minutes. So 4 what would you do for a minute? First Apply yours and then apply your child’s. Brother is the one No, nothing will be included in it. Right Right right right right. oh right right right Right. so and as a passenger you are like this It never happened to me. Yes, right. I am See never seen but will you take off without it? Or, Right Exactly. No, right? Or. Right. The DDCA was asked to investigate and Determine this is a case going on in the court This is happening brother. And the court also reprimanded him I had applied quite a lot. So, are you sure that this is the second option for me? Give you a lower level by filing the routing File it and give it. If you are filing late 390, 39,000 feet, give me 330. So that's me Can descend on to 10, 10,000 in time. Hmm. Maybe nothing will happen. Right? Butt Eye Will not take their chances, right? Right? So what's in 330? It will consume more fuel. Good. The routing took long. the higher you go You should not use laser fuel bro. ok ok ok Because the distance became smaller. Yes? No. The air is less dense as you go up. Fair. For me cruising at a higher level is Beneficial. my so jet engines are performing To their design to perform at high levels. Yes. So you get good performance on top. I will use less fuel. There will be less traffic I will reach there soon. direct to me Routing will be found. Right. so right this plus Last minute delay is and because friend They have five or six routes in dispatch too. We get ready. It is not so that they Hit enter and it came out. now they have to say an end then really work hard and join points And then calculate time and fuel. complete all Something new has to be done. we sleep they were not Happy that you are using your brain. We This is how it has been going on here for the last 10 years It is happening. You are new here. that is an attitude I didn't mean I didn't mean anybody who worked any job anywhere in India in any sector and know All the people in India at some point in their lives they have had a touch Point With Some government, everybody understands your pain Everyone has had a touch point with them once no if anyone knows what the system is like there is no need to explain it so Let us understand that this is our background Cultural attitude to work say that and means this is the same attitude that you work for three months I will not do it. summer holidays are over I will celebrate. We are comfort loving people. A on High This thing is a must at critical safety junctions We as consumers do not expect that These flights operate in this manner. as a Consumer We Say Good Seat Recline It is not happening. Ok issue the bathroom is not working. ok issue like that is what we know. we don't See that this is the level of the issue. yes bro when Earlier some guy had said that the flu in Delhi Ahmedabad sector he pointed this out then i was like these things don't affect safety hmm but then I When I thought again I said it or obviously They don't affect safety but you are an airline why are you running it is a business you Want to Earn Money for Your Customers You want to package things right that they buy Right So If You Don't Have Enough Money and Will to make those things right on that safety you What money are you investing, still Background became background, no one cared It is not visible at all. Right right? when i eat I am going to eat, it's good for me Garnishing is coming. and in the kitchen The insects are roaming around. Do I know? Right Right right. Right. The food here is also good I am not coming. Yes, right, right. what is below Did it happen brother? right right right right right right right Right right. Brother, you have this flight Malaysian Airlines had 370 about it Have you ever done that to pass your time? do you know What happened? Hey, some data has come out. So do you know what he said? He did tell something No. Yes, they did say something from the front No, tell me. Maybe someone from the aviation end There was not much interest. Give it all quiet. I watched a documentary on Netflix. Hmm. So, I will look into it thoroughly and tell you, I will tell you. He doesn't tell me anything, bastard. They I dragged it for one and a half hour. like in ancient alien You used to do it earlier. I'll tell you this right now How did it become? And coming to the end. Yes. sees I am not a Netflix fan. I saw that By taking out time. He didn't tell anything What happened. I think Action History which is the biggest question mark in I think it is the same. that what happened? How Happened? Where did that flight go? How did you get it? Hey it went off the radar. can't be a brother It should go off the radar like this. Look, they are saying that there is a black spot on the radar What can't happen? Oh all over the world What's going on? to the US satellite I know everything. Yes, that is correct. so that date You might not be giving it. yes it is not right He can. It is not possible that that flight is I will tell you that I have arrived. Do you know what it is? MA 370 which was that flight from Malaysia It was fly curry. was going to China and Indian She disappears completely over the ocean. What conspiracy theories are there about him? Brother. Brother, pick up all the aliens, villains They took away the white people. You don't know this All. Documentary. Yes. documentaries thousands of aliens were in it Or some Chinese stuff could be put in it, or Had been. There were US CI agents in it. He got it taken down that what a lot There is more conspiracy in it and that Some of its parts were found. Yes. Australia Met near. Yes. Near Australia. And Where is she going from? It is said here I went there and wandered around like this. Madagascar Came here. Why did you go? Do you know how you got there No, nothing. And they say it feels so much It was not possible for him to go there. Exactly This was also an issue. not that much fuel that he is going somewhere around Australia Got it. Why does it happen? 2000 check it. I think 2018-17 is around this time. This is from the last 10 years. already do. Just write MA 370 to Malaysia. some more I don't know, you will find out only one thing. I This is one of the most famous plane crashes in my opinion. This is the one from Andes. It fell in the Andes in the 60's. In plaid 60's maybe. I don't know in between Why can't I remember now that my Why did he get interested in these things then? yes i saw this 370 has ma 370 all 27 2014 Flank from Kollampur to Beijing and it just went somewhere where koppal where beijing and where australian coast and where Where had you come from after roaming around in Madagas and It is said that it fell into the Indian Ocean it doesn't make any sense nobody knows really what happened Hey, there is some search and rescue for that too They did not find it, then search and rescue started I remember they had shut it down but they didn't find anything Search and rescue is now so big that the Indian Ocean What did you say you would look for something at the last radar point By the way civil radars are different. Military radars are different. when we people we fly under civil radars But the military is always watching you. donation Communicate with you but god is watching you. So Someone must be watching him 110%. Right? you can not disappear from this Planet. Even If You Crash You Don't probably disappear from a raider Immediately. you can't yes means when that It crashed and then you left, so that last dot So yours will stay there. I told you ADSB is out. ADSB Out and In. So it is not always in your control. They. it is sending infection out at everyone Instantaneous time. He keeps sending it. well and military radars are much much more Superior. Meaning, they leave no black spot Not there. How do you like the flights you take? People make fun of me. how do they compare to Military aircrafts? what we fly is basically point a Carrying two point B passengers Are. militaries perform their own sorties And missions and all. You just saw what They took out this B2 and sent it to Iran What do they look like, friend? Plains people, did you see B2? This game is at the next level, this is so Geopolitics is next level isn't it brother 19 Or do they have some ships like that and only they have it and no one else has it there were 21 There have been a few crashes, two crashes and one in Goa Somewhere else in Guwahati one aircraft This one is two billion brother and this bomb too This bomb is thrown, it creates a hole first Down for a long time and then several feet below the ground The Called Bunker Busters bunker explodes in There are busters and it is made a complete The aircraft is a wing. it's basically a Wing. It's a wing. See if there is something in this He is not there. I mean if you are normal If the aircraft sees, then the rudder in the aircraft It is there, isn't it, brother? Tale There is no tail. And what kind of science is this which only they know because tale Without it the aircraft cannot fly. What will be the function of the tail? Your control. So there are three moments. Pitch up, pitch Down, roll as it turns and yours. yo is the most important. If yo were not Then I don't know how you are doing it how to maintain it, you must be doing something there must be some surfaces or many small ones This radar must have been installed on all the planes I don't even come to check who is B2. It is manufactured by Lockid Lockid will probably be a B-2 aircraft Manufacturer North Spirit Manufacturers North Northrop Hugh Aircraft wow i have never even heard northp but as a prime contractor with boring Hughes and What [music] Interesting but they have technology which they do not the world even does not know I am convinced that this is a UFO Sightings to whatever extent they occur 10 to 20% of those cases might be like this They must have been looking for a flight to take This must have happened when the bombing happened in 2001 When they brought down the twin towers then they use F2 raptors to bomb right People didn't even know Iraq was rappers back then what happens to them, they already had these They should have made this ending 20-30 years ago no obviously because when I tell you then What is the benefit Yes No Military strength You must be keeping any guarantee, I don’t believe it can because my American military I had friends in the college where I studied I used to do infusion from military there as well I used to get a lot of attention from the faces of those people But brother, there was relaxation regarding the war It was a different kind of relaxation for them You know, you don't know what we It has been suppressed. And the stories I got from them I have heard about the weapons they have used Just unreal out of this world kind of Stuff. They have access. So yes and If there is any military power then it will be the most First she will think that you should keep such weapon hidden The guy might not even know. May be you don't even know. also know no, because when the chance comes we will attack Of. And America is at the top in this matter. Is. Very top, very. So now you will tell me Why? you are spending billions on Research. Your military budget is only this much Then why would you tell me? that and what you sell Countries like Pakistan are getting their F16 So you will break it like this if you are at war So that's you then I mean that's from your childhood There are toys. toys from the 1960's and 40's Your. now you are reusing them Friend, sell it somewhere else and buy it. You are selling it. The technology remains. a mine plant The setup is . Come on brother, who wants to buy, buy Take. Right right right right right right. I I was recently watching a video on how Nuclear weapons were acquired by all Countries. Of all the countries. So theirs is that what was that project manhattan project. Then how did Russia They both caught him, how did the Germans catch him? Soldiers o German Scientist German Scientist, she did all the research The Nazis had captured them They did this work, then how South Africa Israel Israel is confirmed What does India not do after India? There was a sensation on that and still India has it Pakistan has 200 nuclear war heads has 150 something and this one has 25 thousand which it has declared, the US has just And Russia has declared more than this Yes, but the US will have many more. Which one He was prepared that Russia had more war plans There will be AIDS. have you ever flown in a weird sector Just like these issues had happened recently. Cannot fly over Pakistan. etsetra etsetra have you had some weird No, then if Pakistan gets blocked Let us leave from Ahmedabad below. Good If you go out from the Gulf after crossing the entire Gulf Your flight time increases. More You take the fuel with you. But not that weird I have flown in the weather many times. We What is happening truly in turbulence? Like we only feel tremors Are. What do you guys see that we are looking at from the clouds They are leaving. When the friend shakes a little bit Neither is that ok. butt just like up When you go you call him CB Clumlow Nimbus clouds are very dangerous They look big. there is no friend in it We would have entered. well one thing that is said Us. Don't get into this, brother. That is not Chul Go and see. Please don't show so much. They It will destroy your ship. whatever happened indigo In the flight to Srinagar. yes yes in which It burst from the front. yes so right now the pilots It was grounded. And now DDC has His investigation has been completed. He asked for corrective training to the pilots and according to the news the way he worded it if you If you read it you will understand. He too in some words are saying such that friend no Should have gone. Look, your mistake has crept in Is. After that, whatever year you You have landed that award Needed There is appreciation too. We are brothers, very how in difficult situations like theirs Half the thing had failed. Unreliable Air Speed ​​failed, this failed, that failed brother, how to land what did he do i.e. the trump card pilot who He landed but why did he go, brother? How did you get in? Why did you get in? Meaning you got in well you got in yes and this one like that is in it There were storms and torrents, what was in it? I also made a video so what happened in that You are there, you saw the weather in front of you There is a whole mountain range on the right side Pakistan is on the left side, we are He said if we want deviation then you The person you are talking to says friend go to the military the military says You are a civil aircraft, Pakistan Talk to Civil. They have There was no frequency. He is back in Delhi Passed by. Asked for frequency from Delhi His. I called him. Now they also say He must have called the military from behind Brother, what should I do? He is asking for it. They He might have refused. so brother if your Even if the weather had come 20 miles, all this would have happened You have reached 20 miles. You are at his doorstep You are standing there. So he said he will not let me go. So, brother, what should I do now? left hand to I just entered. So you entered and then you got inside Scandal. So No turn back till today due to weather It did not happen. So he is saying that they should have turned back. Delhi was very far away I would not have gone away. half an hour more than that The entire flight takes at least half an hour. should we go back or else people are saying that I could have dropped you somewhere there. So maybe let's go I assume that there was weather in the whole thing, so no came to my mind. but if you are safe You are playing right and you have played extra Burned the fuel. Passenger Inconveniences It also happened. Anything can happen. bro a little bit why would you be interested in the company but if this happens If a scandal happens then it will become nation wide news She goes. we are actually now after this there There is a lot of news that there is no such and such flight flew. Did such and such flight raise any issue? Gave. It was a British Airways flight. I Think to Chennai. london chennai tha sector Don't know which one it was. any why on that too Is again a Boeing, it is of the same make. And why is that happening? why do you Think? I can't say about the British why Did? But what I know is that Air India Brother, some of the pilots are upset right now. upset Is. Plus they also feel a little bit that Friend, we are sitting in an airplane. Yes Right. The management is sitting downstairs. Right? Engineering is also sitting down. Roasting also She is sitting down. and we are in the ship so we I am sitting. so if you if you're giving me A okay aircraft. i will not take a Ok aircraft also now. give me a The Perfect Aircraft to Fly. Why should I Should I take it? There are three M's in it. one of mine friend says that friend so there are two packs In the aircraft. Pax Means Air There are conditioning packs. and a pack I run two CAKes as backup. Cabin Air What do you say about pressure controller? Boeing I probably say this. so two packs end Two caiques behind a pack. So that makes four cakes. He says Sir one cage is bad. Two CAGs It is bad. Take it. ML says take it. One You can do sector. are you going to delhi and That was an outbound flight. so from there The engineer also says sir don't park here ship. And you know, a lot goes into irrigation Is. Sir don't write this because you will write it So I will have to go through the whole procedure. Sir don't write. I will give you the okay for this as well I am keeping the status. You take him away. you this Station the ship in Delhi. Yours in Delhi There is a company. She will make it. all the parts are there There is something. This is one. The engineering and Pilots' all time runs. The pilots say yes I will write it. Sir don't write the list Please. The flight will be delayed. come to me Will go. And look friend, this is one thing out of 100 So now the companies also have to change a bit It will have to be I don't want to live life for even a minute Needed Companies are very important that 1 minute that there should be no delay and he is the ground staff No, he carries too much Because I think they would have been killed a lot is behind this thing that there is a delay of 3 minutes Went. They might have killed him. Us So I don't know whether they will kill me or not. But the According to them, that is their thing, not their behavior Brother, they are always torn. We Sir Delay It should not come. delay come over me delay will go. So that one minute delay is what the poor guy is waiting for They keep trying to do okay so that it doesn't happen Had to cut. yes yes what do they say sir don't write it in this, post it on etsy So you can tell me that the ship arrived on time I called ATC and the ATC called Clearance was not given, put it on ATC Because if you post it on ATC then there will be no inquiry nothing will happen okay okay so Sometimes friend, we get so much that Bhai means why are you working this pressure But I mean you don't even need crores of rupees The company is not paying the money, brother, that is correct This is true, these are not the stakes of life It should be yours, yes right, yes whatever it is And the guy who is working in this position He gets a normal salary brother Brother yes, for that brother take so much pressure It happens every day, be it one day or two days It's an everyday story, brother. The story is that there is a fight of two minutes, sir don't put it on me, put it on ATC The engineer down below says, Sir, don't bother me put it in ATC that is a fight yes and it happened to me you were 3 minutes late You go, you land, you get an email from the company why explain this 3 minute delay brother one thing Tell me, as a consumer, I feel that Flights are more than happy to be like you I sit here for two to four to five hours I am sitting, flight is not flying, yes, yes and Consumers we learn which flights not to take Because all this will definitely get delayed. Yes, look, it could be like Air India's This might happen but friend Indigo that She is very strict about time, she is Indigo is the only flight you take These are the people who beat you up every couple of minutes no it happens there or not If you want then post it on Etsy or But in that case, friend, there is a lot of pressure much remains on the whole system that have to do have to do have to do have to do If you want to do it, then there shouldn't be that much pressure no so you are saying now pilots are not okay with flying and okay yes yes so I was telling you there that friend, he says Sir sir, I will give it to you after giving it okay. You don't write. don't write. You tell me that this Failure came in the air. Ok. So on this There will be no responsibility. Yes. That That failure occurred after take off. and to everyone Do you know where that take off failure occurred? Air India also knows it. He also knows this. All the airlines know it. Everyone knows. Because it is recorded by the system In. Right. So that's what I say when DDC Only Air India 171 conducts audit It does not open. But all these scandals come to light. What the hell are you doing in maintenance. And I'm saying it might happen yes. Yet I say that I I don't know whether it will happen or not. But the stories that I am getting to hear, brother He took off. A brother said Friend, I had two cakes blown away. Still it It's okay to fly with two cakes. in the air Went. A cacique flew into the air. now now one I am blowing it on the cake. So he had some Had decked off from the station. now it is very Hard for the aircraft to maintain Aircraft cabin pressure no. those 10 12 feet He must have reached there. He got a warning. He Said I will not climb at 3000 feet. Maybe it is not safe that we could not maintain it pressure then i will design emergency I am right, he is back at his base Why should I not take a chance, this is the thing that friend now if again in this There will be an investigation and that pilot you were penalized for this Why did we turn back the Cabin CAG There won't be any warning, he would have gone away saying Sir I was being safe, we are the only one left There was no warning but if it came my friend I'm not feeling safe lest I blow one Buddy We are ML, right ML brother, ML only then It is valid as long as you are on ground. Once you take off ML has no Meaning. Then you can make a practical decision practical so practical means if If you want to fly an aircraft then let's go in the aircraft If you get a warning, come back. But one of yours There is also experience, isn't it, brother? there is one. Should I take off? Long Sector Is. A brother says there are two radars in the weather Boeing There are. We have a weather radar that says I was a failure. Nml allows you to dispatch with one field aircraft he dispatched The wind has turned and whatever is blowing seems to be like this By clicking OK the status, the status is found and OK And dispatch sends it with the same tape which we call the one that turned in the air I am sitting on top of Iran so God knows that The weather was clear, there was no weather at that time was not from my position to Delhi The weather was clear and the depth was 2 feet (2000 feet). There was a ship below so I thought if there was one ahead Then after seeing him I will go away So brother you can talk to him below From. Yes you can do it. you can say that butt no because there is a lot of traffic Not on frequency. Right? good beans The frequency is the same frequency, right? Well If You're Long Down to One Two 1.7 So everybody is on two one7 so everybody is on that Let's talk. Then you can talk to ATC. yes. Many times it has happened that no one comes. When we go to Guwahati etc. There is a lot of military activity there. Those people are flying at low level sometimes There are. So there is no ATC contact. He says that friend tell him that here Let's go. I tell him no. Interesting. ATC is saying go here let's go. Because we're on top. we can catch He has it. ATC and he both were on low level Are. If it is interesting then you can talk about it In such situations it is normal to talk but we And this Airbus is a French company Being is American Company American Company and How Do It They match up like from a pure Airbus What Runs Versus Boeing Perspective How does it run in such a narrow body The competition was 737 vs Airbus 320 ok this narrow body narrow body means single Seat like this in the island Seat like this white There are two oils in the body, I understood it correctly Their flagship is 737 and this one has just 320 Now 320 has been upgraded to Neo, bring less 15 to 20% fuel savings are there in it Orders came from there, there is a little left out in these I started feeling something and she told me to do something too so if they brought the 737 max then this was a Typical Boeing vs Airbus competition If you are going to the airport, look at If there is any Airbus then it is a little higher From the ground, we are Boeing 767 take if you see side by side then air bus this If it is Boeing then it's here, so the wings are down We will be there. So the engine ground clearance The engines are also lower, under the wings. R Little Closer to the Ground We're a Little Bit Closer to the Ground Up to the ground. So Airbs has liberty To make a slightly bigger engine. We to this It is called turbo fan engine. Hum Sleep Turbo They are more fuel efficient in fans. they make Less noise and 80% of the air bypasses the engine. They are high bypass ratio enj. We Only 20% old jets if you look hard military jets make big noises there Loud hum because they are pure jet engines Turbo fan engines are not pure jet engines Because 80% of the air bypasses the core Interesting so they cushion the sound Are. So there was no space on the Boeing because That guy is already downstairs. then they did not Have space to make a high bypass ratio. So This is the wing. This is the wing. Ok? these wing Is. You are installing the engine here. So he Said we will not plant it here. we are the engine Will enclose. Ok? Is it okay? and we will make a big engine and let's compete With Air Bus. and we will also give you 15 The 20% Fuel Saving Was Named 737 Max His. Yes. So friend there is immense power and an engine Imus produces power. When you're on Imus If you produce power, even a little You will have vectors which contain force the vector of force coming from here and here It is coming from. then it will give you a certain Delta. Right? We will change your thrust, The torque will change. Many things will change. Hmm. So how to do it now? they said it was Producing Ah A Slightly Pitched Up Attitude. when you put full power it was Giving the aircraft a slightly pitch-up Attitude. So he said how to correct it do? Let's do one thing. we have made a Software Wherever You Put Full Power in the The aircraft will automatically put its snows Down. Got it. So that counter balance will give. now it this function was called am Cash. Pull up my cash. What is M Cash? It happens? Full form. Yes, it is watching The engine that he had photographed was behind Look at this Boeing, it's a little down. and Airbus The clearance is above. it's still not very clear. yes down down down down no. Yes First Rear Left Left Left No Yes this this look this. Yes. So left is Airbus. Yes. Right is Boeing. Airbnb Hire. Right? It Has more ground clearance. Right? So They Are Here Debert to Make Slightly Better Bypass Engines. Interesting. Interesting. Please back once. Yes. MK Search it. Search MK. MCS right? Yes Maneuvering Characteristic Argumentation The system has gone down so this is it He said that we have this in the software When I put it on, he said this is not it Necessary for pilots to know okay this is just a thing that the plane will do yes we did it's a software and we have made Embed that in the systems and pilot it No input is required, it's an automatic feature which will counter balance the excess Pitchup Got It Pilot also knows about it no and he said that the 737 which flies Does the 737 Max have to fly? just to our ground class is enough same You fly everything, only the pilots know no what is m cash then do it twice m cash mail function is done brother So what does mcsh do with mcsh mail function he is putting his nose down and this one and I gave the nose down command And the plane went down, o the pilots knew no what is MC does it count this Could have countered as well. some such system tha which you move but it was you need ims to Move. Later it was done in SIM also. Humanly an average male cannot move that. It takes that much force because it's good friend All the movements that happen with the aircraft that these electronically and hydraulically Flash flaps move hydraulically Are. In a small aircraft you do the labour yourself Do you move? when you're flying with a Speed ​​of 200 nautical miles and 250 knots. There is an air pressure. I am, right? Right. so you can't move a surface when there is So much air pressure. not by human force You can do it. We do that even in the sim I tried it. It was not possible. But Interesting thing happened again that this MKS How did you pass it? So he said that He passed the FSA in a hurry Diya because they were losing the race to air bus. Okay, okay, ICIC. Yes. so this Race also has a direct impact, brother. Like means safety and the symptoms are Then it depends on humans and pilots. Yes. So There were two crashes. Liner 610 down. We and An Ethiopian bean also crashed. a there there is one more thing i think which is worth Talking about. Brother you were telling me what Pointing out pilot error in a way is very Convenient for all parties involved. because then Boeing or Air India No investigation needs to be run. Insurance money can be obtained very easily. Say something to that effect. because i think People don't understand this. Consumers don't understand this aspect of flying et all. So like I told you about the Goat incident I told you. Hmm. That is you making a pilot error You can, but you should go and check their history. Study to see if they got enough rest, friend Was it there or not? Right. what safety What were the cultures? How is the training done? Is training just about signing a paper? Is it happening or is it even happening? the same standard that hmm. That is also very important, right? so if You have 100 aircrafts on order. You Don't want them to sit on the ground, right? You need people to fly them. so are you just Many times friend, in my college we have When I failed in my B.Tech project When I went there the professor told me to do one thing Anyway, you should wait for two months I will have to do it in 5 days because I also don't want to stop brother, yes it is right, right? This happens even if you are on leave That's what happens, isn't it? So that's that culture. In your airline if the trainer fails If he gives it then the trainer will have to come again, right? He will come in just two hours and says come on friend You do it right this time, I'm telling you So is that the culture in your airline or Proper training standards. so you have to Take deep to understand to go to the root cause Of the accident. It would have been much easier from the top You should blame me that yes, it is an error, Its an error or engineering error. the one who I told you about the spy jet from Kolkata Told the incident. We will tell him This is an engineering error. The procedure is that you should talk on headset then someone The button should be pressed. But why doesn't he follow Happened? Is the culture like that? She has her own You must have seen seniors doing similar things happened. That's why he is also doing it. Seniors scored 10 Nothing happened for a year. do the same Used to be. So what is culture? The three right now People were fired upon in Air India They are not decision makers from rostering The decision makers are singing here Friend, he is not taking the profit home They are from the company, they are getting salary right so whatever command is coming from above He is following right now he is following the command to do that they were sacked who I gave the command give us your city comfortably hmm I understand brother India is in India I don’t know, globally, but I am from India I can tell this after seeing many times whose throat was slit She goes away, she remains an escape goat, it always happens, brother That means now we have to show it to the public To say that you are doing something. not to me I don't know whether its details are like this or not. But People should know that sometimes The man whose effigies were burnt in public That man is actually jealous of her It is not as big a crime as any other What happens by sitting in the back? So yes and that's it the pilots aren't there To defend themselves. yes so me too I don't know if you call it pilot error If yes, then claiming insurance is also a little easy remains. Right? Sooner Hughes I think Hughes incentive in this comes quickly yes it A huge incentive, yes, nothing light That would be a very good insurance it would happen and then the blame has been rested on the pilot you do you do you do you don't have to do anything to keep everybody safe Because friend the other parties are involved do they have to continue their business right they can't they can't shut down right if If any blemish or black spot appears then Then their business will be impacted and they don't want that right then may be they will say that It's okay friend, there were only pilots and there are lots of ah stakeholders now at this point of This accident became a very big case because Buddy. It is not a small case. It did not come Don't think so. and infact since then joe General level of people regarding flights Having anxiety I've been tracking on Twitter to extend whatever I mean since Then the new cycle has changed a lot. But two for a large while i was like that bhaiya here in this plane they said that we will not Fly and That Pilot Is Saying We Will Not Fly and this side had to come down. Yes, for a long while, probably, organically, Problem, because it was coming to me On Twitter. I was following that. and one General sense of consciousness has increased. I Don't know if it will last. it is a very Interesting thing. i think its quite a good thing that pilots are refusing to fly okay Aircraft. Because we as consumers we Never. Yes, I think they should do it. they should put their food down and say that yaar I will write this. Clearly correct, isn't it? Yes, that's right. Hey it happened to me. I was taking a walk around once and I Saw some blood stains on the wing. o what does it mean bird bird b strike by strike or whatever lands it happened only then it happened at what speed tell me Sir, I will clean it up, take it away, I said brother what yes that is correct friend means if How to fix a problem if a bird has entered the engine should I go, anything can happen, yes brother I Where I'm taking the flaps in the air I didn't come So yes, his feather is stuck inside The bird is stuck in the trap, it is not clear will be able to do it yes right second jyoti sir Write in the next sector that there is a delay they are getting delayed right now because The aircraft was already delayed and now it is very late Taking one hour in the next sector Write about the haltage ship there. I haven't Then I stopped doing all this. I said Alright brother, a lot of work has been done brother. yes means Do it brother, do it. If I get any email I will answer it. And I said friend that You have a best attitude. means you I say that you do your job properly Will you do it? then you need to take tension It is not there, friend. At least psychologically free yes. Hey, you are free in every way friend. What to do had been? You have come to do your work only and that is it you actually feel you are not doing it properly You are helping someone. you help I am not doing it. you're ruining their work And you are taking tension on yourself as well Yes you are. Because brother this has happened many times The pilots tried to help Management Key and Something When Goes Around No, the DG only grabs the pilot by the throat Brother. hum hum because what is your license Then you can't fly? We are the Management Still the suspension will be for 15 days. I will come again for a month. You you won't be able to fly because you need something There is no other work except flying an airplane. Right? You only know how to do one thing and that is without you Can't do it without license. we think so i that is let's play safe and that's everyone's It is fine and there is no problem. Meaning I have seen it many times friend, even I myself when I would be flying somewhere there would be fog Nothing happens to that poor staff They are fighting. So I go and meet the staff I will take this side. Maam that ship is not there came because from there I came to try explain to them that I don't know what Why not? So many times I defend I do it too. We are the passengers I am pacifying myself at the airport and You are becoming a big leader. I said sir no but it is like that because he He says that other airlines take take-land Indigo is not flying or any other airline India is not doing it. I said sir that Coming from the airport. take off there The minima are different. She is coming from Delhi. Take off minima is different in Delhi. so It is landing here. she couldn't land The one from Amritsar. So people didn't know that To. Yes, I don't know. Isn't it? we so we So let's make sure if the flight is late So. Yes. We were just getting angry Is. Because friend, other airlines are coming Is. Yours is not coming. Sir its Delhi The ship which must have been there has arrived. the weather is fine there Is it done or you can go there even in 100 meters You can take off. It was to come from Amritsar. 1000 meters are required in Amritsar. the weather is bad Everywhere. So he can't take off From there. Now he can't take off because of boredom. Can. So the general public does not know. so yes Right right. well I mean bro here i this is one of those things about real Life. Where there is no closure. to me It seems that some of the things are like this And there probably aren't four such things in the whole year. There are things that we should talk about openly and let them hang in the air for them to be late for people to consume and for people to understand and to just you know sit with it this is one of those things frankly there is no right answer that everything ends in sadness everything ends in confusion but if it seems like an accident Now if it happens then it will be investigated as well Accidents don't happen with just one mistake that he did something wrong or an engine failed Done. It has a Swiss cheese with no cheese Let us teach you a model. That happens. so there are lots of holes you know what tom And Jerry eats cheese. ji to all the holes have to align at one point at one day at that Instant for that accident to happen. Lot of things go wrong. because that's what I'm saying hmm friend aircraft are really beautiful Machines. They just don't fail like that. To them I twisted it a lot and took a lot of advantage Must have gone. There will also be a human factor. that day Some mistake might have happened at the airport also. Long There might also have been a history of scheduling. Management also has to do with when that happens and not Really bad day. [ __ ] everything aligned on the same day Done. what happens sometimes is that you you are not rested but first officer arrested or did you see something. something was given Another save but that day everything aligned. We Right right. Thank you so much for your video. infact Even what was your response to Captain Steve but I think you conducted yourself very well Gracefully and as a very good healthy Example from the aviation sort of side of Things in the public and media side. thank you You are so much for doing that. Thank you so much For taking out time for this conversation. Thank you brother. this has been i have learned A lot. it's still very sad but I have Learn a lot. Absolutely. I some thing It happens that I am not able to understand. I I still think about it, my friend, I still see that The aircraft is going down and I imagine that I what could I do if I were there and the The answer every time I get it is probably nothing Maybe I am the only God in that sim It was evaluated and also recreated again that It was not a mistake that he lost and could not do anything I could but if he was real then what would I do I would be screaming or what would I be doing It just happens when it's your last 10 seconds In life, whom would I be remembering? is he scary bro or thank you so much brother i hopefully see you Soon for a brighter conversation, thank you so much thank you thank you brother
