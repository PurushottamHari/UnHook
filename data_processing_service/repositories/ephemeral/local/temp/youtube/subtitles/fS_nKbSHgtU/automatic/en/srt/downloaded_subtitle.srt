1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
I want to understand. First of all,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,080
what do you think about this 11a

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
Miracle? its this this

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
You don't think it's a little strange? Meaning

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What are the chances of someone surviving?

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,840
Brother, no one is left, only that man is left. So,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,960
I don't know if there was a guy in 11 before

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,439
Yes, he was saved. This one survived too, brother,

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,119
What do you mean God has to save him, save him

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
Took it. This crash happened earlier also in the same 11

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,560
It's saved. Was left on 11A. this is the same emergency

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
The exit window is the side seat. I slept

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,080
no this much that the seat above the wings

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
happens, from there a structurally sufficient

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,599
The ship becomes stronger from there. but this case

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
I just fell completely down Terry

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
If I survived then I have no idea brother how I survived

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
What is strange and what does it mean

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
Walking out of it playing video

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,920
Brother, he is jumping out of the fire balloons

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,079
and it seems as if it is going on

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,039
Like what in the brother what is his life

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
What would the rest of the people think, brother?

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,440
Imagine his body burning next to his seat

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
It's been four yes and she has it here too

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,440
There was no fracture even in the finger

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,600
Insane means friend can you pull up

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,879
His visual? I mean, I don't know if anyone

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
I have not seen this. Do you not know who you are talking about

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
I am the one who survives, I mean I

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,799
It seems that friend God has to save someone

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,439
No, I would have saved him. anything means yes

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
Here it is. And he just walks out. no brother

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
He has a fracture in his leg or something. Meaning

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,000
The guy is able to walk, friend. it's in his mind

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
he can brother it looks like he came out of a crash

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
This has happened. brother in car accident

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
I have seen worse people than this, brother. Oho

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,759
Brother to whom yes.

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,040
Look at this. Yes. so this is where it stops

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,360
Generating left that's going down.

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,799
I have also heard brother that double engine

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,320
Being a failure is one in a billion

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,920
I would say it will be trillion of billion. I have

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,520
Didn't see it. Why is it like this? why are you two

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,200
The engine is so secure that both of them cannot fail

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,960
Can. friend first no trans atlantic

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
Flights and Pacific flights four engines

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,759
Ships with these used to run. if you look now at boeing 340

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,240
Travel 747 so the regulation said that friend four

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,680
If one of the engines is made of three or two flowers, then

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,399
then we said our technology so advanced that

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,719
Two engines will never fail at the same time

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,799
we saw when boeing triple 7 was made for him

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,600
Direct approval was given that you can fly over

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
There is no water because there is no chance two engines one

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,840
We have made it so much that we fail together

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
If you can't advance, you can't fail so much

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,720
There is more trust on technology that two engines

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,599
Cannot fail and there is no operational reason

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
maybe because i mean if my car engine ends

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm using a very stupid example can

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,160
fail any time what is so special about to

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,920
I am not feeling my love my engines are in such a state

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
that there is a lot of redundancy

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,720
And that's why they are so expensive right

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,800
Now if you own a Maruti

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,319
Do you buy a car and a Rolls Ryce?

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
So there is redundancy in that, so both

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,080
Brother, both A to B will be delivered. Right?

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
Which has more safety? in an expensive car

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
It must be that your air bag has come out, friend

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
will come. This will happen. you must escape the sirens

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Will go. If you fall asleep it will set an alarm

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
will give. The car will stop automatically. So safety

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
Majors are built into the system. we have given

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,959
R set of the art machines. Billions Of

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Dollars have been spent to make such machines.

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,200
has that been another case of a dual engine

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
FAILURE EVER IN AVIATION HISTORY? can you

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,879
Check Dual Engine Failure in Aviation

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
History. Brother it is a dual engine but

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,840
Like the stall is done or the birds have come. By the way

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
It has happened. I didn't even know this happened brother

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
What? It's called a flame out. Right?

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,200
Ok. it's a flame out that's going on and

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
It stopped. It never happened like that. Some?

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,120
All the indicators must have gone to zero

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,760
It is in front. yes all the bells rang ton ton ton

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,319
It will be completed. and when both ends fail all the

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
The NECESSARY PANELS The screen in front of you.

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,640
Everything Goes Dark Except Captain Side

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
Only the rats which used to be there, the rat came.

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,799
The rat only moves that much. what is rat

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
Brother? Dude, it's a ram air turbine. Good.

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
so it's a small fan which drops down

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
from the belly of the aircraft when there

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
is there no electrical supply to the

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,959
Aircraft. me and that too a particular

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,000
Runs up to speed. like there's a lot of talk

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,120
If it is rat then rat is electrical

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,879
When I saw it in my childhood it looked like this

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
The fan used to come. we used to do it outside the car

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
That toy seller used to move around on his own. we we

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
So the wind is blowing around the rat, brother. Rat Koi

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
There isn't an engine like that. The rat is small

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,640
and it requires a minimum air speed

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,680
It is there to perform the function. Ok. So

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Below as you land in the Airbus

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
149 ns that gives even less power. Then you touch

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,599
If you turn it down it stops immediately.

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,360
So the wind is blowing it around. he by himself

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,720
No one is generating power by taking any fuel.

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,239
Hum to rat aya aircraft speed 184

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
There were knots. If he is going down then reduce the speed

116
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,680
It must be happening. So what did the rat do?

117
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,440
Must have done it. Then the aircraft is on batteries

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Done. which would be two 25 volt batteries

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
It is in the air bus. I don't know how much it costs

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,800
Is. Hmm. so very minimal

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
The pilot will have controllability. this fan

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
What is the purpose of a rat? this is the rat

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,280
No? yes what is its purpose? So

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
when lets say you have no so two engines

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,160
Went. Right? The engines have generators.

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,240
Generator one generator two. if we fail in exam then

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,880
The generator is also not working. From lats

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Both generators provide AC power. Now

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,360
Where does the ship get its electrical supply from?

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,600
Will I get it? he gives a rat then he goes down through the

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
Rotation through the rotation. He gives very little

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Brother, that. it is just that it will power one

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,720
Hydraulics and Your Bare Minimum Systems

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
It will work. good gear up she don't go

135
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,840
It would require a lot of power to gear up

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
and you don't want to waste gear up

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
You just have to land in it

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
safely right right right right right then

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
Everything Goes Off Captain's PFD Walk

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
This must have been his stand-by instrument

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
It must be going on and that's it brother in the name of God

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
Take it and land it, it has so much power

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
then the captain probably gives a maid a

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
call boss everything is closed do something

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,160
well there is a question like me

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
After the video people said that I

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080
should I tell you yes yes please tell me that

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,759
If you give me a summary then friend, one in the aircraft

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
The system is AD DSB at every point

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
of time instantly it sends out

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
The Signal That's How ATc Comes to Know

152
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
your position your height your speed and

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
Everything and there is a third party company

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,160
cold radar 24

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,520
radar 24 if you pull up radar 24 he will pull you up

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
of all the aircraft in the world

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,440
Shows the position live, where and what is going

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Where is he not going then Radar 24

159
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,039
This data was made live and it came to us

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,360
Whatever 30 seconds it took from Air India 171

161
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
I was in the flight so they were saying that yaar it

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Took a really long time to lift off from the

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,639
Runway. so let's say this is what

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
The distance you take when you have both inches

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,759
Running. hum if you have one engine fail you will

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Take Slightly Long Distance. power is low

167
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,680
Went. This ship travelled a greater distance than that

168
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:21,199
Took it. That is what the data is suggesting.

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,039
So it's V1, friend. V1 is my decision

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,039
Speed. Ok? before V1 if i had any

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,000
major problem occurs late if i lose n

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,759
Engine before V1 hum i will reject take off

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,720
i can stop i can stop you have enough

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,440
Runway to stop after V1 if engine fails

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,919
if it happens then I don't have enough runway to stop

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,440
ok i have to take off after v1

177
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,360
we are here so i am flying

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,639
I have my hand here on the first lever

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,759
I have it in my hand I can do pull ups

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,240
hun so my first officer gives the call 100

181
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,479
nots 100 nots means that now I am I

182
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
Entering a high speed regime. where things are

183
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,520
Critical Now. No problem with high speed

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,880
If it is there then it is critical. Below 100 knots

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
So I can even solve a small problem

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
Reject. I will come back after getting the go back corrected.

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,319
I'm go minded at over 100 knots.

188
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,880
Now when I reach we one he gives a call we

189
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,240
one the important step i i remove my

190
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,599
Hands from the Thrust Layers. because mistake

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't reject it even from there. Because Incent

192
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,039
It would have happened. ok ok ok ok. Yes. Some?

193
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,720
It happened that the bell rang or he said something. Sir I

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,000
it's a very crypto i remove my hand

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
from the first sleeves even by his mistake

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Don't reject me I'm 100% gone

197
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,240
minded so after v1 i am go minded

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Even if the engine fails, we are here

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
start rotating wheel of pay is my

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
Lift off rotating edge in the engine start

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,759
I start I start ok you start

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
I will also do pulling of pulling ups pull ups

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,880
A little over the top but the point is where I leave my

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,759
ground is wheel off okay okay so

205
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,080
the engine is there so the plane has taken off

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
So everything was fine before V1, right?

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
For V1 then we are sure that before V1 all

208
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,360
It was ok. Got it. Now what happened after V1

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,520
yes brother. That's right. So my theory is that

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
As far as I understood from my mind

211
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
A little bit so I am saying that friend V1

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
After that one of its engines failed. Got it.

213
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,039
Yes. Ok? And he rotated. thats

214
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,000
why he took little lager to lift off from

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,440
The Ground. Right? Now he rotated it so

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,240
His speed decreased. and then another thing bro

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
This is not an everyday story. Now he is the captain

218
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
Came to him. Friends retire even once

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
They do it. Not a single engine fails.

220
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Retire with 25-25,000 hours.

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If people don't happen, nothing happens. and in the sim

222
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,599
Dude you have practiced enough times. In the sim

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,520
What happens? as we sit and talk

224
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
Are. An instructor will come and give a briefing

225
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,479
Every one hour. Gaurav today we had an engine failure

226
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
do. One engine failed for me I am a V1

227
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
I will give it first. I'll give it to you after a V1. V1's

228
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
First you have to reject it. Maintain

229
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,760
Central Line. Give a call. if there is a fire

230
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,599
Will evacuate. Happened after V1. then dead

231
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,240
Foot dead engine. maintain the central line of

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,320
The Nose. see your ship and then take

233
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
The Auto Pilot Trims the Aircraft and

234
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Aftill 400ft No Action Just Gear A

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
plena and then give a maid a call tell him

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
To Stand By and Reach the Acceleration Altitude

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,959
Level up and then clean up complete procedure

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm revising okay okay okay

239
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
Alright brother, when I'm sitting in the plane

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
I know it will give in swimming, yes, yes

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,680
In a real situation, even a little bit

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
The bell bursts in the man's ship

243
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
I may be the one who started by the

244
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,560
The effect was that one engine failed during take off

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,320
did some reach 100 feet

246
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
something unusual must have happened to him there

247
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
attention must have been that friend what happened

248
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,360
If it happens then you gear up at 100 feet and

249
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,440
you put gear up is landing air landing

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,480
air there is a call out i'm flying hill

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
he will say positive climb and only after

252
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,440
His call I'll say gear up and this has

253
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
happened to me in the same that guy

254
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
If you don't say positive climate then I will gear up

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,040
I will not say it, I will initiate that call got

256
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
It He Must Not Have Said Positive Climb

257
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
Because when there is a positive climate my

258
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,120
Vertical speed is going up I'm climbing so

259
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,320
he might have seen a slight drop and you

260
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
Only Say Positive When You Are

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Amative that this guy is becoming positive.

262
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,800
It must have looked to him like he was fickling.

263
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
so you must have said that I will wait

264
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,959
This is only becoming positive. I then I call

265
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,360
I will get it out. he wouldn't have called out

266
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,160
Till then maybe I will give him something

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
There might have been some trouble. So friend, there is one in Boeing

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
There is a procedure that happens in any engine

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
A malfunction occurs. you have to secure that

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,880
engine. And it should not get damaged. and one

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Such an incident has happened before in Gore

272
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,560
At 3000 feet in Delhi. they lost engine one

273
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,720
Due to birds. whatever engine got damaged

274
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,160
hua in the process of securing the

275
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,959
Secure the Wrong Engine. Oh shh it's done.

276
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
Oh wow that plane didn't land. Yes

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,959
Brother that day the biggest accident happened in India

278
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,480
Would. But that did not happen. So Captain Senior

279
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,480
Was. Yes. And so this was

280
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,519
He cut the wrong reason brother first

281
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,440
The officer did. and there is a little tense situation

282
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
No. It is difficult to explain this in a podcast

283
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
It becomes difficult. a jab in a cockpit

284
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
A little later, things move very fast. these 150

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
Work would have been going on at the speed of 200 notes

286
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
Is. the ship is moving forward and you are falling

287
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
There is a lot of work behind it. End

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
Take off and landing is a critical phase.

289
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
Right? There are 1000 tasks to be done and even in that if

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,640
If you get stuck then those 1000 tasks are missed. These

291
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Was left. Then you are more stressed. so like this

292
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,320
They say friend that the first sense you lose is

293
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,680
The Sense of Hearing. We are here, right? you class

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
I am the teacher teaching or she is speaking

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
In your ears. But if your attention

296
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,600
If it is happening somewhere then you will not hear it

297
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,399
You. so he did every action in the cockpit with

298
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,519
Concerning critical systems is a backup

299
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,600
that you ah you're the captain. I am the first officer

300
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
Am. So engine one has failed. I have to

301
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Secure Engine Two. I will say captain confirm

302
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
Number two. so you are supposed to look and

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
confirm that i am holding the right and then

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,399
You said confirmed captain. So the guy saw it

305
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,040
Even after seeing it I said wrong. He said

306
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,279
Confirmed. He grabbed two. He had to cut the forest.

307
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,000
So the bird entered the forest. We are that flame

308
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,640
I am out. Two he caught the captain confirmed

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,839
and if it cuts it then the aircraft is in

310
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,079
Flight without any engine. oh wow captain

311
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,480
He says this is Airbus' redundancy

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,399
So the spool was going down on engine number two and

313
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
This is so if you have not come below 43%

314
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,760
If you put it again, it will come again. get up

315
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
I will go again. He will get up. ok ok ok.

316
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
Sir, just need to add fuel. yes right. Ok.

317
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,399
That's wind milling. just add fuel

318
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,640
Is. Ok. Got it. It is not so in this

319
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
At Boeing. Well, it is in Boeing only. Yes.

320
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,800
Correct. So he saw what was happening

321
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,040
The captain noticed because there was sound as well

322
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,240
yes, everything happens. you lose also she

323
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,800
If I put it again then I put it in another

324
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
Bar start well fault occurred and it tore a bit more

325
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,959
He did that by pitching the aircraft down so that

326
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,240
wind milling ho again it came back then

327
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,639
they land it back safely oh wow they did if

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,279
If he is not there that day then another what

329
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
Be in Delhi Be in Delhi Yes Think and Land

330
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,360
and why did he land near them brother

331
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
they were at 3000 feet they had the altitude

332
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
these guys had altitude

333
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
It was not there friend, I was at 400 feet, what could I do

334
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
You can do it not at 400 feet but at 3000 feet

335
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
What difference would it have made if it had happened, brother?

336
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,839
manubar can you do something can you do a little something

337
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,839
Brother, I would say that Sabarmati is right there

338
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,519
But if I had gone, something would have happened to Hasan

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
Something would have happened, there would have been a field somewhere

340
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,079
if there was a farm somewhere I would have dropped it right

341
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,480
right right right right right now in that case

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,200
Friend, that incident which happened with Go Air

343
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,120
I took that as well very conveniently.

344
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,839
Narrated it to you or as much as the audience is watching

345
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,519
By making a pilot error you close the chapter

346
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
can you do it brother yes you can

347
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
yes, as much as I have just told you the facts

348
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,040
I told you yes ok but but friend

349
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,120
there is that is not a purpose of

350
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,760
Investigation. Those guys were bored at night

351
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,880
Had taken off.

352
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Had come to Delhi. Landed at 3:00. 5:00

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,040
Then the departure was at 8 o'clock and we were going to Bombay.

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,240
so now that's why the one who is now Air India's

355
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,839
of scheduling which they can of

356
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,079
The bombs have been opened. Scheduling opens

357
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,839
Brother. What are you guys doing back there?

358
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
Are you guys making a schedule like this?

359
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760
Brother, the guy who took off at night 12:00

360
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,920
Landed at 3:00 and arrived at 5:00

361
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,880
I have taken off. it is not a very good time

362
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,680
To be attentive. You would even measure our fatigue

363
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,200
yes. Is this a routine thing for the airline?

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,720
You are making the pilots fly like this.

365
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,639
Are you following the regulations?

366
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
Are you even scheduling? how is the rostering going

367
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,519
Is it happening? So that's why all these letters are opened

368
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,760
And then it turns out friend it is more of a

369
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,959
part of what is your culture

370
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,880
The airline's? I get it. Isn't it? If I

371
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
I am making you fly every night. So

372
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,360
It won't work, brother. I am also following

373
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,880
Am. Because it is proving that psychedelics

374
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,880
You are not very attentive in law. Psychadion

375
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
Law is from 3 to 6 in the morning. Right?

376
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,720
No matter how much you sleep during the day, brother brain

377
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
That much you are not that identical. so here

378
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
What I am saying is that firstly on the ground

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
India failed. Let's Come Back Band.

380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
Failed after a V1. He took off

381
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,720
what happened and the same thing might have happened with the aircraft

382
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
his attention was diverted from the landing gear and

383
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,519
He and Boeing have systems that you can use to power the engine

384
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,320
Do you secure it? and brother in airbust then

385
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,480
Yes it is not a memory item. you book

386
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
When you open the iPad, everything comes out. And

387
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,079
It appears completely on your screen. Aircraft

388
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
Tells you what to do. it's that smart

389
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
and once you do it it knows what you have done

390
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
it will remove that from ji theek hai na got

391
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,480
got it tuck it's way easy or boing me

392
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,560
It says this is a memory item, remember it, remember it

393
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
If you keep it then there are some memory items like

394
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
if i remember the whole airbus in airbus

395
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
there are only nine memory items

396
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
These are the things you have to remember, everyone else

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Brother, try to use your brain after looking at some books.

398
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
Memory is not good in this case brother

399
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
If it is an item then it says memory item that

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
let's assume the pilot flying is the captain

401
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,920
Pilot non flying and pilot monitoring

402
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,160
say is a first officer do action

403
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,199
Two actions of the First Officer and two of the Captain

404
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,639
The captain says to turn off the thrust lever

405
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,480
will give because the thrust levers are automatic

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
It moves. him off and then put thrust

407
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,639
Levers to idle. Thrust lever control

408
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,720
Always the pilot is flying and all that

409
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,160
Emergency Pilot Haze. So, an emergency occurred.

410
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,320
This guy puts thrust lever to idle. pilot

411
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,120
Non flying and pilot monitoring. his work

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,800
The fuel shut off valve is cut. we sleep

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,040
Cutting off the fuel. and then there is an engine

414
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,600
The secure or fire damage button is the push.

415
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,480
So those are non-reversible actions. If this

416
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,720
Number one has also been cut which we have failed and

417
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,079
That brother gave good engine fuel set of help

418
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,160
If you cut it then both of them are gone, brother. Good

419
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
write right right to that extant human

420
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,440
There might be an error. yes so to me what we are

421
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
I have included it in the video because brother its

422
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't understand anything other than

423
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,079
It is possible after that it might happen again

424
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,040
This must be wrong. Right? But as much as my knowledge

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
I will try to analyse till that. so me

426
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,720
So, I understand that this is what happened, brother.

427
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
will be. and that's the only reason they could have

428
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
It was in Gone Down Go Air that they

429
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,880
I posted it again, it's here but it's irreversible

430
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Actually, because you are at 400 feet height.

431
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,320
So you don't have time, hey it's irreversible

432
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,720
Be it 400 or 1000, it is irreversible

433
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
I cut off the fuel shut off valve and it started to fire

434
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
The button you pushed is irreversible

435
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
He came back to the ground and the engineer was fine

436
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,680
can do it well okay so if you have fuel

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,440
If you close the valve you can't open it again

438
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,440
I can do that. Then there is another button which says Engine

439
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,000
There is some damage to the button. well that's secure

440
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,560
The button is done. Yes. After that he is

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
what i have proposed this that may be that

442
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,800
must have happened but coming back to that if

443
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Even if there is height, so there is a lawyer guy

444
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
Handling my case also. he has filed

445
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,720
Lot of PIL in Mumbai High Court. He Said

446
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,800
there are lots of buildings which should not

447
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
Be there. Airports Authority of India has

448
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Given left right center permission. where is he

449
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,399
Did you give it to me? Land is expensive in Mumbai.

450
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
Hmm hmm. and you know nobody wants to leave

451
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,279
I will build 10 floors on the land,

452
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
I will make five floors. It is not approved there

453
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,880
Because that is an airport area that is empty

454
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
Should be. You will go to any other country

455
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
So it does not happen that the airport is finished.

456
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,480
A building has again been constructed on the perimeter wall. They

457
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,440
It happens here. but then that

458
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,839
The builder thing is such a big society

459
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,839
that no one wants to talk about it

460
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,760
Someone wants to get into it. take the matter

461
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,839
Brother, same thing happened in Ahmedabad too.

462
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
No. I just woke up and asked sister, how come she is so beautiful

463
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,160
How did big buildings come? If not even

464
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,319
There would have been a little forest and trees as well

465
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
Would have been. Brother, even trees would not have absorbed it

466
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,160
There is impact. if there were trees or forests

467
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,000
No, hmm. There would have been damage, but we wouldn't have

468
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
Lost so many lives. we lost everyone

469
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,600
Life Actually. Only one is left. Butt so much loss

470
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,240
There isn't an off life. in case if this jungle

471
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
or if it were an open field, would this land

472
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,679
Would? Yes, land. of crash landing

473
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,120
It's a procedure, brother. The procedure remains

474
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
It's good to practice crash landing

475
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,440
Practice crash landings. No

476
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,760
so you are telling me if here

477
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,080
There are no buildings and if there is empty ground

478
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
If it had happened then all this wouldn't have happened. yes then take it off

479
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,480
giving damage where the ship breaks landing

480
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
If the wing breaks, we will save ourselves by evacuating

481
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,240
Would go.

482
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Good. What else? Brother it feels like that

483
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,799
that once that visual comes and not now

484
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,799
It's going straight like this. at that point

485
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
End. Nothing can be saved. at this point

486
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,559
Like now your death sentence has been written.

487
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,559
but I didn't know if that was because a

488
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
There is a very famous story about Sali who

489
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,559
The plane landed in Hutson. he became a

490
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,320
hero after that and i thought that was the

491
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
The exception is that you can do something like this.

492
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
Water landing was exception. Good Water

493
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,600
Landing is an exception. Ditching Procedure

494
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,760
Yes bro proper. This is the procedure of ditching.

495
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,679
What happens in that? a you have to

496
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,360
Secure the aircraft. first of all that

497
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
What can you secure in the cockpit?

498
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
now i don't remember that much if one

499
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
Add the bar. yes please write. Procedure

500
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,640
Airus 320 Dali QRH And So For Now

501
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,240
Your guess is that he first needs to remove the engine valve

502
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
He had to shut down the other engine

503
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,000
The first engine had already gone off because that

504
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,320
It took a long time to take off after V1

505
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,160
so that led to dual engine failure that's your

506
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,640
guess probably that's my guess i also

507
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,039
think brother as a pilot you know what you will be

508
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,280
Weather that be yes there is also a ditching button

509
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,440
I remember now yes that was the ditching

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,919
If Airbus has made it, yes, then it is a procedure

522
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
no bro yes right right right na outflew

523
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,360
This is the out flow valve which is your

524
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,120
Cabin pressure to pressure ram air pressure

525
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
Whatever is maintained, it maintains it

526
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
It has to maintain proper cabin pressure

527
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,600
is it planted ditching or unplanted ditching

528
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,600
how are you bringing the crew inside joe

529
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
lead crew hoti u brief her that now

530
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,360
We are ditching. so brace for

531
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,120
Impact is the command for ditching. you si

532
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,679
like this and then all that procedure is done

533
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,640
Ditching ok very interesting. Post

534
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
Ditching actions are planned and unplanned ditching

535
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
everything happens. After end ditching

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
Mostly we just evacuate. Yes. So

537
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,320
We brief the crew everything. The Crew Briefs

538
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Passengers then she reshuffles that yaar emergency

539
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,039
I will make the abled body sit at the exit

540
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
Can you help me also? so de de de go through

541
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,400
give all their procedure turn but ditching hota

542
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,600
Is. but from a sim experience if i say

543
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,840
am at 33 and 29 which is generally what people

544
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,120
we are flying at and suddenly i begin to

545
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,799
Experience and I will have to ditch it.

546
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,960
how much time do i have before i am touching

547
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:18,080
Around? so bro for every 1000 feet eye

548
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,240
Can cover two nautical miles. so to him

549
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,320
calculate if I am on 30000 then I

550
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
I can I have a distance of 160 nautical

551
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,480
Miles I can go left right two 2.3 60

552
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,679
Nautical Miles Distance Wise and Time

553
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,919
wise because I have to brief you by briefing you

554
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
Give me all the instructions brother, I will be saved in that

555
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,360
I will take the plane, don't worry, yes there is a pilot

556
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
If you get 3000 feet of time

557
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,080
I have had so much training that I

558
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,240
If I save myself then I will have confidence in myself too

559
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,559
I have confidence in my training

560
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,760
Sorry, I have confidence in my training

561
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,919
and then my scanning starts that

562
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,520
Where will I stay, I will land the ship and it will be like this

563
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,360
Not even when I'm flying normally

564
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,960
I am there and I don't have anyone at 60 miles

565
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,480
We will find an airport, friend, right?

566
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
Surely, somewhere, someone is telling me a little

567
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
You will find a field, right right right brother

568
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,320
When ours is one and not inbuilt

569
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
some things happen i'm going over

570
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm going to Iran or I'm going to Turkey

571
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,039
I'm going somewhere I'm going to Europe

572
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm flying over some country

573
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,480
what do I do in my free time

574
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,679
What do you do in your free time, brother? That map

575
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,039
let's take it out and see ok i can fly here

576
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,799
I am doing it right now, if I fail then I

577
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,400
I can go here, ok put it here

578
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,159
How much time will it take so we keep doing this

579
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
calculation ok ok ok so it's not like that

580
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,640
We are sitting unprepared. right right

581
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,400
Right right right right right. So we

582
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
We are prepared every time. at everybody

583
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,799
check point i calculate my fuel which

584
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,880
Is it matching what happened or not?

585
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,720
Interesting. Ok. So, it means 10 hours like this

586
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,400
What will you do during the flight? What would you do?

587
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
Yes. We also chatted a bit. brother what are you doing

588
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I have done that too in my life, but only a little

589
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,799
Got the work done also. and that work is that

590
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
How I know where I am going. I

591
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,720
What options do you have basically.

592
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Right. Right right right. So like Pakistan

593
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,600
I fly over the. I'm here bro

594
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,679
So I will not take it off. see this after

595
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,159
Where is the next airport coming? Straight

596
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,080
Brother, we will land you in Amritsar only, either Amritsar or

597
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
Hey brother, things happen sometimes in Iran

598
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
Is. Sometimes there's some trouble, right?

599
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,640
Brother, I will not get down here later

600
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,799
I will download it or I will download the page first. Yes

601
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,120
right so you always have that in mind that

602
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,720
Sometimes it comes to your mind that I am not

603
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,520
I would have been sitting idle like this, looking outside

604
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,679
Am. So it's not like I'm looking outside.

605
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,080
so i'm thinking what if i lose an engine

606
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,480
Now. So this is going on in my mind.

607
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,400
When I take off from Assam

608
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
There is a big island in the middle of the Brahmaputra

609
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,320
We do take off in the rain

610
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
I think it might be better if I drop it here

611
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,120
hmm what does your mind keep on doing something or the other

612
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,320
If the mischief continues, then brother, we will

613
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,400
We are prepared to land the ship

614
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,080
You will lose the landing in Ko and Crashing

615
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,799
gear but everything else will kind of

616
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,159
Survive yes means people will survive anything

617
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,720
I will loose but I am so damaged

618
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,360
Property may be damaged but there is damage of life

619
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,799
It won't happen that much because brother is the most

620
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
I'll protect myself first right?

621
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,320
Sure if I survive I will be behind

622
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
Those left behind will be saved. And I have my own

623
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Life is dear to me. right then for yourself

624
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,080
I will definitely save you. Sure sure, right?

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,760
So that's why you tell yourself first

626
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
Save because if you are saved everyone will be saved.

627
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
well so in this case attitude was also

628
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,520
no issue because you are only at 400 meters

629
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,360
If you are at 400 feet then you cannot do anything

630
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,600
Got it. 400 ft Ahmedabad Elevation 200 ft

631
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,039
And 65 is what reports are saying they were

632
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,799
At. So you were at 400 feet. 400 feet or something

633
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,480
It doesn't exist. You don't have the time.

634
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,840
Such a heavy ship. so you are the heaviest at tech

635
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
Off, right? Right.

636
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,919
You burn 55 tons of fumes at landing then

637
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
You then became at least 55 tonnes lighter. here it is

638
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,880
That too is fuel and they are carrying fuel

639
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Yes you are. That's why that firewall became so big

640
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,159
Because that fuel is fuel. 55 60 tonne

641
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,159
So the fuel is on you. hum hum what do you

642
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,600
think about who captain smith is and this

643
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
This is my observation. Ok? I Purely

644
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,600
From somebody sitting on this side. You x

645
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,440
Aviation ex pilot that captain steve probably

646
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,840
Isn't that his name, Captain Steve?

647
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
actually can you also check which pilots are this

648
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,240
His experiences during the flight were

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,080
7 8000 hours 8000 were not pilots but captains

650
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,840
The first officer of the 1100 hours were yes so

651
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,159
That means it is experienced only, yes

652
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,159
right so i think pilot guy is probably more

653
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,159
Likely to be like this issue happened in pilot

654
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,320
Maybe like this one from Captain Steve

655
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
say they used flaps instead of non

656
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,200
or slats please explain something to me

657
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,440
What to Say Exactly

658
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
But I am sure that if you are an engineer

659
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,159
If you talk to him, he will find the engineering fault

660
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,919
If you speak to an airliner, the airline

661
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,080
Like these are whistle blowers. it might also

662
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,240
be a proximity think about what you do

663
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,320
Think for? You Know

664
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
But what did Captain Steve say that

665
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,720
there has been some error in the sense that

666
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,559
They didn't put those wheels up or anything

667
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
yes I think there was a video of him where

668
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,799
But they say that

669
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,799
So flap landing has to be done air up

670
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,960
After take off positive climb gear up. So

671
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,279
In this case, the gear itself takes the flaps up.

672
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,720
so flap is something which generates more

673
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,640
Lift at a slower speed. I am but that

674
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,200
I don't think that would have happened bro because

675
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
and i made a video also about that end

676
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't even know why he said that

677
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,600
Because there were three or four reasons for that. one is the gear

678
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
Nor does it happen further. so if i am the first

679
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Officer I have to reach out. end flap right here

680
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,799
It happens on pay. So it is not the case that both buttons

681
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,919
I will make mistakes here and there. So

682
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,320
number one reason that number two even by mistake

683
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,360
Doge na Jahaz will sing 50 feet and then

684
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,919
Start It Again Slime Won't Go Down

685
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,320
Because we call it Murphy's Law

686
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,279
that something which has a probability to go

687
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,039
wrong will go wrong this happened this happened

688
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,400
We have new ships with us

689
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,400
The first officer comes and makes a mistake

690
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,200
If you do it in sim also then and the

691
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,440
Aircraft Surfaces Are Electronically

692
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,760
simulated but they move with hydraulic

693
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,679
pressure and it takes time that pressure

694
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,320
Gaya, they are moving. it's a big motor

695
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,840
It rotates. So do the flap at zero

696
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
It comes slowly. so this happened to me

697
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
had put flaps zero. I said brother

698
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,720
What are you doing? I pulled it again.

699
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,279
He has come. what is a flap brother? Brother he

700
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,840
The wing which stays like this keeps moving.

701
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,120
Sir that's above the wing, that's the angle of the wing

702
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,120
Let me change it. ok ok ok.

703
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,559
because whatever we land on

704
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,159
Times become straight. same for the track

705
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,320
There is a flap. That's fine. so what is the flap

706
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,640
He says that friend even at low speed it gets more

707
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,640
It generates lift. good you are

708
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Landing at slow speed but you want more

709
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,440
So what is the disadvantage of lift?

710
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,679
The drag is greater. Ok? so then if

711
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,760
What will happen if I straighten the flaps?

712
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,760
That will basically increase the drag. a little bit

713
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,679
Your lift must be loose, friend. But if the engine

714
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,279
He is running at full power and overtaking

715
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,600
will take it. He will pull it off, brother. means going like this

716
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,880
Yes you are. It will happen. Then you will go upstairs. talk

717
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
I didn't understand it, it was a flash, friend. And

718
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
What are slats? So the slats wing

719
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,880
are in the front and flats are at the back. So

720
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Yaar is slat slabs system. one comes

721
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,080
yes this one is coming. Yes. so they increase the

722
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,159
Chamber of the Wing. So the Bernoulli principle is

723
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,760
You must have read it. Didn't he read it? Bernoulli's

724
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
Yes. Bernoulli I know about him. yes so

725
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,600
It is that one, right? So wing it happens like this right yes.

726
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,159
So the stage moves faster from top than from bottom

727
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,799
In physics he can change the shape of the wing

728
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,200
Gives. yes i see and it increases the

729
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,080
Lift. I am amazing. ok at least. Now

730
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,080
Like this was Flight 171 Air India 171, right?

731
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,440
1731

732
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,000
Now when will its investigation take place? that when

733
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,440
is pay like when will we get any kind of

734
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,240
Certainty because we are still in theory

735
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,600
land and the dominant theory is that it's a

736
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Double engine failure right that's a dominator

737
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,279
Now I know from some YouTube videos I

738
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
have seen sometime that there is a black in it

739
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
The Box That Is Always Recovered which probably contains

740
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Audio recording or punching in the machine

741
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,640
all that happened and then there is something else

742
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,320
called an acr ams cvr cvr meaning

743
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,840
something like this there is some equipment which

744
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,919
those who come out of the cockpit

745
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,640
Now investment is done on this basis. Cause

746
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,480
The nail is down.

747
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
What is the timeline and something like that?

748
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,000
when would we know about something like that

749
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,840
would you expect for this to be the case

750
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,840
Things? yaar initial report i think 30

751
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,080
It should come in days. but i was surprised

752
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,080
to know who will give the CVR and DFDR

753
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,799
R to boxes. CVR & DFDR.

754
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,960
CVR is cockpit voice recorder. Ok? So

755
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,559
When I used to fly, there used to be last two

756
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,400
Communication for hours was recorded.

757
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,880
Now it can even last for 25 hours. be advance

758
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Everything is gone. And then there is a DFDR

759
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,840
including whatever happened on your flight

760
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Some such action has taken place which was done by the pilots

761
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,720
I did not take it but I do software internally too

762
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,880
Are. Everything is recorded. His

763
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
Pitch Bank Roll Engine Power How Much Fuel

764
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,799
Gone are the left, right, everything. well it's locked

765
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,799
Complete. He is completely locked. what did the aircraft

766
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,960
At what speed did you take off? What happened? Meaning

767
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,720
There is very extensive data on flights.

768
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,720
We both have to recover.

769
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
That was done. but then surprisingly they said

770
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,559
That it got a little more damaged. So we

771
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,559
Cannot process this. He also worked in the U.S.

772
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,279
sent it to him

773
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,520
So that was a bit shocking that Boeing

774
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,559
There is a ship and you sent it there

775
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,760
So only now will we know the conflict of

776
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,399
Interest type of right but then good thing

777
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,320
Is this also true or is it the case when M Cash is at fault

778
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,760
If it happened then its investigation was also done there

779
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,520
It happened there and then they did the right

780
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,159
investigation i think its mcsh's fault

781
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,600
what happened was lioner went down and ethiopian also

782
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,279
Went down Boeing 737 but it had no address

783
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,279
what is nts also which is de r

784
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,559
independent organization they don't fall

785
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,120
under the government of there here who is your

786
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,120
AAIB

787
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,399
That government is under the civil action government

788
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,159
If she comes then the fight has been going on for a long time

789
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,919
Make him independent, my friend, that government

790
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
is under some administration

791
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,159
if it is under some minister then things

792
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,720
change can happen change can happen so I came

793
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,080
was talking to this captain amit singh his

794
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,919
He is a big expert, 18000 hours and now he is

795
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,720
safety pay he has dedicated his life to

796
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,799
Flight safety says investigation is on

797
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,880
he is also in touch tell the people of AIB

798
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,080
Yes sir, the engine has failed. Both

799
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,799
The engine has failed. Both engines have failed. and when

800
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,320
If there is an impact then at the time of impact

801
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,919
Why do you study? why is there a seal

802
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
do you do it? Because you have to see

803
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,320
What was the situation at the time of impact?

804
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,640
What was the condition of the engine blades? if you

805
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Engine blades Engine was running at the time of

806
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,559
The impact must be moving around. and if you turn around

807
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
If there is an impact then a different type of deflation will occur

808
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,080
It will be. If it is not working it will be idle

809
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,919
So it will fall just like that. then there will be damage below

810
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,360
The top one won't have blades. if yes then it is ok

811
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,919
Gives a lot of information. so over there

812
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,919
Information came that the engine blades were not

813
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,960
impacted mean at the time of crash engine

814
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,520
Was not running. Ok. Both both. both engines

815
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,279
He crashed because of failure. Yes. They

816
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,360
keep on saying yes dual engine failure dual

817
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,360
Engine failure. They will not change the report overnight

818
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,840
It's done. When it gets published they say

819
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,200
Inger running. that pilot some how put it in a

820
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,399
Stall. and he drove deep so

821
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
It crashed. But the deep drive will definitely take place

822
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,279
It is not there anymore. Didn't it hurt? deep drive then

823
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,159
It is not visible at all brother. No. No. I

824
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,840
Talking about Ghatkopar crash, sorry cash wale cash

825
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,640
Yes yes this was a crash in Ghatkopar

826
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,360
There was another one like this in Mumbai long back

827
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,039
crash was discuss in my video so much

828
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,080
Earlier there was a union minister, he was a ship

829
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
I say that the report says that the

830
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,679
pilot

831
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,919
Went into the cloud he lost situational

832
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,919
Awareness itself could not control the aircraft

833
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,480
and it went down again in the same way

834
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,440
When you explain the report you list all

835
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,559
What was the situation that day? So meteorological

836
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
There is also a page of. it is saying in

837
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,399
There is no weather at all. In Hum and Conclusion

838
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
He is saying that he entered the cloud. so weather

839
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,440
If not, then which cloud is it? we we so

840
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,919
Please give me those reports which are made as well, my friend

841
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,320
Not made so that future accidents can be

842
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,960
Avoided in India. what they are made to save

843
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,600
Someone. We are not getting any benefit from this

844
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,039
Of the investigation.

845
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Then friend, it is a very dark situation

846
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,440
Brother. It is dark brother.

847
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,080
does it mean where is the respite? I am thinking

848
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,720
yes that this conversation means some time

849
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,360
has to be some leg to hold on to you know

850
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,880
I think India as a developing country V

851
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,960
don't necessarily want these kinds of things

852
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,880
neither domestically nor for public

853
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,600
Safety nor for international visibility.

854
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,120
meaning it does not board as well in any

855
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,960
It doesn't make sense either internally or internationally. and like

856
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,039
I'm sitting with an ex pilot somebody who

857
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,880
scene aation so closely somebody who is known to

858
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,320
take his voice to the courts and the public

859
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,799
wherever he thinks fit and he is telling

860
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,960
me there is nothing to like there is no

861
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,039
There Are Silver Linings to the Clouds Literally

862
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,799
what what

863
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,039
Brother

864
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,960
So it's a double engine failure in this case

865
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,240
because it's clear we know that double

866
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,600
There is engine failure brother look at me

867
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,440
I have experience of 9-10 years now

868
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,360
I don't understand hot core I may be

869
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,039
Tot Li Rong seems to have become quite strong.

870
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,840
Like right now we are talking about software

871
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,919
Is there a problem or is it the fuel?

872
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,440
There are fuel shut off valves. Yes. Is

873
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,480
No? So when you're in the car,

874
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
They are hitting the accelerator. you are

875
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,159
basically controlling the amount of gas that

876
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Is entering the engine. ok ok ok. End

877
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,760
Petrol gets vaporised. With the Air

878
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,679
You get a mix. there is a fuel air

879
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,240
Mixture that goes inside the engine. Fuel Set

880
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,240
of the wire that controls how much fuel is

881
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
Going inside the engine. You added power. Take

882
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,600
If you turn it off then you will get power only then it will take off

883
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,399
Did. and then they said there was some

884
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,919
Problem which cuts the AC buses in the

885
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,360
Aircraft. so when the ac buses are

886
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,240
qudd that fuel set of valve is

887
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,799
Controlled by the AC buses. So he is absolutely

888
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,519
It was reset from . There were batteries in flight

889
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,760
Are. but it takes one second to switch on to

890
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
The Batteries. so that's why that fuel shut up well

891
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,799
went into close position because their

892
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,200
The default position is close. but i don't buy

893
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,480
That. because I think that dude is Boeing

894
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,880
must have thought this much that if my AC

895
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,519
Well, I failed in the air also. so that

896
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,600
I think the fuel will shut off, it will not shut off

897
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,679
also in such a critical fuzz because critical

898
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,159
The aircraft in the fuzz also knows it is critical

899
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,919
He is very fuzz and he takes care of himself too

900
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,240
he will not do it, meaning even if he has to fail

901
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,600
Neither a safe way to fail is to fail in an open

902
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,360
Position Rather Than to Fail in a Closed

903
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,440
position or right that consumes more fuel

904
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,799
Let it go, that's not a problem, yes my fuel

905
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,200
If it overflows then that is not a problem

906
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,519
Think even if it fails but it is still going on

907
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,039
hay rumours but

908
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
Brother, should I tell you the truth? I don't understand anything.

909
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,200
are you not coming i am also eagerly

910
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,200
Waiting to See What Has Happened Do You Land

911
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,720
send any creedence to joe conspiracy land

912
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,320
is there any meaning around it, look there are two types

913
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,080
This is a conspiracy. Ok? a conspiracy then

914
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,600
This is the whistle blower regarding Boyan from a long time

915
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,159
Blowing is going on. that there are safety

916
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,880
This is particularly with this airliner. The

917
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,519
second is that this has been done to tarnish

918
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,760
India's Image. Correct. and frankly the

919
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,279
the second one i am less likely to believe because

920
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,519
I think India's media sector

921
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,919
Even if people are talking on informal Twitter

922
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,279
Or a formal journalist, a little paranoid

923
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,600
Is. It takes all our time to find someone

924
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,440
He is interested in fingering. and so on

925
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,679
Perhaps no one thinks about India.

926
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,399
There might be some people in some rooms

927
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,320
Do you think about India? but large

928
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,840
neither any public nor any public offices of the

929
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,159
The world is concerned about India

930
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,679
What an image. so this one still seems to me

931
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,320
It looks a bit inflated. One

932
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,159
A Sense of Self is a Continuous

933
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,839
The inferiority complex that India has

934
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,480
Which is now becoming a superiority complex

935
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,079
This is his manifestation. Butt with Boeing

936
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,679
Many question marks are associated. My

937
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079
who thinks there might actually be questions there

938
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,720
They are there but there will be no one to pick them up. yes it is

939
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,720
you can bro because

940
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,800
The US economy depends on Boeing

941
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,399
No. They are not just Boeing. give me

942
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,639
He probably bought Lockett Martin.

943
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,159
If I am not wrong. it's a very big company

944
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,280
End

945
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,679
There are couple of law makers who are initially

946
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,320
ET Boeing. now they are in congress so they

947
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,280
have like has power they have power boing a has

948
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,399
Power So

949
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,399
He had an I think facility somewhere

950
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,320
They have made a new facility in South

951
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,839
Taxis followed there a guy had a camera

952
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,119
He had also taken some videos with him

953
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,480
I had made it, check the whistle taxes, friend

954
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,800
This is one of their facilities

955
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,240
The same was in the North or Mid US and one down there too

956
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,359
They built a new facility there

957
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,599
But someone had entered with a camera on a search

958
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,040
You should do that, he installed a hidden cam

959
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,800
And then he took it and entered inside

960
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
because he also had something like that but there are

961
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
couple of whistle blowers who have called

962
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Yes for Boeing and what are the problems?

963
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,760
I have pointed it out, do you know friend, that this

964
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,280
They are taking approvals from FA in such a hurry

965
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,800
I am taking it and FA is also giving approval

966
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,480
And he's doing a little arm twisting as well

967
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,280
they approve the FA because they

968
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,880
Such a big good FS Federation of Joe

969
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,760
Here is DC, well there is Federal

970
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
Aviation Administration yes ok ok and brother

971
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,079
The world sees the FA like this, if the FA

972
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,440
If our DG approves then if FA

973
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,200
If the DCP approves it, then he will say yes

974
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,520
It is approved, approve sir, approve, approve yes

975
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:53,599
yes DDCA has no technical knowledge that

976
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,920
new regulations by yourself or something

977
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,720
If we can do research then we will do what the FIA ​​says

978
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Sir, we accept your orders after tying the bandage on our wrist

979
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,119
Just think, someone comes to audit the FI.

980
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,040
Brother, DGCA gives us ratings, yes

981
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
Well that's how competent it is

982
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,119
ok ok ok one thing is done IO when

983
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,880
Sometimes brother, some things happen

984
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,640
what you find out makes you feel weird and

985
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,400
Then for so many years and everybody else you

986
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,520
Around you, you think this is the norm

987
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
if it happens then why do you become okay with it

988
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,880
When I reacted to the thing I said

989
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,720
FA is the body of their country, we

990
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,200
why is he giving rating or rating

991
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,560
be it such a thing or an international organization

992
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,640
ho as she is she is also an I K.O. but she is someone

993
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't give rating to everyone like F.A. Choudhary

994
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,560
Goes to countries and gives ratings to everyone

995
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
America has an old belief that yes, it is right to become a Chaudhary.

996
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,320
So he comes and gives us ratings and now

997
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,760
your improvement has been done otherwise five 6

998
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
Till a year ago I used to keep it in level three

999
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,520
They. We are now at level two. Yes. that level

1000
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,040
When I kept it in three, I used to say that friend yes

1001
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,640
We have more flights to your country than this

1002
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I will not send it because of your safety

1003
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,040
It is very weak. He used to limit flights

1004
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,400
And for us also there are limited flights there.

1005
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,480
Slots were available for sending.

1006
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
yes, what is this? Do it up. there have been

1007
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,320
Reports of Boeing whistle blurs racing

1008
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,240
Safety Concerns and Some How to Die and Face

1009
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,520
Legal action. one whistle blower john bard was

1010
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,599
Found Dead and Was Self-Inflicted

1011
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,320
Wound. After Giving Evidence Against Boeing

1012
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,680
Another whistle blower Sam Salepore. Testified

1013
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,320
before a US Senate committee about

1014
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,040
Manufacturing Shortcuts in 77 and 7 87

1015
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,560
The aircraft was a 7 87 or a 787 FS

1016
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,320
Investigating Quality Claims Made By

1017
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,880
some whistle blowers some Boeing whistle blows have

1018
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,880
Come Forward with Serious Allegations

1019
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,040
Who went with the camera in this, did you find it friend

1020
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I saw that, there is no evidence, but that

1021
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,200
This is what we are talking about. Good John Bard

1022
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,440
that John Burnett's might have blown up

1023
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,760
He might have given it in full from the internet

1024
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,880
It was a long time ago but there is still a whistle

1025
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,200
Brother brothers here and in Air India

1026
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,520
also there was another whistle lower i think he will release in 2022

1027
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,000
something in

1028
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,200
He had done that Air India's Triple 7 which

1029
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,079
They are not coming here from the US

1030
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,720
Compliant with the oxygen requirement on

1031
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,760
The board should be of 15 minutes or 12 minutes

1032
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,200
Taking it all, something like this was happening with us. so then you

1033
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
If you come to India from the US, there are three or four routes

1034
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,560
It can be done by you, right? So he was saying that

1035
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,680
You cannot take an extended flight over water

1036
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,040
Can. Because you have less oxygen. We

1037
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,000
With in some two or three aircraft. that's it

1038
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,560
told called the dispatch said you give please

1039
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,920
Fire a new routing for me. so they weren't

1040
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,359
Happy with him ki yaar last minute pe

1041
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,040
The flight got delayed. you did extra work

1042
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,040
I gave it. so when he landed he was called

1043
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,800
something happened to him and i don't know about him

1044
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,599
There was friction with Corey management. Then

1045
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,839
I fired him, what did you do but then

1046
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,920
His case is going on in Bombay High Court

1047
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,320
And some Bombay High Courts also gave some rulings

1048
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,440
thi hum you shoulda pull it up aa jayega

1049
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,200
actually look it up air india whistle bower

1050
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
Triple 7 Oxygen Requirement Add Now

1051
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,599
It was trending on Twitter as well

1052
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,680
Because what happens when such accidents happen

1053
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,119
right bro so for the past 5-6 years those people who

1054
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,280
it happens to me that yes it happens to me now

1055
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,200
It also happened that all those people come forward there

1056
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,359
There are sufficient videos that the AC is not working

1057
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,200
or the entertainment setup is not working

1058
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,240
Customer version of it not with us

1059
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
The problem has occurred. yes yes this

1060
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,079
Exactly this one is a whistle blower pilot race

1061
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,160
Concerns about the emergency oxygen

1062
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,280
Supply on Air India Boeing 7 of 12 minutes

1063
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,440
right yes 12 minutes 12 minutes oxygen supply

1064
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,200
the pilot this amount of was insufficient for

1065
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,000
Sep operation. So if you know this,

1066
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,680
What is? Hey Sir, this one has two engines

1067
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,800
No. Was there a failure in 10 years? take it

1068
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,839
Even today. and as a pilot my job is bhaiya yes

1069
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,280
Hasn't happened for 10 years. It happened today. Right

1070
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,040
Right right right right. you once

1071
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
probability yes you want one failure for

1072
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,400
Everything to go. he is saying that sir 12

1073
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,000
It will not give oxygen for a minute and why

1074
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,359
12 minutes? because at the level you fly

1075
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,880
Are you planning to be late level 410390

1076
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,160
The safe altitude from there is 10,000

1077
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,839
I don't need supplemental for Rs 10,000

1078
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Oxygen. From there I can reach 10,000 in 12 minutes

1079
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,800
I will not be able to come. I will come in 16 minutes. So 4

1080
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,240
what would you do for a minute? First

1081
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,760
Apply yours and then apply your child’s. Brother is the one

1082
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,760
No, nothing will be included in it. Right

1083
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,119
Right right right right. oh right right right

1084
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,880
Right. so and as a passenger you are like this

1085
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,599
It never happened to me. Yes, right. I am

1086
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,599
See never seen but will you take off without it?

1087
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,680
Or, Right Exactly. No, right? Or. Right.

1088
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,599
The DDCA was asked to investigate and

1089
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,599
Determine this is a case going on in the court

1090
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
This is happening brother. And the court also reprimanded him

1091
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,200
I had applied quite a lot.

1092
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,800
So, are you sure that this is the second option for me?

1093
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,800
Give you a lower level by filing the routing

1094
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,000
File it and give it. If you are filing late

1095
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,000
390, 39,000 feet, give me 330. So that's me

1096
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,400
Can descend on to 10, 10,000 in time.

1097
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,400
Hmm. Maybe nothing will happen. Right? Butt Eye

1098
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
Will not take their chances, right? Right? So

1099
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
what's in 330? It will consume more fuel.

1100
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Good. The routing took long. the higher you go

1101
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,520
You should not use laser fuel bro. ok ok ok

1102
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,520
Because the distance became smaller. Yes? No.

1103
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,280
The air is less dense as you go up. Fair.

1104
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,240
For me cruising at a higher level is

1105
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,800
Beneficial. my so jet engines are performing

1106
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,800
To their design to perform at high levels.

1107
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,880
Yes. So you get good performance on top.

1108
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,079
I will use less fuel. There will be less traffic

1109
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,200
I will reach there soon. direct to me

1110
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,520
Routing will be found. Right. so right this plus

1111
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Last minute delay is and because friend

1112
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,960
They have five or six routes in dispatch too.

1113
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,359
We get ready. It is not so that they

1114
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Hit enter and it came out. now they have to say an end

1115
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,720
then really work hard and join points

1116
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,359
And then calculate time and fuel. complete all

1117
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,000
Something new has to be done. we sleep they were not

1118
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,520
Happy that you are using your brain. We

1119
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
This is how it has been going on here for the last 10 years

1120
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,800
It is happening. You are new here. that is an attitude

1121
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,599
I didn't mean I didn't mean

1122
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,640
anybody who worked any job anywhere in

1123
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,760
India in any sector and know

1124
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,760
All the people in India at some point

1125
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,839
in their lives they have had a touch

1126
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,440
Point With

1127
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,160
Some government, everybody understands your pain

1128
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,079
Everyone has had a touch point with them once

1129
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,319
no if anyone knows what the system is like

1130
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,240
there is no need to explain it so

1131
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,000
Let us understand that this is our background

1132
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,880
Cultural attitude to

1133
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,040
work say that and

1134
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,480
means this is the same attitude that you work for three months

1135
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,760
I will not do it. summer holidays are over

1136
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,200
I will celebrate. We are comfort loving people. A on High

1137
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,319
This thing is a must at critical safety junctions

1138
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,160
We as consumers do not expect that

1139
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,599
These flights operate in this manner. as a

1140
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,800
Consumer We Say Good Seat Recline

1141
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,560
It is not happening. Ok issue the bathroom is not working.

1142
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,560
ok issue like that is what we know. we don't

1143
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,040
See that this is the level of the issue. yes bro when

1144
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,680
Earlier some guy had said that the flu in Delhi

1145
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,160
Ahmedabad sector he pointed this out

1146
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,160
then i was like these things

1147
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,800
don't affect safety hmm but then I

1148
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,800
When I thought again I said it or obviously

1149
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,560
They don't affect safety but you are an airline

1150
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,200
why are you running it is a business you

1151
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,520
Want to Earn Money for Your Customers You

1152
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,440
want to package things right that they buy

1153
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,599
Right So If You Don't Have Enough Money and Will to

1154
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,800
make those things right on that safety you

1155
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,920
What money are you investing, still

1156
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
Background became background, no one cared

1157
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,240
It is not visible at all. Right right? when i eat

1158
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,000
I am going to eat, it's good for me

1159
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,359
Garnishing is coming. and in the kitchen

1160
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,640
The insects are roaming around. Do I know? Right

1161
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,400
Right right. Right. The food here is also good

1162
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,240
I am not coming. Yes, right, right. what is below

1163
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,880
Did it happen brother? right right right right right right right

1164
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,599
Right right. Brother, you have this flight

1165
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,640
Malaysian Airlines had 370 about it

1166
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,319
Have you ever done that to pass your time? do you know

1167
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,520
What happened? Hey, some data has come out.

1168
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,800
So do you know what he said? He did tell something

1169
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,400
No. Yes, they did say something from the front

1170
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,839
No, tell me. Maybe someone from the aviation end

1171
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,599
There was not much interest. Give it all quiet.

1172
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,800
I watched a documentary on Netflix.

1173
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,760
Hmm. So, I will look into it thoroughly and tell you,

1174
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,560
I will tell you. He doesn't tell me anything, bastard. They

1175
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,480
I dragged it for one and a half hour. like in ancient alien

1176
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,960
You used to do it earlier. I'll tell you this right now

1177
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,960
How did it become? And coming to the end. Yes. sees

1178
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,119
I am not a Netflix fan. I saw that

1179
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,880
By taking out time. He didn't tell anything

1180
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,040
What happened. I think Action History

1181
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,200
which is the biggest question mark in

1182
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,839
I think it is the same. that what happened? How

1183
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,760
Happened? Where did that flight go? How did you get it?

1184
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,760
Hey it went off the radar. can't be a brother

1185
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,440
It should go off the radar like this.

1186
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,440
Look, they are saying that there is a black spot on the radar

1187
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,800
What can't happen? Oh all over the world

1188
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,400
What's going on? to the US satellite

1189
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,920
I know everything. Yes, that is correct. so that date

1190
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,760
You might not be giving it. yes it is not right

1191
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,960
He can. It is not possible that that flight is

1192
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I will tell you that I have arrived. Do you know what it is?

1193
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,000
MA 370 which was that flight from Malaysia

1194
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,319
It was fly curry. was going to China and Indian

1195
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,240
She disappears completely over the ocean.

1196
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,160
What conspiracy theories are there about him?

1197
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,680
Brother. Brother, pick up all the aliens, villains

1198
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,040
They took away the white people. You don't know this

1199
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,760
All. Documentary. Yes.

1200
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,720
documentaries thousands of aliens were in it

1201
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,720
Or some Chinese stuff could be put in it, or

1202
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,400
Had been. There were US CI agents in it.

1203
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,920
He got it taken down that what a lot

1204
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,319
There is more conspiracy in it and that

1205
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,680
Some of its parts were found. Yes. Australia

1206
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,599
Met near. Yes. Near Australia. And

1207
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Where is she going from? It is said here

1208
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,440
I went there and wandered around like this. Madagascar

1209
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,760
Came here. Why did you go? Do you know how you got there

1210
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
No, nothing. And they say it feels so much

1211
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,640
It was not possible for him to go there. Exactly

1212
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,160
This was also an issue. not that much fuel

1213
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,880
that he is going somewhere around Australia

1214
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,359
Got it. Why does it happen? 2000 check it. I think

1215
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,319
2018-17 is around this time.

1216
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,520
This is from the last 10 years. already do.

1217
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,520
Just write MA 370 to Malaysia. some more

1218
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,040
I don't know, you will find out only one thing.

1219
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,960
I

1220
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,920
This is one of the most famous plane crashes in my opinion.

1221
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,319
This is the one from Andes. It fell in the Andes in the 60's.

1222
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,599
In plaid 60's maybe. I don't know in between

1223
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,040
Why can't I remember now that my

1224
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,960
Why did he get interested in these things then?

1225
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:03,040
yes i saw this 370 has ma 370 all 27

1226
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,280
2014 Flank from Kollampur to Beijing

1227
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,280
and it just went somewhere where koppal where

1228
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,520
beijing and where australian coast and where

1229
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,359
Where had you come from after roaming around in Madagas and

1230
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,599
It is said that it fell into the Indian Ocean

1231
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,680
it doesn't make any sense nobody knows really

1232
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,359
what happened

1233
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,280
Hey, there is some search and rescue for that too

1234
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,280
They did not find it, then search and rescue started

1235
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,520
I remember they had shut it down but they didn't find anything

1236
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,440
Search and rescue is now so big that the Indian Ocean

1237
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,119
What did you say you would look for

1238
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,440
something at the last radar point

1239
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,119
By the way civil radars are different.

1240
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
Military radars are different. when we people

1241
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,560
we fly under civil radars

1242
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,160
But the military is always watching you. donation

1243
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,640
Communicate with you but god is watching you. So

1244
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,400
Someone must be watching him 110%.

1245
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,920
Right? you can not disappear from this

1246
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,040
Planet. Even If You Crash You Don't

1247
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,200
probably disappear from a raider

1248
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,440
Immediately. you can't yes means when that

1249
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,359
It crashed and then you left, so that last dot

1250
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,440
So yours will stay there. I told you

1251
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,440
ADSB is out. ADSB Out and In.

1252
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,680
So it is not always in your control.

1253
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,960
They. it is sending infection out at everyone

1254
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,280
Instantaneous time. He keeps sending it.

1255
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,720
well and military radars are much much more

1256
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:10,960
Superior. Meaning, they leave no black spot

1257
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,240
Not there. How do you like the flights you take?

1258
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,160
People make fun of me. how do they compare to

1259
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,319
Military aircrafts?

1260
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,920
what we fly is basically point a

1261
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,960
Carrying two point B passengers

1262
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,880
Are. militaries perform their own sorties

1263
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,880
And missions and all. You just saw what

1264
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,560
They took out this B2 and sent it to Iran

1265
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,119
What do they look like, friend?

1266
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,960
Plains people, did you see B2?

1267
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,880
This game is at the next level, this is so

1268
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,119
Geopolitics is next level isn't it brother 19

1269
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Or do they have some ships like that and only

1270
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,720
they have it and no one else has it there were 21

1271
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,800
There have been a few crashes, two crashes and one in Goa

1272
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,359
Somewhere else in Guwahati one aircraft

1273
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,839
This one is two billion brother and this bomb too

1274
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,560
This bomb is thrown, it creates a hole first

1275
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,640
Down for a long time and then several feet below the ground

1276
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,960
The Called Bunker Busters bunker explodes in

1277
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,359
There are busters and it is made a complete

1278
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,599
The aircraft is a wing. it's basically a

1279
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,280
Wing. It's a wing. See if there is something in this

1280
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,040
He is not there. I mean if you are normal

1281
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,599
If the aircraft sees, then the rudder in the aircraft

1282
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,000
It is there, isn't it, brother? Tale

1283
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,839
There is no tail. And what kind of science is this

1284
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,440
which only they know because tale

1285
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,280
Without it the aircraft cannot fly.

1286
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,359
What will be the function of the tail? Your control.

1287
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,560
So there are three moments. Pitch up, pitch

1288
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,319
Down, roll as it turns and yours. yo

1289
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,880
is the most important. If yo were not

1290
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,400
Then I don't know how you are doing it

1291
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
how to maintain it, you must be doing something there

1292
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,960
must be some surfaces or many small ones

1293
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,720
This radar must have been installed on all the planes

1294
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,720
I don't even come to check who is B2.

1295
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,640
It is manufactured by Lockid

1296
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,640
Lockid will probably be a B-2 aircraft

1297
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,640
Manufacturer

1298
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,480
North Spirit Manufacturers North

1299
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:48,800
Northrop Hugh Aircraft

1300
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,800
wow i have never even heard northp

1301
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,160
but as a prime contractor with boring

1302
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,160
Hughes and What

1303
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:01,040
[music]

1304
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,960
Interesting but they have technology

1305
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,520
which they do not the world even does not know

1306
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,960
I am convinced that this is a UFO

1307
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,960
Sightings to whatever extent they occur

1308
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,480
10 to 20% of those cases might be like this

1309
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,720
They must have been looking for a flight to take

1310
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,800
This must have happened when the bombing happened in 2001

1311
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,079
When they brought down the twin towers

1312
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,319
then they use F2 raptors to bomb right

1313
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,079
People didn't even know Iraq was rappers back then

1314
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,720
what happens to them, they already had these

1315
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,559
They should have made this ending 20-30 years ago

1316
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,839
no obviously because when I tell you then

1317
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,920
What is the benefit Yes No Military strength

1318
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,400
You must be keeping any guarantee, I don’t believe it

1319
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,760
can because my American military

1320
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,440
I had friends in the college where I studied

1321
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,880
I used to do infusion from military there as well

1322
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,880
I used to get a lot of attention from the faces of those people

1323
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,240
But brother, there was relaxation regarding the war

1324
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,760
It was a different kind of relaxation for them

1325
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,760
You know, you don't know what we

1326
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
It has been suppressed. And the stories I got from them

1327
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,040
I have heard about the weapons they have used

1328
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,280
Just unreal out of this world kind of

1329
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,960
Stuff. They have access. So yes and

1330
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,960
If there is any military power then it will be the most

1331
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,559
First she will think that you should keep such weapon hidden

1332
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,319
The guy might not even know. May be you don't even know. also know

1333
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,000
no, because when the chance comes we will attack

1334
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,319
Of. And America is at the top in this matter.

1335
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,960
Is. Very top, very. So now you will tell me

1336
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,520
Why? you are spending billions on

1337
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,839
Research. Your military budget is only this much

1338
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,559
Then why would you tell me? that and what you sell

1339
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,240
Countries like Pakistan are getting their F16

1340
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,400
So you will break it like this if you are at war

1341
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,240
So that's you then I mean that's from your childhood

1342
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,839
There are toys. toys from the 1960's and 40's

1343
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,160
Your. now you are reusing them

1344
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,920
Friend, sell it somewhere else and buy it. You are selling it.

1345
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,440
The technology remains. a mine plant

1346
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,680
The setup is . Come on brother, who wants to buy, buy

1347
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,359
Take. Right right right right right right. I

1348
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,760
I was recently watching a video on how

1349
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,319
Nuclear weapons were acquired by all

1350
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,240
Countries. Of all the countries. So theirs is that

1351
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,319
what was that project manhattan

1352
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,119
project. Then how did Russia

1353
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,880
They both caught him, how did the Germans catch him?

1354
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,040
Soldiers o German Scientist German

1355
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,040
Scientist, she did all the research

1356
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,040
The Nazis had captured them

1357
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,119
They did this work, then how

1358
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,640
South Africa Israel Israel is confirmed

1359
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,760
What does India not do after India?

1360
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,079
There was a sensation on that and still India has it

1361
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,720
Pakistan has 200 nuclear war heads

1362
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,520
has 150 something and this one has 25 thousand

1363
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,440
which it has declared, the US has just

1364
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,680
And Russia has declared more than this

1365
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Yes, but the US will have many more. Which one

1366
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,680
He was prepared that Russia had more war plans

1367
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,680
There will be AIDS.

1368
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,200
have you ever flown in a weird sector

1369
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,559
Just like these issues had happened recently.

1370
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,480
Cannot fly over Pakistan.

1371
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,920
etsetra etsetra have you had some weird

1372
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,920
No, then if Pakistan gets blocked

1373
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,520
Let us leave from Ahmedabad below. Good

1374
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
If you go out from the Gulf after crossing the entire Gulf

1375
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,960
Your flight time increases. More

1376
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,880
You take the fuel with you. But not that weird

1377
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,480
I have flown in the weather many times. We

1378
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,240
What is happening truly in turbulence?

1379
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,319
Like we only feel tremors

1380
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,720
Are. What do you guys see that we are looking at from the clouds

1381
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,040
They are leaving. When the friend shakes a little bit

1382
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,520
Neither is that ok. butt just like up

1383
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,200
When you go you call him CB Clumlow

1384
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,839
Nimbus clouds are very dangerous

1385
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,000
They look big. there is no friend in it

1386
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,960
We would have entered. well one thing that is said

1387
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,280
Us. Don't get into this, brother. That is not Chul

1388
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,200
Go and see. Please don't show so much. They

1389
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,440
It will destroy your ship. whatever happened indigo

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,319
In the flight to Srinagar. yes yes in which

1391
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,920
It burst from the front. yes so right now the pilots

It was grounded. And now DDC has

1393
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,800
His investigation has been completed.

1394
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,960
He asked for corrective training

1395
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,880
to the pilots and according to the news

1396
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,359
the way he worded it if you

1397
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,040
If you read it you will understand. He too in

1398
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,839
some words are saying such that friend no

1399
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,240
Should have gone. Look, your mistake has crept in

1400
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,880
Is. After that, whatever year you

1401
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,280
You have landed that award

1402
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,040
Needed There is appreciation too. We are brothers, very

1403
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,520
how in difficult situations like theirs

1404
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,920
Half the thing had failed. Unreliable Air

1405
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,400
Speed ​​failed, this failed, that failed brother, how to land

1406
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,240
what did he do i.e. the trump card pilot who

1407
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,240
He landed but why did he go, brother?

1408
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,400
How did you get in? Why did you get in? Meaning you got in

1409
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
well you got in yes and this one like that is in it

1410
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,720
There were storms and torrents, what was in it?

1411
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,119
I also made a video so what happened in that

1412
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,119
You are there, you saw the weather in front of you

1413
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,960
There is a whole mountain range on the right side

1414
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,839
Pakistan is on the left side, we are

1415
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,680
He said if we want deviation then you

1416
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,599
The person you are talking to says friend

1417
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,200
go to the military the military says

1418
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,319
You are a civil aircraft, Pakistan

1419
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,680
Talk to Civil. They have

1420
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,040
There was no frequency. He is back in Delhi

1421
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,240
Passed by. Asked for frequency from Delhi

1422
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,760
His. I called him. Now they also say

1423
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,880
He must have called the military from behind

1424
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,640
Brother, what should I do? He is asking for it. They

1425
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,400
He might have refused. so brother if your

1426
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,240
Even if the weather had come 20 miles, all this would have happened

1427
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,960
You have reached 20 miles. You are at his doorstep

1428
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,280
You are standing there. So he said he will not let me go.

1429
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,559
So, brother, what should I do now? left hand to

1430
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,400
I just entered. So you entered and then you got inside

1431
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,839
Scandal. So

1432
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,400
No turn back till today due to weather

1433
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,400
It did not happen. So he is saying that they should

1434
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,040
have turned back. Delhi was very far away

1435
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,200
I would not have gone away. half an hour more than that

1436
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,440
The entire flight takes at least half an hour.

1437
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,720
should we go back or else people are saying that

1438
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,079
I could have dropped you somewhere there. So maybe let's go

1439
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,920
I assume that there was weather in the whole thing, so no

1440
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,160
came to my mind. but if you are safe

1441
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,079
You are playing right and you have played extra

1442
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,839
Burned the fuel. Passenger Inconveniences

1443
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,760
It also happened. Anything can happen. bro a little bit

1444
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,319
why would you be interested in the company but if this happens

1445
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,880
If a scandal happens then it will become nation wide news

1446
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,760
She goes. we are actually now after this there

1447
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,240
There is a lot of news that there is no such and such flight

1448
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,480
flew. Did such and such flight raise any issue?

1449
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,160
Gave. It was a British Airways flight. I

1450
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,160
Think to Chennai. london chennai tha sector

1451
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,240
Don't know which one it was. any why on that too

1452
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,079
Is again a Boeing, it is of the same make.

1453
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,800
And why is that happening? why do you

1454
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,920
Think? I can't say about the British why

1455
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Did? But what I know is that Air India

1456
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,319
Brother, some of the pilots are upset right now. upset

1457
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,960
Is. Plus they also feel a little bit that

1458
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,359
Friend, we are sitting in an airplane. Yes

1459
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,599
Right. The management is sitting downstairs. Right?

1460
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,400
Engineering is also sitting down. Roasting also

1461
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,880
She is sitting down. and we are in the ship so we

1462
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,480
I am sitting. so if you if you're giving me

1463
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,880
A okay aircraft. i will not take a

1464
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,880
Ok aircraft also now. give me a

1465
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,079
The Perfect Aircraft to Fly. Why should I

1466
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,800
Should I take it? There are three M's in it. one of mine

1467
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,480
friend says that friend so there are two packs

1468
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,400
In the aircraft. Pax Means Air

1469
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,119
There are conditioning packs. and a pack

1470
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,400
I run two CAKes as backup. Cabin Air

1471
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,240
What do you say about pressure controller? Boeing

1472
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,520
I probably say this. so two packs end

1473
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:11,520
Two caiques behind a pack. So that makes four cakes.

1474
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,599
He says Sir one cage is bad. Two CAGs

1475
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,280
It is bad. Take it. ML says take it. One

1476
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,960
You can do sector. are you going to delhi and

1477
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,640
That was an outbound flight. so from there

1478
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,800
The engineer also says sir don't park here

1479
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,839
ship. And you know, a lot goes into irrigation

1480
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,520
Is. Sir don't write this because you will write it

1481
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,520
So I will have to go through the whole procedure. Sir

1482
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,839
don't write. I will give you the okay for this as well

1483
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,839
I am keeping the status. You take him away. you this

1484
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,520
Station the ship in Delhi. Yours in Delhi

1485
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,000
There is a company. She will make it. all the parts are there

1486
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,000
There is something. This is one. The engineering and

1487
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,680
Pilots' all time runs. The pilots say

1488
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,200
yes I will write it. Sir don't write the list

1489
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,800
Please. The flight will be delayed. come to me

1490
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,480
Will go. And look friend, this is one thing out of 100

1491
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,319
So now the companies also have to change a bit

1492
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,640
It will have to be I don't want to live life for even a minute

1493
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,280
Needed Companies are very important that 1 minute

1494
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,880
that there should be no delay and he is the ground staff

1495
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,800
No, he carries too much

1496
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,520
Because I think they would have been killed a lot

1497
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,520
is behind this thing that there is a delay of 3 minutes

1498
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,559
Went. They might have killed him. Us

1499
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,640
So I don't know whether they will kill me or not. But the

1500
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,040
According to them, that is their thing, not their behavior

1501
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,400
Brother, they are always torn. We Sir Delay

1502
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,079
It should not come. delay come over me delay

1503
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,760
will go. So that one minute delay is what the poor guy is waiting for

1504
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,599
They keep trying to do okay so that it doesn't happen

1505
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,280
Had to cut. yes yes what do they say sir

1506
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,800
don't write it in this, post it on etsy

1507
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,079
So you can tell me that the ship arrived on time

1508
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,760
I called ATC and the ATC called

1509
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,280
Clearance was not given, put it on ATC

1510
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,880
Because if you post it on ATC then there will be no inquiry

1511
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,359
nothing will happen okay okay so

1512
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,359
Sometimes friend, we get so much that

1513
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,440
Bhai means why are you working this pressure

1514
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,800
But I mean you don't even need crores of rupees

1515
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,559
The company is not paying the money, brother, that is correct

1516
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,520
This is true, these are not the stakes of life

1517
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,680
It should be yours, yes right, yes whatever it is

1518
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,079
And the guy who is working in this position

1519
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,240
He gets a normal salary brother

1520
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,559
Brother yes, for that brother take so much pressure

1521
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,720
It happens every day, be it one day or two days

1522
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,319
It's an everyday story, brother.

1523
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,400
The story is that there is a fight of two minutes, sir

1524
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,839
don't put it on me, put it on ATC

1525
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,079
The engineer down below says, Sir, don't bother me

1526
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,640
put it in ATC that is a fight

1527
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,000
yes and it happened to me you were 3 minutes late

1528
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,720
You go, you land, you get an email from the company

1529
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,640
why explain this 3 minute delay brother one thing

1530
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,240
Tell me, as a consumer, I feel that

1531
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,240
Flights are more than happy to be like you

1532
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,960
I sit here for two to four to five hours

1533
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,200
I am sitting, flight is not flying, yes, yes and

1534
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,520
Consumers we learn which flights not to take

1535
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,760
Because all this will definitely get delayed.

1536
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,160
Yes, look, it could be like Air India's

1537
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,079
This might happen but friend Indigo that

1538
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,000
She is very strict about time, she is Indigo

1539
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,160
is the only flight you take

1540
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,720
These are the people who beat you up every couple of minutes

1541
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,359
no it happens there or not

1542
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,079
If you want then post it on Etsy or

1543
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,559
But in that case, friend, there is a lot of pressure

1544
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,000
much remains on the whole system that

1545
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,599
have to do have to do have to do have to do

1546
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,280
If you want to do it, then there shouldn't be that much pressure

1547
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,440
no so you are saying now pilots are

1548
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,040
not okay with flying and okay yes yes so

1549
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,400
I was telling you there that friend, he says

1550
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,040
Sir sir, I will give it to you after giving it okay. You

1551
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,920
don't write. don't write. You tell me that this

1552
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,520
Failure came in the air. Ok. So on this

1553
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,599
There will be no responsibility. Yes. That

1554
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,520
That failure occurred after take off. and to everyone

1555
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,960
Do you know where that take off failure occurred? Air

1556
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,240
India also knows it. He also knows this.

1557
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,680
All the airlines know it. Everyone knows.

1558
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,440
Because it is recorded by the system

1559
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,839
In. Right. So that's what I say when DDC

1560
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,480
Only Air India 171 conducts audit

1561
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,000
It does not open. But all these scandals come to light.

1562
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,559
What the hell are you doing in maintenance.

1563
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,839
And I'm saying it might happen

1564
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,200
yes. Yet I say that I

1565
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,440
I don't know whether it will happen or not.

1566
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,040
But the stories that I am getting to hear, brother

1567
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,839
He took off. A brother said

1568
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,480
Friend, I had two cakes blown away. Still it

1569
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,000
It's okay to fly with two cakes. in the air

1570
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,079
Went. A cacique flew into the air. now now one

1571
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,040
I am blowing it on the cake. So he had some

1572
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,400
Had decked off from the station. now it is very

1573
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,119
Hard for the aircraft to maintain

1574
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,799
Aircraft cabin pressure no. those 10 12 feet

1575
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,400
He must have reached there. He got a warning. He

1576
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,720
Said I will not climb at 3000 feet.

1577
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Maybe it is not safe that we could not maintain it

1578
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,200
pressure then i will design emergency

1579
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,079
I am right, he is back at his base

1580
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,160
Why should I not take a chance, this is the thing

1581
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,160
that friend now if again in this

1582
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,640
There will be an investigation and that pilot

1583
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,920
you were penalized for this

1584
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,119
Why did we turn back the Cabin CAG

1585
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,000
There won't be any warning, he would have gone away saying

1586
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,520
Sir I was being safe, we are the only one left

1587
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,280
There was no warning but if it came my friend

1588
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,880
I'm not feeling safe lest I blow one

1589
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,319
Buddy

1590
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,400
We are ML, right ML brother, ML only then

1591
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:24,000
It is valid as long as you are on ground.

1592
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,079
Once you take off ML has no

1593
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,280
Meaning. Then you can make a practical decision

1594
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,200
practical so practical means if

1595
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,119
If you want to fly an aircraft then let's go in the aircraft

1596
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,440
If you get a warning, come back. But one of yours

1597
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,680
There is also experience, isn't it, brother?

1598
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,200
there is one. Should I take off? Long Sector

1599
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,000
Is.

1600
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,880
A brother says there are two radars in the weather Boeing

1601
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,440
There are. We have a weather radar that says

1602
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,760
I was a failure. Nml allows you to dispatch with

1603
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,880
one field aircraft he dispatched

1604
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,799
The wind has turned and whatever is blowing seems to be like this

1605
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,559
By clicking OK the status, the status is found and OK

1606
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,400
And dispatch sends it with the same tape

1607
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,440
which we call the one that turned in the air

1608
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,079
I am sitting on top of Iran so God knows that

1609
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,559
The weather was clear, there was no weather at that time

1610
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,760
was not from my position to Delhi

1611
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:11,040
The weather was clear and the depth was 2 feet (2000 feet).

1612
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,200
There was a ship below so I thought if there was one ahead

1613
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,799
Then after seeing him I will go away

1614
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,720
So brother you can talk to him below

1615
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,480
From. Yes you can do it. you can say that butt

1616
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,079
no because there is a lot of traffic

1617
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,280
Not on frequency. Right? good beans

1618
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,200
The frequency is the same frequency, right?

1619
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,280
Well If You're Long Down to One Two 1.7

1620
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,640
So everybody is on two one7 so everybody is on that

1621
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,400
Let's talk. Then you can talk to ATC.

1622
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,240
yes. Many times it has happened that no one comes.

1623
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,760
When we go to Guwahati etc.

1624
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,280
There is a lot of military activity there.

1625
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,559
Those people are flying at low level sometimes

1626
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,079
There are. So there is no ATC contact.

1627
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,920
He says that friend tell him that here

1628
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,359
Let's go. I tell him no.

1629
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,799
Interesting. ATC is saying go here

1630
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,799
let's go. Because we're on top. we can catch

1631
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,440
He has it. ATC and he both were on low level

1632
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:48,559
Are. If it is interesting then you can talk about it

1633
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,160
In such situations it is normal to talk but we

1634
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,839
And this Airbus is a French company Being is

1635
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,960
American Company American Company and How Do It

1636
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,480
They match up like from a pure Airbus

1637
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,440
What Runs Versus Boeing Perspective

1638
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,119
How does it run in such a narrow body

1639
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,960
The competition was 737 vs Airbus 320

1640
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,040
ok this narrow body narrow body means single

1641
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,280
Seat like this in the island Seat like this white

1642
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,160
There are two oils in the body, I understood it correctly

1643
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,599
Their flagship is 737 and this one has just 320

1644
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,920
Now 320 has been upgraded to Neo, bring less

1645
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,319
15 to 20% fuel savings are there in it

1646
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Orders came from there, there is a little left out in these

1647
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,640
I started feeling something and she told me to do something too

1648
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,000
so if they brought the 737 max then this was a

1649
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,520
Typical Boeing vs Airbus competition

1650
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,680
If you are going to the airport, look at

1651
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,920
If there is any Airbus then it is a little higher

1652
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,079
From the ground, we are Boeing 767

1653
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,559
take if you see side by side then air bus this

1654
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,960
If it is Boeing then it's here, so the wings are down

1655
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,119
We will be there. So the engine ground clearance

1656
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,200
The engines are also lower, under the wings. R Little

1657
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,040
Closer to the Ground We're a Little Bit Closer to the Ground

1658
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,799
Up to the ground. So Airbs has liberty

1659
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,040
To make a slightly bigger engine. We to this

1660
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:58,000
It is called turbo fan engine. Hum Sleep Turbo

1661
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:01,280
They are more fuel efficient in fans. they make

1662
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,920
Less noise and 80% of the air bypasses the

1663
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,559
engine. They are high bypass ratio enj. We

1664
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,040
Only 20% old jets if you look hard

1665
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,559
military jets make big noises there

1666
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,640
Loud hum because they are pure jet engines

1667
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,760
Turbo fan engines are not pure jet engines

1668
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,240
Because 80% of the air bypasses the core

1669
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,760
Interesting so they cushion the sound

1670
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,760
Are. So there was no space on the Boeing because

1671
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,720
That guy is already downstairs. then they did not

1672
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,680
Have space to make a high bypass ratio. So

1673
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,359
This is the wing. This is the wing. Ok? these wing

1674
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,119
Is. You are installing the engine here. So he

1675
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:35,440
Said we will not plant it here. we are the engine

1676
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,680
Will enclose. Ok? Is it okay? and we will

1677
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,200
make a big engine and let's compete

1678
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,400
With Air Bus. and we will also give you

1679
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,559
15 The 20% Fuel Saving Was Named 737 Max

1680
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,319
His. Yes. So friend there is immense power and an engine

1681
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,760
Imus produces power. When you're on Imus

1682
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,680
If you produce power, even a little

1683
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,160
You will have vectors which contain force

1684
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,160
the vector of force coming from here and here

1685
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,240
It is coming from. then it will give you a certain

1686
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,680
Delta. Right? We will change your thrust,

1687
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,200
The torque will change. Many things will change.

1688
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,680
Hmm. So how to do it now? they said it was

1689
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,640
Producing Ah A Slightly Pitched Up

1690
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,079
Attitude. when you put full power it was

1691
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,000
Giving the aircraft a slightly pitch-up

1692
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,200
Attitude. So he said how to correct it

1693
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,319
do? Let's do one thing. we have made a

1694
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:19,280
Software Wherever You Put Full Power in the

1695
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,599
The aircraft will automatically put its snows

1696
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,720
Down. Got it. So that counter balance

1697
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:27,839
will give. now it this function was called am

1698
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,280
Cash. Pull up my cash. What is M Cash?

1699
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,280
It happens? Full form. Yes, it is watching

1700
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,480
The engine that he had photographed was behind

1701
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,400
Look at this Boeing, it's a little down. and Airbus

1702
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,319
The clearance is above. it's still not very

1703
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,760
clear. yes down down down down no. Yes

1704
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,319
First Rear Left Left Left No Yes

1705
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,880
this this look this. Yes. So left is Airbus.

1706
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,640
Yes. Right is Boeing. Airbnb Hire. Right? It

1707
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,599
Has more ground clearance. Right? So They Are Here

1708
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:52,000
Debert to Make Slightly Better Bypass

1709
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,880
Engines. Interesting.

1710
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,839
Interesting. Please back once. Yes. MK

1711
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,839
Search it. Search MK. MCS right? Yes

1712
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,920
Maneuvering Characteristic Argumentation

1713
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,280
The system has gone down so this is it

1714
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,839
He said that we have this in the software

1715
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,799
When I put it on, he said this is not it

1716
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:14,799
Necessary for pilots to know okay this is

1717
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,039
just a thing that the plane will do yes we did

1718
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:19,599
it's a software and we have made

1719
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,559
Embed that in the systems and pilot it

1720
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,640
No input is required, it's an automatic feature

1721
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:27,200
which will counter balance the excess

1722
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,599
Pitchup Got It Pilot also knows about it

1723
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,599
no and he said that the 737 which flies

1724
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,920
Does the 737 Max have to fly?

1725
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:39,599
just to our ground class is enough same

1726
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,440
You fly everything, only the pilots know

1727
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,799
no what is m cash then do it twice

1728
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,440
m cash mail function is done brother

1729
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:49,200
So what does mcsh do with mcsh mail function

1730
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,079
he is putting his nose down and this one and I

1731
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:55,039
gave the nose down command

1732
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,400
And the plane went down, o the pilots knew

1733
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,400
no what is MC does it count this

1734
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,640
Could have countered as well. some such system

1735
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,720
tha which you move but it was you need ims to

1736
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,520
Move. Later it was done in SIM also.

1737
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:08,960
Humanly an average male cannot move that.

1738
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,960
It takes that much force because it's good friend

1739
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,960
All the movements that happen with the aircraft

1740
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,480
that these electronically and hydraulically

1741
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,000
Flash flaps move hydraulically

1742
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,760
Are. In a small aircraft you do the labour yourself

1743
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,359
Do you move? when you're flying with a

1744
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,160
Speed ​​of 200 nautical miles and 250 knots.

1745
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,920
There is an air pressure. I am, right? Right.

1746
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,000
so you can't move a surface when there is

1747
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,160
So much air pressure. not by human force

1748
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,760
You can do it. We do that even in the sim

1749
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,160
I tried it. It was not possible. But

1750
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,319
Interesting thing happened again that this MKS

1751
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,839
How did you pass it? So he said that

1752
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,319
He passed the FSA in a hurry

1753
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,720
Diya because they were losing the race to air bus.

1754
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,319
Okay, okay, ICIC. Yes. so this

1755
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,880
Race also has a direct impact, brother.

1756
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:49,039
Like means safety and the symptoms are

1757
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,079
Then it depends on humans and pilots. Yes. So

1758
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:56,160
There were two crashes. Liner 610 down. We and

1759
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:58,160
An Ethiopian bean also crashed. a there

1760
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,599
there is one more thing i think which is worth

1761
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,280
Talking about. Brother you were telling me what

1762
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:05,200
Pointing out pilot error in a way is very

1763
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,880
Convenient for all parties involved.

1764
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,160
because then Boeing or Air India

1765
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,680
No investigation needs to be run.

1766
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,359
Insurance money can be obtained very easily.

1767
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,119
Say something to that effect. because i think

1768
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,400
People don't understand this. Consumers

1769
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,400
don't understand this aspect of flying

1770
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,920
et all. So like I told you about the Goat incident

1771
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,599
I told you. Hmm. That is you making a pilot error

1772
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,839
You can, but you should go and check their history.

1773
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,960
Study to see if they got enough rest, friend

1774
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:29,760
Was it there or not? Right. what safety

1775
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,520
What were the cultures? How is the training done?

1776
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,119
Is training just about signing a paper?

1777
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,760
Is it happening or is it even happening? the same standard

1778
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:39,200
that hmm. That is also very important, right? so if

1779
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,039
You have 100 aircrafts on order. You

1780
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,799
Don't want them to sit on the ground, right?

1781
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:47,520
You need people to fly them. so are you just

1782
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,200
Many times friend, in my college we have

1783
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,319
When I failed in my B.Tech project

1784
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,839
When I went there the professor told me to do one thing

1785
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:56,640
Anyway, you should wait for two months

1786
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:58,559
I will have to do it in 5 days because

1787
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,839
I also don't want to stop brother, yes it is right, right?

1788
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,720
This happens even if you are on leave

1789
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:05,039
That's what happens, isn't it? So that's that culture.

1790
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,200
In your airline if the trainer fails

1791
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,119
If he gives it then the trainer will have to come again, right?

1792
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,799
He will come in just two hours and says come on friend

1793
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,480
You do it right this time, I'm telling you

1794
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,079
So is that the culture in your airline or

1795
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,359
Proper training standards. so you have to

1796
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:20,000
Take deep to understand to go to the root cause

1797
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:21,440
Of the accident. It would have been much easier from the top

1798
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,200
You should blame me that yes, it is an error,

1799
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,480
Its an error or engineering error. the one who

1800
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,480
I told you about the spy jet from Kolkata

1801
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
Told the incident. We will tell him

1802
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,240
This is an engineering error. The procedure is that

1803
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,000
you should talk on headset then someone

1804
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,079
The button should be pressed. But why doesn't he follow

1805
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,599
Happened? Is the culture like that? She has her own

1806
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,920
You must have seen seniors doing similar things

1807
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,920
happened. That's why he is also doing it. Seniors scored 10

1808
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,480
Nothing happened for a year. do the same

1809
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,680
Used to be. So what is culture? The three right now

1810
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,640
People were fired upon in Air India

1811
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,520
They are not decision makers from rostering

1812
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,359
The decision makers are singing here

1813
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,039
Friend, he is not taking the profit home

1814
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,119
They are from the company, they are getting salary

1815
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,760
right so whatever command is coming from above

1816
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,400
He is following right now he is following the command

1817
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,960
to do that they were sacked who

1818
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,440
I gave the command give us your city comfortably hmm

1819
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,039
I understand brother India is in India

1820
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,079
I don’t know, globally, but I am from India

1821
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,000
I can tell this after seeing many times whose throat was slit

1822
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,920
She goes away, she remains an escape goat, it always happens, brother

1823
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,480
That means now we have to show it to the public

1824
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,280
To say that you are doing something. not to me

1825
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,359
I don't know whether its details are like this or not. But

1826
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,000
People should know that sometimes

1827
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:26,240
The man whose effigies were burnt in public

1828
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That man is actually jealous of her

1829
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,720
It is not as big a crime as any other

1830
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,880
What happens by sitting in the back? So

1831
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,960
yes and that's it the pilots aren't there

1832
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,720
To defend themselves. yes so me too

1833
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,400
I don't know if you call it pilot error

1834
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,960
If yes, then claiming insurance is also a little easy

1835
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,319
remains. Right? Sooner Hughes I think Hughes

1836
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,839
incentive in this comes quickly yes it

1837
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:45,359
A huge incentive, yes, nothing light

1838
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,280
That would be a very good insurance

1839
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,240
it would happen and then the blame has been rested

1840
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,240
on the pilot you do you do you do you don't have

1841
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,440
to do anything to keep everybody safe

1842
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,920
Because friend the other parties are involved

1843
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,680
do they have to continue their business right

1844
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,280
they can't they can't shut down right if

1845
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,880
If any blemish or black spot appears then

1846
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,520
Then their business will be impacted and they

1847
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,400
don't want that right then may be they will say that

1848
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:09,359
It's okay friend, there were only pilots and there are lots

1849
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,680
of ah stakeholders now at this point of

1850
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:14,640
This accident became a very big case because

1851
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:17,120
Buddy. It is not a small case. It did not come

1852
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:19,679
Don't think so. and infact since then joe

1853
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,880
General level of people regarding flights

1854
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,400
Having anxiety I've been tracking on

1855
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,640
Twitter to extend whatever I mean since

1856
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,560
Then the new cycle has changed a lot. But

1857
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,960
two for a large while i was like that bhaiya

1858
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,719
here in this plane they said that we will not

1859
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,400
Fly and That Pilot Is Saying We Will Not

1860
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,560
Fly and this side had to come down. Yes,

1861
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,159
for a long while, probably, organically,

1862
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,080
Problem, because it was coming to me

1863
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,480
On Twitter. I was following that. and one

1864
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,000
General sense of consciousness has increased. I

1865
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,520
Don't know if it will last. it is a very

1866
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,120
Interesting thing. i think its quite a good thing

1867
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,799
that pilots are refusing to fly okay

1868
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,319
Aircraft. Because we as consumers we

1869
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,719
Never. Yes, I think they should do it.

1870
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,839
they should put their food down and say that yaar

1871
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,279
I will write this. Clearly correct, isn't it?

1872
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:59,600
Yes, that's right. Hey it happened to me.

1873
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:04,239
I was taking a walk around once and I

1874
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:06,799
Saw some blood stains on the wing.

1875
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:09,199
o what does it mean bird bird b

1876
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:12,880
strike by strike or whatever lands

1877
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:16,960
it happened only then it happened at what speed tell me

1878
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,719
Sir, I will clean it up, take it away, I said

1879
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,080
brother what yes that is correct friend means if

1880
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,920
How to fix a problem if a bird has entered the engine

1881
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,440
should I go, anything can happen, yes brother I

1882
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,359
Where I'm taking the flaps in the air I didn't come

1883
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,799
So yes, his feather is stuck inside

1884
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,640
The bird is stuck in the trap, it is not clear

1885
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,560
will be able to do it yes right second jyoti sir

1886
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,520
Write in the next sector that there is a delay

1887
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,960
they are getting delayed right now because

1888
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,480
The aircraft was already delayed and now it is very late

1889
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,279
Taking one hour in the next sector

1890
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,520
Write about the haltage ship there. I haven't

1891
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,679
Then I stopped doing all this. I said

1892
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,679
Alright brother, a lot of work has been done brother. yes means

1893
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,080
Do it brother, do it. If I get any email

1894
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:49,600
I will answer it. And I said friend that

1895
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,560
You have a best attitude. means you

1896
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,320
I say that you do your job properly

1897
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,400
Will you do it? then you need to take tension

1898
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,760
It is not there, friend. At least psychologically free

1899
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,840
yes. Hey, you are free in every way friend. What to do

1900
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,120
had been? You have come to do your work only and that is it

1901
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,080
you actually feel you are not doing it properly

1902
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,080
You are helping someone. you help

1903
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,159
I am not doing it. you're ruining their work

1904
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,320
And you are taking tension on yourself as well

1905
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,000
Yes you are. Because brother this has happened many times

1906
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,320
The pilots tried to help

1907
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,560
Management Key and Something When Goes Around

1908
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,640
No, the DG only grabs the pilot by the throat

1909
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,320
Brother. hum hum because what is your license

1910
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,560
Then you can't fly? We are the Management

1911
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,640
Still the suspension will be for 15 days.

1912
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,000
I will come again for a month. You

1913
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,159
you won't be able to fly because you need something

1914
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,679
There is no other work except flying an airplane.

1915
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,920
Right?

1916
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,440
You only know how to do one thing and that is without you

1917
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,719
Can't do it without license. we think so i

1918
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:43,280
that is let's play safe and that's everyone's

1919
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,600
It is fine and there is no problem. Meaning

1920
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,120
I have seen it many times friend, even I myself when

1921
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,520
I would be flying somewhere there would be fog

1922
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,679
Nothing happens to that poor staff

1923
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,520
They are fighting. So I go and meet the staff

1924
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,880
I will take this side. Maam that ship is not there

1925
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,480
came because from there I came to try

1926
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,239
explain to them that I don't know what

1927
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,880
Why not? So many times I defend

1928
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:02,960
I do it too. We are the passengers

1929
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,320
I am pacifying myself at the airport and

1930
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,040
You are becoming a big leader. I said sir

1931
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,360
no but it is like that because he

1932
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,719
He says that other airlines take take-land

1933
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,560
Indigo is not flying or any other airline

1934
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,920
India is not doing it. I said sir that

1935
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,199
Coming from the airport. take off there

1936
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,480
The minima are different. She is coming from Delhi.

1937
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,679
Take off minima is different in Delhi. so

1938
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,920
It is landing here. she couldn't land

1939
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,760
The one from Amritsar. So people didn't know that

1940
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,120
To. Yes, I don't know. Isn't it? we so we

1941
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,480
So let's make sure if the flight is late

1942
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,920
So. Yes. We were just getting angry

1943
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,360
Is. Because friend, other airlines are coming

1944
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,600
Is. Yours is not coming. Sir its Delhi

1945
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:32,320
The ship which must have been there has arrived. the weather is fine there

1946
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,920
Is it done or you can go there even in 100 meters

1947
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,000
You can take off. It was to come from Amritsar.

1948
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,440
1000 meters are required in Amritsar. the weather is bad

1949
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,960
Everywhere. So he can't take off

1950
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,600
From there. Now he can't take off because of boredom.

1951
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,320
Can. So the general public does not know. so yes

1952
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,480
Right right. well

1953
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,199
I mean bro

1954
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,760
here i this is one of those things about real

1955
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:54,320
Life. Where there is no closure. to me

1956
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,640
It seems that some of the things are like this

1957
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,960
And there probably aren't four such things in the whole year.

1958
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,520
There are things that we should talk about openly

1959
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,040
and let them hang in the air

1960
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,640
for them to be late for people to consume

1961
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,880
and for people to understand and to just

1962
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,640
you know sit with it this is one of those things

1963
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,960
frankly there is no right answer that

1964
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:15,360
everything ends in sadness everything ends

1965
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,320
in confusion but if it seems like an accident

1966
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,600
Now if it happens then it will be investigated as well

1967
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:24,159
Accidents don't happen with just one mistake

1968
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,800
that he did something wrong or an engine failed

1969
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:28,560
Done. It has a Swiss cheese with no cheese

1970
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,280
Let us teach you a model. That happens.

1971
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,080
so there are lots of holes you know what tom

1972
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,679
And Jerry eats cheese. ji to all the holes

1973
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:40,000
have to align at one point at one day at that

1974
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,000
Instant for that accident to happen. Lot

1975
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,920
of things go wrong. because that's what I'm saying

1976
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,159
hmm friend aircraft are really beautiful

1977
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,239
Machines. They just don't fail like that. To them

1978
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:53,199
I twisted it a lot and took a lot of advantage

1979
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:55,920
Must have gone. There will also be a human factor. that day

1980
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,520
Some mistake might have happened at the airport also. Long

1981
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,080
There might also have been a history of scheduling.

1982
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,480
Management also has to do with when that happens and not

1983
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,480
Really bad day. [ __ ] everything aligned on the same day

1984
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,640
Done. what happens sometimes is that you

1985
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,800
you are not rested but first officer arrested

1986
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,360
or did you see something. something was given

1987
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,560
Another save but that day everything aligned. We

1988
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,360
Right right.

1989
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,679
Thank you so much for your video. infact

1990
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,679
Even what was your response to Captain Steve

1991
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,320
but I think you conducted yourself very well

1992
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:29,520
Gracefully and as a very good healthy

1993
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,360
Example from the aviation sort of side of

1994
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,719
Things in the public and media side. thank you

1995
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,080
You are so much for doing that. Thank you so much

1996
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,880
For taking out time for this conversation.

1997
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,719
Thank you brother. this has been i have learned

1998
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,679
A lot. it's still very sad but I have

1999
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,040
Learn a lot. Absolutely. I some thing

2000
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,880
It happens that I am not able to understand. I

2001
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:51,760
I still think about it, my friend, I still see that

2002
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,600
The aircraft is going down and I imagine that I

2003
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,120
what could I do if I were there and the

2004
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,679
The answer every time I get it is probably nothing

2005
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,760
Maybe I am the only God in that sim

2006
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,520
It was evaluated and also recreated again

2007
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,600
that

2008
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,080
It was not a mistake that he lost and could not do anything

2009
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,840
I could but if he was real then what would I do

2010
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,480
I would be screaming or what would I be doing

2011
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,040
It just happens when it's your last 10 seconds

2012
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:19,360
In life, whom would I be remembering?

2013
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,920
is he scary bro or

2014
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,080
thank you so much brother i hopefully see you

2015
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:27,360
Soon for a brighter conversation, thank you

2016
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,360
so much thank you thank you brother
