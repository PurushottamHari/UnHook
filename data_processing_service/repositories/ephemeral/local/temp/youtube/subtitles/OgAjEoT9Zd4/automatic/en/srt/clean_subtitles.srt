Friends, it is being said that this is the biggest attack by Israel on any country since the Six Day War in 1967.  And in fact, you will remember that Israel had clearly said that this attack we have launched on Iran is not going to stop.  We will not stop until we completely destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. And because of this, you see, within 24 hours, Israel carried out a second massive attack late last night.  So basically what happened here, you need to understand that there is a very important nuclear facility inside Iran for the nuclear site.  You can see this, there was news also coming that when the first massive attack was carried out yesterday morning by Israel, the attack on Fardo at that time had failed.  So, it was being said somewhere whether this entire attack by Israel on Iran has actually failed.  Because unless you destroy Iran's nuclear fuel enrichment plant, Iran will still have the capability to build a full-fledged nuclear weapon. And that's why news came here late last night that Israel was reportedly striking at the nuclear site after destroying Nataaj. So here it is being said that it is possible that Israel has attacked the Fado nuclear site on a large scale. So let us understand this in a little detail, what exactly is happening?  Why does this for the nuclear site matter so much ?  What type of attack did Israel carry out within 24 hours ?  You will get to know all that.  Look, first of all you can see here that it has been said that in two massive attacks that were carried out within 24 hours, Israel has attacked 200 strategic sites of Iran. I will tell you all the details about what all has Israel destroyed in the 200 strategic sites. But this development marks one of the most significant military conflicts between these two nations. Because for the last several decades there were attacks going on between the two countries in different ways. And especially for Iran, let me tell you that if you look at it since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, you can call it the biggest attack till date inside Iran, on Iranian territory.  This means that at this time a huge storm has arrived in the entire Middle East. Many countries are unable to understand in which direction things will ultimately go from here. Israel is saying that it is not going to stop and on the other hand, Iran is also trying to completely retaliate. Well, keep one thing in mind here, why did Israel attack ?  Israel basically launched what is now Operation Rising Line. Why did you do it?  There were three main reasons for this and all three need to be understood in a little detail. Firstly, you have to understand that Israel here wants that the way in which Iran is pursuing its entire nuclear program should be completely stopped.  The way Iran keeps supporting Hezbollah and Hamas, they should be stopped.  So keeping this in mind, Operation Rising Line was started by Israel, its first and main objective was to crippling Iran's nuclear program.  Completely end the entire nuclear program being run by Iran. Destroy their nuclear sites.  Secondly, their aim here was to eliminate Iran's senior military personnel and the main figures of the IRGC.  And their third main objective was to remove and destroy Iran's air defense and ballistic missile system. So here I will tell you one by one.  First of all, let me tell you about Iran's air defence system, Israel had given this statement yesterday itself that their entire operation to destroy their air defence system in Western Iran has been completed. Basically, what is Iran's main fear?  It is from the western side because from the eastern side there really is n't that much of a danger.  So Iran had deployed its entire air defense system in this entire area.  Because Israel can attack from here at any time. But Israel says here that they completely destroyed the entire air defense system just yesterday. Whatever radars etc. were there, they destroyed them all here.  So this is the first one. Secondly, there are questions about senior military and IRGC figures.  So you can see that here there are air defense batteries, missile silos, radar bases and weapons production labs of Iran.  Revolutionary Guard command centers were destroyed, but it is also being said that the main figures of Iran's military were also eliminated. You all must be knowing this; the news had already come that the Commander in Chief of IRGC, Hussein Salami, has been killed in the air strike.  Apart from this, Iran Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bhageri has been killed.  Amir Ali Haj Hajizadeh has also been killed and many nuclear scientists and technicians have also been killed.  In fact, Israel had carried out such a precise attack.  You can see that there are many buildings in Iran where these scientists and all the important leaders of Iran would be living in apartments and houses. As you can see here, it has been completely destroyed. And it is obvious that in this entire strike, civilians etc. would also have died.  But if you look here, what things did Israel use?  First of all, let me tell you that Israel has more than 200 fighter jets.  Yes, that is why it is being called the biggest attack since 1967. Israel uses over 200 fighter jets including those acquired from the US including the F35 made in Israel and the US. This is basically what has been used.  Apart from this, Israel also used armed drones and missile swaps. Electronic warfare was used to jam Iran's defenses. And at the same time, the covert sabotage units, which are basically Mossad operatives, had already gone inside Iran and after going there, they started carrying out strikes in Iran.  So all these assets have been used. But what becomes important here is that the way Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran probably had not thought of it in recent times because here Donald Trump was saying that he is withdrawing his personnel from the Middle East.  But Iran will be attacked so soon. No one had thought of this.  So here are basically three important sites that you should know about.  Again you can see it in this map. Firstly, you will get to see Tehran, the capital of Iran.  So if you look just below it, there is a main nuclear site called Ifan.  If you look at this, it is a key site for uranium conversion and suspected war head research. So it is being said that destruction has been done here by Israel.  Second, which is a very important site for Iran is Nathansh.  Again if you look here in this map then you will see the result here.  And why is the fraction important?  Because it is Iran's largest uranium enrichment site. But what happened?  Let me tell you. Nataj has had attacks before as well. Because it is not very low to the ground. This is due to the ground conditions and hence the presence of Indian nuclear facilities here has been attacked many times. But the most important of these is the one that you can see, it is just close to Tehran.  This is Fardo. And it becomes important because it is an underground enrichment facility inside a mountain.  That means, in fact, if you see, which is under a mountain, in the second strike which was carried out late last night, it is being told that an attempt has been made to attack the Fado site and this becomes important because your facility has been built about 80 to 90 meters of rock under the mountain. So it is obvious that if there is any facility at such a depth, then you cannot physically destroy it. You need to be very precise and attack massively. And it may be said that Israel might have used GB 57 MOP, a massive ordinance penetrator supplied by the US. Apart from this, Iranian air defence would have been jammed through electronic warfare. Hypersonic drones would have been used for guidance.  So, it is possible that because of several coordinated strikes, Israel might have attacked the Fardo nuclear facilities late last night. And again you can see in this picture, here you will see this for the nuclear facility. Meaning it is very far down the mountain.   There are many bunkers etc. to go underground through which one can go. And this becomes very important.   Let me tell you why.  This fuel enrichment plan has been a matter of concern for the western countries for a long time. Because Iran used to run its nuclear program here.  If you see this, its scale is not very big. Because if you look at the Natans facility, this Natans facility is the biggest and in comparison to that, in Fado your enrichment is hardly 6% only. But it becomes important because high enrichment uranium is converted here.  This means that your enrichment is done so that nuclear weapons can be made here.  Through the enrichment that takes place in the Nizamabad, you can enrich the uranium as much as possible for your civilian purpose to produce electricity etc. But through the enrichment that takes place in the molecules, you can make a nuclear bomb.  In fact, you will remember that in 2015, under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that was made during Obamaâ€™s time, Iran had said that we will convert our Fordo facility into a research center. But Donald Trump comes in 2018 and pulls out of that deal.  Then after that it was revealed that in 2023, the International Atomic Energy Agency informed and discovered that undeclared modifications were made to the facility for the same.  Meaning it has been modified without informing the world. And high enrichment uranium production is done here.  And it is being said that by the end of 2023, the enriched uranium will reach 83.7% purity.  Look, once you cross 90% you get the capability to make nuclear weapons. So you understand that here Israel was saying that if we do not destroy these nuclear facilities then Iran will, in a way, make nuclear weapons and this will become an existential threat for Israel that Israel can be attacked at any time. So here, even though Israel could not touch Fardo in its first strike, which happened yesterday morning, because Fardo is kept in a very secure manner. But the second strike took place yesterday, it may have been late last night, I don't know how much damage has been caused or not, but an attempt has been made. Now considering all these things, it is obvious that Iran is not going to keep quiet.  Iran has also launched its missiles on a massive scale.  In fact you can see that last night I was looking at the place here.  A very loud explosion was heard in Tel Aviv.  Tel Aviv, which you can see in Israel, is an important city.  A very loud explosion was heard there.  After that it became known that Iran confirmed that it had launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel.  And in fact if you see pictures etc. then you will see something like this.   In fact, you can also see that there has been some damage to buildings etc. and in many cities of Iran and Israel, the people there are moving towards shelters. Trying to save yourself.  And in view of this, a speech by Netan Yau came and he addressed his people and said, look more is on the way.  We will not stop here and at the same time see, Netan Yahoo also addressed the people of Iran and said that people of Iran, wake up and raise your voice against the leadership of Iran.  The way the rules are running in Iran right now, they are against you.  So basically we are attacking the leadership of Iran. We are not attacking the people of Iran.  So this is what Netan Yau said here.  Let's see what happens regarding this now.  Here's how the whole war progresses.  There is much more to know here and we will have to wait and watch.  But I hope that I have told you the latest news that has come and before leaving, a very interesting question.  Can you tell?  Which of the following is a Shi'ite group supported by Iran and active in Iraq?  Meaning, which Shi'ite group among these is supported by Iran and is active inside Iraq.
