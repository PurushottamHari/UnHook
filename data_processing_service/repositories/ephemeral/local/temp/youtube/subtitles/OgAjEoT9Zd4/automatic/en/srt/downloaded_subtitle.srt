1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,800
Hello Friends.  Friends, it is being

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
said

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,680
that this is the biggest attack by Israel on any

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,840
country since the Six Day War in 1967.  And in fact,

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,239
you will remember that Israel had clearly said

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
that this attack we have launched

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,120
on Iran is not going to stop.  We will not stop until

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
we completely destroy Iran's nuclear facilities.

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,600
And because of this, you see,

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,160
within 24 hours, Israel carried out a second massive

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
attack late last night.  So basically

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,720
what happened here, you need to understand

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,520
that there is a very important

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
nuclear facility inside Iran for the nuclear

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
site.  You can see this, there was news also

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
coming that when the first massive attack was carried out yesterday

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,159
morning by Israel, the

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
attack on Fardo at that time had

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
failed.  So, it was being said somewhere

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
whether this entire

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,680
attack by Israel on Iran has actually

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,880
failed.  Because unless you destroy Iran's

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,360
nuclear fuel enrichment plant,

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,680
Iran will still have the

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,240
capability to build a full-fledged nuclear weapon.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
And that's why

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,960
news came here late last night that Israel was

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,920
reportedly striking at the

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,920
nuclear site after destroying Nataaj.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,200
So here it is being said that it is

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
possible that Israel has attacked the Fado nuclear site on a large scale.

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
So let us understand this in a little detail,

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
what exactly is happening?  Why does this for the

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
nuclear site matter so much

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,439
?  What type of attack did Israel carry out within 24 hours

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
?  You will

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,080
get to know all that.  Look, first of all

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,720
you can see here that it has been said that in

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,319
two massive attacks that were carried out within 24 hours,

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Israel has attacked 200 strategic sites of Iran.

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
I will tell you all the details about

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,959
what all has Israel destroyed in the 200 strategic sites.

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,599
But this development

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,560
marks one of the most significant

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,200
military conflicts between these two nations.

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,599
Because for the last several decades there were

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,840
attacks going on between the two countries in different ways.

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,120
And especially for Iran, let me

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,640
tell you that if you look at it since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,519
1988, you can call it the biggest attack

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,160
till date inside Iran, on Iranian territory.  This

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,800
means that at this

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
time a huge storm has arrived in the entire Middle East.

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,160
Many countries are unable to understand in

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,239
which direction things will ultimately go from here.

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
Israel is saying that it is

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,800
not going to stop and on the other hand, Iran is

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,720
also trying to completely retaliate.

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
Well, keep one thing in

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,519
mind here, why did Israel attack

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,080
?  Israel basically

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,440
launched what is now Operation Rising Line.

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,440
Why did you do it?  There were three main reasons for this

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
and all three need to be understood in a little detail.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,959
Firstly, you have to understand that

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,440
Israel here wants that the

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,599
way in which Iran is pursuing its entire nuclear

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,319
program should be

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,720
completely stopped.  The way Iran

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,280

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,599
keeps supporting Hezbollah and Hamas, they should be stopped.  So keeping this in mind,

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,000
Operation Rising Line was started

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,720
by Israel,

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
its first and main objective was to crippling

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
Iran's nuclear program.  Completely end the

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,159
entire nuclear program being run by Iran.

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
Destroy their nuclear

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,959
sites.  Secondly, their aim here was to

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,599

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,080

97
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,319
eliminate Iran's senior military personnel and the main figures of the IRGC.  And their third main

98
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
objective was to remove and destroy Iran's air

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,200
defense and ballistic missile system.

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,120
So here

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
I will tell you one by one.  First of all, let

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
me tell you about Iran's air defence system,

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Israel had given this statement yesterday itself

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,639
that their entire

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
operation to destroy their air

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,520
defence system in Western Iran has been completed.

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
Basically, what is Iran's

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,360
main fear?  It is from the western side

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
because from the eastern side there really is

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
n't that much of a danger.  So Iran had deployed its

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,759
entire air defense system in this entire

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,080
area.  Because

113
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
Israel can attack from here at any time.

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,479
But Israel says here that

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
they completely destroyed the entire air defense system just yesterday.

116
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,960
Whatever radars etc. were there,

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
they

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
destroyed them all here.  So this is the first one.

119
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,160
Secondly, there are questions about senior military and

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
IRGC figures.  So you

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
can see that here there are air defense batteries,

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,639
missile silos, radar bases and

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
weapons production labs of Iran.  Revolutionary

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
Guard command centers were destroyed,

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,520
but it is also being said

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
that the main figures of Iran's

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
military were also eliminated.

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
You all must be knowing this; the news had already come

129
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
that the Commander in Chief of IRGC,

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Hussein Salami, has been killed in the air strike.  Apart from this,

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Iran

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,120
Bhageri has been killed.  Amir Ali Haj

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
Hajizadeh has also been killed and many

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
nuclear scientists and technicians have

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
also been killed.  In fact, Israel had

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,240
carried out such a precise attack.  You

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,479
can see that there are many buildings in Iran

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,479
where these scientists and all the

140
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,479
important leaders of Iran would be living in

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,960
apartments and houses.

142
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
As you can see here, it has been

143
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,320
completely destroyed.

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
And it is obvious that in this entire

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
strike, civilians etc. would

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,960
also have died.  But

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
if you look here, what things did Israel

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
use?  First of all, let me

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,320
tell you that Israel has more than 200 fighter

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,360
jets.  Yes, that is why it is being called the

151
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,319
biggest attack since 1967.

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,120
Israel uses over 200 fighter jets including those

153
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,360

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,240
acquired from the US including the F35 made in Israel and the US.

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
This is basically what has been

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,479
used.  Apart from this,

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319

158
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,479
Israel also used armed drones and missile swaps.

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,720
Electronic warfare was used

160
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,360
to jam Iran's defenses.

161
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,919
And at the same time, the covert

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,400
sabotage units, which are basically Mossad

163
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,039
operatives, had already gone inside Iran

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,440
and after going there, they

165
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,680
started carrying out strikes in Iran.  So

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
all these assets have been used.

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
But what becomes important here is that the

168
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,880
way Israel attacked Iran's

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,840
nuclear facilities,

170
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Iran probably had not thought of it

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
in recent times because here Donald Trump was

172
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
saying that he is withdrawing his personnel

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,000
from the Middle East.  But

174
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,400
Iran will be attacked so soon.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
No one had thought of this.  So here are basically

176
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
three important sites that

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,919
you should know about.  Again you can see it in this map.

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
Firstly,

179
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,919
you will get to see Tehran, the capital of Iran.  So

180
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,800
if you look just below it, there is

181
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,039
a main nuclear site called Ifan.  If

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
you look at this, it is a key site for uranium

183
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,160
conversion and suspected war head research.

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
So it is being said that destruction has been done here

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
by Israel.  Second, which is a

186
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,520
very important site for Iran is

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,840
Nathansh.  Again if you look here in this map then

188
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,680
you will see the result here.  And

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,720
why is the fraction important?  Because it is

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,319
Iran's largest uranium enrichment site.

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
But what happened?  Let me tell you.

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,759
Nataj has had attacks before as well.

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Because it is not very low to the ground.

194
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,039
This is due to the ground conditions and hence the presence of

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,599
Indian nuclear facilities here has been attacked many times.

196
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
But the most important of these is the one that

197
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,000
you can see, it is

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,160
just close to Tehran.  This is Fardo.

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,960
And it becomes important because

200
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,160
it is an underground enrichment facility

201
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,400
inside a mountain.  That means, in

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,120
fact, if you see, which is under a mountain, in the

203
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,199
second strike which was carried out late last night, it is being

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,759
told that an

205
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
attempt has been made to attack the Fado site

206
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,720
and this becomes important

207
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,160
because your facility has been built about 80 to 90 meters of rock under the mountain.

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,080

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,319
So it is obvious that

210
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,000
if there is any facility at such a depth, then you

211
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
cannot physically destroy it.

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,959
You need to be very precise and attack massively.

213
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,719
And it may be said

214
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,880
that Israel might have used GB 57 MOP, a

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
massive ordinance penetrator

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,800
supplied by the US.

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,800
Apart from this,

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,959
Iranian air defence would have been jammed through electronic warfare.

219
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,120
Hypersonic drones would have been

220
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,279
used for guidance.  So, it is

221
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,920

222
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,080
possible that because of several coordinated strikes, Israel might have attacked the Fardo nuclear facilities late last night.

223
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,480
And again

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
you can see in this picture, here you will

226
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,880
see this for the nuclear facility.

227
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
Meaning it is very far down the mountain.   There are

228
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
many

229
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,959
bunkers etc. to go underground through which one can go.

230
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,880
And this becomes very important.   Let

231
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,480
me tell you why.  This

232
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,560
fuel enrichment plan has been a matter of

233
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
concern for the western countries for a long time.

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,640
Because Iran used to

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,959
run its nuclear program here.  If you

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,279
see this, its scale is not very big.

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,560
Because if you look at the Natans facility,

238
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,440
this Natans facility is the

239
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,800
biggest and in comparison to that, in Fado

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
your enrichment is hardly 6% only.

241
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,480
But it becomes important because

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,880
high enrichment uranium is

243
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,240
converted here.  This means that your

244
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,279
enrichment is done so that nuclear

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,680
weapons can be made here.  Through the

246
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,560
enrichment that takes place in the Nizamabad, you can enrich the uranium as much as possible for

247
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,720
your civilian purpose to

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,519
produce electricity etc.

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,600

250
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,600
But

251
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,040
through the enrichment that takes place in the molecules, you

252
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,360
can make a nuclear bomb.  In fact,

253
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,440
you will remember that in 2015, under the

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that was made during Obama’s time,

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,720
Iran had said that

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
we will convert our Fordo facility into a research center.

258
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,200
But Donald Trump comes in 2018 and

259
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,240
pulls out of that deal.  Then after that it was

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
revealed that in 2023, the International Atomic

261
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
Energy Agency informed and discovered

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
that

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
undeclared modifications were made to the facility for the same.  Meaning it has been

264
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
modified without informing the world.

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,959
And high enrichment uranium

266
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
production is done here.  And it is being said that by the end of 2023, the

267
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,480
enriched

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,360
uranium will reach 83.7%

269
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,519
purity.  Look, once you cross 90%

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
you get the capability to make nuclear weapons.

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,640
So you understand that

272
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
here Israel was saying that if we do

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,399
not destroy these nuclear facilities

274
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,640
then Iran will, in a way,

275
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,519
make nuclear weapons and this will

276
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,839
become an existential threat

277
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,640
for Israel that Israel can be attacked at any time.

278
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
So here, even though Israel could not touch Fardo in its first

279
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,160
strike, which happened yesterday morning,

280
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,560
because

281
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
Fardo is kept in a very secure manner.

282
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,680
But the second strike took place yesterday, it

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,000
may have been late last night,

284
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,160

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,240
I don't know how much damage has been caused or not, but an attempt has been made.

286
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,079
Now considering all these things, it

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,560
is obvious that Iran is

288
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,560
not going to keep quiet.  Iran has also

289
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,160
launched its missiles on a massive scale.  In fact you

290
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,200
can see that last night I was

291
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,760
looking at the place here.  A very

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,279
loud explosion was heard in Tel Aviv.  Tel Aviv, which

293
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
you can see in Israel, is an important

294
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
city.  A very loud

295
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,000
explosion was heard there.  After that it became known that

296
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Iran confirmed that it had launched a ballistic

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
missile attack on Israel.  And

298
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,920
in fact if you see pictures etc. then you will

299
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,839
see something like this.   In

300
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,640
fact, you can also see that there has been some damage to

301
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,200
buildings etc. and

302
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,720
in many cities of Iran and Israel, the

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
people there are moving towards shelters.

304
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
Trying to save yourself.  And in

305
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,440
view of this, a speech by Netan Yau

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,639
came and he addressed his people

307
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
and said, look more is on the way.  We will

308
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,440
not stop here and at the same time see,

309
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,639
Netan Yahoo also addressed the people of Iran

310
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,680
and said that people of Iran, wake up

311
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
and raise your voice against the leadership of Iran.  The

312
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,360
way the rules are running in Iran right now,

313
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,560
they are against you.  So basically we are

314
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,399
attacking the leadership of Iran.

315
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
We are

316
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,240
not attacking the people of Iran.  So this is what Netan Yau

317
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
said here.  Let's see

318
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
what happens regarding this now.  Here's how the

319
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
whole war progresses.  There is much more to

320
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,639
know here and we will have to wait and watch.  But I

321
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
hope that

322
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
I have told you the latest news that has come and before leaving, a

323
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
very interesting question.  Can you

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
tell?  Which of the following is a

325
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,800
Shi'ite group supported by Iran and

326
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,040
active in Iraq?  Meaning, which Shi'ite group among

327
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,279
these is supported

328
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,200
by Iran and is active inside Iraq.

329
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,040
And the right answer to this, as you all know, can be

330
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
found on my Instagram.

331
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,079
