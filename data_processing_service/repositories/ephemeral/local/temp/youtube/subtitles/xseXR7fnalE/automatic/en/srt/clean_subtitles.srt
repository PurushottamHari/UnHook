I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  Oh ho ho ho Antarctica, brother, are there aliens in Antarctica. Well it's okay friend, it happens sometimes.  Isn't it? Look, aliens are there somewhere.  And some signals have been received now.  We talk and sometimes such lectures take place.  For the rest you can avail this amazing course on YouTube SEO plus thumbnails.  The link is given in the description comment box.  We will eliminate this coupon code from YouTube.  The course is for just ₹400 and the sale will come after a long time.  Look, Antarctica is a very strange thing.  Ok ?  And Antarctica is the entire South Pole.  The Arctic is in the North Pole. is the southern most point.  You can also go on a cruise to Antarctica.  It will cost ₹1 lakh.   I'll have to go to Argentina.  From there you can also go to visit Antarctica. You'll find penguins here. You will find polar bears here.  And the ice here is melting.  It has become the center of global warming.  It is one of the least populated continents.  There are seven continents and it is the least populated continent among them.  The Southern Ocean, which is the fifth ocean, is a new ocean that was discovered recently.  Discover meant to be created.  So you will find the Southern Ocean here also.  However, the Southern Ocean is also called the Antarctic Ocean.  Ok? And it is the fifth largest continent. It is 40% bigger than Europe.  Ok?  It is a very large area.  Crores has an area of ​​approximately 1.4 lakh square kilometers.  And mostly in Antarctica you will find ice there.  You will not get anything.  Ok?  But there have also been wars over Antarctica.  There are seven territorial claims, brother.   It is the coldest driest windiest continent if we talk and there is a whole polar desert.  This will lay down on the poles. You will find fresh water reserves. You will find 70% of the world's fresh water reserves here in the glaciers.  97% of it is impure water.  Even in 3% pure water, you will find 1.5%, half of it, in the glaciers. So this is the thing.  The temperature goes down to -90 degrees Celsius.  The temperature of coastal regions is up to 10° Celsius. Penguin Seals, I told you, go and visit, it will be great fun. This is the thing.  Everyone has their own stations also. India also has its own station built here.  France, Russia, everyone has built their own stations. Actually, Antarctica is governed by 30 countries. Under the Antarctica Treaty of 1959, military activity, mining, nuclear explosions, nuclear waste disposal etc. cannot take place there. Well, if countries had their way, they would do this as well. You can go here only for tourism, fishing and research and nothing else. In summer around 5000 people live here because in winter they cannot survive at -90° Celsius.  Ok?  They stay even in winters.  Meaning it comes up to 1000. But very little, very little.  But there is pollution here.  Ozone depletion is happening.   The climate is changing.  This is the thing. Everything is there.  So this is what we told you about Antarctica.  Butt what just happened ?  Some strange signals have been found in Antarctica.  Look, it is said in the myths, that is, in the stories, that there are huge pyramids below.  And this has also been seen well.  So there are so many strange signals that they have been detected on the edge of the planet.  And these unusual pulses which are there, this ANITA experiment, Antarctica impulsive transient antenna, brother, the signals will be received, the antenna installed above will catch them, there are many balloons over Antarctica, these are basically antennas and they detect the radio waves, okay, the cosmic rays, the rays from outside, all the radiation that is coming from outside, is hitting the earth, our magnetic field is protecting it from that, whatever harmful addition is there, our magnetic field is protecting it from that. Ok?  So this is the thing.  So what has happened now is that the boons that have been deployed here have received some signals.  They are analyzing signals that have reached Earth. Now this time the signals mean that they are not coming from above.  Not coming from space.  Generally when cosmic waves come then signals will be received from this.  But these are coming from below.  This is strange.  Right? Now scientists have not yet been able to explain what this could be?   Are there new types of particles or some other aliens?  Well, there might not be aliens. I just wrote it in the thumbnail. But look brother, it is possible.  You saw that picture, Alien vs Predator, right? So in that, they go down to search for the pyramid and from there, the predators emerge, they can be anything, Godzilla, I mean, it has been shown in a lot of such movies that the aliens come out by tearing the earth and who knows, there are strange kinds of animals inside the earth, so there could be new types of particles.  Ok?  Which perhaps we have not seen till now, previously unknown a paper was published in General Physics and it explained that these signals pass and this rock, that is, when it comes towards the antenna, then it passes through the stones that are in the middle. Ok?  So by the time the detector detects them, they would have already passed through many stones. So it is possible that till now we have not been able to detect it because the rock has absorbed it because the signals are also particles.  In a way there is energy. So the rock might have absorbed it and that's why we haven't been able to detect it yet. But these radio waves that we have detected are at steep angles.  30° below the surface of the ice.  There are balloons of this type.  Is it okay?  This is an interesting problem because there is no explanation for it yet.  Isn't it? But we know these are not neutrinos. Look neutrinos, I don't know, there's a rain of neutrinos.  Billions of neutrinos come and to detect them you will have to build labs right below the Earth.  There was an attempt to make it in India also but then there were a lot of protests in Tamil Nadu South Side. Ok?  So absolutely, because it is a completely massless particle.  How to detect that ?  It is very difficult.  So you have to detect them inside.  If you do not detect it in the atmosphere then it is not a neutrino. This person, Stephanie Wiesel, Associate Professor of Physics, has said it clearly. So something is different.  So now it is being said that once these particles are traced, it is possible that they may be able to tell more about cosmic events. Isn't it?   The high powered telescopes give us hints because the star that has died is millions of years old.  What you are seeing now is an event from the past and we discover cosmic events in this way only – through light, through energy, through energy signature.  Right?  So the researchers have said that these can be traced to the origin where they came from. Isn't it?  And in what way, just like the ball is thrown at an angle, it will go back at the same angle as I said.  You throw the ball and then as soon as you throw it back, it comes back to you at a particular angle. So in this way we can trace this signal.  The remaining detectors did not register anything.  Anita has detected this.  This is the thing.  So the signal that is there is an annum.  Meaning, the particles which are causing the signals, they are not neutrinos, and now we are getting into deeper research as to where have they come from, what information is there inside them, so from Antarctica, I mean, they are coming from inside, so something or the other is there, this was a lecture, it was a small lecture, stay happy, keep reading this Siddhant Agnihotri signing off
