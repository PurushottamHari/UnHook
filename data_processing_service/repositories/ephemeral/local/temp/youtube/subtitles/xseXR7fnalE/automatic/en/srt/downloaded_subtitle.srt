I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,359
Welcome to Study Gloss.  Oh ho ho

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,559
ho Antarctica,

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,559
brother, are there aliens in Antarctica.

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,960
Well it's

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,080
okay friend, it happens sometimes.  Isn't it?

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,240
Look, aliens are there somewhere.  And

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,760
some signals have been received now.  We talk

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,480
and sometimes such lectures take place.  For the

sale will come after a long time.  Look,

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:43,360
Antarctica is a very strange thing.  Ok

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:46,640
?  And Antarctica is the entire South Pole.  The

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,399
Arctic is in the North Pole.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,079
is the southern most point.  You

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,200
can also go on a cruise to Antarctica.  It will cost ₹1 lakh.   I'll

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
have to go to Argentina.  From there you

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,920
can also go to visit Antarctica.

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
You'll find penguins here.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,280
You will find polar bears here.  And the

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
ice here is melting.  It has

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
become the center of global warming.  It

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,960
is one of the least populated continents.  There are seven

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
continents and it is the least populated

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,080
continent among them.  The Southern Ocean, which is the fifth

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
ocean, is a new

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
ocean that was discovered recently.  Discover

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
meant to be created.  So you will find the Southern Ocean

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
here also.  However, the Southern Ocean is

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,439
also called the Antarctic Ocean.  Ok?

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,799
And it is the fifth largest continent.

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,680
It is 40% bigger than Europe.  Ok?  It is a very large

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
area.  Crores has an area of ​​approximately

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
1.4

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
lakh square kilometers.  And

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
mostly in Antarctica you will find ice there.  You will

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,200
not get anything.  Ok?  But there have

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
also been wars over Antarctica.  There

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,159
are seven territorial claims, brother.   It is the

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,280
coldest driest windiest continent

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,920
if we talk and there is a whole polar

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,640
desert.  This will lay down on the poles.

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,439
You will find fresh water reserves.

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,159
You will find 70% of the world's fresh water reserves

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,880
here in the glaciers.  97% of it is

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,080
impure water.  Even in 3% pure water,

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,840
you will find 1.5%, half of it, in the glaciers.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,040
So this is the thing.  The temperature goes down

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
to -90 degrees Celsius.  The

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,000
temperature of coastal regions is up to 10° Celsius.

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,200
Penguin Seals, I told you,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
go and visit, it will be great fun.

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,680
This is the thing.  Everyone has their own stations also.

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
India also has its own station

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
built here.  France, Russia, everyone has

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
built their own stations.

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,280
Actually, Antarctica is governed by 30 countries.

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,840

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
Under the Antarctica Treaty of 1959, military activity,

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,599
mining, nuclear explosions,

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
nuclear waste disposal etc. cannot take place there.

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,480
Well, if countries had their way, they would do this as well.

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,599

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,640
You can go here only for tourism, fishing and research and nothing else.

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,080
In summer around 5000 people

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,840
live here because in winter they cannot survive

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,920
at -90° Celsius.  Ok?  They

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,360
stay even in winters.  Meaning it comes up to 1000.

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,040
But very little, very little.  But there

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
is pollution here.  Ozone depletion is happening.   The

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,400
climate is changing.  This is the thing.

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,800
Everything is there.  So this is what we

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
told you about Antarctica.  Butt what just happened

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
?  Some strange signals have been

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,680
found in Antarctica.  Look,

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
it is said in the myths, that is, in the stories, that there are

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,959
huge pyramids below.  And

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,720
this has also been seen well.  So there are so many

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
strange signals that they have been

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,319
detected on the edge of the planet.  And these

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,239
unusual pulses which are there, this ANITA

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
experiment, Antarctica impulsive

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,680
transient antenna, brother, the signals will be received, the

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,519
antenna installed above will catch them, there are

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
many balloons over Antarctica, these

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,959
are basically antennas and they detect the radio waves,

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,480
okay, the cosmic rays, the

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,120
rays from outside, all the

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
radiation that is coming from outside, is

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
hitting the earth, our magnetic field is protecting it from that,

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,760
whatever harmful addition is there,

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,319
our magnetic field is protecting it from that.

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Ok?  So this is the thing.  So what has happened now is that the

100
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,720
boons that have been deployed here have

101
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,280
received some signals.  They are

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,799
analyzing signals that have reached Earth.

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,040
 

104
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,680
Now this time the signals mean that they are

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,520
not coming from above.  Not coming from space.  Generally when

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
cosmic waves come then signals will be

107
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,720
received from this.  But these are coming from below.  This

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,800
is strange.  Right?

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Now scientists have not yet been

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,759
able to explain what this could be?   Are there

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,000
new types of particles or some other

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,720
aliens?  Well, there might not be aliens.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,040
I just wrote it in the thumbnail.

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,600
But look brother, it is possible.  You

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,680
saw that picture, Alien vs Predator, right?

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
So in that, they go down to search for the pyramid

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,479
and from there, the predators emerge, they

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
can be anything, Godzilla, I mean, it has been

119
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,919
shown in a lot of such movies that the

120
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
aliens come out by tearing the earth

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,720
and who knows, there are strange

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,639
kinds of animals inside the earth, so there could be new types of

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,280
particles.  Ok?  Which

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:18,160
perhaps we have not seen till now, previously unknown

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,440
a paper was published in General Physics

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,199
and it explained that these signals

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,479
pass and this rock, that is, when it comes

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,600
towards the antenna, then it passes through the stones that are in the middle.

129
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,560

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Ok?  So by the time the detector detects them,

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,919
they would have already passed through many stones.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759
So it is possible that

133
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,440
till now we have not been able to detect it

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,440
because the rock has absorbed it

135
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
because the signals are also

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
particles.  In a way there is energy.

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,240
So the rock might have absorbed it and

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
that's why we haven't been able to detect it yet.

139
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,759
But these radio waves that we have detected are at

140
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,080
steep angles.  30° below the

141
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
surface of the ice.  There are balloons of this type.  Is it

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
okay?  This is an

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,880
interesting problem because there is

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
no explanation for it yet.  Isn't it?

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,560
But we know these are not neutrinos.

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
Look neutrinos, I don't know, there's a

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,880
rain of neutrinos.  Billions of neutrinos

148
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,080
come and to detect them

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,160
you will have to build labs right below the Earth.  There was an

150
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
attempt to make it in India also

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
but then there were a lot of

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,800
protests in Tamil Nadu South Side.

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,479
Ok?  So absolutely, because it

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
is a completely massless particle.  How to detect that

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,919
?  It is very difficult.  So

156
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,000
you have to detect them inside.  If you do

157
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,080
not detect it in the atmosphere then it is not a neutrino.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
This person, Stephanie Wiesel, Associate

159
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,120
Professor of Physics, has said it clearly.

160
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,560
So something is different.  So now it is being

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
said that once these particles are

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
traced, it is possible that

163
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,919
they may be able to tell more about cosmic events.

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,720
Isn't it?   The

165
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,800
high powered telescopes give us hints

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,720
because the star that has died is

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
millions of years old.  What you are seeing now is an

168
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,479
event from the past and

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,759
we discover cosmic events in this way only – through light, through

170
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,560
energy, through energy signature.  Right?  So the

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,520
researchers have said that these can be

172
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,120
traced to the origin where they came from.

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Isn't it?  And in what way, just like the ball is

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
thrown at an angle, it will

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
go back at the same angle as I said.  You throw the ball and

176
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
then as soon as you throw it back, it comes

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
back to you at a particular angle.

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,680
So in this way we

179
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,400
can trace this signal.  The remaining detectors did

180
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,120
not register anything.  Anita has

181
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,080
detected this.  This is the thing.  So

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,960
the signal that is there is an annum.  Meaning, the

183
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,479
particles which are causing the

184
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,960
signals, they are not neutrinos,

185
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,639
and now we are getting into deeper research as to

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,360
where have they come from, what

187
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039
information is there inside them, so

188
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
from Antarctica, I mean, they are coming from inside, so something or the other is there,

189
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,199
this was a lecture, it was a small

190
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,720
lecture, stay happy, keep reading this

191
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,720
