And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, a big news is coming from Iran.  It is being told that Israel has carried out a major attack on the nuclear site.  See, whatever nuclear program Iran is running, the most important site in it is the nuclear site that you will get to see and it is completely fortified.   It has been built in a very secure manner and it is being said that due to the strike on it, an earthquake has been triggered.  You can see the news Explosions Rock Iran's Nuclear Side, Israeli Strikes Trigger Earthquake.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail as to what exactly happened here?  Has any kind of contamination taken place which is radioactive contamination and also why this site is so important, I will tell you all this in detail.  Look, first of all let us see what happened here ?  It is being told that fighting is going on between Israel and Iran. Several loud explosions were heard near the nuclear site which were also noticeable in the ground tremors. Meaning things like earthquakes have also been noticed. Now if you look at the map of Iran here, you will see its capital Tehran and here you will see three important nuclear sites one after the other.  There is one Fado, below that there is intoxication and below that there is Afsahan. So what is here is that this first site is for the nuclear site.  This becomes most important for Iran. Because most of the uranium enrichment that is happening will be seen here only and due to this it was built in a very secure manner, about which I will tell you later.  But the first question is why did Israel strike here on Fardo?  Most important is that Israel feels that Iran's nuclear program is an existential threat to it.  And the uranium enrichment that Iran is doing here, it is very close to weapons grade. Meaning that more than 60% has already been done.   Once 90% is achieved, Iran will have the capability to make nuclear bomb here. Because of which US, Iran, Israel, everything is on alarm.  Apart from this, if you see the other facility here, it becomes concerning because you will find it at a very deep underground location. I will show you everything on the map more about it later.  How it is built beneath the mountain.  But it was completely fortified so that it could not be attacked.  And its role is that high quality enriched uranium is produced there and at the same time, this site is very close to Qam City and it has been deliberately placed near a city so that it has to be thought about many times before striking it because if there is radioactive contamination or any kind of leakage, many people can lose their lives. So this becomes very risky diplomatically again.  Well, the question is, what was the nature of the attack carried out by Israel on this particular site?  It is being told that deep penetration bunker buster bomb has been used here and due to this massive underground explosion took place.  Meaning, after the bomb was dropped on the side, it exploded underground.  Meaning, it would have penetrated up to some level and an explosion would have occurred there and after that, the Iranian Seismological Center also recorded an earthquake of 2.5 magnitude. Seismologists here believe that this terror was not caused by tectonic shifts. What is a normal earthquake? When there is movement in our layers of the Earth, then you get to see it because of that. But this is manmade, it is being told here. If we talk about this earthquake, 2.5 magnitude earthquake occurred due to shallow underground explosion.  The seismic signals received are matched with those of controlled military detonations.  Meaning, it has happened many times in the world that when detonations are done at the military level, then such earthquakes are witnessed at that time. For example, when North Korea conducted a nuclear test, an earthquake of magnitude four to six was noticed. Similarly, this 2.5 magnitude earthquake that was noticed in Iran, basically one to two tons of TNT must have been blasted somewhere and due to that, this particular earthquake occurred.  As far as the question of damage is concerned, look, according to the satellite images that have come out, it is being said that the core enrichment chambers, that is, look, this entire site has been built right below the mountain, that is, 80-90 meters below, so the core enrichment site there is still safe because Israel probably does not have the capability to penetrate and blast up there and that is why it was built intentionally so that it could be kept in a safe manner. So, for now, it is being said that you will see damage in the above ground facilities , supply facilities. Meaning that the collapse that has happened is not visible to you that much at the underground level. Apart from this, there is another news that till now no radioactive leakage of any kind has been seen.  Well, the overall question is what message does Israel want to give through this?  Israel wants to tell that we have the technical capability that we can target such nuclear sites even underground. Apart from this, their main aim is to slow down Iran's weapons program or destroy it completely.  It is also a kind of symbol that Israel is able to attack even fortified nuclear plants like Fado. Well now the question here is, what is this Fado?  And why is it underground?  Look here I told you there is a city, which city.  Infact, about 100 km from Tehran.  You will get to see it from a distance.  There is a whole mountain range there.  It was built under it between 2004 and 2009. If you look carefully at the map, this entire place has been completely fortified here.  And beneath these mountain ranges, as you can see in many of the places, there is this support building of 5500 square meters.  Apart from this, centrifuges are buried deep in the mountain built beneath it.  Security partitions with guard towers have been installed here.   There are check points.  Apart from this, this point which you are seeing is the entrance of the tunnel so that one can go down.  So in fact, multi-layer fencing has been installed here for its security.   There are multiple gates.  The Russian S300 air defence system has also been installed here. So that any type of missile attack can be stopped.  And as I told you, you will get to see three deep levels.  That means its core structure is visible to you from 90 meters deep in the entire ground level.  So in a way, it is very safe.  Now the question is why is this such a big challenge?   The challenge is because I tell you, right now if you look, Iran is mostly doing its uranium enrichment right here.  More than 60% of the enrichment of Uranium 235 has happened here.  Meaning it has come very close to 90%. But the problem is that Israel does not yet have the heavy hardware that can penetrate and destroy it.  For example, if you look at this time, in this map I have told you that Natanj has become Ishan, Ishan has become. What happened there is that Israel has destroyed all the infrastructure above the ground. But you cannot do the same thing with Fado because all its main things are built under yours. But what doesn’t Israel have here ?  What Israel basically has is the GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator.  What I mean to say is that your first attack missile should be able to penetrate at the very low level and if there is a bomb there, then that thing as well as the stealth bomber capability, you will not find it with Israel. This is basically what the US has.  The US is the only nation that has both the Bomb and the B-2 Stealth Bomber. But for now, America has refused to intervene. So in a way you should understand that Israel has intent.  Israel wants it to be abolished.  But the US has the means, which the US probably doesn't want right now.  So the question now is what options are left with Israel ?  Because if Israel wants to destroy Iran's entire nuclear program, then Fardo will have to be removed.  Fardo will have to attack here.  Only then will he be able to achieve something substantial.  Otherwise, Iran can easily restart its entire nuclear program. Because other sites have been attacked before as well. But nuclear sites like Fado had not yet been attacked. Well here it is being said that maybe Israel will try to attack here again and again and ultimately the whole tunnel will collapse then in that case maybe there can be a lot of damage here but again it is very risky. Meaning, if a bunker buster happens then it is not known what its outcome will be.  Then the second one here is that the ground raid should be carried out by special forces.  If Israel sends troops there through its Mossad and other intelligence agencies and gets the ground rate done then it is possible that sabotage can be done there but again this also becomes extremely risky.  I mean, it is very unpresidential that you are sending your army into that country.  Apart from this, the ultimate question is whether the US will share its technology and the weapons it has with Israel so that it can attack the US.  Look what has happened now, you might have seen that in the morning itself the news came that Donald Trump had gone for G7.  He left G7 midway and came back and warned Taihan to evacuate immediately. Meaning, development is happening rapidly.   It is being said that here you will see the entire escalation of the war increasing rapidly. Now what is Iran's reaction amidst all this?  Look, initially you must have seen that Iran had retaliated on a very large scale. Missiles and drones were launched on a large scale against Israel.  Due to which Israel's infrastructure and civilian areas have also suffered huge damage.  The energy plant in Haifa has also suffered extensive damage, and as per reports received so far, more than 200 Iranians and 20 Israelis have died due to this. Well now the question arises that what is its strategic and geopolitical ramification?  Look, if Fordo was still operational, Iran could easily produce weapons-grade uranium within a matter of weeks. And if there is a large scale attack by Israel here, then it is possible that hostility may increase in the whole region and ultimately there may be a lot of spy things that can happen in the oil prices here. Israel's Prime Minister Netan Yau is saying that we will continue to attack until we achieve our goal. So ultimately time will tell what happens regarding this?  But this was a very important news regarding For the.  So I thought I should tell you in detail about it and before leaving, what can I ask you an interesting question?
