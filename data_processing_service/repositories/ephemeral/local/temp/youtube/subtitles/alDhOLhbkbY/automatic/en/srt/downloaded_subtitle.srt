00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,279
[Music]

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,080
So, in the wake of probably the biggest

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,719
update to iPad OS in its entire history,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,920
I've also been testing this amazing

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,040
Android tablet. And it's kind of

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,760
reminded me that now more than ever,

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,279
these things kind of have a problem. And

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
I just wanted to get all of my thoughts

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
into one video. Now, the reason I bring

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,840
up the iPad is because it actually has a

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
version of the same problem, which is we

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,359
have smartphones and we have computers.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,160
And so very few people actually need a

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
device in between a phone and a

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
computer. And this could be addressed if

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,520
maybe there was something special that

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
you could do on a tablet that you can't

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,559
do on a phone and can't do on a

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,079
computer. But that is really niche. So

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,600
take the Apple version of this, right?

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
Obviously the iPhone is extremely

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
popular. Most developers make their apps

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
for the phone because it's easy. One

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
version of the app, millions of

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,039
customers. And so there are very few

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
actually good dedicated iPad apps like

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,239
built from the ground up for the iPad.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
Now of course it's not zero. There are

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,720
some really cool ones. I love Pixelmator

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
for iPad for example. Procreate is

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
amazing. And there are a few others that

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,159
are really dialed iPad apps but that is

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,880
a minority. Many many iPad apps are are

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,920
just gently scaled up iPhone apps and

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880
they're fine at this point. and many

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,880
others are literally just iPhone apps

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
with no changes made at all with just

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
the little 2x button to the side to make

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,799
them bigger. It's actually been a

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
running joke on this channel how long

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
there has been no iPad app for

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,479
Instagram, which like think about that.

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,560
It's 2025 and this is the absolute best

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,079
this trillion dollar company with tens

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
of thousands of employees is willing to

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
do. It's actually making headlines now

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
that Met has actually made a WhatsApp

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,840
app for iPad that they might also make

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
an Instagram app for iPad. Either way,

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
the point is even on the most popular

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,000
tablet in the world, most of the apps

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,600
that work on it are just fine and a tiny

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
fraction of them are really, really

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
good. So that's why so many reviews of

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,119
the highest end pro iPads for years have

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
kind of all been along the same lines,

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,160
which is like this hardware is amazing.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,879
The chip is incredibly powerful. Again,

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,480
the screen is so nice, but I can't

60
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,920
actually do anything special over a base

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,120
iPad or even an iPhone because iPad OS

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
is still iPad OS and the app situation

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
is still exactly what it was before. You

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
can go back and watch even my own iPad

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,160
Pro reviews. That's what I was saying. I

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
was not the only one. And now this new

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,959
iPad OS 26 does feel like a game

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
changer, but we'll get to that in a

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
separate video. Subscribe to see that.

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,560
But the point is, the value that you can

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,200
get out of an iPad has always felt

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,080
limited. It felt capped.

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,640
But you clicked on an Android video. So,

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
this here is the newest and latest and

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
greatest best Android tablet that I have

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,400
used. It's ridiculously good. This is

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
the OnePlus Pad 3. And every possible

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
thing you could want out of a high-end

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
Android tablet, this thing's got it.

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
crazy powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
paired with 12 or 16 gigs of RAM and up

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,879
to half a terabyte of storage. It's

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,280
super fast, ultra responsive, and it has

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,280
a 13.2 in 144 hertz display. These

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,959
bezels are, you know, pretty thin and

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
even all the way around. Hides the

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,760
selfie camera. It's a 7x5 aspect ratio,

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,440
so it's a little taller than a 16x9

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,159
widecreen. And it's a super sharp 315

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,599
pixels per inch. It's almost 3.4K tall.

91
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,319
The whole thing is also just under 6 mm

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,720
thin. So, it's visually just as

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,280
impressive as any other piece of thin,

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,120
powerful tech. And yet, somehow inside

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,080
this, they've packed a 12,140

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
mAh battery. And this battery is so

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
awesome. This thing just lasts and lasts

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
forever. Just for context, the last two

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
OnePlus pads both had around a 9500

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,040
millah battery, and they had pretty good

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,640
battery life. The large 13-inch M4 iPad

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,799
Pro has about a 10,000 mAh battery. This

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,280
is 12,000. So, it just lasts and lasts

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,200
for hours and hours of use. Plus, has

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
been optimized for some particularly

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
impressive standby time, which is

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,599
actually important for tablets cuz you

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
know how they sometimes go a while

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,359
without being used and then you go to

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,320
pick it up again and it's dead, which is

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,240
annoying. So their stat is if you charge

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,120
it to 100% and then turn it off, then

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,720
two years later turn it back on, it will

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
still have power, which is ridiculous

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
and maybe also a little bit of proof of

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,520
the Android tablet problem. But my stat

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,280
is I put this in my backpack with 85%

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,919
after using it for a bit and then the

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,840
next day, 24 hours later, took it out of

120
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,520
my backpack to use it again, 84%.

121
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,800
So, that's without any sort of battery

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
saver features or anything like that.

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,320
And the cherry on top is it fast charges

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,120
at 80 watts. And it still somehow has

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
room for some of the best speakers I've

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
heard in any tablet, including iPad

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,919
Pros. It's actually eight speakers in

128
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,680
total. Quad woofers and quad tweeters.

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,919
They get really loud with very little

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,520
distortion. Kind of seems to bend

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,880
physics a little bit that so much sound

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
can come out of this thing. And this

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,479
whole thing, the price, $6.99,

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,120
which is sick. And that includes the 80

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,000
watt charger in the box. So, great

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,240
screen, great chip, great battery, great

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
speakers. Uh, it's got cameras, one on

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,639
the back, one on the front. Who cares?

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,639
But this whole tablet is a great deal.

140
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
And yet,

141
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,039
who's going to buy one? Because the

142
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,759
exact same problem I talked about

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,759
earlier is still true. Like, most people

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
have a phone and then for bigger tasks,

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,600
a computer. So, the tablet has to do

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,919
something that both a phone and a

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
computer can't do. Now, I realize we are

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
in the the bubble here of of tech

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
YouTube videos. So, there will be people

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
in the comments of this video who are

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,560
like, "Oh, this is finally this is the

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,440
exact tablet I was waiting for. I can

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,720
finally play this specific game on a

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
bigger screen at 60 fps." Totally,

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
that's valid. But if you think about the

156
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
typical person who's maybe using a

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,960
tablet for, you know, some web browsing,

158
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,520
some light YouTube watching or Netflix

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,440
or whatever, and and some work stuff, a

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
couple Zoom calls here and there,

161
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,240
clearly this can do all that, but it's

162
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
also definitely overkill. So, this is an

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,960
amazing, super powerful kind of

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
beautiful razor thin tablet that slots

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
into a bag and can go anywhere with you

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
and lasts forever and has great

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,440
speakers. It's the whole package and yet

168
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,840
it kind of doesn't stand a chance to

169
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,479
sell a whole lot and become mainstream.

170
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
And that is the Android tablet problem

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,240
in a nutshell. It's basically that no

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
matter how great an Android tablet is,

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
it will be incredibly niche. I think

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,960
it's actually kind of amazing how narrow

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
I've seen the use case become for these

176
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,880
tablets for the past couple years. Like

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,639
I feel like 90% of the iPads I've seen

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,319
since 2020 have been either at a point

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
of sale system in a store where they

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
like flip it around and ask you how much

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
you want to tip or in the hands of a

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
child who is just about to cry and now

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
it's playing Coco Melon full blast. So

184
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,199
in the Android world, you know, I don't

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
know if there's a solution to this

186
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,360
problem. Obviously, this has been the

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,120
double-edged sword of Android for a

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,599
while. There's all the upside of all the

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
huge variety of choices you have of

190
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,599
hardware, of aspect ratios, of

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
foldables, flippables, trifolds. It's

192
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,280
all sweet, but that also means that no

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
single one of them is easy to recommend

194
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
to large groups of people, and that the

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,039
experience across all of them is not

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,039
going to be as consistent.

197
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
Okay, so I think now that the casuals

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
have probably tuned out at this point in

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,080
the video and the true tech nerds are

200
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
still here. Uh, for those of you

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,319
considering actually buying this OnePlus

202
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,599
Pad 3, I got a few more things that you

203
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
might want to know. So, this display,

204
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,319
like I said, is huge and it's sharp and

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,120
it's 144 hertz, which is awesome, but

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,120
it's not AMOLED like those Galaxy Tabs.

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,520
Those Samsung tablets, which are more

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
expensive, definitely do have nicer

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,479
looking screens. So, if you're in it for

210
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
the media, you're going to want to go

211
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,919
AMOLED. But this is still a nice fast

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,680
LCD. And then also Oxygen OS here. Just

213
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
like on the phones, there's a lot of

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
great features. They've just added their

215
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
AI stuff here, but there's also a lot of

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,039
copying iOS left and right still. I

217
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,360
think it's hilarious that they continue

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,520
doing the dynamic island bit even though

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
there's no camera cutout on the tablet.

220
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,080
But hey, they've also gone the extra

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,800
mile with all the accessories. There is

222
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,120
a stylus. There is a keyboard dock.

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,719
There is a magnetic folio case. You can

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
look at it as copying, but it's also

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,240
kind of just feels like offering as many

226
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,640
equivalents as possible. So, it makes

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
the pain of switching from an iPad and a

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
stylus and a keyboard dock as minimal as

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
possible. The battery life is awesome,

230
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
but if you use this tablet like I do,

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,600
which is high brightness most of the

232
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,440
time and a lot of high energy stuff, or

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,440
if you game a lot, you can still run

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
through it in a day. Seven or eight

235
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
hours of screen on time is what you

236
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,959
should expect. But its superpower really

237
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
is the standby time. But anyway, I just

238
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
want to I just want to leave this video

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
by closing out with a question for you

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,640
guys. If you have a tablet, I just want

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
to know what you use it for. What do you

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
use your tablet for? And if you don't

243
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
have one, what would you use a tablet

244
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,880
for if you got one? I kind of suspect a

245
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,440
lot of the answers below are going to be

246
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,519
like singleuse things, things that the

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,080
tablets we like to check out are very

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,080
overpowered for. But yeah, it's cool. We

249
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,640
can acknowledge that these are super

250
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,800
awesome pieces of tech, but that also

251
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,000
most people probably won't need to be

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,519
buying them. Thanks for watching. Catch

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,519
you guys in the next one. Peace.
