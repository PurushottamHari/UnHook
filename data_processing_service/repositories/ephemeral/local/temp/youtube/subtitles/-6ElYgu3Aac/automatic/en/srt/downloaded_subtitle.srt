00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,080
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,639
Prashant Dhawan. Now, Israel's Defense Force has

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,519
recently published this very important

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,839
map regarding the threat from Iran.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
Here, Israel's Defense Force is saying

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,720
that Iran is not just a threat to Israel.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,199

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
According to these people, Iran is a global threat.  Look at the main attack that Israel has

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,840
just carried out on Iran.  You all know the main reason behind this.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,480
Israel wants

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,559
Iran to never be able to make nuclear weapons.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
That is why Israel is killing their nuclear testing sites and

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,520
their top nuclear scientists.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,760
And the attack that Israel carried out this morning

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,399
on Iran has

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,559
had a huge impact, their top generals have been killed.  The

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
Chief of Armed Forces was killed.

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
It is absolutely incredible that Israel

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,520
can do all this.  The

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,920
Israeli Air Force used 200 fighter

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
jets in this attack on the very first day.  Can you imagine

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,039
200 fighter jets coming out from Israel

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,520
and continuously attacking all over Iran.

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,600
And I learned one more thing today that

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
Pakistanis don't know the spelling of lion.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I was looking at the comment section,

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,280
two-three Pakistanis were writing that this is

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,799
not Operation Lion.  This is an operation loan.  That

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,080
's right, friend.  Meaning,

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
we in India are not taking real revenge from the British.

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,560
Pakistanis are taking revenge of the English.

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,119
Well here is Operation Rising Lion,

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Israel announced on its first day itself

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,240
that this operation will last for several days

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,880
and at the same time

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,439
Israel is telling the neighboring countries that

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,159
if Iran gets nuclear weapons and given the

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,280
range of their missiles, then tomorrow Iran

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,159
can attack you as well.  I am seeing that

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
Israel is

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
showing a master class in information warfare to the world that

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,920
this is how to build its narrative in

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,200
front of the world.  Now see, as soon as Israel

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
attacked directly, it started posting such animations before the world

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
so that the

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,759
world could immediately understand

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
what Israel had done.  In this way, these 200 fighter

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
jets go

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
to this nuclear site of Iran and after bombing here,

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,599
Israel has bombed the underground refugee centres here.  The

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,840
visuals after the attack are amazing.  Such a huge

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
blast has happened here and it does not seem

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
that these centre refuges have survived.  This

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
attack seems that this is pretty much

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
fatal and Iran's nuclear program has gone way

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
back, after this it is

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,879
incredible, this level of planning, this is

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,040
information warfare, this is where India is left

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,120
behind somewhere,

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,200
we give Pakistan room to build a narrative,

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,239
they say anything, international media

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,720
publishes it, and as soon as this attack was carried out, the Israeli

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,280
government distributed this pamphlet across the world,

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,760
to the point, here they are telling

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
why they carried out this attack, to eliminate Iran's

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
nuclear threat,

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,360
which is an existential threat to Israel,

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,760
all the things that according to them Iran is the world

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
's primary state sponsor of terrorism.

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
We have been saying all these things about Pakistan for a

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
long time.  They say in the UN

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
that Pakistan is the

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,440
centre of terrorism, but

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,319
unfortunately we have to say that

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,560
we are not able to convey this thing properly globally.

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
And I was seeing that there are many journalists from India.

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,599
He himself is openly saying that this is how

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,599
communication is done.  I have seen many journalists who are

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
in India.  Literally

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
looking at the Indian Government they said

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
that this is the method of communication

84
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
when a military operation is carried out.   It is being

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
told clearly

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,799
what their intention is?  Where did they attack

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,280
?  Now after that, see, there are many countries including India

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,599
who have given such response.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,799
This is the official response from By The Way India.

90
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,959

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
We said this after the start of Operation Lion, following the Israeli attack.  We said

92
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,920
deeply concern, it is a matter of great worry.  We are

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,519
monitoring the situation as to what is

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,000
happening and what is not happening.  The

95
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,480
attack on nuclear sides is

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,200
very worrying.  Obviously.  India further has

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,439
written that India has very

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,560
close and friendly relations

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,360
with both the countries.  We are friends of Israel, we are

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,920
friends of Iran and

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,560
we are ready to give whatever possible support both of them need.  Now that

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,599
is absolutely correct.  I have said this earlier also that

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,199

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,759
in an ideal world for India, the best thing would be that

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
all the tension between Israel and Iran

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
ends so that we can build four ports.

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Through Iran we could reach Europe and Russia.  The

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
North South Corridor which will

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
pass through Iran is very important for India.

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
And now Israel is

111
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,960
continuously attacking Iran.  Obviously, we also have a concern

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,240
that Israel has given no warning that

113
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,880
it will attack Iran from air, land

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,840
and water.  The first attack that

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,040
Israel has carried out on Iran was an aerial attack.

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
They have 200 fighter jets.  Again I am trying to imagine

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
what the

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
scene would be like in the sky when 200 fighter jets are

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
attacking together.  So when 200 fighter jets

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
attacked Iran, it became an aerial

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,639
attack.  Right now the Israeli Navy is most

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,040
likely going to

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,080
attack Iran along with the US Navy.  Now

124
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,479
where will this attack take place?  Will it happen at Chabahar?

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
Will the monkey be on Abbas?  Where will it be?

126
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
We don't know.  Then there is still a land attack to take

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
place.  I don't know

128
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,919
what these people will do regarding the land attack?  Will para troopers be

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,160
landed here?  When will some people in Iran

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,360
go to this area of ​​Iran?  We don't know.  But

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,680
Israel has openly said that Iran will be attacked from air, land and water.

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,160
And the land

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
attack, I believe it is possible that the

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
Mossad agents are

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
carrying out blasts at ground level today within

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,759
Iran and

137
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,080
Israel has created chaos here, maybe it was a land attack,

138
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
apart from that you can see that Israel and Iran are

139
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,479
so far away that the armies will

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
not collide with each other and you can imagine that it will be

141
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,720
very frustrating for Israel to

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
see India's statement because

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,000
India is a big player today, whatever India

144
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,639
says on the world stage, it matters and

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,320
India says here that yes, we have

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
good relations with both the countries.  This is something

147
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,160
similar to the statement that came from the US

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
after Operation Sindoor that we have

149
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
good relations with both the countries.  We

150
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,319
just want de-escalation to happen here.

151
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,479
Israel: Only after this we have seen that Israel

152
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,440
published this map where

153
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,919
Iran's target was shown to India as well, saying do

154
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,560
not assume that the thinking and ideology of Iran will

155
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,600

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,000
save the neighboring countries.  Once this country gets

157
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
nuclear weapons, then

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,039
all the neighboring countries will be in danger and after that

159
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
Israel released a video and again

160
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
I want to show you this video here.

161
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,440
Then I will tell you

162
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,280
what India could have done.  Here you

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,240
can see that the title of this video is given by these people,

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
do you think that

165
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
once the Iranian regime destroys Israel, will

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,840
they stop?  Will they

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,199
stop at Israel?  So let us tell you

168
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,199
what their actual plans are.

169
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,089
[MUSIC]

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,880
Now this clip that you are seeing here is of

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
Hassan Salami.  it's dead.  He

172
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,080
was the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
Israel has killed him today.  And this

174
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
is its 2019 speech.  This is saying that our war is

175
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,599
not a domestic war.  There is a war against the world powers.

176
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,639
We are planning to break the United States,

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
Israel and their partners.  Now now and

179
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,960
their partners.  This is a very vague term.

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,199
India is also a partner of USA.  We do

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,880
not use the word LI.  But we are a

182
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,880
strategic partner of Israel and USA.

183
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,280
Now here are his old speeches.

184
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,160
Ok?  He has put all this here

185
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,400
and basically told the world that

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Iran is a threat not just to Israel but to the whole world.

187
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,960
India could also have done this.

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,759
You know, USA flags are burnt every day in Pakistan.

189
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,160
We

190
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,400
could have literally shown during the time of Operation Sindoor

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
that this is the mentality in Pakistan.  This

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,639
is this type of fundamentalism.  They will

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
burn the Indian flags.  We will burn the flags of Pakistan.   The

194
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
type of speeches these terrorists

195
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,960
give.  Ok?  Burn the old speeches of Imran Khan

196
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,800
where he was blaming the US.

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
I mean this is all part of

198
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
information warfare.  And Israel is here

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,000
showing how to present a

200
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,000
perspective to the world.  Again, I neither

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
agree nor disagree with Israel.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,919
I am a very neutral observer.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I am just observing this from the

204
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,240
perspective of an Indian.  And as an Indian,

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
I have also observed that Israel

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,880
as a country has been able to make so much progress

207
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,600
because fundamentally the

208
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,519
politicians here are good.  There is

209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
a lot of debate internally.  Yes,

210
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,440
you did not do well in transportation.  There has been corruption.  Yes,

211
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,560
this is not right here, that is not right.

212
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,680
But when it comes to foreign policy and

213
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,240
unity of the country, everyone comes together in front of an enemy.

214
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,240
This is a very famous video.  It is

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
becoming quite viral these days.  This

216
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,640
man is Naftali Benat.  You will remember it

217
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,000
for some time.  He became the PM of Israel a few

218
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,080
years ago and this Benjamin Nitin is a

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160
staunch opponent of Yahoo.  The parliament

220
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,959
of Israel is

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,040
called the Knesset.  There, Naftali Beneath

222
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,480
criticizes Nitin Yahoo in a way no one would do.

223
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,720
But when Operation Rising Lion was launched,

224
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:40,080
you must listen to his words.  Everyone is standing behind this

225
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,760
strike, all are left and right, I am

226
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,760
 

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
 

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:53,120
behind this decision, it's something preaching,

229
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,800
to hit the head of the opposition, to take it out

230
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,440
aggressively, now listen here, be it

231
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,680
any party, left or right, I believe that

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
we will run a better government than this, we are

233
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,680
better people, but I stand behind my government.  There

234
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,560
is full support to our

235
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,279
government.  For Now As A Country We All

236
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,760
Stand United.  I would say that this is the

237
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,279
identity of a very successful country.

238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,680
Where politicians know

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,079
what their job is.  It is not that you can

240
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,000
just gain power by doing anything.

241
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,360
Somewhere you are part of the country.  You are a

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,680
citizen of a country.  There is a huge

243
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,320
responsibility and in such times,

244
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,240

245
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
both the opposition and the ruling party have a big role in keeping the country united.

246
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,160
And look, Operation Lawn is just beginning.

247
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,079
Iran has declared that the strikes by Israel

248
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,120
are a declaration

249
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,839
of war.  The war has started.  This is an

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,839
official declaration of war.  And Trump has

251
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
also said that many more brutal

252
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,240
attacks are yet to happen on Iran.  Many

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
developments will come.  I will keep on making

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,640
updated videos for you all.  Sometime you

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,959
go to any website where

256
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,440
companies post jobs and you will

257
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,240
notice there that the demand for data analysts is

258
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,399
constantly increasing.  Whether you are

259
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata or

260
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,440
anywhere.  Salaries obviously range based

261
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,920
on your experience.  But you can

262
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,760
easily earn even Rs 50,600 per month from 2025.

263
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,760
Depending on your experience,

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,200
depending on your skills.  And the

265
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,720
impact of data analysts is being seen in every industry.  It will

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200

267
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,440
obviously be seen in the corporate world.  Apart from that,

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,360
articles are being published in medical science and even cricket.

269
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
This is a four day old

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,920
article about how data

271
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
analytics has transformed cricket all together.  Let

272
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,800
me tell you the reason.  Let

273
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,200
me show you for the first time

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,320

275
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,880
how someone can present data if they have the skills of a data analyst.

276
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,760
Once you have the

277
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,800
skills of a data analyst, you can create all of these things.

278
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,000
You will be able to see in what beautiful way

279
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,160
you can see the profit of a company and

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,640
how much revenue a company earned in which month.

281
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,120
What is the market share?  This can be made in detail.

282
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,480
Again it's not just like you

283
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,040
just choose this color scheme and

284
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,680
enter the data.  In this, the formulas, the

285
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,839
way you enter the data, the way

286
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,560
you present the data, everything matters.

287
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,360
And companies today are

288
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,839
ready to pay people who present the data to them in

289
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,240
such a way and in such a form

290
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,399
so that the companies can decide

291
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,959
what to do in the future.

292
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,839
Where do they want to go in the future?

293
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
With the help of Data Analysis course of Career 247,

294
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
many of our students have already become capable of creating such projects.

295
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,079

296
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
I am showing you this project of one of our students

297
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,000
and this again is

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
just 5 to 6% of the total scale.  Apart from that, there are many other

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
tools in Data Analytics

300
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,480
in which if you become proficient, then suddenly

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,040
your value will increase a lot in the job market.

302
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,040
What do you simply have to do?

303
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,200
