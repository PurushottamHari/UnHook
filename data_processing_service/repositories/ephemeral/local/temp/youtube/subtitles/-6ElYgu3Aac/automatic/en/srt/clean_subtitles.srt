Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, Israel's Defense Force has recently published this very important map regarding the threat from Iran. Here, Israel's Defense Force is saying that Iran is not just a threat to Israel. According to these people, Iran is a global threat.  Look at the main attack that Israel has just carried out on Iran.  You all know the main reason behind this. Israel wants Iran to never be able to make nuclear weapons. That is why Israel is killing their nuclear testing sites and their top nuclear scientists. And the attack that Israel carried out this morning on Iran has had a huge impact, their top generals have been killed.  The Chief of Armed Forces was killed. It is absolutely incredible that Israel can do all this.  The Israeli Air Force used 200 fighter jets in this attack on the very first day.  Can you imagine 200 fighter jets coming out from Israel and continuously attacking all over Iran. And I learned one more thing today that Pakistanis don't know the spelling of lion. I was looking at the comment section, two-three Pakistanis were writing that this is not Operation Lion.  This is an operation loan.  That 's right, friend.  Meaning, we in India are not taking real revenge from the British. Pakistanis are taking revenge of the English. Well here is Operation Rising Lion, Israel announced on its first day itself that this operation will last for several days and at the same time Israel is telling the neighboring countries that if Iran gets nuclear weapons and given the range of their missiles, then tomorrow Iran can attack you as well.  I am seeing that Israel is showing a master class in information warfare to the world that this is how to build its narrative in front of the world.  Now see, as soon as Israel attacked directly, it started posting such animations before the world so that the world could immediately understand what Israel had done.  In this way, these 200 fighter jets go to this nuclear site of Iran and after bombing here, Israel has bombed the underground refugee centres here.  The visuals after the attack are amazing.  Such a huge blast has happened here and it does not seem that these centre refuges have survived.  This attack seems that this is pretty much fatal and Iran's nuclear program has gone way back, after this it is incredible, this level of planning, this is information warfare, this is where India is left behind somewhere, we give Pakistan room to build a narrative, they say anything, international media publishes it, and as soon as this attack was carried out, the Israeli government distributed this pamphlet across the world, to the point, here they are telling why they carried out this attack, to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat, which is an existential threat to Israel, all the things that according to them Iran is the world 's primary state sponsor of terrorism. We have been saying all these things about Pakistan for a long time.  They say in the UN that Pakistan is the centre of terrorism, but unfortunately we have to say that we are not able to convey this thing properly globally. And I was seeing that there are many journalists from India. He himself is openly saying that this is how communication is done.  I have seen many journalists who are in India.  Literally looking at the Indian Government they said that this is the method of communication when a military operation is carried out.   It is being told clearly what their intention is?  Where did they attack ?  Now after that, see, there are many countries including India who have given such response. This is the official response from By The Way India. We said this after the start of Operation Lion, following the Israeli attack.  We said deeply concern, it is a matter of great worry.  We are monitoring the situation as to what is happening and what is not happening.  The attack on nuclear sides is very worrying.  Obviously.  India further has written that India has very close and friendly relations with both the countries.  We are friends of Israel, we are friends of Iran and we are ready to give whatever possible support both of them need.  Now that is absolutely correct.  I have said this earlier also that in an ideal world for India, the best thing would be that all the tension between Israel and Iran ends so that we can build four ports. Through Iran we could reach Europe and Russia.  The North South Corridor which will pass through Iran is very important for India. And now Israel is continuously attacking Iran.  Obviously, we also have a concern that Israel has given no warning that it will attack Iran from air, land and water.  The first attack that Israel has carried out on Iran was an aerial attack. They have 200 fighter jets.  Again I am trying to imagine what the scene would be like in the sky when 200 fighter jets are attacking together.  So when 200 fighter jets attacked Iran, it became an aerial attack.  Right now the Israeli Navy is most likely going to attack Iran along with the US Navy.  Now where will this attack take place?  Will it happen at Chabahar? Will the monkey be on Abbas?  Where will it be? We don't know.  Then there is still a land attack to take place.  I don't know what these people will do regarding the land attack?  Will para troopers be landed here?  When will some people in Iran go to this area of ​​Iran?  We don't know.  But Israel has openly said that Iran will be attacked from air, land and water. And the land attack, I believe it is possible that the Mossad agents are carrying out blasts at ground level today within Iran and Israel has created chaos here, maybe it was a land attack, apart from that you can see that Israel and Iran are so far away that the armies will not collide with each other and you can imagine that it will be very frustrating for Israel to see India's statement because India is a big player today, whatever India says on the world stage, it matters and India says here that yes, we have good relations with both the countries.  This is something similar to the statement that came from the US after Operation Sindoor that we have good relations with both the countries.  We just want de-escalation to happen here. Israel: Only after this we have seen that Israel published this map where Iran's target was shown to India as well, saying do not assume that the thinking and ideology of Iran will save the neighboring countries.  Once this country gets nuclear weapons, then all the neighboring countries will be in danger and after that Israel released a video and again I want to show you this video here. Then I will tell you what India could have done.  Here you can see that the title of this video is given by these people, do you think that once the Iranian regime destroys Israel, will they stop?  Will they stop at Israel?  So let us tell you what their actual plans are. [MUSIC] Now this clip that you are seeing here is of Hassan Salami.  it's dead.  He was the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Israel has killed him today.  And this is its 2019 speech.  This is saying that our war is not a domestic war.  There is a war against the world powers. We are planning to break the United States, Israel and their partners.  Now now and their partners.  This is a very vague term. India is also a partner of USA.  We do not use the word LI.  But we are a strategic partner of Israel and USA. Now here are his old speeches. Ok?  He has put all this here and basically told the world that Iran is a threat not just to Israel but to the whole world. India could also have done this. You know, USA flags are burnt every day in Pakistan. We could have literally shown during the time of Operation Sindoor that this is the mentality in Pakistan.  This is this type of fundamentalism.  They will burn the Indian flags.  We will burn the flags of Pakistan.   The type of speeches these terrorists give.  Ok?  Burn the old speeches of Imran Khan where he was blaming the US. I mean this is all part of information warfare.  And Israel is here showing how to present a perspective to the world.  Again, I neither agree nor disagree with Israel. I am a very neutral observer. I am just observing this from the perspective of an Indian.  And as an Indian, I have also observed that Israel as a country has been able to make so much progress because fundamentally the politicians here are good.  There is a lot of debate internally.  Yes, you did not do well in transportation.  There has been corruption.  Yes, this is not right here, that is not right. But when it comes to foreign policy and unity of the country, everyone comes together in front of an enemy. This is a very famous video.  It is becoming quite viral these days.  This man is Naftali Benat.  You will remember it for some time.  He became the PM of Israel a few years ago and this Benjamin Nitin is a staunch opponent of Yahoo.  The parliament of Israel is called the Knesset.  There, Naftali Beneath criticizes Nitin Yahoo in a way no one would do. But when Operation Rising Lion was launched, you must listen to his words.  Everyone is standing behind this strike, all are left and right, I am behind this decision, it's something preaching, to hit the head of the opposition, to take it out aggressively, now listen here, be it any party, left or right, I believe that we will run a better government than this, we are better people, but I stand behind my government.  There is full support to our government.  For Now As A Country We All Stand United.  I would say that this is the identity of a very successful country. Where politicians know what their job is.  It is not that you can just gain power by doing anything. Somewhere you are part of the country.  You are a citizen of a country.  There is a huge responsibility and in such times, both the opposition and the ruling party have a big role in keeping the country united. And look, Operation Lawn is just beginning. Iran has declared that the strikes by Israel are a declaration of war.  The war has started.  This is an official declaration of war.  And Trump has also said that many more brutal attacks are yet to happen on Iran.  Many developments will come.  I will keep on making updated videos for you all.
