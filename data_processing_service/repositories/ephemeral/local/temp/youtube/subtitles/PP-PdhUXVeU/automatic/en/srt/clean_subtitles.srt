I told you about the operation.  Israel was the one that was going to attack.  In what way I took a complete lecture on Pakistan from there. But let me tell you that this offer was made during the time of Indira Gandhi and earlier during the time of Morarji Desai.  It is Indira Gandhi.  He had refused.  Right?  And after that Rajiv Gandhi again refused.  So basically all three of them had refused.  But Israel and India together were going to destroy Pakistan.  They were going to destroy their nuclear program. Now friends, let's talk about something.  Is it okay?  I will tell you three-four points. According to me, it was a big blunder on India's part that they did not say yes.  He should have said yes.  Why?  Look at the situation in Iran today. Iran does not have a nuclear bomb, rather Iran calls itself a Muslim leader. You are considering itself a Muslim leader. Iran calls itself a Muslim leader in the entire world and Iran does not have nuclear power, so it is helpless. The day nuclear power comes here, things will change. If we talk about Pakistan, now see Pakistan in this context, look at this country, this country has been for sale since the beginning and it has supported America by saying that keep giving us alms and we will keep doing your work.  Is it okay ?  Now when the war with Pakistan took place in 1971, India fully destroyed Pakistan within 13 days. After that, we took control of 1/3 of their army. Then they freed him and took him away.  Meaning, he came, Shimla agreement was signed and he said that it is no big deal, take it.  Indira Gandhi showed a big heart and said, okay you can take it. But friends, in 1974 we conducted our nuclear test and we got the nuclear power capability. Then Pakistan started building its own nuclear power. Nuclear.  Abdul Qadeer Khan, Abdul Salam, all these people, they stole the nuclear blueprints. Abdul Qadeer Khan stole nuclear blueprints from Europe and started selling them.  We were already developing our own nuclear programme.  Israel feared this.  They sold it to Libya, they sold it to North Korea, they sold it to Iran, they sold it to Iraq.  Sold them all.  Pakistan has made this a business.  So Israel said that let's do one thing together and destroy the nuclear reactors of Pakistan. Now what benefit would India get from this? Pakistan was very scared in 1971.  These CIA documents of 1993 reveal that Pakistan was so scared that we can never defeat India in a conventional war. So we will have to make a nuclear bomb. Ok?  Now suppose India had accepted Israel's proposal at that time.  So this would have ended Pakistan's nuclear program and Pakistan could not have done anything because it knew that we will not be able to win the war against India.  We will not be able to win the war against India. So if this had been a joint operation, imagine how much damage Pakistan would have suffered and it would not have been able to become a nuclear power till date. That means Pakistan would have been nuclearised.  Pakistan cannot be declared in today's time. Donald Trump is currently sitting and having lunch with Asif Munir. So you forget it.   Is it okay?  But that was a great opportunity. So now there is no terrorism because if there was terrorism, suppose there was any terrorism, then we could have attacked Pakistan or taught Pakistan a lesson, Pakistan would have remained within its limits, but as soon as it conducted its nuclear test in 1998, its tone changed, till then it was silent, we snatched Siachen, we did everything, it was not saying much and America also withdrew its support from Pakistan, but as soon as it became a nuclear power, its tone changed and it started carrying out horrific terrorist attacks and then it started giving nuclear threats to India again and again and somewhere or the other the entire world also listened to it, that is why America also helped Pakistan because nuclear blackmailing was taking place.  So the first objective was that Pakistan would not have been able to do anything if we had attacked it. Secondly then you would say that the whole world would jump on this. America would have jumped, Europe would have jumped. See who was carrying out this attack?  Israel was getting it done. And we all know that America and Israel support each other. America always supports Israel.  So if Israel had done it, it is obvious that America would have supported it. Now, as far as the whole world is concerned, even if we were to assume that it could put pressure on India, it has been doing so since always.  After 1998, America imposed many sanctions on India. But later we realised that we cannot survive without India.  So that has been happening forever.  Today you can see what is happening in Iran.  Brother, look, literally America and Israel are doing hooliganism. Literally brother, they are saying surrender, surrender, we will finish you off, we will kill you.  Iran is fine whatever its regime is.  But now someone is saying something.  Donald Trump comes publicly abusing Emmanuel Macron. Russia is openly killing Ukraine.  If there are sensations then there are sensations.  No one is saying anything.  You look at China.   The world does not say this, brother, everyone is concerned about their own interests.  At that time we felt that brother, we have the problem of Punjab.   There is a problem of Kashmir.  Ok?  And then what will the world say after that?  There will be a problem.  There is pressure.  we stopped.  But when you actually look at it, it doesn't have any meaning. Brother, the Kashmir problem: if we had destroyed Pakistan's nuclear program, then Kashmir and Pakistan would have been even more scared. That problem would also have ended.  Because then India could fight war as many times as it wanted. Today, which country in the entire Middle East or West Asia is not afraid of Israel?  Hit Syria.  There was a coup in Syria.  Today, the terrorist on whom America had a bounty of millions of dollars was made the President of Syria.  Donald Trump just met him.  You look at Iraq, America destroyed it.  Jordan stands with America.  Lebanon was devastated. Israel will take over the whole of Gaza. Egypt is silent out of fear.  He is not saying anything.  Is it okay?  Here in Kuwait, the entire Gulf is under the grip of America.  is supporting America. Iran is already seeing devastation in the entire Gulf country. So who is left?  You can see that the situation in Afghanistan is also very bad and very soon America will support Afghanistan also.  So you see, everyone in Israel is scared. Nobody messes with Israel.  Why? Because these people do not have nuclear power. And the day Iran gets nuclear power, the power balance will completely shift.  On that day, Iran can do anything and will say, now kill us.  Now you have the guts, try killing them, then Israel will not attack.  This was the strategy India could have adopted.  However, we are not as aggressive as Israel. Nor are we a revisionist nation. But we will have to work on our defense.  Ever since Pakistan was formed in 1947, it has continuously created problems in Kashmir. He has created problems in India.  We could have taken very strong action and the entire world would not have said anything and Pakistan would have remained within its limits.  Suppose if Pakistan was not a nuclear power then Pahalgam would have been attacked on 22nd April.  We would have destroyed the entire Pakistan.  The whole of Pakistan, but India increased the restraint.  And friends, in 2001, Pakistan attacked our Parliament with the same thing, Operation Parakram. Nuclear Power: As soon as Pakistan became a nuclear power, its attacks increased 10 times.  He started sending terrorists to India.  Now what happened in that?  What happened was that under Operation Parakram, the Indian Army was ready to attack Pakistan. But Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the senior leadership all said that you have to maintain strategic restraint.  You step back.  There was no response from above. And same with Manmohan Singh.  So this is what has been happening to us continuously.  Somewhere we know from that thing that nuclear war is not right.  So I think my analysis says that as many articles are being published right now, India and Israel should have jointly attacked Pakistan's nuclear program even today if they still have the opportunity. Ok?  And even now if you get this opportunity then in my opinion you should attack.  You should not think about it because if you give even a small window to Pakistan, it will spread terrorism in the whole world and will not do anything else. Look at Hamas, now Iran funds Hamas.  Hamas went to Pakistan.  What did Pakistan do?  Pahalgaon was attacked.  Exactly in our style. Terrorists across the world seek help from Pakistan.  You will definitely find Pakistan's link with terrorism.  What do you think?  Please let me know in the comment box. Be happy, keep reading.  Desh Siddhant Agnitri signing off.
