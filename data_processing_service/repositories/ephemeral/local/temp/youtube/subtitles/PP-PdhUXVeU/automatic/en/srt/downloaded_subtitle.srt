close this offer.  Meaning the sale will

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,160
come after three-four months.  So, many such

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,320
articles have been published.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
I told you about the operation.  Israel was the one that was going to

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
attack.  In what way

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,640
I took a complete lecture on Pakistan from there.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
But let me tell you that

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,000
this offer was made during the time of Indira Gandhi and earlier during the time of Morarji Desai.  It

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
is Indira Gandhi.  He had

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,680
refused.  Right?  And after that Rajiv

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Gandhi again refused.  So basically all three of them

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,120
had refused.  But Israel and

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,199
India together were going to destroy Pakistan.  They were going to

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,200
destroy their nuclear program.

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,119
Now friends, let's talk about something.  Is it

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
okay?  I will tell you three-four points.

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
 

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,560
According to me, it was a big blunder on India's part

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,240
that they did not say yes.  He should have

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,840
said yes.  Why?  Look at the situation in Iran today.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,799

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,360
Iran does not have a nuclear bomb, rather

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,640
Iran calls itself a Muslim leader.

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,720
You are considering itself a Muslim leader.

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,119
Iran calls itself a Muslim leader in the entire world

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,600
and Iran does not have nuclear power, so

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,479
it is helpless. The day

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,640
nuclear power comes here, things will change.

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,079
If we talk about Pakistan, now

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,799
see Pakistan in this context, look at this country, this country has been for

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,560
sale since the beginning and it has

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
supported America by saying that keep giving us alms

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,880
and we will keep doing your work.  Is it okay

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,040
?  Now when the war with Pakistan took place in 1971,

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,920
India fully destroyed Pakistan within 13 days.

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
After that, we

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,119
took control of 1/3 of their army.

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
Then they freed him and took him away.  Meaning, he came, Shimla

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,000
agreement was signed and he said that it is no big deal,

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
take it.  Indira Gandhi showed a big heart and

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,520
said, okay you can take it.

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
But friends, in 1974 we

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,360
conducted our nuclear test and we got the

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,080
nuclear power capability.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Then Pakistan started building its own nuclear power.

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Nuclear.  Abdul Qadeer Khan,

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
Abdul Salam, all these people,

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
they stole the nuclear blueprints.

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
Abdul Qadeer Khan

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
stole nuclear blueprints from Europe and

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
started selling them.  We were already developing our own nuclear

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,800
programme.  Israel

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,879
feared this.  They sold it to Libya, they

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
sold it to North Korea, they sold it to Iran, they

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,720
sold it to Iraq.  Sold them all.  Pakistan has

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,440
made this a business.  So Israel said

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,200
that let's do one thing together and

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
destroy the nuclear reactors of Pakistan.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,440
Now what benefit would India get from this?

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Pakistan was very scared in 1971.  These

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,400
CIA documents of 1993 reveal

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
that Pakistan was so scared that we

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
can never defeat India in a conventional war.

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,000
So we will have to make a nuclear bomb.

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,319
Ok?  Now suppose India had

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
accepted Israel's proposal at that time.  So this would have

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,040
ended Pakistan's nuclear program

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
and Pakistan could not have done anything

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
because it knew that we will

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
not be able to win the war against India.  We will not be able to win the war against India.

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,280
So if this had been a joint operation,

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,360
imagine how much damage Pakistan would have suffered

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
and it would not have been able to become a nuclear power till date.

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
That means Pakistan would have been

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,120
nuclearised.  Pakistan cannot be declared in today's time.

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,040

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,440
Donald Trump is currently sitting and having lunch with Asif Munir.

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,480
So you forget it.   Is it

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,480
okay?  But that was a great opportunity.

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,440
So now there is no terrorism

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,080
because if there was terrorism, suppose there was any

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,879
terrorism, then we could have attacked Pakistan

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,040
or taught Pakistan a lesson,

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,840
Pakistan would have remained within its limits,

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
but as soon as it

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,680
conducted its nuclear test in 1998, its tone changed,

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,080
till then it was silent, we snatched Siachen,

103
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,879
we did everything, it was not saying much and

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,799
America also withdrew its support from Pakistan,

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,360
but as soon as it became a nuclear power,

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,759
its tone changed and it

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,919
started carrying out horrific terrorist attacks and

108
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,240
then it started giving nuclear threats to India again and again

109
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,320
and somewhere or the other the entire world also

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,560
listened to it, that is why America also

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,040
helped Pakistan because nuclear

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
blackmailing was taking place.  So the first

113
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
objective was that Pakistan would

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
not have been able to do anything if we had attacked it.

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
Secondly then you would

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,080
say that the whole world would jump on this.

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,479
America would have jumped, Europe would have jumped.

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
See who was carrying out this attack?  Israel was getting it done.

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,040
And we all know that

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
America and Israel support each other.

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,720
America always

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,479
supports Israel.  So if Israel had done it, it is

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
obvious that America would have supported it.

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
Now, as far as the whole world is concerned, even

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,199
if we were to assume that it could

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
put pressure on India, it has been

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,479
doing so since always.  After 1998, America

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,919
imposed many sanctions on India.

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
But later we realised that we

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
cannot survive without India.  So that has been

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
happening forever.  Today you can see

132
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,080
what is happening in Iran.  Brother, look, literally

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,080
America and Israel are doing hooliganism.

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Literally brother, they are saying surrender,

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,400
surrender, we will finish you off, we will kill you.  Iran is

136
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
fine whatever its regime is.  But

137
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,160
now someone is saying something.  Donald

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,560
Trump comes publicly abusing Emmanuel Macron.

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,120
Russia is openly killing Ukraine.  If there are

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
sensations then there are sensations.  No one is

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,520
saying anything.  You look at China.   The

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
world does not say this, brother, everyone is concerned about their own interests.  At that

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,000
time we felt that

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
brother, we have the problem of Punjab.   There

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,880
is a problem of Kashmir.  Ok?  And then

146
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,440
what will the world say after that?  There will be a problem.  There

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,360
is pressure.  we stopped.  But

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,680
when you actually look at it, it doesn't have any meaning.

149
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Brother, the Kashmir problem: if

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
we had destroyed Pakistan's nuclear program, then

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Kashmir and Pakistan would have been even more scared.

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
That problem would also have ended.  Because

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,680
then India could fight war as many times as it wanted.

154
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Today, which country in the entire Middle East or

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
West Asia is

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,840
not afraid of Israel?  Hit Syria.  There was a

157
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,840
coup in Syria.  Today, the terrorist on whom America had a

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,039

159
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,560

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
bounty of millions of dollars was

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
made the President of Syria.  Donald Trump just

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
met him.  You look at Iraq,

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,800
America destroyed it.  Jordan

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,039
stands with America.  Lebanon was devastated.

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
Israel will take over the whole of Gaza.

166
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,240
Egypt is silent out of fear.  He is not

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,000
saying anything.  Is it okay?  Here in Kuwait, the

168
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
entire Gulf is

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
under the grip of America.  is supporting America.

170
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,880
Iran is already seeing devastation in the entire Gulf country.

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
So who is left?  You

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,440
can see that the situation in Afghanistan is also

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,199
very bad and very soon America will

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,000
support Afghanistan also.  So you

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,560
see, everyone in Israel is scared.

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Nobody messes with Israel.  Why?

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
Because these people do not have nuclear power.

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
And the day Iran

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
gets nuclear power, the power balance will

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,360
completely shift.  On that day, Iran

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,280
can do anything and will say, now

182
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,840
kill us.  Now you have the guts, try killing them, then Israel will

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,840
not attack.  This was the strategy India

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,160
could have adopted.  However, we are not as aggressive as Israel.

185
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
Nor are we a revisionist nation.

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
But we will have to work on our defense.  Ever

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
since

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Pakistan was formed in 1947, it has continuously created problems in Kashmir.

189
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
He has created problems in India.  We

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
could have taken very strong action and the entire

192
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,680
world would not have said anything and Pakistan would have

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,240
remained within its limits.  Suppose if Pakistan was

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,319
not a nuclear power then Pahalgam would have been attacked on 22nd April.  We would have

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,479
destroyed the entire Pakistan.  The

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,800
whole of Pakistan, but India

197
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,199
increased the restraint.  And friends,

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
in 2001, Pakistan attacked our Parliament with the same thing, Operation Parakram.

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,039

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
Nuclear Power: As soon as

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
Pakistan became a nuclear power, its attacks

202
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,960
increased 10 times.  He

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,199
started sending terrorists to India.  Now

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680
what happened in that?  What happened was that

205
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
under Operation Parakram, the Indian Army was ready to

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,479
attack Pakistan.

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
But Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the senior

208
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,160
leadership all said that

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,680
you have to maintain strategic restraint.  You step back.  There was

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,479
no response from above.

211
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
And same with Manmohan Singh.  So this is what has been happening to

212
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,879
us continuously.  Somewhere

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,280
we know from that thing that nuclear war is

214
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
not right.  So I think my analysis

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,840
says that as many articles are being published right now,

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,759
India and Israel should have jointly

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240

218
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,039
attacked Pakistan's nuclear program even today if they still have the opportunity.

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,800
Ok?  And even now if you get this

220
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,560
opportunity then in my opinion you should attack.  You should

221
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
not think about it because if you

222
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,039
give even a small window to Pakistan, it will

223
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,519
spread terrorism in the whole world and will not do anything else.

224
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,839
Look at Hamas, now

225
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,760
Iran funds Hamas.  Hamas

226
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,680
went to Pakistan.  What did Pakistan do?  Pahalgaon was

227
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
attacked.  Exactly in our style.

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,040
Terrorists across the world

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,640
seek help from Pakistan.  You will definitely find Pakistan's link with

230
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
terrorism.  What do you

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,160
think?  Please let me know in the comment box.

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,279
Be happy, keep reading.  Desh
