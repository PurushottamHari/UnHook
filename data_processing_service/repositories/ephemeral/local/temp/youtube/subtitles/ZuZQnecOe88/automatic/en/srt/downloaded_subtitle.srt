1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
I am curious about it why are you alone

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,720
Do you travel? What's the thrill there? Brother

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,799
It's not like I'm alone

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
I roam around. Mostly I travel alone

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,320
There are. The reason is that versatility

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,920
It is more. I like it more somewhere

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
If I have to spend time then I will do it. No

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
If I have to spend it then I will leave on that very day. So

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,119
There is more flexibility in this. Any 

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,119
and when I am with you then you have planned things more

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
There is curry. The next guy probably doesn't feel like it

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,039
is there to get out of there immediately or to the next guy

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
I want to spend many days there

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
Because their plans clash. then fun

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
I don't know. so i'm alone most of the time

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,599
I roam around. And mine would be very spontaneous

17
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,920
There are trips. I mean I don't have a flight ticket

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,320
Would get it done. right now maybe if I'm here I

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
I was thinking what I knew yesterday and the day before

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Should I go for a few days free or get some training somewhere?

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
To do. and if I have to go somewhere

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,200
All the visas are already sorted.

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,000
Mostly visas remain like that. means india

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,559
I am coming. I will get them all installed. Butt now

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
Like Shengan I got five years old.

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,879
The US one was 10 years old, it expires separately

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,039
Used to be. Australia is as old as 3 years old

28
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,320
6 months from all of New Zealand etc to the UK

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
mine are expiring in August

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,199
Are. But then go to UK before August

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
It will have to be done. But wherever I feel like it

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,159
I go there. one side ticket

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
Am. I land there. place for me

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
If I like it then I will stay longer. No

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
If I come, I will leave quickly. and when to leave

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
is this the day before I left or the same day

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
I will decide. so obviously with you

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
If I am some other guy then you will be so

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,880
Cannot maintain flexibility. right i

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,720
This is the main reason. and i'm sure i'm alone

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,280
A very novel type of travel

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
You also get the experience which you get in the group

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
I may not be able to find it. this is my personal

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
I have experience. even if i am two people

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
So, we form a group. then that group

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
Whoever wants to join, he should join that group

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
Is part of. But that group has its identity.

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
Definitely brother, right? You're somewhere alone

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
Get in there too. yes yes yes you are someone's

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
You can be with anyone. Yes, yes. Now

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
A friend of mine is coming. her latex mouth

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't do Thai. I have to but I

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,520
I will go there, it will never be the same again

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Adjust. I will think that he is alone at home

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
he is alone in the hotel, if he comes with me

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,000
He won't feel like doing the same thing to you well

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,159
I have articulated this is what it means everywhere you

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can enter any group yourself

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,680
If you are interested you can go there

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,079
You can become a part but you have a common ground

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
Finding someone else is obviously the same

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
If I am traveling with you then already

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
There are a lot of common grounds between you two

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,000
There will be but there would be some exclusive ones

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,080
which may not be his, they are yours, me and I

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,840
I am sure you must be passionate about travelling, like this

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
You must be enjoying it, otherwise the man will get bored

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,480
It starts happening friend, after some time it is

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,920
hey brother anything if you are naturally

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,599
no you don't enjoy anything

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
You can't do that much right

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
You can't do it by force, no matter how much money you have

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
Are you meeting me, whatever is happening, five to six years

74
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,520
It's done brother, it's fun traveling so much

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,959
that's why I am doing it

76
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,720
hmm yes I can I can imagine I mean my

77
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,959
Two or four years ago it seemed that now

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
It is becoming the same thing. means now if

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,720
I called my whole trip a very good one

80
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,720
I am not giving any character, not that in this

81
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,400
we will do it and then this happens till then it is not fun

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
coming. Otherwise, in the beginning, I was also like this

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
Rotate. Yes. Yes yes yes yes. my first

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
The solo trip was such that I told my family about it

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,040
He said that then I would have been a CA student. I

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
I was doing articleship somewhere. Yes. I've made it home

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,160
I told them that the office people are sending it

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,959
somewhere. Told the office people there is a wedding at home

89
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,879
somewhere. O brother you made them both run away by telling a lie

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,080
In the mountains. And where is Kasual?

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,440
This is a childhood story, brother. very childish

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,159
This is it. I went like this for the first time.

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,599
I have also been to Kasol, brother. I last time

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,040
I came to India. when i come to india

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,640
So generally what you do is that you tell your brothers

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
I am very close to my brothers and friends

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
Am. Means whoever is my best in Hisar

98
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,040
I have friends. I mean my 810 which is closest to me

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,800
Most of the people are from Hisar.

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
There is a new sprout among them, though

101
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,159
I used to travel with him from Bahadurgarh

102
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Am. So, he is a travel friend. But who

103
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,319
The actual one who is my friend is my brother 810

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,599
They are my cousins, in a way, all the same

105
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,519
Someone's grandfather from hometown. My grandmother's cousin.

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
We all are in such an extended family

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
There are eight people who are very close, so whenever I

108
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,400
When I come to India we generally take a drip

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,319
Let's plan within India

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
When I am outside India, I tell my family

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,480
I will call you somewhere in Europe, I am meeting you

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
are you meeting mom and dad somewhere like this

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,519
I take it or if I come to India then I will take it with them

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I live with my friends and brothers

115
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,040
I go out for a trip, so we went last year

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,319
where did we go in 24 we went to Goa 23

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,280
I went to Hemsol brother what happened there

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,760
no she doesn't come hash browns don't come in us

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
It does not do whatever it is or comes by force

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,519
don't know you saying so I tried there

121
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,919
But brother he was good so he fed me

122
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,400
He said this is a brownie, it has something in it

123
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
Whatever you bring, it's such a small brownie, what can I do with it

124
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,199
I ate a little and ate it

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Nothing happened brother, I found out after an hour

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
no what happened absolutely feminine

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
My energy got awakened, I was lying down in such a strange manner

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
I am doing weird things like this

129
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,199
I am doing it. he is saying he is saying

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,960
what are you doing I don't know what it is

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
My brother, the dog was outside the room

132
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm afraid I don't, no

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
Dog, I will go here for how many days

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
I am not scared of dogs now

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
If I say too much then the clips will be cut

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,720
he beats the dogs he does

137
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,400
No brother, he doesn't beat me, but I am not scared

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
Brother there I jump out of the room o

139
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
My God, this will eat me up. I will do this

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
Brother, he told me that later

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,240
They showed me the videos and I felt so embarrassed

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,440
brother the woman inside the fan is really brother i

143
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,880
My friend has become a woman.

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,800
Hey friend, don't feed cannabis to these boys.

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,240
Brother, it is just cannabis. Whatever it is bro

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
No, yes I only have cannabis. the cannabis itself

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
because I once in my childhood

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,280
I saw someone eating, I was in the seventh grade

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
I was in the eighth grade and I was terrified inside

150
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
because I don't know cannabis

151
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
what happens friend. It was the time of Holi.

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Someone gave someone a cold drink, he gave them a cold drink

153
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,039
In a little while. By doing this I am saying

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes, these people go crazy. Cannabis on the

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,639
I must be feeling like this, I am sure. we we

156
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,199
That means dogs are very paranoid, I don't know

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,360
When the thigh pain is gone, that feeling is absolutely good

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,440
It was not there brother so I folded my hands and said this brother

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,160
I don't want to do things today but brother, overall it is like this

160
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,240
It must be a lot because I have taken maybe 15 trips

161
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
There must be eight in the one I took alone

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,120
It has happened many times that we will not die

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,720
This might be more common with you friend that you too die

164
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
Then you won't go as if you are stuck somewhere

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Where I had never imagined that math is

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
No, we have reached somewhere beyond our mathematics.

167
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,840
something else happened to someone else somewhere

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,759
I have reached here brother, such situations happen to me

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,720
who thinks that I mean I know

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,720
Where is it and till what limit can I go

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
As far as I am able to stay safe, I will

172
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
Sounds like a bit of my experience

173
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,479
It's too much to come out of these situations

174
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
Lately I was in Congo, DRC is a country

175
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,080
The Democratic Republic of Congo is there

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,600
The first time I felt it as much as it was there

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,479
I have never experienced that much in any travel till now.

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
I did not think that if I die then what will happen there, brother

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
I happened to be in the eastern part of it.

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
some areas to the east were Boka Goma some

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,199
Cities was its neighbor in Eastern DRC

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,000
The country is Rwanda. Rwanda has one million shares in Abel

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,600
There is a group named M23 of some movement

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,759
They call it M23, so M23 has Eastern

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,360
When did I start going to DRC during which

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,080
I was there just three months ago

187
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,319
The thing is, just before coming to India, his

188
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,280
Rebel groups are roaming the streets of Hoshia

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,199
From big AK-47s on trucks to much more

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
It was so intimidating that it felt like

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,479
Now something will happen now something will happen but I am in no mood to

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,639
like goma yes that is Rwanda M23 rebels

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
I want to put Goma Airport on this Goma

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,800
Airport bhaiya is the worst in my life

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,880
If there was any experience at the airport then this

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,520
There was an airport 3 months ago on this Goma

197
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,960
Airport do that M23 write M23 in front

198
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,360
The rebels had just captured the airport

199
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,360
Recently the plane must have been shot down

200
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
O brother brother brother brother brother brother this day when I

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,080
I left the airport 40 hours later

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,800
A matter of. Oh brother brother he has taken over

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,479
If the airport had been captured then M23 rebels wanted

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
We were thinking of taking over the airport

205
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
So that we can control who is coming and who is coming

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,000
going so that people cannot leave from here

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Diplomats and bureaucrats could not go and

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,199
We will capture the area by force, then this is our desire

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
They were trying to capture the airport and me

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
I had to get out of this situation because

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,599
The fighting had started almost late February

212
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
It is about January, late January of 202

213
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,599
She might be from around here, brother I am at the airport

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,319
I was at the airport and I entered the gate

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,080
But brother tell me that such an environment may be of any kind

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,160
can be done at any time and place

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,319
Militiamen are roaming around with guns. Their

218
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
DRC's army and police have all arrived, now there is war

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,639
It will break out. I went to the airport, the airport

220
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,879
The DRC military was outside. to me

221
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,360
He said, "Brother, you are an undercover agent." your

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
Take out the guns. I got scared brother. mother brother

223
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
What gun do I have? and told us

224
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,120
Looking at you I can tell you are an agent

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
Is. Take out your guns. I said you died

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Brother, this is all the money I had in my pocket

227
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,759
I took it out and mother take it. Said money

228
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,520
I don't want the guns out. this is it somehow

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,599
I made them. Now let's say there

230
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,160
French. I don't know French. Big

231
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,639
With some difficulty I talked to him, gave him the money and went inside.

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Now this is such a fragile airport. This airport

233
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,800
It can be captured at any time. This airport

234
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,880
There wasn't any gun scanning machine.

235
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Meaning there was no machine to scan the bags.

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,360
There was a corner straight ahead. Went to that corner. Speak

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
Go there and get your bag checked. so I

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
I took the bag there. two three there

239
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
Airport officers sat. He said that it is yours

240
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Take out whatever magazines are there in the bag. And

241
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,839
In such situation I am thinking brother what

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,200
will you do it with me even if you push me

243
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
If you put it in then who is letting me go like this

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
In the atmosphere I said that I have some

245
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
No, I told you no, do you have a magazine?

246
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,959
Come on, we got some news, I have nothing

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
no he saw the bag book my bag

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,160
The pack was small but they didn't get anything

249
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
He said come on give me the money now

250
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,320
So friend, they are asking for money hey

251
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,160
Friend, he only wanted money, Himanshu should give it to him

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Friend, give me money, you are harassing my brother

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,440
friend I gave them money

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,800
whatever little remains

255
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,640
Then brother now I am feeling scared that my

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,320
I did not have the magazine with me, whoever has it

257
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,480
I will leave him as well, taking the money

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,800
She is my more torn brother second level

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,120
The problem brother is how much money would have been given, anything

260
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
No, total ₹200 ₹300 for India

261
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:41,680
Just hey, outside came the Blinkit guy, he gave it to me for ₹700

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Brother, bring me some coconut water for ₹200

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,560
The magazine is missing yes that's it brother

264
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
What is there no discount in ₹1000, nothing is money

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
So you were not even taking it, meaning name vs.

266
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
Then brother, show them that there is no problem with this

267
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
If you had guns you would have paid more

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
Now I feel that if they had taken it they would have taken it from me

269
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
I will leave anyone like this completely

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
It can be hijacked at the airport any time

271
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
Airport and brother they don't even have machines

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,839
Have to scan the boarding pass

273
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
When I went there they did not have any machine either.

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
I am writing my name in the register, there was a flight

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,800
I had an airline in Kenya called Air Jbo

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,560
Probably only they and Ethiopian Airlines operate two

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,720
registers the name from that airport

278
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
I am writing your name like this, this is the meaning

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
There is no computer. There was no computer and

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
He gave it straight to me with his hand. this is yours

281
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
Have a boarding pass. What are you saying?

282
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
There was no computer. written boarding pass

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
Written by hand. you go back in time

284
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,880
They went. It has happened to me twice. one more time

285
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
It has happened in any country also. this is from africa

286
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,959
It will be a country. No, that was Tuvalu. Pacific

287
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
It's country. One of the least visited countries.

288
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,279
The island is Welland. Photo of Island Tuvalu

289
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
show. We have to increase tourism. but bro

290
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,120
I have a question. this africa is genuine

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Is he so poor? or does it mean something

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,880
Have they not modernized it? Brother

293
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,720
He is poor. Although they receive funding

294
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
But all the corrupt leaders take them away.

295
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
Well that means it is a problem of corruption.

296
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
There is a problem of corruption. they get the money

297
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,160
Are. Funding is received. The UN gives in

298
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
People want to come into the government. Any

299
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
The government came, they know that we will stay for five years

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
I will not stay. I have to stay for five to six months. His

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,279
It will happen later. We will move away. So five six

302
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
Earn as much as you can in a month. Good

303
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,600
Is. Five to six months then well. Yes, yes. and well

304
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,760
The military does it. The military does it. People

305
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
We do it too. There is no trust in anything. Generaly

306
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
The military does it. It is unstable. Very

307
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,800
More. I mean not the whole of Africa 54

308
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,959
There are countries. Out of 54 I would say half

309
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,880
These are the countries where you can visit.

310
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
There is a lot of instability in the remaining half. And

311
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,399
There is something like this too that Eastern

312
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
is a Francophile. means he speaks French and

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
The Western Frisian speaks French.

314
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,440
Speaks Eastern English. Yes. so this

315
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,360
Is there more problem in the East or the West?

316
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
There is a problem with excess waste and DRC

317
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
Speak French. The DRC is huge.

318
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
It is a bit in the East and a bit in the West

319
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,920
is also there. It is in the centre. It is also in the centre.

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
There are more problems in the West. Because which

321
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,519
I think I'd assume French

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Yes, the rule that was there was quite aggressive. They

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,680
He was quite rude. So any French speaker

324
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,279
They are Africans, especially West Africans.

325
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,760
He is quite rude. You will talk to them. Enough

326
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,920
You trade aggressively. Eastern

327
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,399
Walking down the street like some Americans.

328
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,240
hey how dey bein? Hey, how are you? How are you

329
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,200
doing? It remains like this, don't we?

330
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,279
I don't need to cut it off. No no that's correct.

331
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
Oh friend, I am not doing this kind of fact

332
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
Was. No no that's correct. That is how they say it

333
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,040
Brother. Eastern is correct. Yes. English

334
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
The speaking is correct. good english speaking

335
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,560
Correct. That one is a little more in the west

336
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,680
Is. West some Ivory Coast and all that

337
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,360
You live there, right? Néchar, Burkina

338
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,519
Faso, Mali, Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau,

339
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Ginny Conakry all of these. Once that Tawalu

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
Show me. Dum bro. I have never been to Tuvalu

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,519
It's awesome brother. How far is it from here?

342
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,360
It is very far brother. One is just a strip. These

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
Rahi Stripple. This is a strip. Now its

Exact length 11 km. if i am not

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,639
Wrong. This entire country is 200 meters wide.

346
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,560
Their airport is only 200 meters wide.

347
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,320
Their school is here only. The shops are all so

348
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,240
Is. It is only 200 meters wide. which he

349
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
Maybe it's the airport strip. and weeks

350
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
There are two flights coming in. if you are sick

351
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,680
If it is a serious illness then wait for a week

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,440
do it. You will go to Australia when the flight arrives

353
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,440
You. You can be saved there. it needs to be a country

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,399
what is the need?

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
then i am just trying to ask

356
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,360
A question. Don't laugh in between. this is mine

357
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
This is a real question. What do you need to be a country?

358
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,920
Is it needed? You become someone's city. Brother he

359
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
You must be liking your sovlety. now maybe

360
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,839
But these are coming under Australia

361
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,320
Because it is going to sink in 10-20 years.

362
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,160
People at the airport, the flight took off. At the airport

363
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
He has kept it. Volleyball, football,

364
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,920
Basketball Equipment. as the flight takes off

365
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,959
The entire airport staff and the entire country came together to play football

366
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,959
Let's play on the runway. Such is the atmosphere of the net

367
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,040
what are you, are you from sector 8 here

368
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,040
Faridabad's That is what I got even less than that

369
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Brother their population is 11000, good bus

370
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,160
11000 only yes no tourist comes and

371
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Means total 250 tourists come in a year

372
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,920
All the people outside put together are more than this

373
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
People come to Surajkund Mela once in a day

374
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,200
More than 11000 yes means 11000 or something

375
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
did not happen once show it on map

376
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,160
Tuvalu is located in that part of Australia

377
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,519
It falls in the Pacific, yes this brother

378
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,959
Melanesia Micronesia Polynesia

379
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,480
It falls here and there in Polynesia

380
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
In the East of Australia. Good. These

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,120
Kiribash is another country. Kiribati writes

382
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,600
are in spelling. These are all here. To all

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,040
Least Visited Most Isolated Sovereign

384
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,040
There are countries. I am not talking about islands

385
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,120
I. Talking about son countries. Good

386
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,120
He is the most isolated one. means from here if

387
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
I have to come to Australia it takes 7 to 8 hours

388
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
There will be a flight of. Yes. but you

389
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
You can go to Australia or Fiji

390
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
yes. There are only two flights from Tuvalu to Fiji.

391
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Will you come to Australia from Fiji? just one

392
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,399
There is a Fiji flight which runs from Fiji country

393
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
And when we boarded that flight, we refueled it

394
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
There is no facility in Talu so they

395
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
They took off our bags too, so we were without bags

396
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,880
Me and Navankuri were my best friends

397
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
We reached Talu without bags

398
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
We have four days to spend, we have nothing

399
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
There is no stock, there are two-three clothes shops

400
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,399
Every person gets the same clothes

401
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,320
he wears it, it's a chinese store and what is the time

402
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,160
Let's pass here Netflix comes here

403
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,880
Brother, there is nothing, there are two hotels and that too is meaningless

404
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,800
Electricity is generated from non-operational power

405
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,079
Brother, Australia provides electricity here.

406
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,680
They get all the electricity, groceries and hospitals

407
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,959
all the facilities are small and big

408
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,360
Australia sends them and the liquor flows

409
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,440
Here is the wine and potatoes, it's own liquor

410
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,199
The man takes out the drink at his home

411
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
Look, brother, he finds intoxication no matter how much

412
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
If a person is staying away, he finds intoxication

413
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,360
There is a very important point, alcohol is there brother

414
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,600
His is the first man I met in that country

415
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
He was also drunk, his name was Aatu

416
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
I got drunk when I was at the Bank of Tuvalu

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
I am looking to rent a scooter

418
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,880
So the scooter renter asked for his license

419
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,839
give it to me or give me some ID, that's it

420
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,680
The tourist who came was fat and said he had two potatoes

421
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
The tourist came and he is hugging me

422
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,399
hey aatu she wore flowers here

423
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,399
on the forehead and said no no no

424
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't want any ID or anything from him, he's my brother

425
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,160
Where did it come from? I said it's from India

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,079
My brother has come from India and he told me to go away

427
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,240
Go and take that scooter, I'll come back

428
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,320
so lonely

429
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,000
I must have been so lonely but bro this is this

430
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
It happens like when you are in any isolated place

431
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
I go there and see a man from outside, they are very happy

432
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,880
I feel happy brother only then I have fun

433
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
It is easy to go to such countries. Who

434
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
It is a tourist spot there so I will record as well

435
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
He doesn't do it because they are used to tourists

436
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
of. ok and you know this question gets

437
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,120
I asked you, this is a very remote part

438
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
Is. Have you been to this side of Europe, America or

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,839
You have also been to Latin America. Where was racism

440
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
is it with you? No brother, if it happens then it will be on your face

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,759
Nobody said anything. Wouldn't even dare

442
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,279
seeing. I am not I am being very

443
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,399
Real. It has never happened to me either. because i

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,839
Mean a little in Israel. But look at my size.

445
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,759
Like you don't be rude to me

446
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,279
will you do it. yes yes it does make a difference yes yes yes

447
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,279
yes exactly i think maybe

448
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,000
Personality might play a little role

449
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,079
Maybe they don't, meaning they do it with me in Israel

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
I was stopped on the road and checked two-three times

451
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,680
he looked like an Arab so yes brother if I

452
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
If I go to any Arabic country

453
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,120
I can also look Jewish, I mean our

454
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
Features from Middle Eastern to here

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,320
You live a very common life brother, no matter where you are from

456
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,160
You might think so, in that case it is to me

457
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,639
I stopped you two-three times and I am telling you literally

458
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,639
Literally this would have happened had he stopped me

459
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,920
The Israeli policemen used to open it for me

460
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,720
They used to look at the passport, Indian O Kasol Kasol

461
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
Oh he knew that all the Israelis go to Kasol

462
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
Isn't it brother, he used to say full charas charas like this

463
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,880
Brother, I told you okay, that means we are friends.

464
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Till now you were thinking wrong about me but

465
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
that's the route it would take them first

466
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,399
It seemed that if he had done a profile then he

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
It is not technically racism, but their

468
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,839
There is police, yes, this happened to me two-three times

469
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,079
Well it happened two or three times on the roads but this

470
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
I mean this happened to me in Syria

471
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,400
In Syria, meaning when I went there in 2022

472
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,919
At that time this was Bashar al-Assad who was their

473
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,160
He was the president, just now he was brought down by the second

474
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,880
The party's government will be formed at that time

475
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,799
So during Bashar al-Assad's time, every

476
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
In 100 and 200 meters, there used to be 100 in military

477
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,799
not 200 then 1 kilometer 2 kilometer

478
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,720
The military vehicle was stopped by someone

479
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,039
Where did the tourists come from if Americans

480
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,280
If they were there, they would have searched a lot, good

481
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,600
Indian Shahrukh Khan Shahrukh Khan Let It Go

482
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,840
Let it go means Shahrukh Khan is not from the country

483
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,440
Aaya right so that is a thing in the whole of Africa

484
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,160
I am also there because I know a lot about them

485
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,559
To myself. In Russia he was called Raj Kapoor. Yes

486
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Shani Kapoor Rajput yes that is my shoe

487
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,039
Mithun Chakraborty is also in a rush for his

488
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,280
Here is an old cinema from the Soviet era

489
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,000
and if they have seen that then they are absolutely o

490
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,360
I know my shoe is Japanese and that's his circus

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
I have the record in the Russian circus itself

492
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
Maybe you haven't seen that song even once

493
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
my shoe is japanese the song is probably

494
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,679
Russian circus and circuses of Russia are famous

495
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
Well, now it's a very global level circus

496
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,320
Let's go to Cirque Tu Soleil etc.

497
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,720
In which it is absolutely an A1 production

498
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,039
Historical Circles of Russia Circuses If I

499
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Remember, things are on a much larger scale. So

500
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,679
I think it was a song or some old one

501
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,240
This is the song which is made from the movie Russian Circus

502
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,559
Pay. So, they know it. that is why that

503
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Connection Exists. But I didn't do that before

504
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,000
What I used to think when I was little

505
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
I did not appreciate this. These

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
Shahrukh Khan etc whatever I have said about the actor

507
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,640
Is? I never watch movies etc

508
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,320
Because I used to think what an actor he is.

509
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
Ok. So why do people go crazy

510
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,240
Behind them. I never understood their hype

511
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,160
I did not come. But now when I go to Africa

512
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,919
I travel to such remote areas

513
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
I went there, there is only one TV in every small village

514
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,760
Is. I am watching his picture on that TV.

515
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,679
So I realized his influence.

516
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
To me, their soft power is our soft power

517
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,120
There is power. We are our soft power today

518
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,320
In date. This is true. i remember me

519
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,039
It's in front of my campus in New York

520
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,960
There used to be a Halal Chicken Over Rice stall.

521
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
It is New York, by the way. Yes. in New York

522
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,559
Chicken over rice is a thing and it is done in a halal way

523
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
it is made because they make muslims

524
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,520
I am from there. yes then I will go there

525
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,440
The food was the cheapest for $8 and

526
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,039
It was a nutritious meal. I go there and take

527
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,039
I have been. I am telling you friend this is for fun

528
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,039
The voice of seems familiar. this this

529
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,360
Is before I was laughing on the internet. I

530
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,360
I am telling you that I heard the sound of laughter.

531
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,520
Archana is the laughing voice of Poon Singh.

532
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,799
Kapil Sharma is on air. I did it brother you

533
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Where are you from? saying from Afghanistan

534
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,480
Am. I told you Kapil in Hindi

535
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
You see Sharma. Kapil says that

536
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,520
It is not special for us. Just like that he is his

537
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,520
then he is saying to me in afghani accent

538
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,000
I understood India's role in Afghanistan

539
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,760
How much soft power is there? yes and even

540
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,240
We can see this moment in Pakistan

541
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,880
As soon as the life line of their entertainers

542
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,200
The cut made a difference to them because our

543
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
Audience and our entertainment industry

544
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,600
It matters to them. Exactly this

545
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,200
Building power is very important in the global sphere

546
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
It is necessary brother. absolutely bro absolutely

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,760

Where did he call him? i met salman khan

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,039
Yes, open this photo in which everyone is sitting

When I was a child I used to go for a walk, so we used to go somewhere

688
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,080
Wherever we went, we always saw Indians. One

689
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,919
Our turn came when we went to Russia in the year 2008. So brother

690
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,600
It is a 10 day tour. It's been 8-9 days. Any

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,200
No Indian was seen. I am with my dad

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,240
There are big parks. Himanshu is so big

695
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,679
There are parks that have adventure inside them

696
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
There is a park. The whole amusement park

697
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,760
It happens. The entire amusement park is

698
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,840
Inside we understand that it means such a big thing

699
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
Parks like Lodhi Garden are very big.

700
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,279
If the city becomes a park in itself then we will

701
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm walking around I tell papa

702
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,520
Papa, by the way friend, this time there is no Indian

703
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,880
Suddenly I saw a Sardar brother standing on the side

704
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
I came out from the bush saying Sat Shri

705
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,600

[music]

783
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,440
Where else have you seen Crazy Indians?

784
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,120
it means like you have gone somewhere where you should be there

785
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,039
We don't want Indians wherever we find them

786
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,279
Because there will be many in Africa, brother.

787
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,760
There are many Sindhis in Africa

788
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,520
All these Gujaratis and Marwaris are the boss

789
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
These are the people, they are the owners, they are the ones

790
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,080
He has all the big businesses and he is their brother

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
The rich people are Lebanese and these

792
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,880
Indians are good Lebanese too yes because to me

793
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,279
It seems that not to white people

794
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,279
I am not used to working in corruption

795
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,279
In such an environment he becomes a fully structured person.

796
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,360
They live in the same way as they do business

797
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,880
Can do it. Indians come we are so street

798
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,720
Smart becomes like someone

799
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,799
Give me money, get the work done, do this, do that quickly

800
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
They don't get used to all this quickly

801
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,480
How is the Middle East? Where to visit

802
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,880
It's great brother it's awesome which place do you like

803
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,840
In the Middle East I have Syria and

804
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,679
Lebanon I think they are my favourites

805
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,760
I would say that the situation in Syria is not bad

806
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,600
It's very bad brother, this is the beauty there

807
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
The situation is bad, no one seems to be able to go

808
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
Then when you go there, what they say

809
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,960
Is there happiness on your face or in our country?

810
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,480
They don't even know that someone has come to visit in the evening

811
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,480
Will they get food or not?

812
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,039
Hunger means this is a common public perception

813
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,200
Whether you get food or not, yes only in Domescus

814
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,120
Brother soldier also in Domescus Capital City

815
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
After doing a job, he drives a taxi

816
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,080
After driving, he used to work as a guard somewhere

817
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,279
Only then do they earn during the day, brother

818
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,200
₹200 ₹150 for working 20 hours a day

819
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,559
Afterwards it's ok nothing happened brother whatever work is done

820
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
if he is doing it then this is his condition who is not doing it

821
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,080
He has nothing and Lebanon

822
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,080
Lebanon now even a little bit in urban Lebanon

823
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,880
There is a huge crisis going on in Lebanon

824
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,559
It was pretty good, now the poor guys have problems

825
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,399
It is happening too much but yes Lebanon

826
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
I have seen a lot of money at one time, that's what I'm saying

827
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,440
weren't they France and Mid Middle East level

828
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,440
They say. Paris of the Middle East to Beirut

829
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,679
They used to say. Yes, it was called Beirut. Right? So

830
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,799
His night life etc is quite amazing

831
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
Brother. My biggest concern is the Middle East

832
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,799
The best nightlife would be in Beirut.

833
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,360
Everything remains open all night long. Eat

834
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,880
I think Lemony's food is one of the best in

835
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,760
One of the best. I think it's only second

836
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,159
Two Indian food. Indian number one according to me

837
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,559
to seconds. I think Mexican number two. Like

838
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,039
I really like Mexican food. Yes. Meaning

839
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,200
There are also quite a few similar ones like Freehole Aros

840
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,480
Your Rajma rice is still the same Rajma rice

841
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,159
rajma rice and curd is the same as this

842
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
There is also a theory that a contingent from India

843
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,240
This dude went to Mexico, now look at him

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,000
Brother, it's history, I don't know it exactly

845
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,799
I know, I say this so that I can show some arrogance

846
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,600
Don't stay at home, I taught you how to eat

847
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,440
food but I have heard this but yes to me

848
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,760
I also like Japanese food very much

849
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,600
At least it's not sushi or any other type of food

850
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't like sushi-bushi yes Mexican

851
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,159
I like it good but Lebanese I'm sure and

852
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
It will be very tasty because their roles etc.

853
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,640
They must be living there and he must be living there. Yes

854
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,679
awesome awesome and what was i saying

855
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,279
Friend, the thought just slipped from my mind Egypt

856
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,600
I was talking about Egypt, I was in Egypt

857
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,440
Food is a pleasure to make

858
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,679
Khushari is in Egypt, brother Khushari is his own

859
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,200
Khichdi is a bean and they call it khushri

860
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,120
brother and he also says that he is happy

861
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,120
It also sounds similar, I don't know how

862
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,919
I did not do any research when I reached there

863
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,600
This is their happiness over their Khichdi

864
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,440
I have put some dry fruits on top

865
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,840
Add a couple of dry fruits or spaghetti

866
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,320
di just call it khushri literally li dal

867
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,120
and this is rice and it's a bit dry on top

868
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,120
Add fruits, add chickpeas and ask

869
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,640
See its connection with Khushri and Khichdi

870
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,519
Is there any connection? Search for it for sure.

871
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,000
It tasted really good friend, this Egypt was awesome

872
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,159
I said yes in Egypt in Cairo

873
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,640
This means his stable in Alexandria

874
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,880
The food of the Egyptians is vegetarian and

875
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,039
ok yes there is no meat in it

876
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,600
You are a vegetarian, brother, I eat chicken

877
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
I take it, I eat it, that means I

878
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,279
I also eat lamb yes yes yes yes someone

879
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,600
no problem

880
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:29,519
hoti is to believe yes look friend for real

881
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,640
yaar indian soldiers station in egypt wow

882
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,720
Yaar brought khichdi with them and ate it

883
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Evolved into the Khushri Vinod today people say

884
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,519
that's what I'm saying I'll tell you

885
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,679
I am here, a lot of things are made here

886
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,960
It goes from our house to the rest of the country

887
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,039
That's crazy in the world brother yes khushri

888
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,000
Then from there it became Khichdi Khushari, yes

889
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,120
make sense a na fiji open a fiji in a

890
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,960
island hai naandi spelling its naadi

891
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,159
do not use N in the spelling NA DI

892
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,760
The spelling is nadi by the way it is naandi brother this is a

893
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,159
Fiji is a country where Indians went to the Pacific

894
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,320
Here, many 100 years ago, sugarcane was grown

895
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,240
The workers probably went on a ship 200 years ago

896
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,799
There were people from different parts of India, South

897
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,919
Indians from Bihar go to different places and

898
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,679
Today probably 40% of the people are ethnic

899
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,840
Those who live in Fiji have Indian roots

900
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,919
they speak hindi fijian hindi

901
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,240
There people say that in this whole country

902
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,080
Although Pacific Islanders make up 50% of the population

903
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,919
Those big ones are like Samvans, so they are

904
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,600
All the people are speaking Hindi in the taxi

905
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,679
I am sitting here, all these people are talking like this

906
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,080
So this is such an isolated country

907
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,039
Open the bar from Google Maps

908
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,000
Showing how isolated this island is now

909
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,399
I was there when I was in college in DU

910
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,080
I was there so I just did a part time job

911
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,279
I opened my own cafe and restaurant

912
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,919
Delhi Vijay Nagar North Campus Yes Where

913
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,159
He had a Mother Dairy booth in Vijayanagar

914
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,919
near north campus ok ok so two

915
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,279
I opened it in the last year of college.

916
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,360
After that, I started traveling

917
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,399
I sold it to my manager there

918
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,559
I had a chef, he was from Nepal, so the chef's

919
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,720
I even forgot the name, I don't know what it was 2018

920
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,399
It is a question of how much is Fiji a country now

921
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,079
How far is New Zealand from Australia?

922
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,720
How far is Fiji from the rest of the world?

923
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,480
There is a lot of sea and nothing is far away

924
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,000
And Naandi, an island in Fiji, which I

925
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,639
I showed her the island, pronounced naandi

926
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,520
Let's spell it Naandi, isn't it an island?

927
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,359
I and my

928
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,919
My new friend was with me. we travel together

929
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,520
Were doing it in the Pacific. so I go to the gym

930
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,200
seemed to. Navankur doesn't go to the gym. So

931
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,040
Navankur said, friend, I am feeling hungry.

932
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,119
Let's eat something and then you go to the gym. We

933
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,520
You were on the road, you are free after making videos etc.

934
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,119
They went. I asked if he would eat well

935
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,040
will you eat it? He told me that he only eats Indian food

936
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,119
Only. Indian food is available in freebie

937
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,359
Because the roots of these people are Indian. So

938
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,280
He said, look there was a small Dhaba nearby.

939
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,040
He said let's eat roti at this dhaba

940
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,240
Are. I said, okay, you eat it. My

941
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
has to do exercise. I will not eat

942
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,320
More. I went and sat down and then a voice came from behind

943
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,720
I have come Paramveer sir I thought here too my

944
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,919
There are subscribers in Fiji because there are many

945
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,520
Sir keeps telling me often that I feel someone

946
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,680
I looked back and saw that he must be a subscriber

947
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,480
Mera Chef was Delhi University in 2018

948
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,200
I was the chef at that cafe

949
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,680
That day, on that island in Fiji, my brother

950
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,960
I realized how small the world is, friend, wherever

951
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,720
You can find people anywhere, friend

952
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,359
I have become crazy fond of Latin America

953
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,760
I like it very much brother I think it is very under

954
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,280
He talks very little but the more I

955
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,000
I have been there, it is not very accessible to me

956
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,800
No, it is very far from India and

957
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,760
Definitely one of the most underrated

958
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,240
Among the places are Latin, Argentina, etc.

959
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,800
I didn't go to Argentina brother, I was in Mexico

960
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,560
When it was Cancun, not Mexico City

961
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,560
Argentina won the World Cup immediately

962
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,760
I got my V flight booked to me

963
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,839
I didn't have a visa, I found out I need one

964
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,720
I applied for Argentina $200

965
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,720
Pay immediately but he wins his World Cup

966
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,760
All the office workers had holidays, couldn't go

967
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,680
If possible, the visa will come, not after 15 days in South

968
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,079
I have only been to America, Colombia

969
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,119
I will go to Colombia on this trip now

970
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,680
Colombia Top Where did you go Bogota and Mejin Inn

971
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,520
There were only two places I went to and that was Karth Hena

972
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,000
Kartana Hey Kartana we're at the Festival

973
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Did the time pass by just like that brother it is just a city

974
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,119
The whole festival is yes I am the best way to

975
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,200
I have to describe it because its

976
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,440
The town part looks like this

977
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,079
Brother it could have been Mathura, you are thinking of him

978
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,079
It has that old town vibe but the place is there

979
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
It is clean and the people there are also such that

980
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,000
Sitting on the road playing Ludo with the kids

981
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,400
Everybody is dancing like this.

982
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,040
This was my first impression when I saw him

983
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,119
that friend this could have been any city that I

984
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,520
come from if it was cleaner and people were

985
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,760
Not this stressed. Poverty is here

986
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,400
It keeps us so stressed that we

987
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,160
Can't even enjoy it. Yes, yes. and not one

988
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,480
There is a factor, Paramveer bhai, maybe you can relate

989
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,200
will you do it. I feel like in a city

990
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,320
Beauty has great value and the whole of India

991
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,599
Roughly all Indian cities Bombay, Delhi,

992
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bangalore Beauty

993
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,839
There are starred cities. we keep this much forward

994
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,720
to their cities. So much rubbish, lack of

995
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,160
Planning, two tons, the stench of the drain, the whole of Bombay

996
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,599
It smells like drain. abuses to me

997
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,760
You will have to work for this. But I will not lie

998
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,160
I am speaking. It has a psychological impact

999
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,200
Unless you're the beauty in the city

1000
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,440
You will give people the understanding of God and divinity

1001
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,599
It will not come, friend, she will not feel it at all.

1002
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,280
What do you give to people in the city? I

1003
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,280
I consider electricity as water. I understand roads.

1004
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,599
very good thing. you guys are traumatized

1005
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,280
You give it. So much on every road, every red light

1006
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,599
Poor man and so poor old helpless man

1007
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Brother, I cried privately one and a half times

1008
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,359
Am. just standing at the red lights

1009
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,240
Even if I had cash in my pocket, how much would I give

1010
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,240
Would give. hmm hmm hmm withdraw ₹800 ₹900 ₹900

1011
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,440
by taking it out because brother that uncle is poor

1012
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,599
They are playing like this. this is us so its na

1013
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,839
There is impact. You take any ordinary city in Europe

1014
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,200
In any ordinary city. Have you seen that

1015
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,000
They are beautiful, friend. We her you morning man

1016
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,440
He gets up and says. We have it here

1017
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,599
stress due to awkwardness, that noise is absolutely

1018
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,119
Brother. We will achieve something. we make money

1019
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,119
I will take it. We are very capable people in that regard

1020
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,440
Are. But what makes us feel happy from inside

1021
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,880
Will you find it in your cities? When we came to Bombay

1022
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
Let's talk about spirit, a big argument

1023
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,800
I was just meeting people in Bombay. of Bombay

1024
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Spirit Local. 100 and a quarter people travel in trains

1025
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
They fall under it and die. You

1026
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,079
Trauma and tragedy have also been romanticised

1027
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,079
yes friend. Absolutely brother, absolutely.

1028
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,880
Why do we run to the mountains? Because

1029
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,119
There is beauty there. we go to the beach

1030
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,920
When you are from India, go to Konkan or

1031
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,400
In some area. Yes. There is beauty there.

1032
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
Then the man says, friend, I wish I could keep roaming

1033
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,240
Just like you do all your life. Because the man

1034
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,560
If you look for that beauty, it may not be in any sense

1035
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,280
I can't find it brother. I think so too friend

1036
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,280
Here people mean nothing, no matter how rich someone is

1037
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,800
Yes, how expensive is the car? you have to drive that same

1038
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,720
It's on the road that everyone else is driving on.

1039
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,599
That broken one will take you any car too

1040
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,839
Will go. Anyone can do anything by overtaking. And

1041
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,760
So what does a rich man do here? Rich

1042
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,280
The man creates his own island. His

1043
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
He builds big walls in front. Four

1044
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,119
The security guy deploys it. inside her

1045
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Four Range Rovers and four big vehicles parked

1046
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,520
Does. Mercedes and so on and says

1047
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,760
I will live in this. the grass inside it

1048
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,440
It will be better than the grass outside. Water again rich

1049
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,800
A man is making an island inside India

1050
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,160
Because I don't want to step outside

1051
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,400
I want it. yes yes friend i am not sure it is

1052
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,680
The Right Way to Play This. this is mine this is mine

1053
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,760
It has a personal feel. no no bro i agree

1054
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,920
Am. The value of beauty, you are here

1055
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,480
Chonqing etc. in China? No, Beijing and

1056
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,640
Shengha bus. He is there, isn't he? He is standing above.

1057
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,160
Still it looks below, it looks like this above many

1058
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,920
Floors. The spelling of Chamkin is different from yours

1059
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I can't hope so. which is yours

1060
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,599
Spelling is his problem. you leave it and retire

1061
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,520
Go away, don't be shocked. from the building

1062
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,000
The metro goes. when paramveer bhai came out

1063
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,960
When you go then his shocking Google will be complete.

1064
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,440
Brother, yes that is what I am saying. The China

1065
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,680
also, at some level, yes, it is right, it is right, it is right

1066
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,520
yes it is right china also has beauty at some level

1067
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,480
Look, open this photo in which there are lights

1068
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,920
It is burning, yes this is their hill town

1069
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,400
This could have been their Mussoorie, ah ha ha brother

1070
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,200
Neither did we give it any shape nor did he give it any shape, friend

1071
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,000
It looks like a modern marvel

1072
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Big city that is in the top seven eight cities of the US

1073
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,960
since this is a bigger city than that

1074
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,960
I think our urban planning and

1075
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,119
There is something missing in all of this in our country.

1076
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,119
It is the first time I went to Mumbai

1077
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,520
Everyone wants to see Shahrukh Khan's house. to me

1078
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,760
I have no hobby but somehow I went along with it

1079
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,480
With the ones. shahrukh in bandra west

1080
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,520
Saw Khan's house. Outside that, brother, is the sea

1081
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,440
Is. No offense brother but that is what I meant

1082
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,359
I did not see a bad place. such a bad sea

1083
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,119
I did not see it brother. There was so much bad smell. There itself

1084
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,680
Those corn cobs are sizzling. I kept the paan spit there

1085
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,000
people have. and with the sea breeze

1086
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,320
It all comes into the nose. now his house is inside

1087
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,720
I don't know how luxurious it will be. several 100

1088
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,240
It is worth crores. But that area friend then I

1089
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,920
I also have a group chat. I my brothers

1090
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,760
Sent to. There friend this house is worth 200 crores

1091
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,760
He has taken it here. in Croatia if this

1092
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,320
This sea pass costs one and a half to two crore rupees

1093
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,400
Such a blue sea, such a bigger sea than this

1094
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,240
His. No, you have to make a point here.

1095
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,359
You will have to show it visually, Paramveer Bhai.

1096
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,119
The one from Croatia who is Blue of Croatia

1097
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,200
I have seen very few things bluer than that

1098
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,040
In life. Yes. Whether it's his Plitvice

1099
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,119
There is a park. Which one is that, it is a national park.

1100
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,240
Don't know. Good. nice croatia brother

1101
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,319
The beauty of Croatia is unmatched beauty

1102
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,319
In this case split or dubro split

1103
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,720
yes yes what is this in Dubron

1104
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,880
There shouldn't be any villa on the shore, it is so big that it is one and a half

1105
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,160
A villa like this will cost Rs 2 crores, even closer to his house

1106
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,920
Double big and such a sea, such a wind, such a peace

1107
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,319
But how much have you overdone it my friend?

1108
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Now in India, the people who go to Mumbai

1109
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,960
They are seeing the sea in their mind

1110
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,400
The definition of the sea is the same as that of Shahrukh

1111
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,400
Khan looked outside the house at North

1112
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
There would be no sea, no one like us would go

1113
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
If I hadn't seen Croatia. If

1114
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,680
If I had not gone out of India, my

1115
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,359
So the definition of the ocean remains the same throughout life.

1116
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,200
Is. It smells like that. There is black water.

1117
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,880
There is spittle fallen there. these beauty

1118
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,800
If you haven't seen it then their standards should be the same

1119
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Wow, let's go to Marine Drive. wow sea

1120
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,280
Sit on the side. So I think a lot

1121
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,359
These things do not need much development

1122
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,839
The cleanliness and standards are very good.

1123
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,079
It is useless for me. I think I should ask for this

1124
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,800
It's not a big deal to ask for

1125
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:51,599
You can increase the hygiene and beauty quotient

1126
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,720
Improve India. Brother tell me something about Thailand

1127
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,480
The entire economy is tourism. Eight more such countries

1128
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,800
can you tell me about Indonesia etc.

1129
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,160
The majority economy is tourism. we are those countries

1130
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,760
What is there in it which is not in our country

1131
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,200
Is. I'm talking realistic

1132
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,640
How much have you experienced from tourism point of view

1133
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,040
I have travelled to India. Didn't travel much. More

1134
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,960
Did not turn around. I have travelled a lot in India. We

1135
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,200
You want to see mountains more beautiful than this

1136
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,640
except maybe in contests like Patagonia

1137
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
There are no mountains in Argentina. From this

1138
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
As beautiful as our beautiful mountains. whether

1139
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,640
Be it this side or the east side. If

1140
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,920
You go to North East and search for the mountains there.

1141
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,079
Zero Valley Zero Valley is probably in Arunachal

1142
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,240
If you search for the mountains and lithams there

1143
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,680
A I T L U M I'm telling people

1144
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,520
I couldn't believe my eyes

1145
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,599
How beautiful can it be to visit Meghalaya for the first time

1146
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,200
is there anything good brother hey this is zero on the left

1147
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,040
I open that image, open the left zero

1148
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,880
Look at this green valley, this green whole world

1149
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,200
except maybe the Alps in Switzerland etc

1150
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
This green will not be seen anywhere except etc.

1151
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,560
Bhai Bhai I 10 Days in the French Alps

1152
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,720
I spent last year here. Yes. exactly like that

1153
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,119
in the village. What was the name of that village? I am so

1154
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,079
I even forgot the name of that village. the village was

1155
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,560
Properly. Yes. I will tell you about such villages now.

1156
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,160
I give you whatever is clean in Himachal

1157
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
Because it is very difficult to carry dirt up to the mountains.

1158
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,640
It becomes useful. Yes. But brother, we have

1159
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,119
There is infrastructure for that tourism. Good

1160
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,960
They became mountains. If you talk about beaches.

1161
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,400
I understand the problem of Bengal sorry

1162
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,319
This is the problem of the Bengali Arabian Sea

1163
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,319
that it is a sea with a lot of mud so its

1164
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,160
The water always looks brown. This side also that

1165
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,920
Side too, that is not our mess's fault.

1166
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
But if you go to the Bay of Bengal side you will find many

1167
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,560
You will find many good ones. you island side

1168
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,800
Go, you will get some great pictures

1169
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,280
Will go. If you consider the Kerala coast

1170
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,839
Do consider its back water top.

1171
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,839
Houseboat season tops. Top brother. Ok? And

1172
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,200
You will find religious tourism all across India

1173
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:36,960
You have to do any type of tourism.

1174
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,960
You will get it. The industry is not developed

1175
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,520
Brother. It is not safe for people to come. To you

1176
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,760
You have to choose late or go to Meghalaya again

1177
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,680
Or Switzerland and all your

1178
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,400
Logistics expenses are covered. where are you

1179
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,920
will you go? right now you will get Meghalaya right now

1180
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,920
Because it takes a little time to go to Switzerland 8

1181
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,680
It will take an hour. But I will tell you this

1182
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,520
No, it is that kind of thing brother. If you are a health food

1183
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,960
Make it. Any healthy one, you tell me brother Prakhar

1184
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,440
I have healthy food for you and it is tasty

1185
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,520
No. I will not accept it. so to the man

1186
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,319
The feeling of luxury comes only when that money

1187
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,720
He pays extra and sits for 8 hours. Then

1188
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,960
He feels that friend has done something. that indian

1189
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,800
Man cannot accept this. Faridabad Puri

1190
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,800
This is the intention of the city, no matter how good you are

1191
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,040
Open a shop, we will not spend any money by coming here.

1192
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,680
Because I will spend it after going to Delhi. suffering then

1193
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes, before spending your body. Yes, yes. These

1194
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,960
It becomes an attitude. Otherwise

1195
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,240
Meghalaya my eyes were opened. and Meghalaya

1196
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,599
There is a freedom overall. so many rule bonds

1197
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,040
I mean the people there also like me so much

1198
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,760
You started welcoming me, seat me on your bike

1199
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,760
I took you around in the jungle all alone

1200
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,839
put your bag behind me and I have a

1201
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,000
That speaker seemed to be playing music

1202
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,480
Roaming around the whole of Meghalaya on bikes is awesome

1203
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
friend so the man says friend if there is so much beauty

1204
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,280
It is in our country and right now I am going to Meghalaya

1205
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,119
I am talking about it, I did not go inside it

1206
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,720
I am on top of that, Manipur, Assam, Arunachal, all these

1207
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,720
I did not see anything like Tripura etc.

1208
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,359
I have seen Sikkim, I have seen a little bit of Sikkim

1209
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,760
In Sikkim I went to the very top of Yumthang Le YM

1210
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,319
t h u n

1211
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,000
Yamthan is a valley. Yes. If above Sikkim

1212
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,440
You go to the North Side as much as I can remember

1213
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,720
Used to be. Brother, I have my own photo which I

1214
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,440
Taken from my phone. yes there is no

1215
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,839
The Indian mountains are unmatched.

1216
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,839
Yes yes there is no competition. If you get this

1217
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,720
Look brother, open any photo. Top

1218
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,599
Open the photo on the left

1219
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,440
In. Going to the right.

1220
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,920
Right right. Just keep pressing the right button

1221
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:31,040
Not on your keyboard.

1222
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,040
go right friend first of all this is this valley

1223
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,480
Prakhar bhai you like India's tourism

1224
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,920
If you are made a minister, what changes would you make?

1225
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
You will say that there are more tourists in India

1226
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,040
It's a good question, I think one of them is safety

1227
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,720
Communicating to the Global Tourist

1228
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,359
The most important thing now is that you

1229
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,160
How will you create the environment but I am global

1230
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,480
We will communicate safety to tourists

1231
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,400
As Goa is getting filled up now

1232
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
One very clear thing is that the person who earns money

1233
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,000
He wants to go somewhere by spending money, go to Goa

1234
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,599
For example I want to go to Gokarna

1235
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,040
Start tourism there also. His

1236
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,359
Start talking about it too. Because

1237
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,680
No, tourists always spread like this. one place

1238
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,440
From there it develops into four different places

1239
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,359
Is. Ok? So local tourist will get new

1240
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,400
I have to tell the place to go because otherwise he

1241
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,079
He will go to Mussoorie, Dehradun, Goa and raid it.

1242
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,839
Eventually it will be overused. No handle

1243
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,599
will be able to do it. We have a large public. Global

1244
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,359
Start giving the perception of safety to tourists

1245
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,440
Have to do it. You have to fix law and order

1246
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,359
Is. You for whatever reason police

1247
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,040
This needs to be elevated to the priority list of stations.

1248
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,800
tourist cities Hampi, Pondi which all these

1249
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,280
Religious cities where you go

1250
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,680
Police activity in Varanasi etc.

1251
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,760
There should be more foreign tourism

1252
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,480
They should be encouraged and they should never feel unsafe

1253
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,200
because if I have money then tourism

1254
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,359
If we want to expand, the money will come from outside

1255
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,119
Good Luxury Tourism as a Brand Increase

1256
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,400
We should do luxury in Rajasthan

1257
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,720
We are tourism, we are very top hotels

1258
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,960
I am saying luxury safari in Ranthambore

1259
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,200
why aren't we here don't we know

1260
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,480
Brother, there are no animals in our safaris

1261
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,920
The chances of being seen are also less. I heard

1262
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,839
it is more easy in Masamara etc.

1263
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,359
Can be seen. I am just sharing AT RECENTLY.

1264
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,040
Yes. So I heard there you have on

1265
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,960
Demand tells that by evening this animal

1266
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,880
I will introduce you to him. There is no such animal

1267
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,400
Which is in your mind but you cannot see it. and that

1268
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,240
He asks what do you feel like seeing today. Look

1269
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,760
Is. So brother you are taking luxury tourism as a brand

1270
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,800
increase because global man invest money

1271
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,359
wants. As many people as there are in Sri Lanka at this time

1272
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,280
going. We

1273
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,440
You saw Sri Lanka. All the Goans

1274
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,839
Tourist from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Global

1275
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,240
Tourists are also from global Russian yes yes Russian

1276
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,400
Now all the Europeans are also going to the next Bali

1277
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,359
Sri Lanka is no different

1278
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,599
In Sri Lanka the roads are clear, the stones are broken

1279
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,520
There is no law and order, it's not very good

1280
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,359
There is no strong law and order and the food is not available

1281
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,160
Sri Lankan food is worse than ours

1282
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,000
man man cries yes yes yes meaning

1283
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,200
Realistically everything in Sri Lanka is perfect

1284
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,920
I just don't like the food yet.

1285
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,599
Available Yes Yes Yes Total cities in Sri Lanka

1286
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,640
How many are there? colombo kalatara kalutara and one

1287
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,280
two and four city eliya nare eliya whatever

1288
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,520
there's one that's four cities yes four cities so I

1289
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,640
I can give you Goa Goa and back and forth yes

1290
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,720
yes so we have a little image of our own

1291
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,560
There needs to be a change in the tourism sector. Us

1292
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,480
People want to sell luxury travel

1293
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,119
He is a foreign tourist. We need tourism

1294
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,480
We want to sell safety and we want to expand radially

1295
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,599
Tourist centres have to do this. hmm hmm

1296
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,440
Hmm. so if auroville pondicherry is running

1297
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,000
So what can we do next to Auroville Poncheri

1298
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,079
We can, we what you said about the police

1299
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,680
No, in tourist cities there is no police

1300
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,280
Should be more active. Prioritize

1301
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,440
Tourists should do this. This is in my opinion

1302
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,200
It is very important. Let me give you an example like

1303
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,280
Many of my friends went to Brazil. I am currently

1304
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,760
Haven't gone yet. But in Brazil, there are quite a few

1305
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,680
There are more gangs, crimes, and favelas.

1306
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,680
It is impossible for them to steal your phone

1307
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,280
yes. Brazil if you stay for a few days. But

1308
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,800
What happens? Stop it, friend. Sorry brother.

1309
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,800
yes turn it off. I am feeling cold too.

1310
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,720
My nose got completely blocked.

1311
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,480
If your phone is stolen in Brazil.

1312
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,480
If it is a local's phone that has been stolen then

1313
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,160
The police will not even go to the favela. if went

1314
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,680
Went. If it happened to a tourist then it is a favela

1315
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,760
I will go to. They will say return it. Any 

1316
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,440
You can steal the local one but then we will leave it. Its

1317
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,960
Return it and they will return it. So

1318
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,040
They sponsored the tourists

1319
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,960
To the foreigners. Same thing in Cuba too. One

1320
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,359
My friend was in Cuba. steal his phone

1321
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,119
Happened. Went to the police. my phone was stolen

1322
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,280
Is. He said if it would have been someone else's then maybe we would have been like this

1323
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,200
Should not have taken action. That guy is in jail right now

1324
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,280
is in. The person who stole the phone was only two years old

1325
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,800
That guy is done and in jail. so my thought

1326
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,200
You will also have to prioritize yourself from

1327
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,720
Specially for foreign tourists. now here

1328
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Where do so many policemen listen? So much

1329
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,079
It's crowded, there's so much population, so many

1330
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,559
There are cases. do the same things to yourself

1331
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,800
Will need it. What do you like about Europe? Brother

1332
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,520
Every country in Europe has similar architecture

1333
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,280
It will happen. One would be Old Tatown. Enough

1334
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,280
pretty little. In Europe my brother General Joe

1335
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,720
I like Germany a lot in parts

1336
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,720
Maybe it's because I have friends there.

1337
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,240
But lots of them. Portugal, Greece and Portugal

1338
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,079
did not go. I haven't been to Greece yet. And

1339
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,680
Spain went to Spain. Spain Spain then went

1340
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,119
Am. I think this is the warm side of Europe

1341
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,880
It would be good. I did not go to all three.

1342
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,599
I like Italy. Good Italy choice

1343
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,640
Is. I like Italy. I like Spain too.

1344
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,040
Germany

1345
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Although you will not relate to that thing.

1346
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,319
What is happening in Germany is similar to what is happening in Spain

1347
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,480
It is happening. I mean, people are a little different.

1348
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,720
People from a cool place. obviously less

1349
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,200
Warm. yes there are not that many hospitals

1350
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,119
As many as these people from the hot Mediterranean countries. Absolutely

1351
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,680
correct. so this is what i feel about people

1352
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,680
That's what I have also become to a large extent.

1353
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,280
Meaning, wherever I am, I become like that.

1354
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,200
So I don't have any problem. If the next

1355
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,760
The person is absolutely cold, no problem

1356
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,760
Is. I will also live my life. Spain

1357
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,480
I like Italy, I like Italy, recently in Italy

1358
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,319
I did a road trip. so with the family

1359
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,240
I was out for quite some time so I was not happy with my family

1360
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:23,839
I called him. then we take the car

1361
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,520
Had travelled around. Italian food Italy is also such a place

1362
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,440
I mean no one, I haven't found anyone like that

1363
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,960
It seems as if he liked Italy. in Europe. every

1364
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,880
European's dream destination with these

1365
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,880
Europe is Italy or Croatia, okay?

1366
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,119
Croatia is becoming more popular now

1367
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,359
Right, I like Italian food so much.

1368
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,319
I don't like pizza etc unless it has that in it

1369
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,440
don't put your catch up watch in it

1370
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,640
Fill it with oregano or not, it is not tasty

I did not like that food as a child

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,960
So this was their pasta vs pizza

1376
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,400
I didn't enjoy it etc. But besides that, Italy

Pizza. Yes.

1387
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,200
The modern pizza we eat is American

1388
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,359
have a pizza. because that's Italian pizza

1389
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,280
He lives there like a big tomato. They

1390
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,520
Brother lives a little differently. I like flavours

1391
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,880
Also seems a bit bland. Exactly American

1392
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,839
Pizza, that too New York Pizza, is available.

1393
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,160
That New York pizza slice so thick. They

1394
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,079
Where is the best place to treat diabetes?

1395
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,640
Are you looking for it in New York now? my friend

1396
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,800
There was a place near the college. Good

1397
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,160
Coonets. Good. which street is it

1398
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,480
Where? at 110 and Broadway. Good. Connet

1399
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,079
k o r o n a t his na slice so much

1400
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,240
It used to be big, about the size of a pizza

1401
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,160
slice yes when i first ate it

1402
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,160
My head was blown but I was ready for pizza

1403
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,920
I am not a big fan of anything, neither am I, brother.

1404
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,520
hmm i don't like pizza very much

1405
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,559
it's crazy like people live there

1406
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,400
But we are not going to eat one such thing for your whole life

1407
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,480
You can, but the taco should not be Indian

1408
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,800
tacos hands down i think because they

1409
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,079
That meat roti is practically Indian

1410
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,520
Exactly but I mean I had tacos

1411
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,920
I specifically go and eat when I

1412
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,000
I go to Mexico right? Yes, the street people

1413
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,480
I will eat this flavour because I like it

1414
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,559
I don't know what's the difference between Alastor and this

1415
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,319
but I eat them all because I

1416
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,800
The tacos are genuinely delicious on it

1417
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,520
That little bit of onion salsa with vinegar

1418
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,440
Let the flavour come, oh brother, it doesn't feel chilli

1419
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,040
Maximus puts a lot of chilli in the taco, man

1420
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,680
It is like this in my in-laws house, so we are the ones

1421
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,280
stay

1422
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,599
Let it go, it doesn't feel like chilli to me

1423
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,760
I actually like chillies. good i like it

1424
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,599
Not there. I have eaten like this on the road many times

1425
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,680
Didn't go to maximum. I used to say that

1426
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,680
no pikte no pikte si pikte

1427
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,359
And those people went to Mexico together with the Indians

1428
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,960
When I am very happy, I am also very happy

1429
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,040
It is quite similar friend, this thing interests me the most

1430
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,000
it seems more fascinating that even two we all

1431
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,160
Come from a very different ethnic cultural

1432
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,160
Religious National Background in the World

1433
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,319
But there are so many common interests, so many similarities

1434
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,559
Where are the people, where are the Americas

1435
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,040
Where is Mexico and where is India but still

1436
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,880
We have so many common interests, I mean cultures,

1437
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,520
How similar are values ​​and moral ethics

1438
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,960
Buddy. Brother, I mean, especially with Mexico

1439
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,200
My family is realising now. I

1440
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,040
I realised it very quickly. We people

1441
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,839
Most of the beans are humans. Yes, yes

1442
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,240
Exactly. Just something like this here

1443
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,400
The system is different. But how can that not happen?

1444
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,559
We are a little more evolved. and any difference

1445
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,480
Not there. But actually this is the situation

1446
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,240
Because you are like them, from food to their

1447
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,280
Let's treat God. His Central

1448
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,280
The Central God Family in Mexico.

1449
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,520
Central

1450
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,839
Is

1451
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:53,520
And the talk in the country is that you should visit the US

1452
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,680
yes not much bro i'm from texas ohio

1453
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,760
New York California

1454
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,520
I've probably been to one or two more states, I don't remember

1455
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,040
Good, and have you travelled to Australia etc.?

1456
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,800
I have travelled all over Australia mostly right now

1457
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,359
I was in Australia for some time now

1458
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,880
it was in October it was a month and a half in October

1459
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,880
Australia Gold Coast as a child

1460
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,200
I remember he went there, he was very handsome, yes, gold

1461
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,319
But I found Australia to be an overrated fun

1462
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,920
I did not enjoy it I did not enjoy it

1463
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,680
For beauty, it was New Zealand

1464
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,079
There is no point in going to Australia Sundar

1465
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,920
yes new zealand is another world very beautiful

1466
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,559
Melbourne is my city in Australia

1467
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,319
I liked it quite a lot, I found it quite livable and a little

1468
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,079
See European vibes come to Melbourne City

1469
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,839
I was talking about Europe, Europe is my

1470
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,599
I don't feel like there is anything special to go around

1471
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,520
I would love to stay here, but if

1472
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,440
I want to go somewhere for 10 days

1473
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,880
I would probably never choose Europe if

1474
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,559
If I have to go for a month then I will go to Europe

1475
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,119
that I should live in some city in Europe

1476
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,640

to place top three if countries slush

1479
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,160
If we talk about cities, it depends

1480
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,359
Who has what motive, who has what purpose

1481
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,480

I can't remain one. now as long as the kids

1504
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,359
You would have switched off unless you were in school

1505
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:58,319
will remain. Then three years in one country, three years

1506
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,839
In the other. But India, Delhi, Hisar,

1507

Haryana whatever wood be definite wood

Definitely be one of my basis. the second one

1509
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,480
in Europe, the third one is probably in the US or

1510
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,960
US Most Likely Elsewhere in the Americas.

1511
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,160
Nice. Nice.

1512
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,240
or man i think you like your travel enough

1513
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,640
I like it. Now what is the plan for the future next?

1514
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,640
Six months ago I was thinking the same thing

1515
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,200
Like this he will probably ask me what is the plan

1516
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,040
If it is about life then I have played your reel wheel

1517
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,480
Did you see, he will go and ask some tough questions

1518
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,240
And I don't even know what the plan is

1519
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,400
what can I say about the next six months

1520
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,200
yes brother there is no plan even for six months

1521
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,440
hey brother he is six months old he also has no

1522
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,280
I have no plans, I have no plans for tomorrow either, but brother

1523
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,040
I want my own expectations

1524
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,520
This is what life is all about, it's just that you have to see as much

1525
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,200
I learn as many skills as I can

1526
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,160
I can do whatever interests me

1527
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,920
I should learn as many physical sports as possible

1528
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,920
activities I can try that I

1529
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,440
I do what I like and talk to as many people as possible

1530
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,680
as much as I can find out about the culture

1531
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,240
I can know that I know and then brother it's okay

1532
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,839
Just going with the flow when you know everything

1533
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,280
If it goes away then I will become God

1534
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,880
I am doing what I enjoy

1535
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,480

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,040
Galapagos Is Darwin's Address in Galapagos

1543
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,359
is Darwin Charles Darwin who

1544
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,680
Evolution was written in the Galapagos where

1545
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,680
He had figured out that evolution

1546
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,079
How does it work and where is Galapagos this

1547
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,480
Islands off the coast of Ecuador Yes

1548
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:32,160
should I tell you the spelling of Galapagos ok ok

1549
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,079
okay there the animals are there

1550
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,119
They are so isolated that their size is very

1551
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,440
You have grown up and you are such big turtles

1552
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,440
you can swim with me apparently brother

1553
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,960
I go to SD, I have a friend there

1554
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,640
He would take me to a place in Ceylon

1555
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,240
Is. We have to wear body suits etc. We

1556
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,720
We go swimming with seals etc. there.

1557
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,839
Yes. What is the joy of life? I tell you

1558
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,440
not can. What is his name Lahoya Ingo?

1559
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:56,079
There we went swimming with seals.

1560
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,480
I will do it and come back. And you grew up in the Galapagos

1561
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,200
Look, open this.

1562
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,880
Things like this happen. So the Galapagos

1563
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,200
There's this vibe. In Argentina

1564
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,520
Patagonia is done. Hawaii can go along.

1565
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,119
Hawaii Hawaii I really wanted to explore.

1566
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,160
I didn't even explore Japan.

1567
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:15,119
Yes it is longer than Japan, just yes it is longer than Japan

1568
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,040
Or from the US or the Pacific countries,

1569
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,599
It moves because I know my mind

1570
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,520
Look, open this one down below, the one from Ecuador

1571
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,559
How far is Galapo from silent Ecuador?

1572
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:27,920
yes yes it's a long way to get here

1573
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:31,040
I have work, I am most active in these two-three places

1574
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,280
Likely I will spend about 5-6 months at the end of this year

1575
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,200
I'll be staying in South America, which means I'm in Colombia

1576
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,040
I'll go back to Venezuela from there

1577
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,359
This is my tentative plan, something fixed

1578
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,200
If not, then whenever you come at the end of this year

1579
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,200
So I can make a plan for you

1580
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Ecuador and the things you have to do with it

1581
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,640
Maybe they will do something together, this will be a part

1582
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,319
I know you will have to make a plan

1583
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,240
Don't you believe in traveling alone, brother?

1584
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,000
no it's not like that I mean look at this this this this

1585
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,760
Take out the totois etc. who is this totois?

1586
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,640
Brother, such big totois live here

1587
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,920
You will enjoy seeing animals that the world has never seen

1588
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,640
See there is a nice Bahamas in Galapas

1589
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,160
I am also in the beach where that pig is with the pig

1590
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,160
you can swim there are lots of pigs

1591
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,440
I don't know which beach is there brother

1592
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,200
this is my friend etc

1593
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,680
You are talking about our drain. yes my

1594
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,000
All my friends are pigs. yes with them

1595
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,839
So take a bath anytime. He is not the same as

1596
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,240
Would take bath. Who is stopping them? between

1597
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,760
Doing pigs. Brother brother such cute pigs

1598
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,280
Are. I don't have any friends. I do not swim

1599
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,640
had come. You were talking to me about pigs

1600
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,960
Did not swim together. The Europeans are speaking.

1601
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,520
I went crazy. Tell me, I am with you.

1602
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,960
My friends aren't that cute. But how many

1603
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,960
There are cute pigs. mom swear so cute

1604
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,240
I won't give you pigs, brother. We even have pigs

1605
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,079
stay dirty

1606
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,240
Are. I get a lot of thrill doing all this

1607
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,240
Is. Now as the wedding is getting closer

1608
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,920
A little like you travel now.

1609
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,240
That's why I kept asking you. Your

1610
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,160
Attitude to travel has changed because one of them

1611
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,880
you have a female and you have to know

1612
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,880
Protect her. So now my travel range is

1613
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,760
It is happening that now money is being spent.

1614
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,079
Now I have to live in a good place. pack the bag first

1615
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,720
I roamed around in the same pyjama and the same kurta

1616
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,920
For. Earlier this scene used to happen. I

1617
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,079
When I reached Pondicherry, I and Pacheri

1618
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,079
My friend from the cast was polite with me too

1619
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,680
brother he is a polite and nice guy

1620
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,280
You will hear from him also, he will say such things

1621
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,040
Because we have a common history, me and

1622
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,520
If we are humble childhood friends then we are very

1623
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:18,960
we have traveled together it's good my

1624
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:21,839
The shoes were stolen and the slippers were broken

1625
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,319
I will first walk barefoot through Auroville for the whole day

1626
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,640
nice and polite and i'll give you a scooty

1627
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,559
Somehow we found it, then it was ours

1628
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,240
I went out barefooted with my scooter brother

1629
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:34,960
Burning feet on leather

1630
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,720
Meaning travelling alone is now a luxury

1631
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,040
Traveling, I do all this now a little more

1632
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,520
Forget about luxury, we don't even learn about discomfort

1633
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,200
You can obviously not sleep on the footpath

1634
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,280
Obviously there is someone to take care of you

1635
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,040
But it's not like I'm just alone

1636
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
I travel only with my boy friends

1637
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,480
I've pretty much had the same experience as I was in Africa

1638
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,720
In West Africa I have a Belgian

1639
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,880
I found this guy, his father's name was French

1640
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,640
He used to say that he spoke all European languages

1641
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,319
So she and I spent a lot of time together

1642
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,160
When I travel it happens many times that I

1643
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:03,040
I do it with someone for some period.

1644
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,760
20 days a month a week alone from let's

1645
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,160
Generally I can go on like this with someone for 20 days

1646
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,680
Is. I recently spoke to Vinamra

1647
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,520
Was. I haven't read any book till now

1648
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,359
In my life. Didn't read any book. School

1649
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,680
If I had not studied, I would have cheated

1650
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,520
Was. There is no point in reading it later.

1651
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,119
So I politely asked you, brother are you my

1652
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,119
I have to start reading. Some?

1653
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
Recommend from books. you sent it to me

1654
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,079
I have kept a good list. Although I have

1655
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,079
Haven't bought it yet. Great Person to Ask

1656
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,760
That. The more the humble the humble reads and

1657
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,880
Very few people read with as much passion as he does

1658
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,119
Are. Yes.

1659
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,200
His brain is next level in that sense

1660
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,520
So you can take reading recommendations from him.

1661
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,040
yes. He had sent a good list. Polite and

1662
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,680
My travel stories are such that

1663
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,440
Vinamr can ever tell me on camera.

1664
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,319
I mean I'm telling you this point blank.

1665
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,440
I tell you that she and I have traveled a lot together

1666
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,839
In. And those things are such that thank God we

1667
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,760
People were not on the internet then. and brother means

1668
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,359
Now I have people around me, wherever I am sitting

1669
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,160
He told me come on tell me your stories

1670
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,000
I travelled. Now one of mine they gave me one

1671
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,000
I have seen image personality on the internet. My

1672
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,760
has to be maintained. I tell them those things

1673
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,160
I can't even describe what I've seen

1674
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,000
If you have talked on the internet then I will talk to you from afar

1675
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,640
Even if a friend comes to him alone,

1676
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,640
can not speak

1677
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,760
like nothing at all

1678
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:20,640
Brother, why did you laugh, he was going to say

1679
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,760
I caught her you were back

1680
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,960
You know it happened like this

1681
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,599
As if you had entered his mind through his embrace

1682
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,920
The thing has been snatched back from him

1683
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,880
Guys you guys go and write in the comments Himanshu

1684
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,440
You have lost your job. First of all Himanshu's

1685
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,079
I lost my job. What did you need to do

1686
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,680
To laugh? Understand when you need to restrain

1687
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,760
Restrain.

1688
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,640
Oh brother, you asked this in the right way

1689
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,440
In my neck. Yes

1690
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,119
Brother, here comes the art of conversation brother. This way

1691
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,920
We are the best podcasters in the country

1692
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,680
Buddy. You have taken it lightly brother.

1693
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,200
Brother, first you insulted my laughter.

1694
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,000
Then his laughter spoiled the work.

1695
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,160
Himanshu, don't take pressure. I am doing it.

1696
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,480
I am creating your character on camera.

1697
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,400
Now if you sit here then it will be yours. AC

1698
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,960
Turn it on and sit.

1699
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,200
So brother, those are the stories of my eight brothers.

1700
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,160
It is limited to them only. so he doesn't go out

1701
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,680
I could never go away. I understand. This talk

1702
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,839
I understand brother. I absolutely say this

1703
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,680
You mean these are things you would never do

1704
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,440
You can on camera. The real joy of traveling

1705
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,119
no ok and what is the second thing? Married

1706
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,799
Man cannot do these things like that.

1707
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,119
A married man should keep his tongue

1708
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:30,559
You may have to rotate it a little bit. How

1709
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:34,000
Should I tell you where I was stuck? How can I tell you with what face?

1710
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,319
how do i meet the eyes of the man i am a man

1711
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,359
's morality changes when suhaag

1712
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,039
Someone's marital bliss becomes its morality

1713
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:43,839
Now I am not wearing the ring, but the ring

1714
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,440
here you can imagine brother now you are back

1715
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,920
I feel you will go for a walk right now

1716
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,920
It is like yesterday, this tomorrow is never the way

1717
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,440
I mean, it's Delhi, my bag is packed, I'm coming

1718
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,720
I just keep that bag in the cupboard like that

1719
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,319
The day I am leaving I woke up just like that

1720
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,400
that travel bag is separate so I took it out

1721
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,799
When you come back, don't come here after visiting

1722
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,880
We'll talk again, decompress

1723
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,400
We will do it, we will talk. is it on camera or

1724
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,240
Without? No, look at what isn't coming on camera.

1725
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,640
Well, a lot of things get cut anyway.

1726
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,920
When you talk openly in India

1727
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,280
You can talk openly, we should not post openly.

1728
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,280
Why am I right or not?

1729
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,760
Exactly brother. live your life freely then

1730
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,599
We will see it later. Yes. but overall my

1731
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,280
I think I had a lot of fun. Today

1732
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,880
So we probably just scratched the surface

1733
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,160
have done it. We could have talked about so much. Yes

1734
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,079
It's too much brother. too much. As

1735
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,240
At first I thought we were talking today

1736
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,559
you were expecting me to ask that

1737
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,000
Brother what crazy story do you have then?

1738
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,559
Slowly I realized this, this is the thing

1739
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,559
Whatever he does, we will do it, then you should also do the same

1740
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,319
I did not talk, today I probably would not have spoken

1741
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,920
I was prepared not to talk to him.

1742
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,760
I have to keep a very family version of myself

1743
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,440
but i am sure that is what is

1744
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,760
expected of you in podcast also that

1745
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,280
Tell me something, then tell me what happened, crazy?

1746
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,880
So we had fun, we sat and had fun brother

1747
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,039
Absolutely and there was more two way conversation

1748
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,400
It was fun, same thing happened with Humility too

1749
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,400
People are abusing him in the comments

1750
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,160
Is. Now let Paramveer bark. why do you say

1751
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,160
This is happening in the middle but it's not fun

1752
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,520
Brother. Once upon a time, from our side, our audience

1753
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,200
Appeal to him that he is a good man. As such

1754
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,119
Not there.

1755
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:08,000
bro it's ok it's not that bad

1756
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:10,000
Was. It's over, time has passed brother. 2 hours

1757
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,359
The man from is sitting here. her phone four times

1758
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,599
It's already time. He hasn't picked it up. Saying

1759
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,599
Hey, the work is done. She gave me tea, brother, and

1760
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,760
So I did not give anything. I gave him water. Later

1761
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,760
Look at the #shbrownies out there. Ash brownie is kept.

1762
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,440
The job was not over. No brother I

1763
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,520
I did not ask for anything. I enjoyed it brother Prakhar

1764
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,200
just as I thought after talking to

1765
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,960
He is a fun guy brother, just as I thought initially

1766
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,480
It is not like that, he laughs, he laughs himself too

1767
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,640
Brother, this thing made me genuinely laugh

1768
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,039
I was coming, he is a funny guy brother, I enjoyed it

1769
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,480
We will meet again after doing a podcast

1770
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,920
I also started my own podcast channel.

1771
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,240
I did it, anyway, I'm not going to advertise it.

1772
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,839
I want to, I haven't put anything in it yet, meaning

1773
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,200
Back then what I used to do was my course

1774
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,880
I used to promote the course every

1775
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,839
There is no latest update on the podcast yet

1776
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,000
I didn't do anything like that, but I thought

1777
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:52,640
I would like to tell you one thing please

1778
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,880
tell me na, meaning 10 years ago you

1779
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,760
did you say something while sitting with friends

1780
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,520
That thing disappeared. don't you remember him

1781
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,680
and you know the matter between those three people

1782
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,520
She spoke in front of two people. the internet's best

1783
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,680
This is the biggest quality and the biggest drawback. One

1784
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,359
Whatever discussion will happen on this, it will not be deleted

1785
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,039
It could be possible. somebody has it

1786
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:12,079
The downloaded video will remain. Somewhere he

1787
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:14,559
will remain. So neither its nor we are not gravity

1788
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,599
understand how big the platform is and

1789
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,280
very heavy words or anything that you

1790
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,119
who thinks you'll ever regret it

1791
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,720
Obviously our personality changes

1792
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,400
during the course of our life some things

1793
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,119
What you believed before, you no longer believe in

1794
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:31,119
I agree and that is totally fine but still

1795
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:33,760
I feel like it's not a big deal

1796
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,760
that once the thing is gone it will be delivered

1797
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,680
you won't take back your words

1798
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,280
so then I thought friend I

1799
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,960
Now I will do less podcasts etc. I

1800
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,640
I want to talk on any topic on my own channel.

1801
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,799
Have to do it. Any travel destination in my mind

1802
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,799
A thought came to my mind related to some culture,

1803
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,799
Whatever you are talking about related to a city,

1804
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,799
have been. Exactly these are the things if I

1805
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:52,559
If I feel like doing it, I will do it alone or

1806
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:54,640
I will arrange for a traveler friend to sit. Our

1807
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,720
I will ask a friend to sit. he went to some country

1808
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,039
Wherever we go, we talk about that country. Ambulatory

1809
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,119
because then I will have the freedom to

1810
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:03,359
Can I post on that? as you

1811
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,119
Said. Say anything, do anything, but

1812
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,799
Keep posting it. You have control over it

1813
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,400
Needed I would like to give an addition to this

1814
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:10,720
Am. I feel quite genuinely about this

1815
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,799
I do it. I think so, the audience

1816
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,480
At the end of the day it's 28. I am 29 years old

1817
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:16,319
I am of the same. Ok? at the end of the day the

1818
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,079
Average Age for Successful Content Creators

1819
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:21,280
In this country is 27 27. you are 27 years old

1820
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,559
You can. It might be older than that.

1821
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,119
They might be smaller. As much as you can understand

1822
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:28,640
He is as stupid as you are. Hmm. Now our

1823
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:30,799
There is both a blessing and a curse in the hand

1824
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,559
that if we talk then there are 1 million such men

1825
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,920
He just listens to it. and this is its disadvantage too

1826
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,680
that if we do something wrong then it will be 1

1827
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,200
The millionaire man listens. now what is wrong

1828
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,039
Its definition can be your own. My

1829
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,359
It could be mine. I understand. But

1830
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,920
If you don't give us freedom it's a mistake

1831
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:46,640
To do. We talk for four hours every week

1832
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,720
I do it. My colleagues work 8 hours a week

1833
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,880
Let's talk about it. if we don't make a mistake

1834
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,640
If we could, we would be discouraged. To you

1835
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,559
I get angry at some time or the other. no one

1836
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,160
I get angry due to some reason. you society

1837
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,319
There's x thing going on in me. You're doing that X thing

1838
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,079
You add to it. An influencer said in 2015

1839
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,079
I had said one thing and in his life his

1840
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,000
Come into his life and give him bamboo in his inbox

1841
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,960
You start it. Then that demotivated feeling

1842
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,960
Will he do it or not? And what I mean to say is this

1843
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,400
It could be the same thing, it could be any leader of yours

1844
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,160
may have said it, some TV anchor may have said it,

1845
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,480
Some local student leader might have said this. But he

1846
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,279
He said it privately. We have

1847
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,799
There are disproportionate losses. Because we have that

1848
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,239
Talking in a fun way in some context

1849
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,799
I had said it. How can you cross that out on Twitter?

1850
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:27,120
You can drive it too. And I'm talking.

1851
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,880
You may believe it or not. you your children

1852
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,159
Our mine doesn't have anyone else like me

1853
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,640
will look at the man. You guys can do anything.

1854
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,679
The Hardware of Content Consumption Has Changed

1855
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,759
And now we are the new thing. And I this

1856
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,480
I am not saying it like that. I tell him in this sense

1857
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:45,600
That if we are the new thing then

1858
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:48,159
Help us do better. And it may not be

1859
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,239
Always come from scolding us. we have a

1860
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:52,080
Dispropionate loss. we are always ourselves

1861
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:54,159
Censoring. we are never sure what we will

1862
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,480
Say and what it will be taken as a letter. donation

1863
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,759
We never have free conversations. i you

1864
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,679
I am telling you how many people I sit with

1865
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,359
Am. Paramveer Bhai, the first half hour here is mine

1866
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,239
it takes time to lift a stone from a man's chest

1867
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,080
Is. hum hum hum so that it becomes lighter. They

1868
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,600
Let's relax. hey i will edit it

1869
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,440
Friend, don't take tension, speak openly.

1870
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,040
Because the man was carrying so much heaviness

1871
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,319
is all about Twitter comments and YouTube

1872
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,920
Of the comments. You can also like your favorite creator

1873
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,359
Give yourself a chance to make mistakes. and if there is any

1874
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,880
He is pointing his finger forcefully. you come to him

1875
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,839
Tell me in front of me brother what happened? mistake then

1876
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,440
Was. It happens to even the best of people. that's it

1877
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,799
So their track isn't red

1878
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,600
Who is 70 years old. because at that time

1879
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,520
There was no social media. it's ours and when you

1880
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,159
can you largely assert that Prakhar's

1881
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:36,239
Or is Paramveer's intent your country's own?

1882
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:37,839
If it is audience service then it is capable of this much

1883
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,839
There is no need to be about these things

1884
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,759
I don't need to be so uncomfortable

1885
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,080
There's something so punishing about these things

1886
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,159
oriented and antagonism oriented

1887
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,319
I don't need you friend, I genuinely do

1888
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:51,279
I am telling you I sense it in front of me

1889
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:56,640
50 men sit per month hmm just

1890
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:59,120
relax it's ok hum hum it's ok so tense

1891
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,960
about how the public will respond to that

1892
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,880
Not a good position I think look at the science

1893
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,600
and technology is a cutting edge field

1894
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,920
That is the hard power of the world, that is weaponry

1895
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,080
Those are aircrafts, those are vehicles.

1896
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,640
Highways are science and technology for which

1897
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,280
You study IT and the whole country becomes one

1898
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,360
Soft power is Shahrukh Khan and Aamir Khan

1899
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,440
Bollywood

1900
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,679
Content Tanmay Bhatt Ranveer Alabadia

1901
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,480
Rajmani Prakhar Gupta this is soft power

1902
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,080
Brother, this one speaks to the world for you.

1903
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,920
Let us do the licensing for you. Your

1904
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,800
your interest, your anger, your needs

1905
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,679
presenting it to the world

1906
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,440
Are. The value of this soft power is understood

1907
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:41,320
when something happens like right now

1908
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:44,800
Used to be. You and I are young boys,

1909
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,960
Buddy. The Oldest YouTuber, Conventional

1910
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,880
The outcome is probably 35. we are young boys

1911
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,480
I am doing it, friend. We don't have it, no

1912
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,320
We have the scope to correct our mistakes,

1913
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,600
Nor do we have any scope for making mistakes. Then

1914
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,440
So we will definitely exert dominance. you give me two friends

1915
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,120
If you give them a chance of 5 years, everyone would make their own mistakes

1916
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,239
He learns by doing. you have to be offended

1917
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,800
Get offended. Public enemy number one

1918
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,480
You take it as soon as you get it. then that man stayed for 6 months

1919
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,480
Recovering from your psychological trauma

1920
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,320
It comes in. 8 months of his financial

1921
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,040
Traumas are recovered. says after 12 months

1922
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,320
To hell with it, England moves.

1923
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,159
Why is Virat Kohli in England?

1924
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,280
This is mob mentality. he took a photo of someone

1925
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,159
I liked it. The raita was spread. Mud Mud

1926
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,400
became.

1927
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,000
come on cry friend you should build a better one

1928
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,440
Relationship with your media people now

1929
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,840
especially in the age where nothing can be

1930
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:35,840
Forgotten on the Internet Because We Want to

1931
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,600
serve you but we don't want to hate you

1932
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,120
don't want to be afraid of you that's not a

1933
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,280
It is a good position to be in, we have that 50

1934
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,280
The man doesn't have a legal team, right? Jo Jo News

1935
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,719
Does she live near the channels or Star TV?

1936
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,800
She lives nearby. We don't have it. we are alone

1937
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,880
yes friend. We also have to make money. How

1938
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,880
We also have to make it. then spend it

1939
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,960
We have it too. We also have to drive these people to their homes

1940
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,640
Are. We have to see their future also today

1941
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,560
Is he 21 or 28, how many will be there by then

1942
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,719
He must be earning. We don't have it friend

1943
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,800
A legal team of 50 people who came and fought again and again

1944
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,320
on behalf of us

1945
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,679
Pay. Many have I am sure Paramveer Bhai

1946
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,880
You may not even know about the legal system

1947
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,760
How it works. I am from a legal family

1948
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:13,040
Am. I know how it works. We

1949
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,199
Can't fight this battle. Now this is the future.

1950
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,719
This guerilla content creation, this rebellious

1951
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:19,440
Single man content creation, the whole world

1952
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:21,360
This man has turned you around, friend. this future

1953
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,360
yes, whether you believe it or not, build a better

1954
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,640
Relationship with us, we want to serve you.

1955
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,400
what am I saying, am I saying something

1956
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,400
Wrong? I don't think so. I think I have

1957
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,000
Said a very natural thing. I am not

1958
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,840
Trying to escape your punishment. I am

1959
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,640
trying to build a relationship between you

1960
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,040
And I. I don't know that works. Brother, this

1961
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,199
Do you share knowledge after every podcast?

1962
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,199
Sometimes it will be taken out brother but now people will say

1963
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,800
Paramveer was laughing loudly as if he would say

1964
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,640
Paramveer was saying yes yes but friend, it was very

1965
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,080
This guy has articulated well

1966
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,679
I didn't even write the whole thing down

1967
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,600
I didn't even tell you this in writing, I didn't even know

1968
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,560
If yes, then it is natural, my friend, you have written it down

1969
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,239
So no no friend she said it very nicely friend means

1970
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,760
I liked it brother it's good right I am three

1971
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,280
After a month I myself came on camera

1972
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,360
I was not even able to talk to him properly but

1973
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,719
Brother, to me this seemed motivating

1974
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,239
I was wondering how he was talking

1975
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,159
How well and flawlessly he is talking

1976
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:07,920
How eloquently he is saying everything

1977
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,840
My love likes this thing. Meaning

1978
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,840
When people talk with so much confidence

1979
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,239
So this is what I think is today's takeaway.

1980
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,320
This was it. how to talk like a strong brother

1981
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,159
I need it more confidently. This for me

1982
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,520
That's how open-heartedly a man can live

1983
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,280
Brother. Hum Hum I think you have an exceptional life

1984
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,679
Live in style. I am not very serious today

1985
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,440
Wanted to be. that bro then i mean family members

1986
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,760
Do you miss the types or not? I didn’t

1987
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,480
Want to do that with you, you know. i want to

1988
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,320
Have fun. Just

1989
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,640
Connect. but bro i think your life style

1990
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,040
is acquire. I think people will die to be

1991
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,719
You are in some way moving the whole world,

1992
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,640
making money, having fun

1993
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:46,480
Is. I don't know brother, it's the same thing. If You

1994
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,719
Start having fun every single day is fun

1995
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,159
Not fun anymore. But I still believe

1996
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,800
Every morning I think I'm living a dream

1997
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,400
Am. What a life this is. Any single complaint

1998
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,760
It is not there brother. truly live the dream life

1999
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,400
I have been. It's a great life. but man

2000
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,080
Prakhar I am very impressed. the manner in which

2001
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,719
you talk to me through the camera right

2002
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:05,199
Seriously there is one take away for me. Thanks

2003
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,199
Brother. this has been an absolute pleasure i hope

2004
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,719
we talk more bro means i know that you are a little

2005
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,159
You're a Little Bit About Podcasts

2006
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,400
like this but i am sure you realise this

2007
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:14,159
It's not like any other podcast, it was fun brother
